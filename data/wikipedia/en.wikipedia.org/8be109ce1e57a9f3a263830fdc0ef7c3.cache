the organization is known as an active recruiting tool for the republican party and has produced many prominent republican and conservative activists and introduced more party members to the republican party than any other organization in the nation2 the organizational structure of the college republicans has changed significantly since its founding in 1892 founded as an organization for the republican national committee the college republicans now operate as an independent 527 group after the young republican national federation was spun off from the college republicans organization in 1972 the groups operate independent of one another contents 1 history 11 founding and early history 12 modern history 2 governance 21 college republican national committee 22 state federations 23

as the college and university what is inculcated here penetrates every corner of the country where the college man goes he goes everywhere and where he goes he is a mighty force in making and molding public sentiment william mckinley at the founding of the american republican college league in 18922 the college republicans were founded as the american republican college league on may 17 1892 at the university of michigan2 the organization was spearheaded by law student james francis burke who would later serve as a congressman from pennsylvania2 the inaugural meeting was attended by over 1000 students from across the country from stanford university in the west to harvard university in the east contemporary politicians also attended the meeting including judge john m thurston senator russell a alger congressman j sloat fassett congressman w e mason john m langston and abraham lincolns successor in the illinois state legislature a j lester thengovernor of ohio william mckinley gave a rousing keynote speech2 the college republicans quickly pursued a strategy of sending college students to vote in their home districts and registering others to vote where they schooled to swing closely contested districts2 this strategy was successfully implemented for the 1900 presidential election between william mckinley and william jennings bryan helping win bryans home state of nebraska for mckinley2 james francis burke 1901 the college republicans were financed at least in part by the republican national committee throughout much of its history james francis burke received significant funding from the rnc to support the american republican college leagues founding and to maintain the organizations early offices in new york city and chicago2 by 1924 the organization was operating directly under the auspices of the rnc as the associated university republican clubs2 the relative dominance of the democratic party through the 1930s through the 1960s coincided with a precipitous drop in the membership and effectiveness of the college republicans2 in 1931 the college republicans were absorbed as an arm of the hoover campaign3 for the next several years the organization operated alternately under the auspices of the republican national league young republican national committee and the division of young republican activities3 in 1935 the college republicans were merged into the newly created young republican national federation encompassing both college students and young professionals3 college republican operations continued under the young republicans until the 1965 founding of the college republican national committee3 modern historyedit in 1967 morton blackwell then a field representative for the crnc to kentucky developed many of the principles now used by the college republicans as the college organizer supporting louie nunns campaign for governor of kentucky blackwell organized approximately 5000 college student volunteers who dropped 93000 pieces of literature posted 20000 flyers mailed 15000 handaddressed and signed postcards to friends of known student supporters of nunn and processed over 8000 absentee ballots2 on election day nunn became the first republican governor of kentucky in 20 years the new york times and louie nunn himself credited the efforts of blackwells volunteers in 1970 the young republican national federation was permanently spun off from the college republicans in 1970 to prevent counterproductive infighting among the two groups2 in 1972 the republican national committee made the college republican national committee an auxiliary arm of the rnc2 in 1973 karl rove ran for chair of the college republicans he challenged the frontrunners delegates throwing the national convention into disarray after which both he and his opponent robert edgeworth claimed victory the dispute was resolved when rove was selected through the direct order of the chairman of the republican national committee who at the time was george h w bush4 college republicans are a vital force in conservative politics you are the vanguard of the republican party i know that the strength of young peoples support for our party will ensure the continued success of republican goals as you begin to assume leadership roles in the party and in our nation ronald reagan to the college republican national committee june 2 19872 by 1980 only 20 active college republican chapters remained by the us presidential election in 1980 that number had increased to 1000 active clubs helping reagan win 98 of 105 mock elections and recruiting thousands of voters this success led to 290000 in financial assistance from the rnc mainly to implement jack abramoffs field representative program2 abramoffs fundraising efforts brought in an additional 1160000 during the next two years by 1983 only 10 of the crncs budget came from the rnc2 prompted by the 2002 bipartisan campaign reform act the crnc officially left the control of the rnc by reconstituting as a 527 group allowing it to operate independently and raise unlimited amount of money for issueadvocacy work as a 527 group the organization is prohibited from coordinating directly with a particular campaign and its recent focus has turned towards developing volunteers and other support activities rather than outright campaigning the shift has allowed the crnc to vastly expand its fundraising efforts during its first two years the crnc raised 173 million most going to pay fundraising costs and other administrative costs while leaving more than 2 million to expand the field representative program and to improve pay for the fulltime positions5 the crnc was criticized for its relationship with response dynamics a virginiabased direct mail company 6 the relationship became an issue during the 2005 election for national chairman which was won by former crnc treasurer paul gourley whose signature was on the questionable fundraising letters7 morgan wilkins a crnc field representative for election 2006 was placed on probation by the crnc after suggesting several controversial events might be held on the university of michigan – ann arbor campus to that schools student newspaper the michigan daily the events included catch an illegal immigrant day and fun with guns day where students were to shoot cardboard cutouts of prominent democrats8 this incident ultimately became a major news story on several national media outlets910 several sources including the michigan daily incorrectly identified ms wilkins as an employee of the republican national committee rather than the crnc eliciting an outcry from democratic national committee chairman howard dean11 in return gop chairman ken mehlman condemned wilkins activities as well as governor dean12 keith olbermann named wilkins his worst person in the world13 she was suspended for the incident and later fired by the crnc for later creating a facebook group in which she promised to make out with individuals who signed up volunteers for get out the vote efforts14 in 2013 alexandra smith became the first elected female national chair of the college
