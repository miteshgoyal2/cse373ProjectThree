siblings in las vegas the vegas shows had initially begun in april without rebbie due to a sprained ankle rebbies debut was postponed until june her five brothers were the main draws with rebbie randy janet and la toya serving as fillers for the performances11 when the jackson 5 parted with their record label motown in 1976 they signed to cbs records and rebranded themselves as the jacksons12 additionally the brothers were signed to cbstv to star with their family in a variety series called the jacksons the shows premiered in june 1976 and featured all of the siblings excluding jermaine who had chosen to stay with motown the initial series run of the 30minute programs was four weeks due to ratings success more episodes were ordered in january 1977 the shows marked the first time that an africanamerican family had ever starred in a television series the run of programs concluded shortly afterward13 prior to the series jackson had thought of her singing as merely a private hobby the jacksons – as well as an early love of musicals—motivated her to become a professional recording artist and the shows producer encouraged her to sing1415 jackson served as a backing vocalist for several musicians around this time as well as a cabaret singer she contributed her voice for songs by artists such as the emotions sonny bono and betty wright before jacksons second pregnancy stalled
