from april 2009 to april 2016 this represented about 39 of all federally insured reverse mortgage foreclosures during that time crc estimated that financial freedom only serviced about 17 of the

california and new york wanted to stop being friends43 after trump won the election he announced that mnuchin would join the transition team on november 1144 political views in a november 30 2016 interview on cnbc mnuchin called it the trump administrations job to make sure that the average american has wage increases and good jobs furthermore he said his priority was getting a sustained

system when asked about trade he said he believed in trade deals with individual countries as opposed to regional trade deals mnuchin said this president is going to have open communication with business leaders when asked about keeping jobs from being offshored to mexico45 during the interview he also said he wants to strip back parts of dodd–frank because he argued it was too complicated

boards of ucla health system the newyork–presbyterian hospital and the los angeles police foundation11 the new york times noted that mnuchins selection fits uneasily with much of mr trump’s campaign attacks on the financial industry for example an ad of trumps campaign said goldman sachs ceo had robbed the working class mnuchin is the third goldman alumnus to serve in the job after hank paulson under president george w bush and robert rubin under president bill clinton in the 2000s and 1990s respectively25 during his senate confirmation hearing on january 19 2017 mnuchin was criticized by democrats for onewests foreclose practices mnuchin said since i was first nominated to serve as treasury secretary i have been maligned as taking advantage of others hardships in order to earn a buck nothing could be further from the truth49 during the hearing it was also noted that mnuchin had failed to disclose 95 million of real estate that he owned and his role as director of dune capital international an investment fund in a tax haven mnuchin described the omissions as mistakes made amid a mountain of bureaucracy50 following trumps january 2017 announcement about an investigation into voter registration it was discovered that mnuchin is registered to vote in both california and new york51 on february 13 2017 mnuchin was confirmed as secretary of the treasury by a vote of 53–4752 tenure artificial intelligence mnuchin when asked in an interview with mike allen of axios whether he was worried about ai displacing jobs replied not at alli think we are so far away from that — 50 or 100 years — it’s not even on my radar screen former treasury secretary lawrence summers was among critics of the statement likening it to climate denial and creationism53 fortune columnist alan murray noting the dispute said he thought the core of the misunderstanding is the term artificial intelligence while he felt mnuchin expressed understanding of the role of technology in the labor market and also worried that the secretary and president donald trump were both in their ways underestimating technologys impact he thought the climatedenial charge was excessive54 federal budget and benefits on june 12 mnuchin denied the debt ceiling not being raised before the august recess would cease federal government operations and said congress should weigh the option of changing the timing so that the debt ceiling matches the budget process so we don’t have to deal with this in this format during a house appropriations subcommittee hearing55 on june 14 during a prepared testimony ahead of the house subcommittee on state foreign operations and related programs mnuchin said the budget proposal on the part of the trump administration should send a message that the international financial institutions need to operate more efficiently56 on july 13 in response to limited lifespans being reported of social security and medicaid mnuchin said to help make these programs sustainable into the future we should focus on strengthening the economy today compounding growth will help ease projected shortfalls57 income tax mnuchin is a member of the big six a group of politicians convened to write a tax reform proposal that incorporated input from members of the house of representatives senate and white house in addition to mnuchin the group consists of senators orrin hatch rut and mitch mcconnell rky representatives kevin brady rtx and paul ryan rwi and national economic council director gary cohn58 shortly after the november 2016 election mnuchin as the planned nominee for secretary of the treasury stated in an interview with cnbc that any reductions we have in upperincome taxes will be offset by less deductions so that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class59 which senator ron wyden dor subsequently called the mnuchin rule during his senate confirmation hearing60 brad mcmillan chief investment officer for commonwealth financial network said a preliminary tax reform proposal by trump in april 2017 allocates much of the tax relief to the wealthy and could increase the budget deficit60 in a may 2017 event moderated by cnbc mnuchin stated the intent was to deliver a middleincome tax cut but that final results depended on the actions of congress61 mnuchin appeared with white house director of legislative affairs marc short in a july 2017 event when they vowed to have the tax reform proposal before congress after it resumed operations on september 5 and mnuchin added that lowering the top earners rate would be offset by elimination of huge deductions so for most people in the top rate theyre not going to get a tax cut62 mnuchin walked back the mnuchin rule in a september 2017 interview with cnn prior to the release of the proposed tax reforms saying the no absolute tax cut for the upper class phrase was never a promise never a pledge it was what the presidents objective was under the tax reform proposal the top tax rate would decline from 396 to 35 percent and the budget deficit would likely increase63 during an appearance at the milken institute global conference on may 1 mnuchin said the white house and house republicans were united in views on tax reductions were all on the same page on 80 of the details were in agreement another 20 we need to work through64 during a conference in ottawa on june 9 mnuchin said government tax receipts were coming in somewhat lower but that this did not concern the administration65 while appearing on abc news on july 9 mnuchin confirmed the administration was not considering a tax increase on the american upper class and the upcoming tax plan would finance itself66 international relations at a march 18 2017 meeting of g20 country finance ministers mnuchin supported the trump administrations trade policy of economic protectionism6768 during an april 24 2017 white house briefing mnuchin announced department of treasury sanctions against the syrian scientific studies and research center he said the sanctions were designed to create accountability for the bashar alassad regime and its supporters in the wake of their violations of both un security council resolutions and the chemical weapons convention69 on june 29 mnuchin announced the bank of dandong a chinese bank had sanctions imposed on it by the us he charged the bank with acting as a gateway for north korea to access the us and international financial systems70 support for donald trump while briefing reporters on april 26 mnuchin said president trump has no intention to release his tax returns asserting the latter has released plenty of information71 following president donald trumps handling of the august 2017 unite the right rally several hundred of mnuchins yale classmates drafted a letter urging him to resign from the administration in protest72 mnuchin responded by saying while i find it hard to believe i should have to defend myself on this or the president i feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way shape or form believes that neonazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways73 on september 24 mnuchin appeared on this week and state of the union to defend trumps call to get that son of a bitch off the field right now referring to the protests by professional athletes starting in 2016 most notably marked by colin kaepernick sitting during the pregame singing of the national anthem mnuchin said its not about race its not about free speech they can do free speech on their own time this is about respect for the military and first responders in the country74 comments on lego batman movie at the end of march 2017 regarding a statement he had made urging parents to send all your kids to lego batman during an interview with axios apparently endorsing the lego batman movie75 mnuchin acknowledged in a letter to walter shaub at the office of government ethics oge that he should not have made that statement and assured the oge that it was not my intention to make a product endorsement76 divestment from prior businesses in may 2017 it was reported that mnuchins fiancée louise linton had succeeded him as the interim ceo of dune entertainment effective february 2017 mnuchin had stepped down from the role as part of his ethics agreement to divest his business roles in preparation for his appointment as secretary of the treasury7778 lintons announcement of her role at dune entertainment drew the attention of senator ron wyden doregon a member of the senate finance committee who questioned whether the appointment of linton meant mnuchin had fully divested from the company although the department of the treasury replied that she was serving in an uncompensated capacity linton resigned as interim ceo later in may79 use of government aircraft gulfstream aerospace c37a gulfstream v photographed in 2005 following criticism of his use of a united states air force jet on a trip to kentucky that involved viewing the solar eclipse the treasury departments office of the inspector general oig opened up an inquiry into mnuchins use of government aircraft80 the watchdog group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington crew filed a freedom of information act foia request regarding mnuchins use of government aircraft after the government failed to respond to the foia request crew sued the department of the treasury to release the documents81 mnuchin denied the trip was related to viewing the solar eclipse saying people in kentucky took the solar eclipse very seriously being a new yorker i dont have any interest in watching the eclipse82 mnuchin who was accompanied by his wife louise linton on the trip reimbursed the government for lintons travel to kentucky which amounted to 595 out of a total cost of 269008384 during the oigs investigation into mnuchins use of government aircraft it was revealed that mnuchin had requested a military jet for his honeymoon travel to europe in june 2017 mnuchin stated that as a member of the united states national security council he needed access to secure communications during his honeymoon but withdrew his request for the military jet after an alternative was identified85 mnuchin stated im very sensitive to the use of government funds ive never asked the government to pay for my personal travel the story regarding the honeymoon travel request was quite misreported82 the oig investigation also showed mnuchin had taken a usaf c37a the military designation of the gulfstream v to return from new york to washington on august 15 after flying to new york commercially although the request for travel on the military jet was initiated by mnuchins office the aircraft had previously been used to fly transportation secretary elaine chao from joint base andrews to teterboro airport mnuchins return flight lasted less than an hour and had an operating cost of at least 2500086 the oig released its report on october 4 2017 concluding that there was no violation of law in these requests and uses of government aircraft by mnuchin but also expressing concern regarding a disconnect between the standard of proof called for in the daley memo and the actual amount of proof provided by treasury and accepted by the white house in justifying these trip requests87 the referenced daley memo was issued by thenwhite house chief of staff william m daley on april 4 2011 and it stated the standards for use of government aircraft by senior executive branch officials were given in omb circular a126 dated february 10 1993 the daley memo also states that travel using military aircraft must be considered a white house support mission taken at the specific direction of the president under one of a set of limited circumstances that make commercial transportation unacceptable87 the typical reimbursement paid by requesting federal executive agencies only covers the cost of an equivalent coach ticket on a commercial flight86 in the report the oig reviewed nine travel requests by mnuchin for military air transportation since march 2017 of which seven were approved and taken one was withdrawn and one was approved with travel pending in late october 201787 the total cost of the seven trips taken was 811800 calculated from perhour cost and operating hours for the specific aircraft or air forceprovided direct costs of operations two of the flights taken to europe in march and may 2017 each cost more than 300000 on one flight to ottawa in june mnuchin was accompanied by his thenfiancée linton the total cost of the ottawa trip was 16350 and the reimbursement repaid for lintons cost of travel was 7448488 due to an inconsistency in the records provided for the trip to new york on august 15 the oig opened a second inquiry in october 2017 to assure that the oig have in fact received all relevant records89 personal life mnuchins mother was a longtime investor with bernie madoff after his mother died in early 2005 mnuchin and his brother liquidated her investments making 32 million a madoff trustee sued to retrieve the money from the mnuchins but a
