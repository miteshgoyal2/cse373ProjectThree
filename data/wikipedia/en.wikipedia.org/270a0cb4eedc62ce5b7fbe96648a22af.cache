satellite imagery from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the first images from space were taken on the suborbital v2 rocket flight launched by the us on october 24 1946 satellite imagery are images of earth or other planets collected by imaging satellites operated by governments and businesses around the world satellite imaging companies sell images by licensing them to governments and businesses such as apple maps and google maps contents 1 history 2 uses 3 resolution and data 4 imaging satellites 41 geoeye 42 digitalglobe 43 spot image 44 aster 45 blackbridge 46 imagesat international 47 meteosat 5 disadvantages 6 see also 7 references 8 external links historyedit the satellite images were made from pixels the first crude image taken by the satellite explorer 6 shows a sunlit area of the central pacific ocean and its cloud cover the photo was taken when the satellite was about 17000 mi 27000 km above the surface of the earth on august 14 1959 at the time the satellite was crossing mexico the first images from space were taken on suborbital flights the uslaunched v2 flight on october 24 1946 took one image every 15 seconds with an apogee of 65 miles 105 km these photos were from five times higher than the previous record the 137 miles 22 km by the explorer ii balloon mission in 19351 the first satellite orbital photographs of earth were made on august 14 1959 by the us explorer 623 the first satellite photographs of the moon might have been made on october 6 1959 by the soviet satellite luna 3 on a mission to photograph the far side of the moon the blue marble photograph was taken from space in 1972 and has become very popular in the media and among the public also in 1972 the united states started the landsat program the largest program for acquisition of imagery of earth from space landsat data continuity mission the most recent landsat satellite was launched on 11 february 2013 in 1977 the first real time satellite imagery was acquired by the united statess kh11 satellite system the first television image of earth from space transmitted by the tiros1 weather satellite in 1960 all satellite images produced by nasa are published by nasa earth observatory and are freely available to the public several other countries have satellite imaging programs and a collaborative european effort launched the ers and envisat satellites carrying various sensors there are also private companies that provide commercial satellite imagery in the early 21st century satellite imagery became widely available when affordable easy to use software with access to satellite imagery databases was offered by several companies and organizations usesedit satellite photography can be used to produce composite images of an entire hemisphere or to map a small area of the earth such as this photo of the countryside of haskell county kansas united states satellite images have many applications in meteorology oceanography fishing agriculture biodiversity conservation forestry landscape geology cartography regional planning education intelligence and warfare images can be in visible colors and in other spectra there are also elevation maps usually made by radar images interpretation and analysis of satellite imagery is conducted using specialized remote sensing applications resolution and dataedit there are four types of resolution when discussing satellite imagery in remote sensing spatial spectral temporal and radiometric campbell 20024 defines these as follows spatial resolution is defined as the pixel size of an image representing the size of the surface area ie m2 being measured on the ground determined by the sensors instantaneous field of view ifov spectral resolution is defined by the wavelength interval size discrete segment of the electromagnetic spectrum and number of intervals that the sensor is measuring temporal resolution is defined by the amount of time eg days that passes between imagery collection periods for a given surface location radiometric resolution is defined as the ability of an imaging system to record many levels of brightness contrast for example and to the effective bitdepth of the sensor number of grayscale levels and is typically expressed as 8bit 0255 11bit 02047 12bit 04095 or 16bit 065535 geometric resolution refers to the satellite sensors ability to effectively image a portion of the earths surface in a single pixel and is typically expressed in terms of ground sample distance or gsd gsd is a term containing the overall optical and systemic noise sources and is useful for comparing how well one sensor can see an object on the ground within a single pixel for example the gsd of landsat is 30m which means the smallest unit that maps to a single pixel within an image is 30m x 30m the latest commercial satellite geoeye 1 has a gsd of 041 m this compares to a 03 m resolution obtained by some early military film based reconnaissance satellite such as coronacitation needed the resolution of satellite images varies depending on the instrument used and the altitude of the satellites orbit for example the landsat archive offers repeated imagery at 30 meter resolution for the planet but most of it has not been processed from the raw data landsat 7 has an average return period of 16 days for many smaller areas images with resolution as high as 41 cm can be available5 satellite imagery is sometimes supplemented with aerial photography which has higher resolution but is more expensive per square meter satellite imagery can be combined with vector or raster data in a gis provided that the imagery has been spatially rectified so that it will properly align with other data sets imaging satellitesedit geoeyeedit geoeyes geoeye1 satellite was launched september 6 20086 the geoeye1 satellite has the high resolution imaging system and is able to collect images with a ground resolution of 041 meters 16 inches in the panchromatic or black and white mode it collects multispectral or color imagery at 165meter resolution or about 64 inches digitalglobeedit digitalglobes worldview2 satellite provides high resolution commercial satellite imagery with 046 m spatial resolution panchromatic only7 the 046 meters resolution of worldview2s panchromatic images allows the satellite to distinguish between objects on the ground that are at least 46 cm apart similarly digitalglobes quickbird satellite provides 06 meter resolution at nadir panchromatic images digitalglobes worldview3 satellite provides high resolution commercial satellite imagery with 031 m spatial resolution wviii also carries a short wave infrared sensor and an atmospheric sensor8 spot imageedit spot image of bratislava the 3 spot satellites in orbit spot 2 4 and 5 provide images with a large choice of resolutions – from 25 m to 1 km spot image also distributes multiresolution data from other optical satellites in particular from formosat2 taiwan and kompsat2 south korea and from radar satellites terrasarx ers envisat radarsat spot image will also be the exclusive distributor of data from the forthcoming veryhigh resolution pleiades satellites with a resolution of 050 meter or about 20 inches the first launch is planned for the end of 2011 the company also offers infrastructures for receiving and processing as well as added value options asteredit the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster is an imaging instrument onboard terra the flagship satellite of nasas earth observing system eos launched in december 1999 aster is a cooperative effort between nasa japans ministry of economy trade and industry meti and japan space systems jspacesystems aster data is used to create detailed maps of land surface temperature reflectance and elevation the coordinated system of eos satellites including terra is a major component of nasas science mission directorate and the earth science division the goal of nasa earth science is to develop a scientific understanding of the earth as an integrated system its response to change and to better predict variability and trends in climate weather and natural hazards9 land surface climatology—investigation of land surface parameters surface temperature etc to understand landsurface interaction and energy and moisture fluxes vegetation and ecosystem dynamics—investigations of vegetation and soil distribution and their changes to estimate biological productivity understand landatmosphere interactions and detect ecosystem change volcano monitoring—monitoring of eruptions and precursor events such as gas emissions eruption plumes development of lava lakes eruptive history and eruptive potential hazard monitoring—observation of the extent and effects of wildfires flooding coastal erosion earthquake damage and tsunami damage hydrology—understanding global energy and hydrologic processes and their relationship to global change included is evapotranspiration from plants geology and soils—the detailed composition and geomorphologic mapping of surface soils and bedrocks to study land surface processes and earths history land surface and land cover change—monitoring desertification deforestation and urbanization providing data for conservation managers to monitor protected areas national parks and wilderness areas blackbridgeedit blackbridge previously known as rapideye operates a constellation of five satellites launched in august 200810 the rapideye constellation contains identical multispectral sensors which are equally calibrated therefore an image from one satellite will be equivalent to an image from any of the other four allowing for a large amount of imagery to be collected 4 million km² per day and daily revisit to an area each travel on the same orbital plane at 630 km and deliver images in 5 meter pixel size rapideye satellite imagery is especially suited for agricultural environmental cartographic and disaster management applications the company not only offers their imagery but consults their customers to create services and solutions based on analysis of this imagery imagesat internationaledit earth resource observation satellites better known as “eros” satellites are lightweight low earth orbiting highresolution satellites designed for fast maneuvering between imaging targets in the commercial highresolution satellite market eros is the smallest very high resolution satellite it is very agile and thus enables very high performances the satellites are deployed in a circular sunsynchronous near polar orbit at an altitude of 510 km 40 km eros satellites imagery applications are primarily for intelligence homeland security and national development purposes but also employed in a wide range of civilian applications including mapping border control infrastructure planning agricultural monitoring environmental monitoring disaster response training and simulations etc eros a – a high resolution satellite with 1912m resolution panchromatic was launched on december 5 2000 eros b the second generation of very high resolution satellites with 70 cm resolution panchromatic was launched on april 25 2006 meteosatedit model of a first generation meteosat geostationary satellite the meteosat2 geostationary weather satellite began operationally to supply imagery data on 16 august 1981 eumetsat has operated the meteosats since 1987 the meteosat visible and infrared imager mviri threechannel imager visible infrared and water vapour it operates on the first generation meteosat meteosat7 being still active the 12channel spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri includes similar channels to those used by mviri providing continuity in climate data over three decades meteosat second generation msg the flexible combined imager fci on meteosat third generation mtg will also include similar channels meaning that all three generations will have provided over 60 years of climate data disadvantagesedit because the total area of the land on earth is so large and because resolution is relatively high satellite databases are huge and image processing creating useful images from the raw data is timeconsumingcitation needed depending on the sensor used weather conditions can affect image quality for example it is difficult to obtain images for areas of frequent cloud cover such as mountaintops for such reasons publicly available satellite image datasets are typically processed for visual or scientific commercial use by third parties commercial satellite companies do not place their imagery into the public domain and do not sell their imagery instead one must be licensed to use their imagery thus the ability to legally make derivative products from commercial satellite imagery is minimized privacy concerns have been brought up by some who wish not to have their property shown from above google maps responds to such concerns in their faq with the following statement we understand your privacy concerns the images that google maps displays are no different from what can be seen by anyone who flies over or drives by
