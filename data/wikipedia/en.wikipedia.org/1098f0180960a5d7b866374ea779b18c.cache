influenced the duos singing style5 and shifted their recording style from the style of their roulette records to a more live more energetic gospel callandresponse feel and beat driven soul style the group is known for today sam daves stax records also benefited from the musicians and engineering at stax the stax house band booker t the mgs and the stax horn section the markeys were worldclass musicians who cowrote often without credit and contributed to recordings—the same musicians who recorded with otis redding wilson pickett carla thomas and other soul artists sam daves stax recordings through 1967 were engineered by stax founder jim stewart who created the memphis sound by recording live in a single take stewart is credited for instrumental mixes that allowed for instrumental

they were awesome an article from time in october 1968 reads of all the rb cats nobody steams up a place like sam dave weaving and dancing while singing they gyrate through enough acrobatics to wear out more than 100 costumes per year jerri hershey described in nowhere to run they carried red suits white suits three piece lime green suits all with matching patent boots and coordinated silk hankies woefully inadequate to absorb a soul mans nightly outpourings both sam dave talk a lot about sweat to dave its proof that hes worked for his pay for sam its essential almost mystical he says he cannot work without it unless my body reaches a certain temperature starts to liquefy i just dont feel right without it wayne jackson said sam dave left puddles of sweat onstage by the end of a performance in march 1967 sam dave were coheadliners for the staxvolt revue in europe which included booker t the mgs the markeys eddie floyd carla thomas arthur conley and headliner otis redding it was the duos first trip to europe although redding headlined the tour many agreed sam dave stole the show on many nights according to reddings and sam daves manager phil walden redding refused to be booked on the same bill with sam dave again not wanting to have to follow their explosive act a live version of soothe me from sam daves double dynamite lp was recorded in paris during the 1967 tour released as a single in mid1967 it continued sam daves string of top 20 us rb hits and was their first in the uk top 40 after the tour sam dave worked as headliners in the us and in europe during fall

breakup and reunion 1969–1972edit jerry wexler with coproducer tom dowd tried producing sam dave in new york with atlantic songwriters and musicians it took eight months to issue ooh ooh ooh the first atlantic single in august 1969 it was not a very good record by sams own admission and it represented the first time in four years that a sam dave single failed to chart two more singles followed in 1970 baby baby dont stop now and one part love two parts pain the first was a leftover hayesporter recording from stax the second was produced by wexler and dowd in new york and was written by stax executive al bell and allen jones both failed to chart according to wexler we just made some shitass records with them i never really got into their sensibilities as a producer14 wexler then sent the duo south to muscle shoals and miami to work with producers brad shapiro and dave crawford for their next single knock it out the park which also failed to chart sam dave split in june 1970 according to moore15 as a result of moores dissatisfaction with the duo and his desire to pursue a career solo according to prater they broke up because moore decided to do what he wanted to do on his own moore recorded three solo singles none of which charted for atlantic over the next year and was preparing an album produced by king curtis which was shelved after curtis was stabbed to death in 1971 prater recorded a single for alston neither was commercially successful as a solo act and they reunited in august 1971 in october 1971 their last atlantic single dont pull your love was a cover of a hit by

label after atlantic there was still demand for public performances especially in europe16 they toured turkey in spring 1972 and england in spring 1973 sam dave also continued to be visible in the us performing on tv shows including the midnight special and the mike douglas show according to sam most us shows in the 1970s were small clubs oldies shows and whatever they could get he attributed their poor bookings during this period to rumors of drug use and bad blood between the duo sam dave returned to the studio in 1974 and 1975 recording an album of new songs titled back at cha for united artists the album – their first album of new material in 7 years – was produced by steve cropper and featured the mgs and the memphis horns and had a minor rb single a little bit of good rb 89
