early 2006 in an article for the weekly standard titled the medias ancien régime hewitt outlined his belief that traditional journalism was supplanted by the ease of information exchange on the internet15 there is too much expertise all of it almost instantly available now for the traditional idea of journalism to last much longer in the past almost every bit of information was difficult and expensive to acquire and was therefore mediated by journalists whom readers and viewers were usually in no position to secondguess authority has drained from journalism for a reason too many of its practitioners have been easily exposed as poseurs hewitt at a campaign event for doug ducey for governor of arizona october 2014 a recurring theme on hewitts show is accusing the mainstream media of

make a claim to objectivity while never answering questions about their own beliefs allows a deepseated culture of liberal media bias to be perpetuated he has said that financial reporters are never
