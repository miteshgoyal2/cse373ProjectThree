california as a rallying point for republicans opposed to the briggs initiative which attempted to ban homosexuals from teaching in public schools in addition to sanctioning the termination of openly gay and lesbian teachers the proposed legislation authorized the firing of those teachers that supported homosexuality5 while mounting his imminent presidential campaign ronald reagan publicly expressed his opposition to the discriminatory policy reagans condemnation of the bill—epitomized in a letter sent to a probriggs group excerpts of which were reprinted in the san francisco chronicle in 1978—played an influential role in the eventual defeat of the briggs initiative6 in the midst of this victory gay conservatives in california created the log cabin republicans the group initially proposed to name themselves lincoln club but found that name was already in use by the lincoln club of orange county another california republican organization so the name log cabin republicans was chosen as an alternative title this designation calls attention to the first republican president abraham lincoln the log cabin republicans suggest that lincoln founded the republican party on the philosophies of liberty and equality these principles log cabin argue are consistent with their platform of an inclusive republican party7 1992 presidential electionedit the 1992 log cabin republican convention was held in spring texas a houston exurb the main point of discussion was whether or not lcr would endorse the reelection of president george h w bush the group voted to deny that endorsement because bush did not denounce antigay rhetoric at the 1992 republican national convention8 1996 presidential electionedit in august 1995 the campaign of republican presidential candidate bob dole returned the lcrs 1000 campaign contribution9 the campaign returned the contribution after openly lesbian columnist deb price of the detroit news asked about it after she saw it on a public report from the federal elections commission the campaign sent a written statement to price saying that dole was in 100 disagreement with the agenda of the log cabin republicans10 the finance office of the campaign had solicited the contribution from lcr at the event where it was given dole had personally spoken with lcrs thenexecutive director rich tafel about the group and about aids legislation it was promoting in the senate weeks earlier dole agreed to cosponsor the legislation after a meeting with tafel at the campaigns headquarters11 it resulted in a frontpage story in the new york times penned by richard l berke thenchief political reporter for the daily12 as reporters including berke were seeking confirmation of the story before it broke doles finance chairman john moran asked tafel not to speak to the press and that tafels steadfastness and statesmanship at this moment will be handsomely appreciated in the long run by the campaign tafel refused13 pundits accused dole of being a flipflopper and a hypocrite14 editorials ran in major newspapers including the washington post the new york times the boston globe the atlanta journalconstitution and the times of london condemning doles action joined by radio commentators rush limbaugh and don imus1516 under the pressure dole admitted during an october 1995 press briefing on capitol hill that he regretted the decision to return the check and that his campaign was responsible for it without consulting him17 i think if theyd have consulted me we wouldnt have done that wouldnt have returned it dole said18 dole later told washington post editor and author bob woodward that the lcr episode was a mistake because the decision to return the check gets into bob dole the person its not so much about bob dole the candidate its the person is he tolerant does he tolerate different views tolerate someone with a different lifestyle he added this is basic this is what people ought to know about you are you going to just do this because it sounds good politically19 lcrs leadership met with doles coalitions manager to discuss an endorsement after doles reversal20 among various items tafel demanded there be no gay bashing in the speeches from the podium of the 1996 republican national convention nor any antihomosexual signs on the convention floor he also wanted to see a gay person address the convention and a public request from doles campaign for the lcr nod21 on the closing night of the convention stephen fong thenpresident of the san francisco chapter spoke at the dais as part of a series of speeches from mainstreet americans but was not publicly identified as gay22 nevertheless his presence on the podium for the organization and for the gay and lesbian community was something that would have been unimaginable four years earlier tafel later wrote22 fong was the first openly gay speaker at a republican national convention23 two days later dole spokesperson christina martin told a reporter that the campaign welcomed the endorsement of the log cabin republicans22 lcr voted to endorse dole for president and thenrepublican national committee chairman haley barbour approved the use of the rncs press briefing room for tafel lcrs convention delegates and officers of its national board to announce their decision22 later in the campaign tafel met with doles chief aide sheila burke and the remaining demands lcr made for their endorsement were met in a statement released by lcr and confirmed to reporters by the campaign dole had pledged to maintain an executive order prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal workforce and full funding for aids programs22 2000 presidential electionedit the group endorsed george w bush in 20007 2004 presidential electionedit due to his support of the federal marriage amendment the group declined to endorse the reelection of george w bush in 20048 the proposed amendment would have constitutionally defined marriage as exclusively between one man and one woman24 bushs defense of the fma led the group to vote 22 to 2 against an endorsement of his reelection25 the palm beach county chapter in florida did endorse him resulting in the revocation of their charter26 2008 presidential electionedit in september 2008 lcr voted to endorse the john mccain–sarah palin ticket in the 2008 presidential election lcr president patrick sammon said the most important reason for their support was mccains opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment to ban samesex marriage27 2012 presidential electionedit on 23 october 2012 lcr officially endorsed mitt romney despite mr romneys commitment to a constitutional amendment barring gays and lesbians from marriage nationwide and his objection to the repeal of the dont ask dont tell policy on military service28 in a public statement lcr said it supported romney due to the gravity of the economic and national security issues currently at stake moreover lcr expressed its hope that romney would reconsider his opposition to the employment nondiscrimination act but he did not29 log cabin republican chapters which endorsed donald trump for the 2016 united states presidential election 2016 presidential electionedit on october 22 2016 the board members of lcr voted not to endorse the republican nominee for president donald trump30 in defiance the lcr statewide chapters of colorado georgia and texas along with the lcr countywide chapter of orange county california and the lcr city chapters of houston texas los angeles california miami florida and cleveland ohio voted to endorse donald trump31 in florida at least one report claimed trump was able to cut into the vote margin in heavily democratic broward county florida with the help of the local chapter of log cabin republicans32 however donald trump received only 3137 of the broward county vote less than the republican presidential candidate in 2012 2008 and 2004 nationwide exit polls estimated that trump received the lowest percentage of the lgbt vote by any republican presidential candidate since the metric was first included in presidential polls in 199233 trump received only 14 of the lgbt vote a significant decline from mitt romney who received 22 in 201234 on november 9 2016 the national lcr congratulated donald trump on his victory32 log cabin republicans v united statesedit main article log cabin republicans v united states a lawsuit filed by lcr in federal court challenging the dont ask dont tell dadt policy which excludes homosexuals from openly serving in the u s military went to trial on july 13 2010 presided by judge virginia phillips lcr argued that the policy violates the rights of homosexual military members to free speech due process and open association35 the government argued that dadt was necessary to advance a legitimate governmental interest36 lcr introduced several admissions by president barack obama including that dadt doesnt contribute to our national security weakens our national security and that reversing dadt is essential for our national security rather than address plaintiffs claims or bring evidence to support their own claims of national interest the government relied exclusively on the policys 1993 legislative history37 on september 9 2010 phillips ruled in favor of plaintiffs finding that dadt violates the first and fifth amendments to the united states constitution3839 on september 29 2011 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit vacated the district courts decision ruling that the legislative repeal of dont ask dont tell by president barack obama and the outgoing democratic congressional majority in december 2010 rendered the case moot the dismissal left the lower court ruling without value as precedent40 platformedit lcr acts under the statement we are loyal republicans we believe in limited government strong national defense free markets low taxes personal responsibility and individual liberty log cabin republicans represents an important part of the american family—taxpaying hard working people who proudly believe in this nations greatness we also believe all americans have the right to liberty and equality we believe equality for lgbt americans is in the finest tradition of the republican party we educate our party about why inclusion wins opposing gay

neutral on matters relating to gay and lesbian rights lcr advocates for samesex marriage and tax equity for domestic partner benefits42 the lcr website also contains an equality map giving information on state laws in areas from employment discrimination and relationship recognition to hate crimes protections and antibullying laws43 lcr takes no official position on abortion44 on the issue of national defense log cabin republicans believe in a confident foreign policy and a strong national defense as the worlds sole military superpower it is vital that the united states remain ready and able to shoulder its responsibilities in the global arena while standing as a beacon of freedom log cabin republicans call attention to the cruel and abusive treatment of gays and lesbians worldwide

forum national symposium panel topics included corporate diversity family fairness and is sexual orientation a choice this caused two washington post opinion columnists to observe that the log cabin republicans are looking less and less republican26 in 2012 the log cabin republicans were criticized by advocates of gay rights and marriage equality for endorsing republican candidates who advocated new limitations on the legal rights of gay americans as well as the retention of current discriminatory laws and policies47 some in the lgbt community have expressed dissatisfaction with lcr viewing lcr as a centrist organization and not an organization representing lgbt conservatives in 2009 two former lcr members christopher r barron and jimmy lasalvia formed goproud a now dissolved organization representing lgbt conservatives and libertarians according to lcr president greg angelo preservation of lgbt rights and support for the lgbt community were a hallmark of donald trumps campaign and that he would continue to do that in his presidency48 however that same day the trump administration rescinded obamaera guidance on transgender students rights49 david badash has
