persons life in addition to the federal estate tax many states have enacted similar taxes these taxes may be termed an inheritance tax the tax is often the subject of political debate and opponents of the estate tax call it the death tax1 if an asset is left to a spouse or a federally recognized charity the tax usually does not apply in addition a maximum amount varying year by year can be given by an individual before andor upon their death without incurring federal gift or estate taxes2 5340000 for estates of persons dying in 20143 and 20154 5450000 effectively 1090 million per married couple

tax is imposed on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the united states8 the starting point in the calculation is the gross estate9 certain deductions from the gross estate are allowed to arrive at the taxable estate the gross estateedit the gross estate for federal estate tax purposes often includes more property than that included in the probate estate under the property laws of the state in which the decedent lived at the time of death the gross estate before the modifications may be considered to be the value of all the property interests of the decedent at the time of death to these interests are added the following property interests generally not owned by the decedent at the time of death the value of property to the extent of an interest held by the surviving spouse as a dower or curtesy10 the value of certain items of property in which the decedent had at any time made a transfer during the three years immediately preceding the date of death ie even if the property was no longer owned by the decedent on the date of death other than certain gifts and other than property sold for full value11 the value of certain property transferred by the decedent before death for which the decedent retained a life estate or retained certain powers12 the value of certain property in which the recipient could through ownership have possession or enjoyment only by surviving the decedent13 the value of certain property in which the decedent retained a reversionary interest the value of which exceeded five percent of the value of the property14 the value of certain property transferred by the decedent before death where the transfer was revocable15 the value of certain annuities16 the value of certain jointly owned property such as assets passing by operation of law or survivorship ie joint tenants with rights of survivorship or tenants by the entirety with special rules for assets owned jointly by spouses17 the value of certain powers of appointment18 the amount of proceeds of certain life insurance policies19 the above list of modifications is not comprehensive as noted above life insurance benefits may be included in the gross estate even though the proceeds arguably were not owned by the decedent and were never received by the decedent life insurance proceeds are generally included in the gross estate if the benefits are payable to the estate or if the decedent was the owner of the life insurance policy or had any incidents of ownership over the life insurance policy such as the power to change the beneficiary designation similarly bank accounts or other financial instruments which are payable on death or transfer on death are usually included in the taxable estate even though such assets are not subject to the probate process under state law deductions and the taxable estateedit once the value of the gross estate is determined the law provides for various deductions in part iv of subchapter a of chapter 11 of subtitle b of the internal revenue code in arriving at the value of the taxable estate deductions include but are not limited to funeral expenses administration expenses and claims against the estate20 certain charitable contributions21 certain items of property left to the surviving spouse22 beginning in 2005 inheritance or estate taxes paid to states or the district of columbia23 of these deductions the most important is the deduction for property passing to or in certain kinds of trust for the surviving spouse because it can eliminate any federal estate tax for a married decedent however this unlimited deduction does not apply if the surviving spouse not the decedent is not a us citizen24 a special trust called a qualified domestic trust or qdot must be used to obtain an unlimited marital deduction for otherwise disqualified spouses25 tentative taxedit the tentative tax is based on the tentative tax base which is the sum of the taxable estate and the adjusted taxable gifts ie taxable gifts made after 1976 for decedents dying after december 31 2009 the tentative tax will with exceptions be calculated by applying the following tax rates lower limit upper limit initial taxation further taxation 0 10000 0 18 of the amount 10000 20000 1800 20 of the excess 20000 40000 3800 22 of the excess 40000 60000 8200 24 of the excess 60000 80000 13000 26 of

and job creation act of 2010 hr 4853 pub l no 111312 124 stat 3296 3301 dec 17 2010 as amended by section 101c1 of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 see instructions for form 706 rev august 2013 page 5 internal revenue service us dept of the treasury at pdf the tentative tax is reduced by gift tax that would have been paid on the adjusted taxable gifts based on the rates in effect on the date of death which means that the reduction is not necessarily equal to the gift tax actually paid on those gifts credits against taxedit there are several credits against the tentative tax the most important of which is a unified credit which can be thought of as providing for an exemption equivalent or exempted value with respect to the sum of the taxable estate and the taxable gifts during lifetime for a person dying during 2006 2007 or 2008 the applicable exclusion amount is 2000000 so if the sum of the taxable estate plus the adjusted taxable gifts made during lifetime equals 2000000 or less there is no federal estate tax to pay according to the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 the applicable exclusion increased to 3500000 in 2009 and the estate tax was repealed for estates of decedents dying in 2010 but then the act was to sunset in 2011 and the estate tax was to reappear with an applicable exclusion amount of only 1000000 the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 became law on december 17 2010 the 2010 act changed among other things the rate structure for estates of decedents dying after december 31 2009 subject to certain exceptions it also served to reunify the estate tax credit aka exemption equivalent with the federal gift tax credit aka exemption equivalent the gift tax exemption is equal to 525000026 for estates of decedents dying in 2013 and 5340000 for estates of decedents dying in 201427 the 2010 act also provided portability to the credit allowing a surviving spouse to use that portion of the predeceased spouses credit that was not previously used eg a husband died used 3 million of his credit and filed an estate tax return at his wifes subsequent death she can use her 5 million credit plus the remaining 2 million of her husbands if the estate includes property that was inherited from someone else within the preceding 10 years and there was estate tax paid on that property there may also be a credit for property previously taxed because of these exemptions only the largest 02 of estates in the us will have to pay any estate tax6 before 2005 there was also a credit for nonfederal estate taxes but that credit was phased out by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 portabilityedit the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 authorizes the personal representative of estates of decedents dying on or after january 1 2011 to elect to transfer any unused estate tax exclusion amount to the surviving spouse in a concept known as portability the amount received by the surviving spouse is called the deceased spousal unused exclusion or dsue amount if the personal representative of the decedent’s estate elects transfer or portability of the dsue amount the surviving spouse may apply the dsue amount received from the estate of his or her last deceased spouse against any tax liability arising from subsequent lifetime gifts and transfers at death the portability exemption is claimed by filing form 706 specifically part 6 of the estate tax return whether the personal representative has an obligation to make the portability election is presently unclear requirements for filing return and paying taxedit for estates larger than the current federally exempted amount any estate tax due is paid by the executor other person responsible for administering the estate or the person in possession of the decedents property that person is also responsible for filing a form 706 return with the internal revenue service irs in addition the form must be filed if the decedents spouse wishes to claim any of the decedents remaining estategift tax exemption the return must contain detailed information as to the valuations of the estate assets and the exemptions claimed to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid the deadline for filing the form 706 is 9 months from the date of the decedents death the payment may be extended but not to exceed 12 months but the return must be filed by the 9month deadline exemptions and tax ratesedit year exclusion amount maxtop

taxation by the law below is a table of the amount of exemption by year an estate would expect estates above these amounts would be subject to estate tax but only for the amount above the exemption for example assume an estate of 35 million in 2006 there are two beneficiaries who will each receive equal shares of the estate the maximum allowable credit is 2 million for that year so the taxable value is therefore 15 million since it is 2006 the tax rate on that 15 million is 46 so the total taxes paid would be 690000 each beneficiary will receive 1000000 of untaxed inheritance and 405000 from the taxable portion of their inheritance for a total of 1405000 this means the estate would have paid a taxable rate of 197 as shown the 2001 tax act would have repealed the estate tax for one year 2010 and would then have readjusted it in 2011 to the year 2002 exemption level with a 2001 top rate that is had no further legislation been passed the estate of a person who deceased in the year 2010 would have been entirely exempt from tax while that of a person who deceased in the year 2011 or later would have been taxed as heavily as in 2001 however on december 17 2010 congress passed the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 section 301 of the 2010 act reinstated the federal estate tax the new law set the exemption for us citizens and residents at 5 million per person31 and it provided a top tax rate of 35 percent for the years 2011 and 201232 on january 1 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was passed which permanently establishes an exemption of 5 million as 2011 basis with inflation adjustment per person for us citizens and residents with a maximum tax rate of 40 for the year 2013 and beyond33 the permanence of this regulation is not ensured the fiscal year 2014 budget called for lowering the estate tax exclusion the generationskipping transfer tax and the gifttax exemption back to levels of 2009 as of the year 201834 puerto rico and other us possessionsedit a decedent who is a us citizen born in puerto rico and resident at the time of death in a us possession ie pr is generally treated for federal tax purposes as though he or she were a nonresident who is not a citizen of the united states35 so the 5 million exemption does not apply to such a persons estate for us estate tax purposes a us resident is someone who had a domicile in the united states at the time of death a person acquires a domicile by living in a place for even a brief period of time as long as the person had no intention of moving from that place36 nonresidentsedit the 5 million exemption specified in the acts of 2010 and 2012 cited above applies only to us citizens or residents not to nonresident aliens nonresident aliens have only a 60000 exclusion this amount may be higher if a gift and estate tax treaty applies for estate tax purposes the test is different in determining who is a nonresident alien nra compared to the one for income tax purposes the inquiry centers around the decedents domicile this is a subjective test that looks primarily at intent the test considers factors such as the length of stay in the united states frequency of travel size and cost of home in the united states location of family participation in community activities participation in us business and ownership of assets in the united states and voting a foreigner can be a us resident for income tax purposes but not be domiciled for estate tax purposes an nra is subject to a different estate tax regime than a us taxpayer the estate tax is imposed only on the part of the gross nras estate that at the time of death is situated in the united states these rules may be ameliorated by an estate tax treaty the us does not maintain as many estate tax treaties as income tax treaties but there are estate tax treaties in place with many of the major european countries australia and japan us real estate owned by the nra through a foreign corporation is not included in an nras estate the corporation must have a business purpose and activity lest it be deemed a sham designed to avoid us estate taxes see also gift tax in the united states § nonresidents noncitizen spouseedit the estate tax of a deceased spouse depends on the citizenship of the surviving spouse all property held jointly with a surviving noncitizen spouse is considered to belong entirely to the gross estate of the deceased except for the extent the executor can substantiate the contributions of the noncitizen surviving spouse to the acquisition of the property37 us citizens with a noncitizen spouse do not benefit from the same marital deductions as those with a us citizen spouse furthermore the estate tax exemption is not portable among spouses if one of the spouses is a noncitizen see also gift tax in the united states § noncitizen spouse estate and inheritance taxes at the state leveledit currently fifteen states and the district of columbia have an estate tax and six states have an inheritance tax maryland and new jersey have both38 some states exempt estates at the federal level other states impose tax at lower levels new jersey taxes estates beginning at 67500038 in states that impose an inheritance tax the tax rate depends on the status of the person receiving the property and in some jurisdictions how much they receive39 inheritance taxes are paid not by the estate of the deceased but by the inheritors of the estate for example the kentucky inheritance tax “is a tax on the right to receive property from a decedent’s estate both tax and exemptions are based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the decedent”40 for decedents dying in calendar year 2014 12 states connecticut delaware hawaii illinois maine massachusetts minnesota new york oregon rhode island vermont and washington and the district of columbia impose only estate taxes delaware and hawaii allowed their taxes to expire after congress repealed the credit for state estate taxes but reenacted the taxes in 2010 exemption amounts under the state estate taxes vary ranging from the federal estate tax exemption amount or 534 million indexed for inflation two states to 675000 new jersey the most common amount is 1 million three states and the district of columbia in 2014 four states increased their exemption amounts minnesota phased up to 2 million for 2018 deaths rhode island 15 million for 2015 deaths and maryland and new york both phased their exemptions up to the federal amount for 2019 deaths top rates range from 12 percent to 19 percent with most states like minnesota imposing a top rate of 16 percent five states iowa kentucky nebraska pennsylvania and tennessee impose only inheritance taxes the tennessee tax is scheduled to be eliminated for deaths after december 31 2015 the exemptions under state inheritance taxes vary greatly ranging from 500 kentucky and new jersey for bequests to unrelated individuals to unlimited exemptions iowa and kentucky for bequests to lineal heirs such as children or parents of the decedent no states tax bequests to surviving spouses top tax rates range from 45 percent pennsylvania on lineal heirs to 18 percent nebraska on collateral heirs tennessee’s inheritance tax is calculated more like an estate tax ie the tax does not vary based on the beneficiary two states—new jersey and maryland—impose both types of taxes but the estate tax paid is a credit against the inheritance tax so the total tax liability is not the sum of the two but the greater of the two taxes neither state taxes bequests to lineal heirs41 tax mitigationedit estate tax rates and complexity have driven a vast array of support services to assist clients with a perceived eligibility for the estate tax to develop tax avoidance techniques many insurance companies maintain a network of life insurance agents all providing financial planning services guided towards providing death benefit that covers paying estate taxes brokerage and financial planning firms and charities also use estate planning and estate tax avoidance as a marketing technique many law firms also specialize in estate planning tax avoidance and minimization of estate taxes many techniques recommended by those selling products with high fees do not really avoid the estate tax instead they claim to provide a leveraged way to have liquidity to pay for the tax at the time of death it is very important for those whose primary wealth is in a business they own or real estate or stocks to seek professional legal advice in one technique marketed by commissioned agents an irrevocable life insurance trust is recommended where the parents give their children funds to pay the premiums on life insurance on the parents structured in this way life insurance proceeds can be free of estate tax however if the parents have a very high net worth and the life insurance policy would be inadequate in size due to the limits in premiums a charitable remainder trust crt may be recommended but should be critically reviewed the client however may lose access to the asset placed in the crt proponents of the estate tax and lobbyists for high commission financial products argue the tax should be maintained to encourage this form of charity historyedit taxes which apply to estates or to inheritance in the united states trace back to the 18th century according to the irs a temporary stamp tax in 1797 applied a tax of varying size depending on the size of the bequest ranging from 25 cents for a bequest between 50–100 to 1 dollar for each 500 the tax was repealed in 1802 in the 19th century the revenue act of 1862 and the war revenue act of 1898 also imposed rates but were each repealed shortly thereafter the modern estate tax was enacted in 19164243 the modern estate tax was temporarily phased out and repealed by tax legislation in 2001 this legislation gradually dropped the rates until they were eliminated in 2010 however the law did not make these changes permanent and the estate tax returned in 201144 but late in 2010 before that clause took effect congress passed superseding legislation that imposed a 35 percent tax in 2011 and 2012 on estate in excess of 5 million like the 2001 legislation the 2010 legislation had a sunset clause so that in 2013 the estate tax would return to its 2001 level but then on new years day 2013 congress made permanent an estate tax on estates in excess of 5 million at a rate of 40 percent45 debateedit the estate tax is a recurring source of contentious political debate and political football generally the debate breaks down between a side which opposes any tax on inheritance and another which considers it good policy arguments in supportedit proponents of the estate tax argue that large inheritances currently those over 5 million are a progressive and fair source of government funding removing the estate tax they argue favors only the very wealthy and leaves a greater share of the total tax burden on working taxpayers proponents further argue that campaigns to repeal the tax rely on public confusion about the estate tax and about tax policy more generally4647 william gale and joel slemrod give three reasons for taxing at the point of inheritance in their book rethinking estate and gift taxation first the probate process may reveal information about lifetime economic wellbeing that is difficult to obtain in the course of enforcement of the income tax but is nevertheless relevant to societal notions of who should pay tax second taxes imposed at death may have smaller disincentive effects on lifetime labor supply and saving than taxes that raise the same revenue in present value terms but are imposed during life third if society does wish to tax lifetime transfers among adult households it is difficult to see any time other than death at which to assess the total transfers made while death may be unpleasant to contemplate there are good administrative equity and efficiency reasons to impose taxes at death and the asserted costs appear to be overblown – william gale and joel slemrod in response to the concern that the estate tax interferes with a middleclass familys ability to pass on wealth proponents point out that the estate tax currently affects only estates of considerable size over 5 million and 10 million for couples and provides numerous credits including the unified credit that allow a significant portion of even large estates to escape taxation48 proponents note that abolishing the estate tax will result in tens of billions of dollars being lost annually from the federal budget49 proponents of the estate tax argue that it serves to prevent the perpetuation of wealth free of tax in wealthy families and that it is necessary to a system of progressive taxation50 a driving force behind support for the estate tax is the concept of equal opportunity as a basis for the social contract this viewpoint highlights the association between wealth and power in society – material proprietary personal political social arguments that justify wealth disparities based on individual talents efforts or achievements do not support the same disparities where they result from the dead hand these views are bolstered by the concept that those who enjoy a privileged position in society should have a greater obligation to pay for its costs the strength of political opposition to the estate tax proponents argue would not be found under a veil of ignorance in which policy makers were kept from knowing the wealth of their own families51unreliable source winston churchill argued that estate taxes are a certain corrective against the development of a race of idle rich this issue has been referred to as the carnegie effect for andrew carnegie carnegie once commented the parent who leaves his son enormous wealth generally deadens the talents and energies of the son and tempts him to lead a less useful and less worthy life than he otherwise would’ some research suggests that the more wealth that older people inherit the more likely they are to leave the labor market52 a 2004 report by the congressional budget office found that eliminating the estate tax would reduce charitable giving by 6–12 percent53 chyeching huang and nathaniel frentz of the center on budget and policy priorities assert that repealing the estate tax would not substantially affect private saving and that repeal would increase government deficits thereby reducing the amount of capital available for investment54 in the 2006 documentary the one percent robert reich commented if we continue to reduce the estate tax on the schedule we now have it means that we are going to have the children of the wealthiest people in this country owning more and more of the assets of this country and their children as well its unfair its unjust its absurd proponents of the estate tax tend to object to characterizations that it operates as a double tax they point out many of the earnings subject to estate tax were never taxed because they were unrealized gains48 others describe this point as a red herring given common overlapping of taxes chyeching huang and nathaniel frentz of the center on budget and policy priorities assert that large estates consist to a significant degree of unrealized capital gains that have never been taxed54 supporters of the estate tax argue there is longstanding historical precedent for limiting inheritance and note current generational transfers of wealth are greater than they have been historically in ancient times funeral rites for lords and chieftains involved significant wealth expenditure on sacrifices to religious deities feasting and ceremonies the welltodo were literally buried or burned along with most of their wealth these traditions may have been imposed by religious edict but they served a real purpose which was to prevent accumulation of great disparities of wealth which estate tax proponents suggest tended to avoid destabilizing societies and prevented social imbalance eventual revolution or disruption of functioning economic systems economist jared bernstein has said people call it the paris hilton tax for a reason we live in an economy now where 40 percent of the nations wealth accumulates to the top 1 percent and when these folks leave bequests to their heirs were talking about bequests in the tens of millions55 free market supporters of the tax would argue that people should be able to get to the top of the market through earning wealth based on meritocratic competition not through unearned inherited handouts unearned transfers of wealth work against the free market by creating a disincentive of hard work in the recipients and others in the market56 if the income from estate tax is reduced this would have to be made up broadly through taxes on working people accordingly if estate tax was increased relative to other taxes irwin stelzer argues it could pay for lowering the marginal tax rate faced by all earners reduce taxes on the pay for that extra work and you will get more of it reduce taxes on the profits from risktaking and entrepreneurs will take more chances and create more jobs reduce the taxes on recipients of inheritances on the other hand and they will work less and be less likely to start up new businesses57 unhindered inheritance has another possible influence on some in the market if many of the wealthiest in the country acquired their wealth through inheritance while contributing nothing to the market personally to get there people at the lower end of the market may have equal economic potential as many of those receiving some of this 40 percent of wealth but did not have the luck of being born to wealthy parents the disparity in fair chance of acquiring initial wealth on top of preexisting differences in non fiscal sustenance like differing qualities of education inherited work ethic and valuable connections causes resentment and the perception that hard work is of diminished importance when some due to bad luck will struggle to afford the basics of living even at maximum effort while others may never need to work and even present this lifestyle as idealcitation needed the disparity in initial gifted wealth also means a reduced ability for some to accumulate wealth it is a lot easier to put money aside if you inherited a house and do not have to rent one56 these factors create a system perceived to be rigged against those who are not from wealthy families along with political instability58 reducing estate tax exacerbates this situation while increasing estate tax promotes a fairer free market especially if this excess wealth is used to encourage productivity while also encouraging wealthy parents to focus on providing the best skills and education for their children57 michael j gratz has said indeed thats what the case for the estate tax boils down to basic fairness the tax affects a small number of people who inherit large amounts of wealth—and who can afford to give up a portion of their windfall to help finance their government59 arguments againstedit in arguing against the us federal estate tax the investors business daily has editorialized that people should not be punished because they work hard become successful and want to pass on the fruits of their labor or even their ancestors labor to their children as has been said families shouldnt be required to visit the undertaker and the tax collector on the same day60 as the tax foundation notes because the tax can be avoided with careful estate planning estate taxes are effectively penalties imposed on those who neglect to plan ahead or who retain unskilled estate planners rather than actual taxes61 some free market critics of the estate tax contend that proponents assume the superiority of socialistcollectivist economic models under this view proponents of the tax commonly argue that excess wealth should be taxed without offering a definition of what excess wealth could possibly mean and why it would be undesirable if procured through legal effortscitation needed such statements are seen to exhibit a predilection for collectivist principles that opponents of the estate tax oppose606263 a disparity between rates may encourage wealthy individuals to relocate to avoid or minimize taxation this moves the wealth – and all associated future tax revenue – outside the united states as a result of transferring wealth abroad the estimated tax generation claimed by proponents of the estate tax will likely be far less than that claimed and will likely lower the future tax base within the united statescitation needed however most countries have inheritance tax at similar or higher rates64 the tax foundation has published research suggesting that the estate tax acts as a strong disincentive toward entrepreneurship their 1994 studycitation needed found that the estate tax’s 55 percent rate at the time had roughly the same disincentive effect as doubling an entrepreneur’s top effective marginal income tax rate the estate tax has also been found to impose a large compliance burden on the us economycitation needed similar past economic studies from the same groupcitation needed have estimated the compliance costs of the federal estate tax to be roughly equal to the amount of revenue raised – nearly five times more costly per dollar of revenue than the federal income tax – making it one of the nation’s most inefficient revenue sources61 another argument against the estate tax is that the tax obligation in itself can assume a disproportionate role in planning possibly overshadowing more fundamental decisions about the underlying assets in certain cases this is claimed to create an undue burden for example pending estate taxes could become an artificial disincentive to further investment in an otherwise viable business – increasing the appeal of tax or investmentreducing alternatives such as liquidation downsizing divestiture or retirement this could be especially true when an estates value is about to surpass the exemption equivalent amount older individuals owning farms or small businesses when weighing ongoing investment risks and marginal rates of return in light of tax factors may see less value in maintaining these taxable enterprises they may instead decide to reduce risk and preserve capital by shifting resources liquidating assets and using tax avoidance techniques such as insurance policies gift transfers trusts and tax free investments65 another argument is that the estate tax burdens farmers because agriculture involves the use of many capital assets such as land and equipment to generate the same amount of income that other types of businesses generate with fewer assets individuals partnerships and family corporations own 98 percent of the nation’s 22 million farms and ranches the estate tax may force surviving family members to sell land buildings or equipment to keep their operation going66 the national farmers union advocated relief for farmers by increasing the exemption per estate to 5 million67 americans standing for the simplification of the estate tax advocates relief for farmers and small business owners by eliminating death as a taxable event in what the group describes as a down payment on their estate taxes during their earning years68 along these lines the american solution for simplifying the estate tax act or ‘asset act’ of 2014 hr 5872 was introduced on december 11 2014 to the 113th congress by rep andy harris69 another argument is that the estate tax is detrimental to the public good in an article in washington examiner michael shindler argues that the inheritance of multigenerational wealth allows people especially young people to comfortably pursue callings that despite their vital importance to human flourishing are typically uncompensated by the market and cites lord byron thomas jefferson and ludwig wittgenstein as examples of such individuals similarly shindler also argues that whereas in europe museums theaters symphony halls and other cultural institutions are typically governmentsubsidized here they gain the bulk of their funding from the generosity of philanthropic foundations founded and sustained by the stewards of multigenerational wealthconsequently american culture is less an expression of the whims of bureaucrats and more a manifestation of the will of its citizenry70 the term death taxedit the caption for section 303 of the internal revenue code of 1954 enacted on august 16 1954 refers to estate taxes inheritance taxes legacy taxes and succession taxes imposed because of the death of an individual as death taxes that wording remains in the caption of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended71 the term death tax is also a neologism used by critics to describe the us federal estate tax in a way that conveys a negative connotation on july 1 1862 the us congress enacted a duty or tax with respect to certain legacies or distributive shares arising from personal property passing either by will or intestacy from deceased persons72 the modern us estate tax was enacted on september 8 1916 under section 201 of the revenue act of 1916 section 201 used the term estate tax7374 according to professor michael graetz of columbia law school and professor emeritus at yale law school opponents of the estate tax began calling it the death tax in the 1940s75 the term death tax more directly refers back to the original use of death duties to address the fact that death itself triggers the tax or the transfer of assets on which the tax is assessed many opponents of the estate tax refer to it as the death tax in their public discourse partly because a death must occur before any tax on the deceaseds assets can be realized and also because the tax rate is determined by the value of the deceaseds persons assets rather than the amount each inheritor receives neither the number of inheritors nor the size of each inheritors portion factors into the calculations for rate of the estate tax proponents of the tax say the term death tax is imprecise and that the term has been used since the nineteenth century to refer to all the death duties applied to transfers at death estate inheritance succession and otherwise76 chyeching huang and nathaniel frentz of the center on budget and policy priorities assert that the claim that the estate tax is best characterized as a death tax is a myth and that only the richest 014 of estates owe the tax77 political use of death tax as a synonym for estate tax was encouraged by jack faris of the national federation of independent business78 during the speakership of newt gingrich wellknown republican pollster frank luntz wrote that the term death tax kindled voter resentment in a way that inheritance tax and estate tax do not79 linguist george lakoff a member of spains socialist partys think tank states that the term death tax is a deliberate and carefully calculated neologism used as a propaganda tactic to aid in efforts to repeal estate taxes the use of death tax rather than estate tax in the wording of questions in the 2002 national election survey was correlated with an increased support for estate tax repeal by a few percentage points80 in 2016 presidential candidate donald trump released a health care plan which used the term death penalty in the context of health savings accounts which would pass taxfree to the heirs of an estate81 irs auditsedit in july 2006 the irs confirmed that it planned to cut the jobs of 157 of the agency’s 345 estate tax lawyers plus 17 support personnel by october 1 2006 kevin brown an irs deputy commissioner said that he had ordered the staff cuts because far fewer people were obliged to pay estate taxes than in the past estate tax lawyers are the most productive tax law enforcement personnel at the irs according to brown for each hour they work they find an average of 2200 of taxes that people owe the government48 related taxesedit the federal government also imposes a gift tax assessed in a manner similar to the estate tax one purpose is to prevent a person from avoiding paying estate tax by giving away all his or her assets before death there are two levels of exemption from the gift tax first transfers of up to as of 2013 14000 per recipient person per year are not subject to the tax individuals can make gifts up to this amount to each of as many people as they wish each year in a marriage a couple can pool their individual gift exemptions to make gifts worth up to 28000 per recipient person per year without incurring any gift tax second there is a lifetime credit on total gifts until a combined total of 5250000 not covered by annual exclusions has been given in many instances an estate planning strategy is to give the maximum amount possible to as many people as possible to reduce the size of the estate the effectiveness of which depends on the lifespan of the donor and the number of donees this also gives the donees immediate use of the assets while the donor is alive to see them enjoy it furthermore transfers whether by bequest gift or inheritance in excess of 5 million tied to inflation in the same manner as the estate tax exemption may be subject to a generationskipping transfer tax if certain other criteria are met see alsoedit lyeth v hoey referencesedit meet mr death joshua green may 20 2001
