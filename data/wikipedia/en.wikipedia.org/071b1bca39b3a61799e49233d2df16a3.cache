in the garage of his childhood home on crist drive in los altos california apples first product the apple i invented by apple cofounder steve wozniak was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard monitor and case the owner of this unit added a keyboard and wooden case the apple ii introduced in 1977 was a major technological advancement over its predecessor apple computer company was founded on april 1 1976 by steve jobs steve wozniak and ronald wayne5 the companys first product was the apple i a computer singlehandedly designed and handbuilt by wozniak67 and first shown to the public at the homebrew computer club89 apple i was sold as a motherboard with cpu ram and basic textualvideo chips which was less than what is now considered a complete personal computer10 the apple i went on sale in july 1976 and was marketpriced at 66666 2806 in 2016 dollars adjusted for inflation111213141516 apple computer inc was incorporated on january 3 19771718 without wayne who left and sold his share of the company back to jobs and wozniak for 800 only a couple weeks after cofounding apple1920 multimillionaire mike markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of 250000 during the incorporation of apple2122 during the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially doubling about every four months between september 1977 and september 1980 yearly sales grew from 775000 to 118m an average annual growth rate of 5332324 the apple ii also invented by wozniak was introduced on april 16 1977 at the first west coast computer faire it differed from its major rivals the trs80 and commodore pet because of its character cellbased color graphics and open architecture while early apple ii models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 ¼ inch floppy disk drive and interface called the disk ii25 the apple ii was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer app of the business world visicalc a spreadsheet program visicalc created a business market for the apple ii and gave home users an additional reason to buy an apple ii compatibility with the office26 before visicalc apple had been a distant third place competitor to commodore and tandy2728 by the end of 1970s apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line the company introduced the apple iii in may 1980 in an attempt to compete with ibm and microsoft in the business and corporate computing market29 jobs and several apple employees including jef raskin visited xerox parc in december 1979 to see the xerox alto xerox granted apple engineers three days of access to the parc facilities in return for the option to buy 100000 shares 800000 splitadjusted shares of apple at the preipo price of 10 a share30 jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface gui and development of a gui began for the apple lisa3132 in 1982 however he was pushed from the lisa team due to infighting jobs took over jef raskins lowcostcomputer project the macintosh a race broke out between the lisa team and the macintosh team over which product would ship first lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a gui but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles33 on december 12 1980 apple went public at 22 per share18 generating more capital than any ipo since ford motor company in 1956 and immediately creating 300 millionaires34 1984–91 success with macintosh see also timeline of macintosh models the macintosh released in 1984 was the first massmarket personal computer that featured an integral graphical user interface and mouse in 1984 apple launched the macintosh the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language35 its debut was signified by 1984 a 15 million television commercial directed by ridley scott that aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january 22 198436 the commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for apples success37 and was called a masterpiece by cnn38 and one of the greatest commercials of all time by tv guide3940 the macintosh initially sold well but followup sales were not strong41 due to its high price and limited range of software titles the machines fortunes changed with the introduction of the laserwriter the first postscript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price and pagemaker an early desktop publishing package it has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market42 the macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive macintosh gui in 1985 a power struggle developed between jobs and ceo john sculley who had been hired two years earlier43 the apple board of directors instructed sculley to contain jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products rather than submit to sculleys direction jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple sculley found out that jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which apples board of directors sided with sculley and removed jobs from his managerial duties41 jobs resigned from apple and founded next inc the same year44 wozniak also left apple in 1985 to pursue other ventures stating that the company had been going in the wrong direction for the last five years45 the macintosh portable released in 1989 was apples first batterypowered portable macintosh personal computer after jobs and wozniaks departure the macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points the socalled highright policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a 1000 price for the macintosh which they were unable to meet newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the highright policy was in full force by the mid1980s notably due to jeanlouis gassées mantra of fiftyfive or die referring to the 55 profit margins of the macintosh ii46 this policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on pc clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the macintosh but at far lower price points the company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their highpriced products the christmas season of 1989 was the first in the companys history that saw declining sales and led to a 20 drop in apples stock price47 gassées objections were overruled and he was forced from the company in 1990 later that year apple introduced three lower cost models the macintosh classic macintosh lc and macintosh iisi all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand in 1991 apple introduced the powerbook replacing the luggable macintosh portable with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops the same year apple introduced system 7 a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities it remained the architectural basis for the classic mac os the success of the powerbook and other products brought increasing revenue43 for some time apple was doing incredibly well introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process the magazine macaddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the first golden age of the macintosh48 apple believed the apple ii series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the lowend macintosh49 in the 1990s apple released the macintosh lc and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for macintosh rather than apple ii and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards macintosh and away from apple ii50 the apple iie was discontinued in 199351 1991–97 decline and restructuring see also timeline of the apple ii family the penlite was apples first attempt at a tablet computer created in 1992 the project was designed to bring the mac os to a tablet – but was shelved in favor of the newton52 the success of apples lowercost consumer models especially the lc also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines to address this management introduced several new brands selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets these were the highend quadra the midrange centris line and the illfated performa series this led to significant market confusion as customers did not understand the difference between models53 apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s including digital cameras portable cd audio players speakers video consoles the eworld online service and tv appliances enormous resources were also invested in the problemplagued newton division based on john sculleys unrealistic market forecastscitation needed ultimately none of these products helped and apples market share and stock prices continued to slidecitation needed throughout this period microsoft continued to gain market share with windows by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience54 apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response instead they sued microsoft for using a gui similar to the apple lisa in apple computer inc v microsoft corp55 the lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed at this time a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied apples reputation and sculley was replaced as ceo by michael spindler56 the newton was apples first foray into the pda markets as well as one of the first in the industry despite being a financial flop at the time of its release it helped pave the way for the palmpilot and apples own iphone and ipad in the future by the early 1990s apple was developing alternative platforms to the macintosh such as aux the macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware in addition apple was facing competition from os2 and unix vendors such as sun microsystems the macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware57 in 1994 apple allied with ibm and motorola in the aim alliance with the goal of creating a new computing platform the powerpc reference platform which would use ibm and motorola hardware coupled with apple software the aim alliance hoped that preps performance and apples software would leave the pc far behind and thus counter microsoft the same year apple introduced the power macintosh the first of many apple computers to use motorolas powerpc processor58 in 1996 spindler was replaced by gil amelio as ceo amelio made numerous changes at apple including extensive layoffs and cut costs59 after numerous failed attempts to improve mac os first with the taligent project and later with copland and gershwin amelio chose to purchase next and its nextstep operating system and bring steve jobs back to apple60 1997–2007 return to profitability power mac was a line of apple macintosh workstationclass personal computers based on various models of powerpc

directors after overseeing a threeyear recordlow stock price and crippling financial losses jobs acted as the interim ceo and began restructuring the companys product line it was during this period that he identified the design talent of jonathan ive and the pair worked collaboratively to rebuild apples status62 at the 1997 macworld expo jobs announced that apple would join microsoft to release new versions of microsoft office for the macintosh and that microsoft had made a 150 million investment in nonvoting apple stock63 on november 10 1997 apple introduced the apple online store which was

numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital production software for both professionals and consumers in 1998 apple purchased macromedias key grip software project signaling an expansion into the digital video editing market the sale was an outcome of macromedias decision to solely focus upon web development software the product still unfinished at the time of the sale was renamed final cut pro when it was launched on the retail market in april 19996970 the development of key grip also led to apples release of the consumer videoediting product imovie in october 199971 next apple successfully acquired the german company astarte which had developed dvd authoring technology as well as astartes corresponding products and engineering team in april 2000 astartes digital tool dvdirector was subsequently transformed into the professionaloriented dvd studio pro software product apple then employed the same technology to create idvd for the consumer market71 in 2002 apple purchased nothing real for their advanced digital compositing application shake72 as well as emagic for the music productivity application logic the purchase of emagic made apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company the acquisition was followed by the development of apples consumerlevel garageband application73 the release of iphoto in the same year completed the ilife suite74 mac os x based on nexts openstep and bsd unix was released on march 24 2001 after several years of development aimed at consumers and professionals alike mac os x aimed to combine the stability reliability and security of unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface to aid users in migrating from mac os 9 the new operating system allowed the use of os 9

culture jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple became a fortune 500 company by the time of the 1984 television commercial apples informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors360 according to a 2011 report in fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation361 as the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives it has arguably lost some of its original character nonetheless it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after jobs returned to the company numerous apple employees have stated that projects without jobss involvement often took longer than projects with it362 to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including bill atkinson363 steve capps364 rod holt363 alan kay365366 guy

work in retail though its 2014 sec filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base372 an editorial article in the verge in september 2016 by technology journalist thomas ricker explored some of the publics perceived lack of innovation at apple in recent years specifically stating that samsung has matched and even surpassed apple in terms of smartphone industrial design and citing the belief that apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products he goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole stating yes iteration is boring but its also how apple does business it enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success he acknowledges that people are wishing for the excitement of revolution but argues that people want the comfort that comes with harmony furthermore he writes that a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem specifically mentioning that walkman didnt have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along but how apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the icloud cloud service with features including universal clipboard in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device as well as interconnected device functionality including auto unlock in which an apple watch can unlock a mac in close proximity he argues that apples ecosystem is its greatest innovation373 apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy and has
