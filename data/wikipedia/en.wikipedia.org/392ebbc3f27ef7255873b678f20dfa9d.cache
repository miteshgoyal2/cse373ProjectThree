conservatism portal v t e in the united states there has never been a national political party called the conservative party1 all major american political parties support republicanism and the basic classical liberal ideals on which the country was founded in 1776 emphasizing liberty the pursuit of happiness the rule of law the consent of the governed opposition to aristocracy and fear of corruption coupled with equal rights2 political divisions inside the united states often seemed minor or trivial to europeans where the divide between the left and the right led to violent polarization starting with the french revolution3 historian patrick allitt expresses the difference between liberal and conservative in terms not of policy but of attitude certain continuities can be traced through american history the conservative attitude was one of trusting to the past to longestablished patterns of thought and conduct and of assuming that novelties were more likely to be dangerous than advantageous4 no american party has advocated european ideals of conservatism such as a monarchy an established church or a hereditary aristocracy american conservatism is best characterized as a reaction against utopian ideas of progress5 russell kirk saw the american revolution itself as a conservative reaction in the english political tradition against royal innovation6

1131 tea party 12 references 13 further reading 131 historiography 14 primary sources foundingedit colonial eraedit the conservatism that prevailed in the colonies before 1776 was of a very different character than the conservatism that emerged based on revolutionary principles this old conservatism was founded on a landed elite and urban merchant class that was loyalist during the revolution the largest and richest and most influential of the american colonies was virginia where conservatives were in full control of the colonial and local governments at the local level church of england parishes handled many local affairs and they in turn were controlled not by the minister but rather by a closed circle of rich landowners who comprised the parish vestry ronald l heinemann emphasizes the ideological conservatism of virginia while noting there were also religious dissenters who were gaining strength by the 1760s the tobacco planters and farmers of virginia adhered to the concept of a hierarchical society that they or their ancestors had brought with them from england most held to the general idea of a great chain of being at the top were god and his heavenly host next came kingswho were divinely sanctioned to rule then a hereditary aristocracy who were followed in descending order by wealthy landed gentry small independent farmers tenant farmers servantsaspirations to rise above ones station in life were considered a sin7 in actual practice colonial virginia never had a bishop to represent god nor a hereditary aristocracy with titles like duke or baron however it did have a royal governor appointed by the king as well as a powerful landed gentry the status quo was strongly reinforced by what jefferson called feudal and unnatural distinctions that were vital to the maintenance of aristocracy in virginia he targeted laws such as entail and primogeniture by which the oldest son inherited all the land the entail laws made it perpetual the one who inherited the land could not sell it but had to bequeath it to his oldest son as a result increasingly large plantations worked by white tenant farmers and by black slaves gained in size and wealth and political power in the eastern tidewater tobacco areas maryland and south carolina had similar hierarchical systems as did new york and pennsylvania8 during the revolutionary era all such laws were repealed by the new states9 the most fervent loyalists left for canada or britain or other parts of the empire they introduced primogeniture in upper canada ontario in 1792 and it lasted until 1851 such laws lasted in england until 192610 american revolutionedit the new american conservatism unlike the old was not based on landed estates or loyalty to the crown or the established church and thus differed from european conservatism donald t critchlow and nancy maclean point out its resemblance to european liberalism11 at the time of the american revolution the colonists under british rule lived under the freest government in the european world12 but in their fierce determination to protect and preserve their historic rights the founding fathers sought independence from great britain despite their relatively low level of taxation13141516 however wealthy merchants involved in international trade royal officials and patronage holders typically enjoyed close ties across the british empire many of these men dubbed loyalists or tories opposed the american revolution and remained loyal to the crown throughout the war in a sense the loyalists represented vestiges of european conservatism in the american colonies they tried to preserve the status quo of empire in the face of revolutionary change their leaders were men of wealth and property who loved order respected their betters looked down on their inferiors and feared mobocracy at home more than rule by a distant monarch when it came to a choice between protecting their historic rights as americans or remaining loyal to the king they chose king and empire about 70000 loyalists left the new united states in the wake of the revolutionary war most fled to canada where they are still known as united empire loyalists1718 the patriots who fought in the revolution did so in the name of preserving traditional rights of englishmen—especially the right of no taxation without representation they increasingly opposed attempts by parliament to tax and control the fastgrowing colonies in 1773 when the british imposed heavy sanctions on the massachusetts colony in the wake of the boston tea party self described patriots organized colonybycolony resistance through organizations such as the sons of liberty19 fighting broke out in the spring of 1775 and all thirteen colonies entered into open rebellion against the crown in july 1776 the second continental congress declared independence from the united kingdom and became the de facto national government espousing the principles of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the patriots formed a consensus around the ideas of republicanism whereby popular sovereignty was invested in a national legislature instead of a king in his book labaree 1948 identified the main characteristics of the loyalists that contributed to their conservative opposition to independence loyalists were generally older than patriots better established in society resisted innovation believed resistance to the crown—the legitimate government—was morally wrong and were further alienated from the patriot cause when it resorted to violent means of opposition such as burning houses and tarring and feathering royal officials loyalists wanted to take a middleofthe road position and were angry when forced by the patriots to declare their opposition they had a longstanding sentimental attachment to britain often with business and family ties and were procrastinators who realized that while independence might be inevitable they would rather postpone it for as long as possible many loyalists were also highly cautious and afraid of the potential anarchy or tyranny that could arise out of mob rule finally loyalists were pessimists who lacked the patriots confidence in the future of an independent united states202122 the patriots victory established their revolutionary principles as core american political values adhered to by all parties in the newly formed united states modern american conservatives often identify with the patriots of the 1770s a fact exemplified in 2009 by the tea party movement named after the tea party of 1773 its members often dress in costumes characteristic of the founding fathers the american revolution proved highly disruptive to the old networks of conservative elites in the colonies the departure of so many royal officials rich merchants and landed gentry destroyed the hierarchical networks that previously dominated politics and power in many of the colonies in new york for example the departure of key members of the delancy depester walton and cruger families undercut the interlocking families that largely owned and controlled the hudson valley likewise in pennsylvania the departure of the powerful penn allen chew and shippen families destroyed the cohesion of the old upper class new men became rich merchants but they retained a spirit of republican equality that replaced the old elitism the revolution prevented the rise of a truly powerful upper class in american society one rich patriot in boston noted in 1779 that fellows who would have cleaned my shoes five years ago have amassed fortunes and are riding in chariots23 four out of five loyalists remained in america and were loyal to the new republic for the most part they avoided politics certainly they never tried to form a revanchist movement seeking a return to the empire loyalist samuel seabury for example abandoned politics but became the first episcopalian bishop in the united states rebuilding a church that appealed to families that still admired hierarchy tradition and historic liturgy but had given up their allegiance to the king24 federalistsedit in the wake of the revolution the newly formed federalist party dominated by treasury secretary alexander hamilton used the presidency of george washington to promote a strong nation capable of holding its own in world affairs with a strong army and navy able to suppress internal revolts such as the whiskey rebellion and a national bank to support financial and business interests25 intellectually federalists while devoted to liberty held profoundly conservative views attuned to the american character as samuel eliot morison explained they believed that liberty is inseparable from union that men are essentially unequal that vox populi voice of the people is seldom if ever vox dei the voice of god and that sinister outside influences were busy undermining american integrity26 historian patrick allitt concludes that federalists promoted many conservative positions including the rule of law under the constitution republican government peaceful change through elections judicial supremacy stable national finances credible and active diplomacy and protection of wealth27 the federalists were dominated by businessmen and merchants in the major cities and were supportive of the modernizing urbanizing financial policies of hamilton these policies included the funding of the national debt and also assumption of state debts incurred during the revolutionary war thus allowing the states to lower their own taxes and still pay their debts the incorporation of a national bank of the united states the support of manufactures and industrial development and the use of a tariff to fund the treasury in foreign affairs the federalists opposed the french revolution under john adams they fought the quasi war an undeclared naval war with france in 1798–99 and built a strong army and navy ideologically the controversy between jeffersonian republicans and federalists stemmed from a difference of principle and style in terms of style the federalists distrusted the public thought the elite should be in charge and favored national power over state power republicans distrusted britain bankers merchants and did not want a powerful national government the federalists—notably hamilton were distrustful of the people the french and the republicans28 jeffersonian republicans democraticrepublicansedit in the 1790s jeffersonian democracy arose in opposition to the federalist party primarily as a response to the fear that federalists favoritism toward british monarchism threatened the new republic29 the opposition party chose the name republican party some historians refer to them as jeffersonian republicans while political scientists usually use the democraticrepublican party in order to distinguish them from the modern republican party while jeffersonian democracy persisted as an element of the democratic party into the early 20th century as exemplified by william jennings bryan 1860–1925 and its themes continue to echo in the 21st century3031 jeffersonians opposed the further strengthening federal government and the rise of an interventionist judiciary a concern later shared by conservatives of the 20th century32 the next four presidents were democraticrepublicans whigsedit daniel webster whig leader during the 1800s and 1810s the old republicans not to be confused with the republican party which did not yet exist were led by john randolph of roanoke they refused to form a coalition with the federalists instead they set up a separate opposition led by james madison albert gallatin james monroe john c calhoun33 and henry clay they nevertheless adopted federalist principles by chartering the second bank of the united states promoting internal improvements for transportation raising tariffs to protect factories and promoting a strong army and navy after the failures of the war of 181234 by the 1830s the whig party emerged as the national conservative party whigs supported the national bank private business interests and the modernization of the economy in opposition to jacksonian democracy which represented the interests of poor farmers and the urban working class represented by the newly formed democratic party they chose the name whig because it had been used by patriots in the revolution daniel webster and other whig leaders referred to their new political party as the conservative party and they called for a return to tradition restraint hierarchy and moderation35 in the end the nation synthesized the two positions federalist and whig adopting representative democracy and a strong nation state by the end of the 1820s american politics had generally adapted to a twoparty system whereby rival parties stake their claims before the electorate and the winner takes control of the government as time went on the federalists lost appeal with the average voter and were generally not equal to the tasks of party organization hence they grew steadily weaker after 1816 the federalists had no national influence apart from john marshalls supreme court they retained some local support into the 1820s but important leaders left their fading cause including future presidents john quincy adams and james buchanan and future chief justice roger b taney american civil waredit abraham lincolnedit abraham lincoln was the first president elected by the newly formed republican party and lincoln has been an iconic figure for american politicians of both parties according to historian striner it is vain to try to classify lincoln as a clearcut conservative or liberal as some historians have tried he was both and his politics engendered a longterm tradition of centrism 36 historian david hackett fischer stresses lincolns conservative views in the 1850s lincoln was a prosperous corporate lawyer and a member of the conservative whig party for many years37 he promoted business interests especially banks canals railroads and factories38 before the outbreak of the civil war lincoln explicitly appealed to conservatives in 1859 he explained what he meant by conservatism in terms of fealty to the original intent of the founding fathers the chief and real purpose of the republican party is eminently conservative it proposes nothing save and except to restore this government to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery and there to maintain it looking for no further change in reference to it than that which the original framers of the government themselves expected and looked forward to39 lincoln elaborated his position in his famous cooper union speech before republican elites in new york on february 27 1860 he argued that the founding fathers expected slavery to die a natural death not to spread his point was that the founding fathers were antislavery and the notion that slavery was good was a radical innovation that violated american ideals this speech solidified lincolns base in the republican party and helped assure his nomination40 during the war lincoln was the leader of the moderate republicans who fought the radical republicans on the issues of dealing with slavery and reintegrating the south into the nation he built the stronger coalition holding together conservative and moderate republicans and war democrats against the radicals who wanted to deny him renomination in 18644142 when the war was ending lincoln planned to reintegrate the white south into the union as soon as possible by offering generous peace terms with malice toward none with charity toward all but when lincoln was assassinated the radicals gained the upper hand and imposed much harsher terms than those lincoln had wished43 james randall is one of many who see lincoln as holding 19th century liberal positions while at the same time emphasizing lincolns tolerance and moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform randall concluded that lincoln was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of socalled radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders44 david greenstone argues that lincolns thought was grounded in reform liberalism but notes his unionism and whiggish politics had a deeply conservative side as well45 southern conservatismedit main articles solid south and southern democrats after the civil war conservative came to mean opposition to the radical republicans who wanted to grant full citizenship rights to freed slaves and take political power away from the exconfederates46 conservative white southerners thought that the radical experiments by northern reformers to empower the freed slaves violated the rights of white men and they often accused carpetbaggers who tried to help freed slaves of corruption the racebased conservatism in the american south differed from the businessbased conservatism in the north in its strong support for white supremacy and insistence on a secondclass powerless status for blacks regardless of the constitution47 southern conservatives in the 1950s added anticommunism to their agenda believing that the ideology was behind the civil rights movement and the push for integration48 there was also a liberal element in the south—in support of woodrow wilson and franklin roosevelt—but they rarely opposed jim crow49 from 1877 to 1960 the solid south voted for democratic party candidates in almost all national elections democrats had firm control of state and local government in all southern states by the late 1930s conservative southern democrats in congress joined with most northern republicans in an informal conservative coalition that usually proved decisive in stopping liberal domestic legislation until 1964 with the southern strategy of the republican party in the late 1960s the white southern conservatives shifted their support from the democratic party to the republican party forming a very dominant solid south block of social conservatives in the republican party however the southerners generally were much more internationalist than the mostly isolationist northern republicans in the coalition50 fundamentalism especially on the part of southern baptists was a powerful force in southern conservative politics beginning in the late 1970s however they voted for reagan in 1980 over a fellow southern baptist jimmy carter5152 the gilded ageedit main article gilded age there was little nostalgia and backward looking in the dynamic north and west during the gilded age the period in the us history in the late 19th century from the 1870s to about 1900 business was expanding rapidly with manufacturing mining railroads and banking leading the way there were millions of new farms in the prairie states immigration reached record levels progress was the watchword of the day the wealth of the period is highlighted by american upper class opulence but also by the rise of american philanthropy referred to by andrew carnegie as the gospel of wealth that used private money to endow thousands of colleges hospitals museums academies schools opera houses public libraries symphony orchestras and charities53 conservatives in the 20th century looking back at the gilded age retroactively applied the word conservative to those who supported unrestrained capitalism for example oswald garrison villard writing in 1939 characterized his former mentor horace white 1834–1916 as a great economic conservative had he lived to see the days of the new deal financing he would probably have cried out loud and promptly demised54 in this sense the conservative element of the democratic party was led by the bourbon democrats and their hero president grover cleveland who fought against high tariffs and on behalf of the gold standard in 1896 the bourbons were overthrown inside the democratic party by william jennings bryan and the agrarians who preached free silver and opposition to the power that banks and railroads had over the american farmer the agrarians formed a coalition with the populists and vehemently denounced the politics of big business especially in the decisive 1896 election won by republican william mckinley who was easily reelected over bryan in 1900 as well religious conservatives of this period sponsored a large and flourishing media network especially based on magazines many with close ties to the protestant churches that were rapidly expanding due to the third great awakening catholics had few magazines but opposed agrarianism in politics and established hundreds of schools and colleges to promote their conservative religious and social values55 modern conservatives often point to william graham sumner 1840–1910 a leading public intellectual of the era as one of their own citing his articulate support for free markets antiimperialism and the gold standard and his opposition to what he saw as threats to the middle class from the rich plutocrats above or the agrarians and ignorant masses below5657 the gilded age came to an end with the panic of 1893 and the severe nationwide depression that lasted from 1893 to 1897 1896 – 1932edit 1896 realignmentedit the two parties realigned in the election of 1896 with the conservative republicans led by william mckinley becoming the party of business sound money and assertive foreign policy while the democratic party led by william jennings bryan became the party of the worker the small farmer free silver inflationists populists and in 1900 antiimperialism bryans people took control of the democratic party away from the cleveland democrats also called bourbon democrats at the 1896 convention where 36year old bryan electrified the left by blaming international bankers for crucifying mankind upon a cross of gold pietistic protestants thrilled to bryans intensely religious rhetoric58 the republican strategy for a counter crusade was to join together all conservative forces and brand the crusaders as anarchists dishonest shallowbrained fools and thoroughly dangerous fanaticswhile bryan preached the overthrow of evil men the opposition showed that silver right panaceas would wreck the economy for decades deprived factory workers of their livelihood cheat honest businessmen and install a holy unamerican regime59 the republican countercrusade energized conservative republican farmers and businessmen and attracted previously democratic inclined lutherans and catholics who switched toward mckinley as the sound money conservative choice who rejected radicalism60 socialist epithetedit the term socialist has long been used as an epithet by conservatives that goes far beyond issues of municipal ownership editor william allen white of emporia kansas in his famous 1896 editorial on whats the matter with kansas furiously attacked the radicalism of bryanite democrats and populists supporters of republican conservative william mckinley distributed over a million copies to rally opposition to william jennings bryan nominee of both the democratic and populist parties white according to historian david hinshaw used socialistic as his big gun to blast radical opposition61full citation needed conservative empire buildingedit as the 19th century drew to a close the united states became an imperial power with overseas territories in hawaii the philippines and puerto rico and control over cuba imperialism won out as the election of 1900 ratified mckinleys policies and the us possession of hawaii puerto rico guam the philippines and temporarily cuba theodore roosevelt promoted the military and naval advantages of the us and echoed mckinleys theme that america had a duty to civilize and modernize the heathen6263 bryan made antiimperialism a centerpiece of his 1900 campaign and the democrats continue the antiimperialistic tradition calling for independence for the philippines until they finally won congressional approval in 1916 that promised eventual independence which was achieved in 1946 meanwhile the imperialistic republicans lost interest the supposed business religious and military advantages of having an empire proved illusory by 1908 or so the most ardent conservative imperialists especially william howard taft and elihu root turned their attention to building up an army and navy at home and to building the panama canal64 they dropped the notion of additional expansion and agreed by 1920 that the philippines should become independent6566 progressive eraedit in the early years of the 20th century republican spokesmen for big business in congress included speaker of the house joe cannon and senate republican leader nelson aldrich of rhode island aldrich introduced the sixteenth amendment which allowed the federal government to collect an income tax he also set in motion the design of the federal reserve system which began in 191367 probusiness conservatives supported many progressive era reforms especially those opposed to corruption and inefficiency in government and called for purification of politics conservative senator john sherman sponsored the nations basic antitrust law in 1890 and conservatives generally supported antitrust in the name of opposing monopoly and opening up opportunities for small business68 the efficiency movement attracted many progressive republicans such as nelson w aldrich and later president herbert hoover with its probusiness quasiengineering approach to solve social and economic problems the issues of prohibition and woman suffrage split the conservatives the insurgents were on the left of the republican party led by robert m la follette sr of wisconsin george w norris of nebraska and hiram johnson of california they fought the conservatives in a series of bitter battles that split the gop and allowed the democratic party to take control of congress in 1910 teddy roosevelt a hawk on foreign and military policy moved increasingly to the left on domestic issues regarding courts unions railroads big business labor unions and the welfare state6970 by 1910–11 roosevelt had broken bitterly with taft and the conservative wing of the gop in 1911–12 he took control of the insurgency formed a third party and ran an unsuccessful campaign for president on the progressive party ticket in 1912 his departure left the conservatives led by president william howard taft dominant in the republican party until 193671 the split opened the way in 1912 for democratic woodrow wilson to become president with only 42 of the vote world war iedit the great war broke out in 1914 with wilson proclaiming neutrality former president theodore roosevelt denounced wilsons foreign policy charging had it not been for wilsons pusillanimity the war would have been over by the summer of 1916 indeed roosevelt believed that wilsons approach to foreign policy was fundamentally and objectively evil72 roosevelt abandoned the progressive party and campaigned energetically for republican candidate charles hughes but wilsons policy of neutrality managed to provide him with a narrow victory in the 1916 election the gop under conservative leadership went on to regain congress in 191873 and then the white house in 1920 1920sedit play media republicans returned to dominance in 1920 with the election of president warren g harding who ran a campaign that pledged a return to normalcy tucker 2010 argues that the 1924 election marked the high tide of american conservatism as both major candidates campaigned for limited government reduced taxes and less regulation the opposition was split between progressive party candidate robert la follette who won 17 of the vote and democratic john w davis who took 29 which allowed calvin coolidge to easily win reelection74 under coolidge 1923–29 the economy boomed and society stabilized new policies focused on americanizing immigrants already living in the united states and restricting the influx of new immigrants into the country during 1920s religious fundamentalists like minister william bell riley and william jennings bryan the threetime democratic presidential nominee led the battle against the theory of darwinian evolution they considered it false and blasphemous and helped pass laws to make the teaching of evolution in public schools a state crime the scopes trial of 1925 was a nationally publicized challenge to their efforts which largely discredited the movement75 representative of the 1900–1930 era was james m beck a lawyer under presidents roosevelt harding and coolidge and a congressman from 1927–1933 he espoused conservative principles such as nationalism individualism constitutionalism laissezfaire economics property rights and opposition to reform conservatives like beck saw the need to regulate bad behavior in the corporate world with the intention of protecting corporate capitalism from radical forces but they were alarmed by the antibusiness and prounion proposals of roosevelt after 1905 they began to question the notion of a national authority beneficial to big capital and instead emphasized legalism concern for the constitution and reverence for the american past76 anticommunismedit in the wake of the bolshevik revolution and the subsequent rise of the ussr both major american political parties became strongly anticommunist within the us the far left split and an american communist party emerged in the 1920s77 conservatives denounced communist ideals as a subversion of american values and maintained relentless opposition to communist principles until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 conservatives were especially sensitive to the perception of communist elements trying to change national policies and values in the us government the media and academia conservatives enthusiastically supported anticommunist agencies such as the fbi were chief proponents of the congressional investigations of the 1940s and 1950s particularly those led by richard nixon and joe mccarthy and were wary of excommunists who exposed the system such as whittaker chambers78 writers and intellectualsedit a tension between mainstream academia and conservatism has been a factor for generations richard hofstadter found that opposition to conservatism has been common among intellectuals since about 189079 although conservatism built a presence among intellectuals in the late 19th century historian george nash wrote in 1996 that despite its newfound status and competitiveness intellectual conservatism remains a minority movement especially in the academic community and more broadly amongst the articulate and politically dynamic new class80 there were however conservative intellectuals inside and out of mainstream academia who during early and mid20th century propagated conservative values and shaped the intellectual base of modern conservatism prominent among them were irving babbitt russell kirk henry adams richard m weaver whittaker chambers etc a classic conservative work of the period is democracy and leadership 1924 by irving babbitt numerous literary figures developed a conservative sensibility and warned of threats to western civilization in the 1900–1950 era henry adams t s eliot allen tate andrew lytle donald davidson and others feared that heedless scientific innovation would unleash forces that would undermine traditional western values and lead to the collapse of civilization instead they searched for a rationale for promoting traditional cultural values in the face of their fear of an onslaught by moral nihilism based on historical and scientific relativism81 conservatism as an intellectual movement in the south after 1930 was represented by writers such as flannery oconnor and the southern agrarians the focus was on traditionalism and hierarchy82 numerous former communist or trotskyite writers repudiated the left in the 1930s or 1940s and embraced conservatism becoming contributors to national review in the 1950s they included max eastman 1883–1969 john dos passos 1896–1970 whittaker chambers 1901–1961 will herberg 1901–1977 and james burnham 1905–198783 dozens of small circulation magazines aimed at intellectuals promoted the conservative cause in the 20th century84 newspapersedit major newspapers in metropolitan centers with conservative editorial viewpoints have played an important part in the development of american conservatism in the 1930–1960 era the hearst chain85 and the mccormick family newspapers especially the chicago tribune86 and the los angeles times87 championed most conservative causes as did the henry luce magazines time and fortune88 in recent years those media have lost their conservative edge89 by 1936 most publishers favored republican alf landon over democratic liberal franklin roosevelt in the nations 15 largest cities the newspapers that editorially endorsed landon represented 70 percent of the circulation while roosevelt won 69 of the actual voters in those 15 cities90 roosevelts secret was to open up a new channel of communication to his supporters through radio his fireside chats especially influenced young radio broadcaster ronald reagan who was an enthusiastic new dealer at that time91 newspaper publishers continue to favor conservative republicans92 the wall street journal has continuously been a major voice of conservatism since the 1930s and remains so since its takeover by rupert murdoch in 2007 as editor of the editorial page vermont c royster 1958–1971 and robert l bartley 1972–2000 were especially influential in providing a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis93 new deal eraedit during the 1930s the seeds of modern conservatism was born with the opposition towards the new deal of president franklin d roosevelt conservative mostly midwestern republicans and southern democrats united for the first time and distinct characteristics of modern conservatism began to appear great depressionedit the great depression which followed the 1929 stock market collapse led to price deflation massive unemployment falling farm incomes investment losses bank failures business bankruptcies and reduced government revenues herbert hoovers protectionist economic policies failed to halt the depression and in the 1932 presidential election democratic franklin d roosevelt won a landslide victory liberty league and the old rightedit main articles liberty league and old right united states roosevelts new deal had considerable conservative support at the start but by 1934 the conservatives started uniting in opposition to the president the counterattack first came from conservative democrats led by presidential nominees john w davis 1924 and al smith 1928 who mobilized businessmen into the american liberty league94 opposition to the new deal also came from the old right a group of conservative freemarket antiinterventionists originally associated with midwestern republicans led by hoover and after 1938 by senator robert a taft of ohio expresident hoover moved sharply to the right after 1932 abandoning his earlier progressivism he became a leading opponent of fdr and the new deal hoover became a senior statesman of conservative republicanism until his death in 1964 and made his research center the hoover institution a major think tank for the right9596 the old right accused roosevelt of promoting socialism some noted his upper class status and said he was a traitor to his class97 by 1935 the new deal strongly supported labor unions which grew rapidly in membership and power they became the main target of conservatives98 conservative backlash against rooseveltedit main article judicial procedures reform bill of 1937 buoyed by his landslide win in 1936 which decimated the gop in congress roosevelt in early 1937 astonished the nation by his courtpacking scheme announcing his plan to add six more justices to the nine on the supreme court who had been overturning new deal legislations as unconstitutional vice president john nance garner worked with congressional allies to stop roosevelt many who broke with roosevelt on the court issue had been old progressives such as senator burton k wheeler of montana and chief justice charles evans hughes who played a backstage role99100 roosevelt was defeated in the court initiative and fought back by targeting his enemies in the 1938 democratic primaries the national economy was in a sharp recession and widespread labor strikes were making unions highly controversial roosevelt failed as all but one congressman resisted the purge opposition to roosevelt doubled among southern democratic congressmen101102103 conservative coalition formsedit main article conservative coalition senator josiah bailey dnc released the conservative manifesto in december 1937 which marked the launching of the conservative coalition between republicans and southern democrats104 the republicans made nationwide gains in 1938 the conservative coalition generally controlled congress until 1963 no major legislation passed which the coalition opposed its most prominent leaders were senator robert a taft roh and senator richard russell dga105106 according to james t patterson by and large the congressional conservatives by 1939 agreed in opposing the spread of federal power and bureaucracy in denouncing deficit spending in criticizing industrial labor unions and in excoriating most welfare programs they sought to conserve an america which they believed to have existed before 1933107 foreign policyedit the conservative coalition was not concerned with foreign policy as most of the southern democrats were internationalists a position opposed by most republicans the key republican conservative was senator taft he unsuccessfully sought the republican nomination in 1940 1948 and 1952 and was a staunch isolationist who opposed american membership in nato 1949 and the fight against communism in the korean war 1950 many conservatives especially in the midwest in 1939–41 favored isolationism and opposed american entry into world war ii—and so did some liberals see america first committee conservatives in the east and south were generally interventionist as typified by henry stimson however the japanese attack on pearl harbor in dec 1941 united all americans behind the war effort with conservatives in congress taking the opportunity to close down many new deal agencies such as the bête noire wpa jeffersons imageedit in the new deal era of the 1930s jeffersons memory became contested ground franklin d roosevelt greatly admired jefferson and had the jefferson memorial built to honor his hero even more dramatic however was the reaction of the conservatives as typified by the american liberty league comprising mostly conservative democrats who resembled the bourbon democrats of the 1870–1900 era and the republican party conservative republicans abandoned their hamiltonian views because they led to enlarged national government their opposition to roosevelts new deal was cast in explicitly jeffersonian smallgovernment terms and jefferson became a hero of the right108 1945–51edit the modern conservative political movement combining elements from both traditional conservatism and libertarianism emerged following world war ii but had its immediate political roots in reaction to the new deal those two branches of conservatism allied the post world war i anticommunism thought they defended a system in which the state should have a limited role to play in individual affairs109 their conceptions of conservatism though differing slightly from one another shared an inclination towards the elevation of a universal moral code within society in the early 1950s dr russell kirk defined the boundaries and resting grounds of conservatism in his book the conservative mind dr kirk wrote six truisms110 that became major concepts for conservatism philosophy another important name in the domain of us conservatism is james burnham mr burnham philosopher in training but remembered for his political life unsettled some foundations of conservatism when he fervent opponent of liberalism took position in favor of the conscription111 in another book called rebels all the authors sought to define the main goals of postwar conservatism in the united states they wrote isnt conservatism supposed to be about maintaining standards upholding civility and frowning on rebellion112 in addition looking back at how it has evolved from after world war ii to modern times it seems undeniable that conservatism holds the capacity to defend diverging beliefs such as freemarket libertarianism religious traditionalism while valuing the aggressively suggested by the anticommunist mind113 modern conservatism a highly complex concept finds its roots in the works of postworld war ii thinkers and philosophers whose differing opinions about how to promote similar goals reflect the subjectivity of this political inclination in 1946 conservative republicans took control of congress and opened investigations into communist infiltration of the federal government under roosevelt congressman richard nixon accused alger hiss a senior state department official of being a soviet spy based on the testimony of whittaker chambers an excommunist who became a leading anticommunist and hero to conservatives hiss was convicted of perjury114 president harry truman 1945–53 adopted a containment strategy against joseph stalins communist expansion in europe trumans major policy initiatives were through the truman doctrine 1947 the marshall plan 1948 and nato 1949 trumans cold war policies had the support of most conservatives except for the remaining isolationists the far left comprising communist party members and fellow travelers wanted to continue détente with russia and followed fdrs vice president henry wallace in a quixotic crusade in 1948 that failed to win broad support and indeed largely destroyed the far left in the democratic party115 truman was reelected but his vaunted fair deal went nowhere as the conservative coalition set the domestic agenda in congress the coalition did not play a role in foreign affairs in 1947 the conservative coalition in congress passed the taft–hartley act balancing the rights of management and unions and delegitimizing communist union leaders however the major job of rooting out communists from labor unions and the democratic party was undertaken by liberals such as walter reuther of the autoworkers union116 and ronald reagan of the screen actors guild reagan was a democrat at that time117 one typical midcentury conservative republican in congress was noah m mason 1882–1965 who represented a rural downstate district in illinois from 1937 to 1962 less flamboyant and less well known than his colleague everett mckinley dirksen he ardently supported states rights in order to minimize the federal role for he feared federal regulation of business he distrusted roosevelt and gave many speeches against high federal spending he called out new dealers such as eveline m burns henry a wallace adolph a berle jr and paul a porter as socialists and suggested their policies resembled fascism he fought communism as a member of the house unamerican activities committee 1938–43 and in 1950 he championed joe mccarthys exposes118 in 1950 lionel trilling wrote that conservatives had lost the battle of ideas in the united states at this time liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition for it is the plain fact that nowadays there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in general circulation he likewise wrote but the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse do not with some isolated and some ecclesiastical exceptions express themselves in ideas but only in action or in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas119 korean waredit main article korean war when the communist north korea invaded south korea in 1950 truman adopted a rollback strategy planning to free the entire country by force truman decided not to obtain congressional approval for his war—he relied on un approval—which left the republicans free to attack his war policies taft said trumans decision was a complete usurpation by the president120 trumans reliance on the un reinforced conservative distrust of that body with the allies on the verge of victory the chinese communists entered the war and drove the allies back with terrific fighting in subzero weather truman reversed positions dropped the rollback policy and fired the conservative hero general douglas macarthur who wanted rollback and settled for containment trumans acceptance of the status quo at a cost of 37000 americans killed and undermined trumans base of support truman did poorly in the early 1952 primaries and was forced to drop his reelection bid the democratic party nominated a liberal intellectual with no ties to roosevelt or truman illinois governor adlai stevenson ii mccarthyism 1950–54edit main article mccarthyism a 1947 booklet published by the catholic catechetical guild educational society raising the specter of a communist takeover when anxiety over communism in korea and china reached a fever pitch an otherwise obscure senator joe mccarthy of wisconsin launched extremely highvisibility investigations into the alleged network of communist spies in the government irish catholics including buckley and the kennedy family were intensely anticommunist and supported mccarthy a fellow irish catholic121 paterfamilias joseph kennedy 1888–1969 a leading conservative democrat was an ardent supporter of mccarthy and got his son robert f kennedy a job with mccarthy mccarthys careless tactics however allowed his opponents to effectively counterattack mccarthy talked of twenty years of treason ie since roosevelts election in 1932 in 1953 he started talking of 21 years of treason and launched a major attack on the army for promoting a communist dentist in the medical corps this was too much for eisenhower who encouraged republicans to censure mccarthy formally in 1954 the senators power collapsed overnight senator john f kennedy did not vote for censure122123124125126 arthur herman states mccarthy was always a more important figure to american liberals than to conservatives because he defined the liberal target and made liberals look like innocent victims127 however in recent years conservatives have not so much defended mccarthys rough tactics as argued chiefly based on espionage work done under the venona project that communist spies were really present in the government and some of the left at the time were indeed covering up those communist networks128 1950sedit examining postwar conservative intellectual history kim phillipsfein writes the most influential synthesis of the subject remains george h nashs the conservative intellectual tradition since 1945 he argued that postwar conservatism brought together three powerful and partially contradictory intellectual currents that previously had largely been independent of each other libertarianism traditionalism and anticommunism each particular strain of thought had predecessors earlier in the twentieth and even nineteenth centuries but they were joined in their distinctive postwar formulation through the leadership of william f buckley jr and national review the fusion of these different competing and not easily reconciled schools of thought led to the creation nash argued of a coherent modern right129130 eisenhoweredit as shown by general dwight d eisenhowers defeat of senator robert a taft for the gop nomination in 1952 isolationism had weakened the old right eisenhower then won the 1952 election by crusading against what he called trumans failures korea communism and corruption eisenhower quickly ended the korean war which most conservatives by then opposed and adopted a conservative fiscal policy while cooperating with taft who became the senate majority leader as president eisenhower promoted modern republicanism involving limited government balanced budgets and curbing government spending although taking a firm anticommunist position he and secretary of state john foster dulles didnt push for rollback and continued the truman administrations policy of containment he cut defense spending by shifting the national strategy from reliance on expensive army divisions to cheap nuclear weapons though he made efforts to eliminate expensive supports for farm prices he was ultimately unsuccessful but he met success in reducing the role of the federal government by returning offshore oil reserves to the states eisenhower kept the regulatory and welfare policies of the new deal with the republicans taking credit for the expansion of social security he also sought to minimize conflict among economic and racial groups in the quest for social harmony peace and prosperity he was reelected by a landslide in 1956131132 russell kirkedit while republicans in washington were making small reversals of the new deal the most critical opposition to liberalism came from conservative intellectuals russell kirk 1918–1994 claimed that both classical and modern liberalism placed too much emphasis on economic issues and failed to address mans spiritual nature and called for a plan of action for a conservative political movement he claimed that conservative leaders should appeal to farmers small towns the churches and others following the example of the british conservative party133 kirk adamantly opposed libertarian ideas which he saw as a threat to true conservatism in libertarians the chirping sectaries kirk wrote that the only thing libertarians and conservatives have in common is a detestation of collectivism what else do conservatives and libertarians profess in common the answer to that question is simple nothing nor will they ever have134 william f buckley jr and the national reviewedit william f buckley jr the most effective organizer and proponent of conservative ideas was william f buckley jr 1925–2008 the founder of national review in 1955 and a highly visible writer and media personality though before there had been numerous small rightwing circulation magazines the national review was able to gain national attention and shaped the conservative movement due to strong editing and a strong stable of regular contributors erudite witty and tireless buckley inspired a new enthusiasm for the movement135 behind the scenes the magazine was handled by publisher william a rusher geoffrey kabaservice asserts in many ways it was rusher not buckley who was the founding father of the conservative movement as it currently exists we have rusher not buckley to thank for the populist operationally sophisticated and occasionally extremist elements that characterize the contemporary movement136 buckley and rusher assembled an eclectic group of writers traditionalists catholic intellectuals libertarians and excommunists they included russell kirk james burnham frank meyer willmoore kendall l brent bozell and whittaker chambers in the magazines founding statement buckley wrote137 the launching of a conservative weekly journal of opinion in a country widely assumed to be a bastion of conservatism at first glance looks like a work of supererogation rather like publishing a royalist weekly within the walls of buckingham palace it is not that of course if national review is superfluous it is so for very different reasons it stands athwart history yelling stop at a time when no other is inclined to do so or to have much patience with those who so urge it milton friedman and libertarian economicsedit austrian economist f a hayek 1899–1992 in 1944 galvanized opponents of the new deal by arguing that the left in britain was leading that nation down the road to serfdom138 more influential was the chicago school of economics led by milton friedman 1912–2006 and george j stigler 1911–1991 who advocated neoclassical and monetarist public policy the chicago school provided a vigorous criticism of regulation on the grounds that it led to control of the regulations by the regulated industries themselves since 1974 government regulation of industry and banking has greatly decreased139 the school attacked keynesian economics then the dominant theory of economics which friedman claimed was based on unsound models the stagflation of the 1970s combining high inflation and high unemployment was impossible according to keynesian models140 but was predicted by friedman giving his approach credibility among the experts141 by the late 1960s ebenstein argues friedman was the most prominent conservative public intellectual at least in the united states and probably in the world142 friedman advocated for greater reliance on the marketplace in lectures weekly columns books and on television according to friedman americans should be free to choose he convinced many conservatives that the practice of military drafting was inefficient and unfair consequently nixon ended it in 1973 nine chicago school economists won the nobel prize for economics their views about deregulation and fiscal policy became widely accepted following the crisis in the 1970s however friedmans monetarism did not fare as well with current monetary practice targeting inflation not the money supply143 as an academic economist ben bernanke developed friedmans argument that the banking crises of the early 1930s deepened and prolonged the depression144 as chairman of the federal reserve bernankes energetic reaction to the great financial crisis of 2008 was based in part on friedmans warnings about the feds inactions after 1929145 john birch societyedit robert w welch jr 1900–1985 founded the john birch society as an authoritarian topdown force to combat communism it had tens of thousands of members and distributed books pamphlets and the magazine american opinion it was so tightly controlled by welch that its effectiveness was strictly limited as it mostly focused on calls to impeach chief justice earl warren as well as supporting local police146 it became a major lightning rod for liberal attacks in 1962 buckley won the support of goldwater and other leading conservatives for an attack on welch he denounced welch and the john birch society in national review as far removed from common sense and urged the gop to purge itself of welchs influence147 internal disagreementsedit the main disagreement between kirk who would become described as a traditionalist conservative and the libertarians was whether tradition and virtue or liberty should be their primary concern frank meyer tried to resolve the dispute with fusionism america could not conserve its traditions without economic freedom he also noted that they were united in opposition to big government and made anticommunism the glue that would unite them the term conservative was used to describe the views of national review supporters despite initial protests from the libertarians because the term liberal had become associated with new deal supporters they were also later known as the new right as opposed to the new left 1960sedit south and segregationedit despite the popular perception that conservatism is limited to republicans during the era of segregation before 1965 many southern democrats were also conservative especially about social and racial issues southern democrats were a key part of a conservative coalition that largely blocked liberal labor legislation in congress from 1937 to 1963 though they tended to be liberal and vote with the rest of the democratic party on other economic issues148 southern democrats fended off the more conservative republican party gop by arguing that only they could defend segregation because the republican party nationally was committed to integration that argument collapsed when congress banned segregation in 1964 this provided an opportunity for republicans to appeal to conservative southerners on the basis that the gop was the more conservative party on a wide range of social and economic issues as well as being hawkish on foreign policy when the antiwar forces gained strength in the democratic party southern white conservatives moved from the democratic party to the gop at the presidential level in the 1960s and at the state and local level after 1990149150151 george wallaceedit democrat george wallace the newly elected governor of alabama in january 1963 electrified the white south by crying out for segregation now segregation tomorrow segregation forever he later stood in the schoolhouse door in a failed attempt to stop federal officials from desegregating the university of alabama wallace communicated traditional conservatism in a populist antielitist and earthy language that resonated with rural and working class voters who long had been part of the new deal coalition he was able to exploit anticommunism yearnings for traditional american values and dislike of civil rights agitators antiwar protesters and sexual exhibitionists the wallace movement did help break away a major element of the new deal coalition—less educated powerless low income whites152—which decades later made its way into the gop in the south he helped pave the way for the conservative backlash of the 1970s and 1980s153 however wallace did not receive support from goldwater buckley or any mainstream conservative154 he did get support from the john birch society and the christian anticommunism crusade155 wallaces populist base of poor white farmers echoed earlier racist demagogues such as tom watson of georgia156 as governor of alabama and when his wife was elected to the governorship as her husband wallace combined his reactionary position on civil rights with relatively liberal programs such as support for women157 despite this support for statelevel government welfare wallace did not believe in government intervention in free enterprise and private property he accused liberals of using the federal government to interfere in everybodys private business and as a conservative believed in freedom for business and labor158 goldwater in 1964edit senator barry goldwater conservatives united behind the 1964 presidential campaign of arizona senator barry goldwater 1919–1998 though his campaign was ultimately unsuccessful goldwater published the conscience of a conservative 1960 a bestselling book that explained modern conservative theory goldwater was significantly weakened by his unpopular views regarding social security income tax and the war in vietnam in tennessee he suggested selling the tennessee valley authority which was a favorite for conservatives in its region159 he voted against the civil rights act of 1964 thereby winning the support of southern segregationists support for the campaign came from numerous grassroots activists such as phyllis schlafly and the newly formed young americans for freedom sponsored by buckley to mobilize conservatives buckley himself tried to win the 1965 mayoral election of new york but failed despite goldwaters defeat conservatives were rapidly organizing at the local state and national levels they were most successful in suburban california where they worked hard in 1966 for their new hero ronald reagan 1911–2004 who was elected governor for two terms160161162 1970sedit reagan increasingly dominated the conservative movement especially in his failed 1976 quest for the republican presidential nomination and his successful run in 1980163 religious rightedit further information christian right and fundamentalism by the 1950s many conservatives emphasized the judeochristian roots of their values164 goldwater noted that conservatives believed the communist projection of man as a producing consuming animal to be used and discarded was antithetical to all the judeochristian understandings which are the foundations upon which the republic stands165 ronald reagan frequently emphasized judeochristian values as necessary ingredients in the fight against communism166 belief in the superiority of western judeochristian traditions led conservatives to downplay the aspirations of third world and to denigrate the value of foreign aid167 since the 1990s the term judeochristian has been primarily used by conservatives168 evangelicals had been politicized in the 1920s battling to impose prohibition and to stop the teaching of evolution in the schools as in the scopes trial of 1925 but had largely been politically quiet since the 1930s169 the emergence of the religious right as a political force and part of the conservative coalition dates from the 1970s and was a response to secularization and supreme court rulings on school prayer and abortion according to wilcox and robinson the christian right is an attempt to restore judeochristian values to a country that is in deep moral decline they believe that society suffers from the lack of a firm basis of judeochristian values and they seek to write laws that embody those values170 especially important was the hostile reaction to the roe v wade supreme court decision legalizing abortion which brought together catholics who had long opposed abortion and evangelical protestants who were new to the issue171 noting the anger of catholic bishops at losing state funding because of the catholic opposition to gay adoptive parents along with other social issues the new york times reported in late 2011 that the idea that religious americans are now the victims of governmentbacked persecution is now a frequent theme not just for catholic bishops but also for republican presidential candidates and conservative evangelicals172 neoconservativesedit the 1970s saw the movement of many prominent liberal intellectuals to the right many of them from new york city jewish roots and wellestablished academic reputations173 who had become disillusioned with liberalism irving kristol and leo strauss were founders of the movement the magazines commentary and public interest were their key outlets as well as oped articles for major newspapers and position papers for think tanks activists around democratic senator henry jackson became deeply involved as well prominent spokesmen include gertrude himmelfarb bill kristol paul wolfowitz lewis libby norman podhoretz richard pipes david horowitz charles krauthammer richard perle robert kagan elliott abrams and ben wattenberg meanwhile senator daniel patrick moynihan was highly sympathetic but remained a democrat some of strauss influential neoconservative disciples included supreme court nominee robert bork paul wolfowitz who became deputy secretary of defense alan keyes who became assistant secretary of state william bennett who became secretary of education weekly standard editor william kristol political philosopher allan bloom writer john podhoretz college president john agresto political scientist harry v jaffa and novelist saul bellow neoconservatives generally support probusiness policies some went on to high policymaking or advisory positions in the reagan bush i and bush ii administrations conservatism in the southedit the growth of conservatism within the republican party attracted white conservative southern democrats in presidential elections a few big names switched to the gop including south carolina senator strom thurmond in 1964 and texas governor john connally in 1973 starting in 1968 in the south the gop dominated most presidential elections 1976 was the lone exception but not until the 1990s did the gop become dominant in state and local politics in the region through the southern strategy republicans built their strength among southern baptists and other religious fundamentalists white social conservatives middleclass suburbs migrants from the north and cubans in florida meanwhile starting in 1964 african american voters in the south began to show overwhelming support for the democratic party at both the presidential and local levels they elected a number of congressmen and mayors in 1990 there were still many moderate white democrats holding office in the south but when they retired they were typically replaced by much more conservative republicans or by liberal blacks51 in the 21st century political scientists point to the strong base of social conservatism in the south the evangelical protestants comprising the religious right have since the 1980s strongly influenced the vote in republican primaries for it is primarily in the south where the evangelical core of the gop is strongest174175 think tanks and foundationsedit hoover tower at the hoover institution in 1971 lewis f powell jr urged conservatives to retake command of public discourse through a concerted media outreach campaign in powells view this would involve monitoring national television networks… inducing more publishing by independent scholars who do believe in the free enterprise system publishing in magazines and periodicals—ranging from the popular magazines to the more intellectual ones issuing books paperbacks and pamphlets and dedicating advertising dollars to a sustained major effort to inform and enlighten the american people176 conservative think tanks like the american enterprise institute and the heritage foundation brought in intellectuals for shorter or longer periods financed research and disseminated the products through conferences publications and systematic media campaigns they typically focused on projects with immediate policy implications aware that the brookings institution had played an influential role for decades in promoting liberal ideas the heritage foundation was designed as a counterpart on the right177 meanwhile older conservative think tanks such as the american enterprise institute grew rapidly as a result of major increases in conservative philanthropy both think tanks became more oriented to the news media more aggressively ideological and more focused on rapidresponse production and shorter publications at the same time they generally eschewed longterm research in favor of projects with immediate policy implications and produced synthetic materials rather than longterm research178 in the following decades conservative policies once considered outside the political mainstream—such as abolishing welfare privatizing social security deregulating banking embracing preemptive war and teaching creationism in schools—were taken seriously and sometimes passed into law due in part to the work of the hoover institution the heritage foundation the cato institute the hudson institute the american enterprise institute and various smaller tanks179 complaining that mainstream academia was hostile to conservatives several foundations became especially active in funding conservative policy research notably the adolph coors foundation the bradley foundation the koch family foundations the scaife foundations and until it closed in 2005 the john m olin foundation typically they have emphasized the need for marketbased solutions to national problems180 the foundations often invested in conservative student publications and organizations such as the intercollegiate studies institute and legal foundations such as the federalist society181 policy entrepreneurs such as william baroody edwin feulner and paul weyrich started to entrench conservatism in public research institutions their aim was to rival the liberal regime for the control of the sources of power the appearance of think tanks changed the history of conservatism and left an enormous imprint on the republican right in subsequent years182 nixon ford and carteredit see also nixon and the liberal consensus the republican administrations of president richard nixon 1969–74 and gerald ford 1974–77 were characterized by their emphasis on détente and on economic intervention through wage and price controls ford angered conservatives by continuing henry kissinger as secretary of state and pushing his policy of détente with the soviet union conservatives finally found a new champion in ronald reagan whose 8 years as governor of california had just ended in 1976 and supported his campaign for the republican nomination ford narrowly won renomination but lost the white house following major gains by democratic liberals in the 1974 midterm election jimmy carter was elected as president carter proved too liberal for his fellow southern baptists as they voted for him in 1976 but not 1980 too conservative for the mainstream of the democratic party and many considered his foreign policy a failure carter realized there was a strong national sense of malaise as inflation skyrocketed interest rates soared the economy stagnated and prolonged humiliation resulted when islamic militants in tehran kept american diplomats hostage for 444 days in 1979–81183 1970s recessionsedit see also 1970s recession during the recessions of the 1970s inflation and unemployment rates soared simultaneously and budget deficits began to raise concerns among many americans in the early 1970s america was still a moderately progressive country as citizens supported social programs and voted down efforts to cut taxes but by the end of the decade a fullfledged tax revolt had gotten underway led by the overwhelming passage in 1978 of proposition 13 in california which sharply cut property taxes and the growing congressional support for the kemproth tax bill which proposed cutting federal income taxes by 30 percent184 supplyside economics developed during the 1970s in response to keynesian economic policy and in particular the failure of demand management to stabilize western economies during the stagflation of the 1970s in the wake of the oil crisis in 1973185 it drew on a range of nonkeynesian economic thought particularly the chicago school and neoclassical school186 stopping the equal rights amendmentedit see also women in conservatism in the united states conservative women were mobilized in the 1970s by phyllis schlafly in an effort to stop ratification of the equal rights amendment era to the us constitution the era had seemed a noncontroversial effort to provide legal equality when it easily passed congress in 1972 and quickly was ratified by 28 of the necessary 38 states schlafly denounced it as tilting the playing field against the traditional housewife in a power grab by antifamily feminists on the left she warned it would mean women would be drafted in the army on the same basis as men through her eagle forum she organized statebystate to block further ratification and to have states rescind their ratification congress extended the time needed and a movement among feminists tried to boycott tourist cities in states that had not ratified such as chicago and new orleans it was to no avail the era never became law and schlafly became a major spokesperson for antifeminism in the conservative movement187 1980s reagan eraedit further information reagan era first inaugural address of ronald reagan 1981 audio only conservative ascentedit with ronald reagans victory in 1980 the modern american conservative movement took power republicans took control of the senate for the first time since 1954 and conservative principles dominated reagans economic and foreign policies with supply side economics and strict opposition to soviet communism defining the administrations philosophy reagans ideas were largely espoused and supported by the conservative heritage foundation which grew dramatically in its influence during the reagan years extended to a second term by the 1984 presidential election as reagan and his senior aides looked to heritage for policy guidance an icon of the american conservative movement reagan is credited by his supporters with transforming the politics of the united states galvanizing the success of the republican party he brought together a coalition of economic conservatives who supported his supply side economics foreign policy conservatives who favored his staunch opposition to communism and the soviet union and social conservatives who identified with his religious and social ideals reagan labeled the soviet union the evil empire conservatives also supported the reagan doctrine under which the us provided military and other aid to insurgency movements resisting governments aligned with the soviet union for these and other efforts reagan was attacked by liberals at the time as a dangerous warmonger but conservative historians assert that he decisively won the cold war188 in defining conservatism reagan said if you analyze it i believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism i think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals—if we were back in the days of the revolution socalled conservatives today would be the liberals and the liberals would be the tories the basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is189 reagans views on government were influenced by thomas jefferson especially his hostility to strong central governments190 were still jeffersons children he declared in 1987 he also stated freedom is not created by government nor is it a gift from those in political power it is in fact secured more than anything else by limitations placed on those in government191192 likewise he greatly admired and often quoted abraham lincoln193 supply side economics dominated the reagan era194 during his eight years in office the national debt more than doubled from 907 billion in 1980 to 26 trillion in 1988 and consumer prices rose by more than 50195 but despite cuts in income tax rates federal income tax revenues grew from 244 billion in 1980 to 467 billion in 1990196 the real median family income which had declined during the previous administration grew by about ten percent under reagan the period from 1981 to 1989 was among the most prosperous in american history with 17 million new jobs created197 the 1980s also saw the founding of the washington times a newspaper influential in the conservative movement reagan was said to have read the paper every morning and the paper had close ties to multiple republican administrations198199 in 1987 after the end of the fairness doctrine conservative talk radio began to grow in significance saving many am radio stations200 since 1990edit time stated there has been an identity crisis in us conservatism growing since the end of the cold war and the presidency of ronald reagan201 supporters of classical liberalism—distinct from modern liberalism—tend to identify as conservatives and in the 21st century classical liberalism remains a major force within the republican party and the larger conservative movement202 in the 21st century only in the united states is classical liberalism a significant political ideology203 1990sedit after the end of the reagan administration significant change occurred within the conservative movement during the george h w bush and bill clinton administrations204 in 1992 many conservatives repudiated president george h w bush because campaigned to the center of the american political spectrum and bill clinton campaigned to the right of the center205 he was defeated for reelection in 1992 in a three way race with populist ross perot attracting considerable support on the right206 democrat bill clinton was stopped in his plan for government health care205 in 1994 the gop made sweeping gains under the leadership of newt gingrich the first republican to become speaker in 40 years207 gingrich overplayed his hand by cutting off funding for the federal government allowing clinton to regain momentum and win reelection in 1996208 the contract with america promised numerous reforms but little was accomplished beyond the ending of major new deal welfare programs209 a national movement to impose term limits failed to reach congress because the supreme court ruled that a constitutional amendment was needed but did transform politics in some states especially california210 some sources have argued that clinton while a member of the democratic party governed as a conservative211 beginning in the early 1990s conservative leaning internet sites began to emerge such as drudge report free republic and townhall212 these websites were created due to an alleged liberal bias within mainstream media213 since then conservative leaning internet sites have gained a significant following and have received more readership than liberal leaning internet sites214 george w bushedit the election of george w bush in 2000 brought a new generation of conservatives to power in washington bush ran under the banner of compassionate conservatism contrasting himself with other members of the republican party205215 bush cut taxes in a 10year plan that was renewed in late 2010 following major debate bush forged a bipartisan coalition to pass no child left behind which for the first time imposed national standards on public schools bush expanded medicaid and was criticized by conservatives216 the september 2001 terrorist attacks resulted in american commitment to the war against terror with invasions of afghanistan in 2001 and iraq in 2003 bush won solid support from republicans in congress and from conservative voters in his 2004 reelection campaign exit polls in 2004 showed that 34 of the voters identified themselves as conservatives and they voted 84 for bush by contrast 21 identified as liberals of whom 13 voted for bush 45 were moderates and they voted 45 for bush almost the same pattern had appeared in the 2000 exit polls217 the exit polls show bush won 57 of the rural vote 52 of the suburban vote and 45 of the urban vote217 when the financial system verged on total collapse in 2008 bush pushed through large scale rescue packages for banks and auto companies that even some conservatives in congress did not support218 some noted conservatives including richard a viguerie and william f buckley jr have said that bush was not a true conservative219220 2008–presentedit the republican contest for the nomination in 2008 was a freeforall with senator john mccain the winner facing barack obama mccain chose alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate and while she was greeted by the gop establishment with initial skepticism she electrified many conservatives and became a major political force on the right221 in 2008 a period which began in 1980 termed the conservative era ended222 after the election of obama for president republicans in congress were unified in almost total opposition to the programs and policies of obama and the democratic majority they unsuccessfully attempted to stop an 814 billion stimulus spending program new regulations on investment firms and a program to require health insurance for all americans they did keep emissions trading from coming to a vote and vow to continue to work to convince americans that burning fossil fuel does not cause global warming223 the slow growth of the economy in the first two years of the obama administration led republicans to call for a return to tax cuts and deregulation of businesses which they perceived as the best way to solve the financial crisis obamas approval rating steadily declined in his first year in office before leveling off at about 5050224 this decline in popularity led to a gop landslide in the midterm elections of 2010225 on foreign policy some conservatives especially neoconservatives and those in the national review circle supported obamas policy of a surge in afghanistan air raids to support the insurgents in libya and the war on terror especially after he ordered the killing of osama bin laden in abbottabad pakistan in may 2011226227 at issue in 2012 was the efficacy of diplomacy and sanctions in stopping iran from building nuclear weapons228 in the 2016 republican party presidential primary donald trump won229 multiple commentators stated that conservatism lost during the primaries as trump was not a conservative230 that trump is a populist231 in february 2017 in politico it wrote the election of trump and his presidency has split conservatives in the united states232 tea partyedit main article tea party movement tea party protesters walk towards the united states capitol during the taxpayer march on washington september 12 2009 a relatively new element of conservatism is the tea party movement of 2009–present a populist grassroots movement comprising over 600 local units who communally express dissatisfaction with the government and both major parties233 many units have promoted activism and protests234 the stated purpose of the movement is to stop what it views as wasteful government spending excessive taxation and strangulation of the economy through regulatory bureaucracies the tea party attracted national attention when it propelled republican scott brown to a victory in the senate election for the massachusetts seat held by the kennedy brothers for nearly 60 years235236 in 2010 tea party candidates upset establishment republicans in several primaries such as alaska colorado delaware florida nevada new york south carolina and utah giving a new momentum to the conservative cause in the 2010 elections and boosting sarah palins visibility rasmussen and schoen 2010 conclude that she is the symbolic leader of the movement and more than anyone else has helped to shape it237 in the fall 2010 elections the new york times identified 129 house candidates with significant tea party support as well as 9 running for the senate all are republicans as the tea party has not been active among democrats238 the tea party itself is a conglomerate of conservatives with diverse viewpoints including libertarians and social conservatives239 most tea party supporters selfidentify as angry at the government240241242 one survey found that tea party supporters in particular distinguish themselves from general republican attitudes on social issues such as samesex marriage abortion and illegal immigration as well as global warming243 however discussion of abortion and gay rights has also been downplayed by tea party leadership244 in the leadup to the 2010 election most tea party candidates have focused on federal spending and deficits with little focus on foreign policy245 noting the lack of central organization or explicit spokesmen matthew continetti of the weekly standard has said there is no single tea party the name is an umbrella that encompasses many different groups under this umbrella youll find everyone from the woolly fringe to ron paul supporters from americans for prosperity to religious conservatives independents and citizens who never have been active in politics before the umbrella is gigantic246 gallup poll editors noted in 2010 that in addition to conservatives being more enthusiastic than liberals about voting in this years election their relative advantage on enthusiasm is much greater than weve seen in the recent past247 referencesedit the conservative party of new york state was founded in 1962
