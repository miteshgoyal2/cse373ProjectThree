transit expects annual revenue of 16 billion 933 of that revenue comes from taxes predominately in the form of local sales taxes property taxes and motor vehicle excise taxes levied within its taxing district in portions of king pierce and snohomish counties passenger fares investments and advertising income make up the remaining 67 of revenue the agency has passed three major ballot measures to fund system expansion including sound move 1996 sound transit 2 2008 and sound transit 3 2016 planning and construction of new light rail lines is anticipated to continue until 2041 under the sound transit 3 plan capital improvement projects will cost 13 billion in 2017 sound transits day to day operations are expected to lose 190 million in 2017 tax revenues exceed the capital improvement budget for the year so the net loss will only be 131 million5 historyedit further information history of link light rail backgroundedit throughout the 20th century seattle planners and voters rejected various proposals for rapid transit systems the forward thrust program of the late 1960s produced two ballot measures for a rapid transit system that were unable to pass with the staterequired supermajority for bonds federal funding that was allocated to the project was instead sent to atlanta georgia forming the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority the municipality of metropolitan seattle metro the regional water quality agency took over bus operations in king county and the city of seattle on january 1 1973 after approval from voters in response to the failure of forward thrust the puget sound council of governments an intercounty planning agency partnered with metro to complete a light rail corridor study in 1986 the regional transportation plan was amended the following year to include rail transit and the washington state legislature formed a state rail development commission to study a regional transit system with light rail commuter rail and express buses establishmentedit the predecessor to sound transit was a 1995 ballot measure that was rejected by voters because of its 67 billion costcitation needed the first sound transit ballot measure passed in 1996 as the current mix of buses commuter rail and light rail at a cost of 39 billion by proposing a much smaller light rail system the remaining funds could be used for the two other services ensuring that the entire seattle area received services from the measure sound transit started out in scandal the agency faced a crisis of financial mismanagement and poor planning and federal officials ordered an audit in 2000 and pulled promised funding after a series of executives resigned in 2001 joni earl took the helm and is widely credited with saving the agency largely this was by being more realistic and being more honest with the public — reportedly she used the slogan optimism is not our friend largely due to her efforts by 2003 sound transit received a clean financial audit and was rerewarded the funding lost two years earlier despite this the earlier crisis required earl to drop about onethird of the originally promised light rail line6 sound transit 2edit 2007 voteedit sound transit 2 st2 was part of a joint ballot measure with the regional transportation investment district entitled roads and transit which was presented to snohomish king and pierce county voters on november 6 2007 sound transit 2 would have made a number of mass transit related improvements as well as a series of highway improvements7 these changes included almost 50

two expansion studies one for studying rapid transit across the sr520 floating bridge and the other studying the use of the woodinville subdivision between renton and woodinville8 the ballot measure was defeated by voters9 2008 voteedit the sound transit board on july 24 2008 voted to put a reduced sound transit 2 plan before voters it passed by large margins 58 to 42 on november 4 20081011 the financial plan for the measure shows 178 billion expenditure over 15 years funded with a 510 rise in the regional general sales tax which essentially doubles sound transits revenue central link light rail will be extended from the currently funded northern terminus at husky stadium north to lynnwood to the south the tracks will continue from the current southern terminus at seatac airport to the northern edge of federal way the proposed east link light rail will depart from downtown seattle and end in overlake via bellevue a first hill connector streetcar is proposed from central links
