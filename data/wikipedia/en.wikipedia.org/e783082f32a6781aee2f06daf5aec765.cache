characters 4 development 41 hd rerelease 5 reception 6 see also 7 references 8 external links gameplayedit see also gameplay in space channel 5 much like the previous game players take on the role of ulala as she uses her funky dance moves and shooting skill to fight against the rhythm rogues players must repeat actions acted out by their opponent in time to the music using the four directional buttons and two call buttons chu and hey in this game hey is now used to distinguish rescuing hostages from shooting during rescue segments and serves as its own move during dance sections also new to this game certain commands call for the player to hold down a button to do a charged move for example when someone says chuuuuu players hold down the chu button there are also segments where characters play instruments which is controlled using any of the directional buttons along with chu and hey during each section players are given a set number of hearts if a player makes a mistake during a line they will lose a heart along with some of their ratings losing all hearts result in a section being failed usually resulting in the loss of a captive hostage if a players ratings drop below 0 the game will end during certain areas such as boss battles the players rating will be converted into stars which act the same way as hearts albeit if the players loses all of their stars the game ends the viewer rating percentage in the corner works as the score which changes depending on how well the game is played and the number of hearts or stars at the end of a scenario there are also secrets at certain points in between gameplay where players press buttons to make morolians spring up from the corner players need to find all these secrets in a level in order to get a full 100 rating at the end the last level has a possible 200 rating clearing certain objectives can unlock new costumes for ulala to wear during stages space channel 5 part 2 rewards the player for replaying sections by giving bios for every character unlocked in addition saving characters allows ulala to unlock certain hidden costumes elsewhere there is a 100stage battle mode known as ulalas dance or ulalas dancing show in which players have to play 100 consecutive lines with only one heart there is also a 2 player mode where one player controls directions and the other controls actions and an alternate story mode where characters and costumes are new and dance moves are harder other improvements include replacing the rendered backgrounds of the first game with real time environments plotedit the game follows ulala as she faces off against a new group of enemies called the rhythm rogues known as the odoridan in japanese led by the mysterious purge and his masked assistant shadow the rhythm rogues kidnap thousands of innocent people including space president peace and force them to dance purge demands a ransom for the return of the president but when ulala and space
