machinelearning research outline of machine learning machine learning portal v t e pattern recognition is a branch of machine learning that focuses on the recognition of patterns and regularities in data although it is in some cases considered to be nearly synonymous with machine learning1 pattern recognition systems are in many cases trained from labeled training data supervised learning but when no labeled data are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns unsupervised learning the terms pattern recognition machine learning data mining and knowledge discovery in databases kdd are hard to separate as they largely overlap in their scope machine learning is the common term for supervised learning methodsdubious – discuss and originates from artificial intelligence whereas kdd and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use pattern recognition has its origins in engineering and the term is popular in the context of computer vision a leading computer vision conference is named conference on computer vision and pattern recognition in pattern recognition there may be a higher interest to formalize explain and visualize the pattern while machine learning traditionally focuses on maximizing the recognition rates yet all of these domains have evolved substantially from their roots in artificial intelligence engineering and statistics and theyve become increasingly similar by integrating developments and ideas from each other in machine learning pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value in statistics discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936 an example of pattern recognition is classification which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of classes for example determine whether a given email is spam or nonspam however pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well other examples are regression which assigns a realvalued output to each input sequence labeling which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values for example part of speech tagging which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence and parsing which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence describing the syntactic structure of the sentencecitation needed pattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform most likely matching of the inputs taking into account their statistical variation this is opposed to pattern matching algorithms which look for exact matches in the input with preexisting patterns a common example of a patternmatching algorithm is regular expression matching which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors in contrast to pattern recognition pattern matching is generally not considered a type of machine learning although patternmatching algorithms especially with fairly general carefully tailored patterns can sometimes succeed in providing

further reading 8 external links overviewedit pattern recognition is generally categorized according to the type of learning procedure used to generate the output value supervised learning assumes that a set of training data the training set has been provided consisting of a set of instances that have been properly labeled by hand with the correct output a learning procedure then generates a model that attempts to meet two sometimes conflicting objectives perform as well as possible on the training data and generalize as well as possible to new data usually this means being as simple as possible for some technical definition of simple in accordance with occams razor discussed below unsupervised learning on the other hand assumes training data that has not been handlabeled and attempts to find inherent patterns in the data that can then be used to determine the correct output value for new data instances2 a combination of the two that has recently been explored is semisupervised learning which uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data typically a small set of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data note that in cases of unsupervised learning there may be no training data at all to speak of in other words the data to be labeled is the training data note that sometimes different terms are used to describe the corresponding supervised and unsupervised learning procedures for the same type of output for example the unsupervised equivalent of classification is normally known as clustering based on the common perception of the task as involving no training data to speak of and of grouping the input data into clusters based on some inherent similarity measure eg the distance between instances considered as vectors in a multidimensional vector space rather than assigning each input instance into one of a set of predefined classes note also that in some fields the terminology is different for example in community ecology the term classification is used to refer to what is commonly known as clustering the piece of input data for which an output value is generated is formally termed an instance the instance is formally described by a vector of features which together constitute a description of all known characteristics of the instance these feature vectors can be seen as defining points in an appropriate multidimensional space and methods for manipulating vectors in vector spaces can be correspondingly applied to them such as computing the dot product or the angle between two vectors typically features are either categorical also known as nominal ie consisting of one of a set of unordered items such as a gender of male or female or a blood type of a b ab or o ordinal consisting of one of a set of ordered items eg large medium or small integervalued eg a count of the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email or realvalued eg a measurement of blood pressure often categorical and ordinal data are grouped together likewise for integervalued and realvalued data furthermore many algorithms work only in terms of categorical data and require that realvalued or integervalued data be discretized into groups eg less than 5 between 5 and 10 or greater than 10 probabilistic classifiersedit main article probabilistic classifier it has been suggested that portions of this section be split out into another article titled probabilistic classifier discuss may 2014 many common pattern recognition algorithms are probabilistic in nature in that they use statistical inference to find the best label for a given instance unlike other algorithms which simply output a best label often probabilistic algorithms also output a probability of the instance being described by the given label in addition many probabilistic algorithms output a list of the nbest labels with associated probabilities for some value of n instead of simply a single best label when the number of possible labels is fairly small eg in the case of classification n may be set so that the probability of all possible labels is output probabilistic algorithms have many advantages over nonprobabilistic algorithms they output a confidence value associated with their choice note that some other algorithms may also output confidence values but in general only for probabilistic algorithms is this value mathematically grounded in probability theory nonprobabilistic confidence values can in general not be given any specific meaning and only used to compare against other confidence values output by the same algorithm correspondingly they can abstain when the confidence of choosing any particular output is too low because of the probabilities output probabilistic patternrecognition algorithms can be more effectively incorporated into larger machinelearning tasks in a way that partially or completely avoids the problem of error propagation number of important feature variablesedit feature selection algorithms attempt to directly prune out redundant or irrelevant features a general introduction to feature selection which summarizes approaches and challenges has been given3 the complexity of featureselection is because of its nonmonotonous character an optimization problem where given a total of n displaystyle n features the powerset consisting of all 2 n − 1 displaystyle 2n1 subsets of features need to be explored the branchandbound algorithm4 does reduce this complexity but is intractable for medium to large values of the number of available features n displaystyle n for a largescale comparison of featureselection algorithms see 5 techniques to transform the raw feature vectors feature extraction are sometimes used prior to application of the patternmatching algorithm for example feature extraction algorithms attempt to reduce a largedimensionality feature vector into a smallerdimensionality vector that is easier to work with and encodes less redundancy using mathematical techniques such as principal components analysis pca the distinction between feature selection and feature extraction is that the resulting features after feature extraction has taken place are of a different sort than the original features and may not easily be interpretable while the features left after feature selection are simply a subset of the original features problem statement supervised versionedit formally the problem of supervised pattern recognition can be stated as follows given an unknown function g x → y displaystyle gmathcal xrightarrow mathcal y the ground truth that maps input instances x ∈ x displaystyle boldsymbol xin mathcal x to output labels y ∈ y displaystyle yin mathcal y along with training data d x 1 y 1 … x n y n displaystyle mathbf d boldsymbol x1y1dots boldsymbol xnyn assumed to represent accurate examples of the mapping produce a function h x → y displaystyle hmathcal xrightarrow mathcal y that approximates as closely as possible the correct mapping g displaystyle g for example if the problem is filtering spam then x i displaystyle boldsymbol xi is some representation of an email and y displaystyle y is either spam or nonspam in order for this to be a welldefined problem approximates as closely as possible needs to be defined rigorously in decision theory this is defined by specifying a loss function or cost function that assigns a specific value to loss resulting from producing an incorrect label the goal then is to minimize the expected loss with the expectation taken over the probability distribution of x displaystyle mathcal x in practice neither the distribution of x displaystyle mathcal x nor the ground truth function g x → y displaystyle gmathcal xrightarrow mathcal y are known exactly but can be computed only empirically by collecting a large number of samples of x displaystyle mathcal x and handlabeling them using the correct value of y displaystyle mathcal y a timeconsuming process which is typically the limiting factor in the amount of data of this sort that can be collected the particular loss function depends on the type of label being predicted for example in the case of classification the simple zeroone loss function is often sufficient this corresponds simply to assigning a loss of 1 to any incorrect labeling and implies that the optimal classifier minimizes the error rate on independent test data ie counting up the fraction of instances that the learned function h x → y displaystyle hmathcal xrightarrow mathcal y labels wrongly which is equivalent to maximizing the number of correctly classified instances the goal of the learning procedure is then to minimize the error rate maximize the correctness on a typical test set for a probabilistic pattern recognizer the problem is instead to estimate the probability of each possible output label given a particular input instance ie to estimate a function of the form p l a b e l x θ f x θ displaystyle prm labelboldsymbol xboldsymbol theta fleftboldsymbol xboldsymbol theta right where the feature vector input is x displaystyle boldsymbol x and the function f is typically parameterized by some parameters θ displaystyle boldsymbol theta 6 in a discriminative approach to the problem f is estimated directly in a generative approach however the inverse probability p x l a b e l displaystyle pboldsymbol xrm label is instead estimated and combined with the prior probability p l a b e l θ displaystyle prm labelboldsymbol theta using bayes rule as follows p l a b e l x θ p x l a b e l θ p l a b e l θ ∑ l ∈ all labels p x l p l θ displaystyle prm labelboldsymbol xboldsymbol theta frac pboldsymbol xrm labelboldsymbol theta prm labelboldsymbol theta sum lin textall

labelspboldsymbol xlplboldsymbol theta operatorname d l the value of θ displaystyle boldsymbol theta is typically learned using maximum a posteriori map estimation this finds the best value that simultaneously meets two conflicting objects to perform as well as possible on the training data smallest errorrate and to find the simplest possible model essentially this combines maximum likelihood estimation with a regularization procedure that favors simpler models over more complex models in a bayesian context the regularization procedure can be viewed as placing a prior probability p θ displaystyle pboldsymbol theta on different values of θ displaystyle boldsymbol theta mathematically θ ∗ arg ⁡ max θ p θ d displaystyle boldsymbol theta arg max boldsymbol theta pboldsymbol theta

displaystyle prm labelboldsymbol xint prm labelboldsymbol xboldsymbol theta pboldsymbol theta mathbf d operatorname d boldsymbol theta frequentist or bayesian approach to pattern recognitionedit the first pattern classifier – the linear discriminant presented by fisher – was developed in the frequentist tradition the frequentist approach entails that the model parameters are considered unknown but objective the parameters are then computed estimated from the collected data for the linear discriminant these parameters are precisely the mean vectors and the covariance matrix also the probability of each class p l a b e l θ displaystyle prm labelboldsymbol theta is estimated from the collected dataset note that the usage of bayes rule in a pattern classifier does not make the classification approach bayesian bayesian statistics has its origin in greek philosophy where a distinction was already made between the a priori and the a posteriori knowledge later kant defined his distinction between what is a priori known – before observation – and the empirical knowledge gained from observations in a bayesian pattern classifier the class probabilities p l a b e l θ displaystyle prm labelboldsymbol theta can be chosen by the user which are then a priori moreover experience quantified as a priori parameter values can be weighted with empirical observations – using eg the beta conjugate prior and dirichletdistributions the bayesian approach facilitates a seamless intermixing between expert knowledge in the form of subjective probabilities and objective observations probabilistic pattern classifiers can be used according to a frequentist or a bayesian approach usesedit the face was automatically detected by special software within medical science

related to perception which explains how the sensory inputs humans receive are made meaningful pattern recognition can be thought of in two different ways the first being template matching and the second being feature detection a template is a pattern used to produce items of the same proportions the templatematching hypothesis suggests that incoming stimuli are compared with templates in the long term memory if there is a match the stimulus is identified feature detection models such as the pandemonium system for classifying letters selfridge 1959 suggest that the stimuli are broken down into their component parts for identification for example a capital e has three horizontal lines and one vertical line14 algorithmsedit algorithms for pattern recognition depend on the type of label
