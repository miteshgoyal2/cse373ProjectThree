put dorothy toto and the lion into an eternal sleep with magic poppy perfume finally reaching the emerald city an analogue of the reallife world trade center plaza the quintet gains passage into the city because of dorothys ownership of the silver slippers they marvel at the spectacle of the city and its sophisticated fashion forward dancers they are granted an audience with the wiz richard pryor

scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch which she does the sprinklers put out the fire but also melt evillene she is flushed down into her throne the lid of which slams shut like a toilet with evillene finally gone her spells lose their power the winkies are freed from their permanent costumes revealing attractive humans underneath and their sweatshop tools disappear they

dorothy makes them realize that they already have had these things all along just as it seems as if she will never be able to get home glinda the good witch of the south appears and implores her to

good witch home finale dorothy productionedit preproduction and developmentedit the wiz was the eighth feature film produced by motown productions the filmtv division of berry gordys motown records label gordy originally wanted the teenaged future rb singer stephanie mills who had played the role on broadway to be cast as dorothy when motown star diana ross asked gordy if she could be cast as dorothy he declined saying that ross—then 33 years old—was too old for the role10 ross went around gordy and convinced executive producer rob cohen at universal pictures to arrange a deal where he would produce the film if ross was cast as dorothy gordy and cohen agreed to the deal pauline kael a film critic described rosss efforts to get the film into production as perhaps the strongest example of sheer will in film history10 after film director john badham learned that ross was going to play the part of dorothy he decided not to direct the film and cohen replaced him with sidney lumet10 of his decision not to direct the wiz john badham recalled telling cohen that he thought ross was a wonderful singer shes a terrific actress and a great dancer but shes not this character shes not the little sixyearold girl dorothy in the wizard of oz11 though 20th century fox had financially backed the stage musical they ended up exercising their first refusal rights to the film production which gave universal an opening to finance the film12 initially universal was so excited about the films prospects that they did not set a budget for production12 joel schumachers script for the wiz was influenced by werner erhards teachings and his erhard seminars training est movement as both schumacher and diana ross were very enamored of werner erhard13 before i knew it said rob cohen the movie was becoming an estian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing who you are and sharing and all that i hated the script a lot but it was hard to argue with ross because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars13 schumacher spoke positively of the results of the est training stating that he was eternally grateful for learning that i was responsible for my life13 however he also complained that everybody stayed exactly the way they were and went around spouting all this bull13 of est and erhard references in the film itself the grove book of hollywood notes that the speech delivered by glinda the good witch at the end of the film was a litany of estlike platitudes and the book also makes est comparisons to the song believe in yourself13 although joel schumacher had seen the broadway play before writing the script none of the broadway plays writing was incorporated into the films14 during production lumet felt that the finished film would be an absolutely unique experience that nobody has ever witnessed before12 when asked about any possible influence from mgms popular 1939 film adaptation of the wizard of oz lumet stated that there was nothing to be gained from the 1939 film other than to make certain we didnt use anything from it they made a brilliant movie and even though our concept is different – theyre kansas were new york theyre white were black and the score and the books are totally different – we wanted to make sure that we never overlapped in any area12 michael jackson a former motown star who by the start of development on the wiz in 1977 had left motown for epic records with his brothers the jacksons was cast as the scarecrow jackson was dedicated to the role and watched videotapes of gazelles cheetahs and panthers in order to learn graceful movements for his part15 however jacksons father joseph jackson didnt want him to land the role as he was managing him at the time but jackson refused to listen to his father and decided to be on the movie ted ross and mabel king were brought in to reprise their respective roles from the stage musical while nipsey russell was cast as the tin man lena horne motherinlaw to sidney lumet during the time of production was cast as glinda the good witch and comedian richard pryor portrayed the wiz1016 principal photographyedit the wiz was filmed at astoria studios in queens new york the decaying new york state pavilion from the 1964 new york worlds fair was used as the set for munchkinland astroland at coney island was used for the tinman scene with the cyclone as a backdrop while the world trade center served as the emerald city17 the scenes filmed at the emerald city were elaborate utilizing 650 dancers 385 crew members and 1200 costumes1718 costume designer tony walton enlisted the help of high fashion designers in new york city for the emerald city sequence and obtained exotic costumes and fabric from designers such as oscar de la renta and norma kamali16 albert whitlock created the films visual special effects12 while stan winston served as the head makeup artist16 quincy jones was the musical supervisor and music producer for the film15 he later wrote that he initially did not want to work on the film but did it as a favor to sidney lumet15 the film production marked jones first time working with michael jackson and jones would later produce three hit albums for jackson off the wall thriller and bad19 jones recalled working with jackson as one of his favorite experiences from the wiz and spoke of jacksons dedication to his role comparing his acting style to sammy davis jr15 jones had a brief cameo during the gold segment of the emerald city sequence playing what looks like a fiftyfoot grand piano releaseedit box officeedit the wiz proved to be a commercial failure as the 24 million production only earned 136 million at the box office2310 though prerelease television broadcast rights had been sold to cbs for over 10 million in the end the film produced a net loss of 104 million for motown and universal310 at the time it was the most expensive film musical ever made20 the films failure steered hollywood studios away from producing the allblack film projects that had become popular during the blaxploitation era of the early to mid1970s for several years456 the film was released on vhs home video in 1989 by mcauniversal home video with a reissue in 1992 and was first broadcast on television on cbs on may 5 1984 edited to 100 minutes to capitalize on michael jacksons massive popularity at the time21 it continues to be broadcast periodically on networks such as bet tvone vh1 soul and was the inaugural broadcast on the bounce tv digital broadcast network22 the wiz is often broadcast on thanksgiving day attributed to the opening scene of dorothys family gathered for a thanksgiving dinner1023 the film was released on dvd in 199924 a remastered version entitled the wiz 30th anniversary edition was released in 2008242526 extras on both dvd releases include a 1978 featurette about the films production and the original theatrical trailer24 a bluray version was released in 201027 critical receptionedit critics panned the wiz upon its october 1978 release228 many reviewers directed their criticism at diana ross who they believed was too old to play dorothy6293031 most agreed that what had worked so successfully on stage simply did not translate well to the screen hischaks through the screen door what happened to the broadway musical when it went to hollywood criticized joel schumachers cockamamy screenplay and called believe in yourself the scores weakest song29 he described diana rosss portrayal of dorothy as cold neurotic and oddly unattractive and noted that the film was a critical and box office bust29 in his work history of the american cinema harpole characterized the film as one of the decades biggest failures and the years biggest musical flop3 the grove book of hollywood noted that the picture finished off diana rosss screen career as the film was rosss final theatrical feature131832 in his book blockbuster tom shone referred to the wiz as expensive crud33 in the book mr and mrs hollywood the author criticized the script noting the wiz was too scary for children and too silly for adults2 ray bolger who played the scarecrow in the 1939 the wizard of oz film did not think highly of the wiz stating the wiz is overblown and will never have the universal appeal that the classic mgm musical has obtained34 michael jacksons performance as the scarecrow was one of the only positively reviewed elements of the film with critics noting that jackson possessed genuine acting talent and provided the only genuinely memorable moments1735 of the results of the film jackson stated i dont think it could have been any better i really dont36 in 1980 jackson stated that his time working on the wiz was my greatest experience so far ill never forget that35 the film received a positive critique for its elaborate set design and the book american jewish filmmakers noted that it features some of the most imaginative adaptations of new york locales since the glory days of the astairerogers films37 in a 2004 review of the film christopher null wrote positively of ted ross and richard pryors performances38 however nulls overall review of the film was critical and he wrote that other than the song ease on down the road the rest is an acid trip of bad dancing garish sets and a joel schumacherscripted mess that runs 135 agonizing minutes38 a 2005 piece by hank stuever in the washington post described the film as a rather appreciable delight even when its a mess and felt that the singing – especially diana rosss – was a marvel39 the new york times analyzed the film within a discussion of the genre of blaxploitation as the audience for blaxploitation dwindled it seemed as if car wash and the wiz might be the last gasp of what had been a steadily expanding black presence in mainstream filmmaking40 the st petersburg times noted of course it only took one flop like the wiz 1978 to give hollywood an excuse to retreat to safer ie whiter creative ground until john singleton and spike lee came along yet without blaxploitation there might not have been another generation of black filmmakers no denzel washington or angela bassett or they might have taken longer to emerge41 the boston globe commented the term black film should be struck from the critical vocabulary to appreciate just how outmoded deceptive and limiting it is consider the following all of which have been described as black films and characterized the wiz in a list which also featured 1970s films shaft blacula and super fly42 despite its lack of critical or commercial success in its original release the wiz became a cult classic7 especially because it features michael jacksons only starring theatrical film role8 with lena hornes death in 2010 diana ross is the only living cast member of the film awards and honorsedit the wiz was nominated for four academy awards best art direction tony walton philip rosenberg edward stewart robert drumheller best costume design best original music score and best cinematography but did not win any of them4344 on 1979s naacp image awards michael jackson received the outstanding actor in a motion picture award for the wiz 45 see alsoedit adaptations of the wizard of oz referencesedit the wiz u british board of film classification december 7 1978 retrieved october 24 2016  a b
