line was cleopatra vii who committed suicide following the burial of her lover mark antony who had died in her arms from a selfinflicted stab wound after octavian had captured alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled the ptolemies faced rebellions of native egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by rome nevertheless hellenistic culture continued to thrive in egypt well after the muslim conquest christianity was brought to egypt by saint mark the evangelist in the 1st century35 diocletians reign from 284 to 305 ad marked the transition from the roman to the byzantine era in egypt when a great number of egyptian christians were persecuted the new testament had by then been

the arabs brought sunni islam to the country early in this period egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices leading to various sufi orders that have flourished to

its population41 egypt was always a difficult province for the ottoman sultans to control due in part to the continuing power and influence of the mamluks the egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries napoleon defeated the mamluk troops in the battle of the pyramids 21 july 1798 painted by lejeune egypt remained semiautonomous under the mamluks until it was invaded by the

nominalcitation needed muhammad ali massacred the mamluks and established a dynasty that was to rule egypt until the revolution of 1952 the introduction in 1820 of longstaple cotton transformed its agriculture into a cashcrop monoculture before the end of the century concentrating land ownership and shifting production towards international markets42 muhammad ali annexed northern sudan 1820–1824 syria 1833 and parts of arabia and anatolia but in 1841 the european powers fearful lest he topple the ottoman empire itself forced him to return most of his conquests to the ottomans his military ambition required him to modernise the country he built industries a system of canals for irrigation and transport and reformed the civil service42 he constructed a military state with around four percent of the populace serving the army to raise egypt to a powerful positioning in the ottoman empire in a way showing various similarities to the soviet strategies without communism conducted in the 20th century43 muhammad ali pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the corvée to a great modernised army he introduced conscription of the male peasantry in 19th century egypt and took a novel approach to create his great army strengthening it with numbers and in skill education and training of the new soldiers was not an option the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation the men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckoned with the resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold one of nationalism and pride it was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that muhammad ali imposed his rule over egypt44 the policy that mohammad ali pasha followed during his reign explains partly why the numeracy in egypt compared to other northafrican and middleeastern countries increased only at a remarkably small rate as investment in further education only took place in the military and industrial sector45 muhammad ali was succeeded briefly by his son ibrahim in september 1848 then by a grandson abbas i in november 1848 then by

because of the onerous taxation it required in 1875 ismail was forced to sell egypts share in the canal to the british government within three years this led to the imposition of british and french controllers who sat in the egyptian cabinet and with the financial power of the bondholders behind them were the real power in the government46 other circumstances like epidemic diseases cattle disease in the 1880s floods and wars drove the economic downturn and increased egypts dependency on foreign debt even further47 in later years the dynasty became a british puppet42 ismail and tewfik pasha governed egypt as a quasiindependent state under ottoman suzerainty until the british occupation of 1882 female nationalists demonstrating in cairo 1919 local dissatisfaction with ismail and with european intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879 with ahmad urabi a prominent figure fearing a reduction of their control the uk and france intervened militarily

his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of infitah through this policy incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction abandoning egypts infant industries62 even though sadats policy was intended to modernise egypt and assist the middle class it mainly benefited the higher class and because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs led to the 1977 egyptian bread riots sadat made a historic visit to israel in 1977 which led to the 1979 peace treaty in exchange for israeli withdrawal from sinai sadats initiative sparked enormous controversy in the arab world and led to egypts

stream into cities like cairo where they ended up in crowded slums barely managing to survive in the 1980s 1990s and 2000s terrorist attacks in egypt became numerous and severe and began to target christian copts foreign tourists and government officials65 in the 1990s an islamist group algamaa alislamiyya engaged in an extended campaign of violence from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners serious damage was done to the largest sector of egypts economy—tourism66—and in turn to the government but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support67 during mubaraks reign the political scene was dominated by the national democratic party which was created by sadat in 1978 it passed the 1993 syndicates law 1995 press law and 1999 nongovernmental associations law which hampered freedoms of association and expression by imposing new regulations and draconian penalties on violationscitation needed as a result by the late 1990s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were
