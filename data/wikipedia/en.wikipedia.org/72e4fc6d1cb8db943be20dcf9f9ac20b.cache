controversiesedit adam lamberts performanceedit in response to adam lamberts performance of his song for your entertainment at the end of the 2009 american music awards broadcast on abc the parents television council a conservative television watchdog group urged viewers to complain to the fcc if living in an area where the performance was shown before 10 pm local time the ptc complained that the performance contained a simulation of oral sex4 lamberts performance reportedly was broadcast around 11 pm eastern and pacific time outside the fccs usual 6am10pm time frame prohibiting the broadcast of indecent material5 abc also received about 1500 telephoned complaints6 in a report by lambert he had been scheduled to also perform on fellow abc programs jimmy kimmel live and dick clarks new years rockin eve with ryan seacrest 2010 the latter also being produced by dick clark productions but found out that these bookings were cancelled possibly in response to the incident neither abc or dick clark productions confirmed his reports or confirmed if he was ever booked at all7 nominations of michael jacksonedit after his death in june 2009 michael jackson was nominated for five posthumous awards artist of the year favorite poprock male artist favorite poprock album for number ones favorite soulrb male artist and favorite soulrb album also for number ones this move was subsequently criticized by those who felt that the awards committee was piggybacking on the hype of jacksons death for ratings and media coverage purposes and that his nomination was unfair to artists who had brought out newer material to equal success such as lady gaga and taylor swift not helping matters was the fact that number ones was a greatesthits compilation released in 2003 six years before that years awards show and not only had jackson not released any new material since one more chance the sole new recording on that album but he had already won several american music awards for the songs featured on number ones la times insisted that if fans thought it was an injustice that kanye west had the audacity to interrupt swift accepting a moon man at the mtv video music awards then they should be ready to riot if shes now losing awards to artists who havent had a new song in nearly a decade8 jackson went on to win four of his five nominations only losing out on artist of the year which was won by swift referencesedit nominations of 2009 american music awards abc archived from the original on 3 december 2009 retrieved 20091107  performers of 2009 american music awards abc
