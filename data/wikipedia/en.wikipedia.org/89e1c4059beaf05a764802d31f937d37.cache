hitchhikers guide to the galaxy the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was a concept for a sciencefiction comedy radio series pitched by adams and radio producer simon brett to bbc radio 4 in 1977 adams

used in the series towel day 2005 in innsbruck austria where adams first had the idea of the hitchhikers guide in the novels a towel is the most useful thing a space traveller can have the annual towel day 25 may was first celebrated in 2001 two weeks after adamss death according to adams the idea for the title occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in innsbruck austria gazing at the stars he was carrying a copy of the hitchhikers guide to europe and it occurred to him that somebody ought to write a hitchhikers guide to the galaxy he later said that the constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event15 despite the original outline adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote he turned to john lloyd for help with the final two episodes of the first series lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own called gigax16 very little of lloyds material survived in later adaptations of hitchhikers such as the novels and the tv series the tv series was based on the first six radio episodes and sections contributed by lloyd were largely rewritten bbc radio 4 broadcast the first radio series weekly in the uk

writing this included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three weeks to ensure that so long and thanks for all the fish was completed17 he was quoted as saying i love deadlines i love the whooshing noise they make as they go by18 despite the difficulty with deadlines adams wrote five novels in the series published in 1979 1980 1982 1984 and 1992 the books formed the basis for other adaptations such as threepart comic book adaptations for each of the first three books an interactive textadventure computer game and a photoillustrated edition published in 1994 this latter edition featured a 42 puzzle designed by adams which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four hitchhikers novels the paperback for the fifth reused the artwork from the hardback

if he meant agnostic he told american atheists that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it he imagined a sentient puddle who wakes up one morning and thinks this is an interesting world i find myself in – an interesting hole i find myself in – fits me rather neatly doesnt it in fact it fits me staggeringly well must have been made to have me in it to demonstrate his view that the finetuned universe argument for god was a fallacy31 he remained fascinated by religion because of its effect on human affairs i love to keep poking and prodding at it ive thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing32 the evolutionary biologist and atheist richard dawkins uses adamss influence throughout to exemplify arguments for nonbelief in his 2006
