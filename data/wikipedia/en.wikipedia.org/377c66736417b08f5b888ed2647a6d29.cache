that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way my fondest hope for each one of you—and especially for the young people here—is that you will love your country not for her power or wealth but for her selflessness and her idealism may each of you have the heart to conceive the understanding to direct and the hand to execute works that will make the world a little better for your having been here play media
