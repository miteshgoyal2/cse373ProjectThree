technical schools were founded in 1900 in pittsburgh16 by the scottish american industrialist and philanthropist andrew carnegie who wrote the timehonored words my heart is in the work when he donated the funds to create the institution carnegies vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of workingclass pittsburghers many of whom worked in his mills carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the pratt institute in brooklyn new york founded by industrialist charles pratt in 188717 in 1912 the institution changed its name to carnegie institute of technology cit and began offering fouryear degrees during this time cit consisted of four constituent schools the school of fine and applied arts the school of apprentices and journeymen the school of science and technology and the margaret morrison carnegie school for women the mellon institute of industrial research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers andrew who went on to become treasury secretary and richard b mellon in honor of their father thomas mellon the patriarch of the mellon family the institute began as a research organization which performed work for government and industry on contract and was initially established as a department within the university of pittsburgh in 1927 the mellon institute incorporated as an independent nonprofit in 1938 the mellon institutes iconic building was completed and it moved to its new and current location on fifth avenue in 1967 with support from paul mellon carnegie tech merged with the mellon institute of industrial research to become carnegie mellon university carnegie mellons coordinate womens college the margaret morrison carnegie college closed in 1973 and merged its academic programs with the rest of the university18 andrew mellon cofounder of the mellon institute the industrial research mission of the mellon institute survived the merger as the carnegie mellon research institute cmri and continued doing work on contract to industry and government cmri closed in 2001 and its programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into independent entities19 campusedit the main campus in pittsburgh as seen from the 36th floor of the cathedral of learning carnegie mellons 140acre 57 ha6 main campus is three miles 5 km from downtown pittsburgh between schenley park and the squirrel hill shadyside and oakland neighborhoods carnegie mellon is bordered to the west by the campus of the university of pittsburgh carnegie mellon owns 81 buildings in the oakland and squirrel hill neighborhoods of pittsburgh for decades the center of student life on campus was skibo hall the universitys student union built in the 1950s skibo halls design was typical of midcentury modern architecture but was poorly equipped to deal with advances in computer and internet connectivity the original skibo was razed in the summer of 1994 and replaced by a new student union that is fully wifi enabled known as university center the building was dedicated in 1996 in 2014 carnegie mellon rededicated the university center as the cohon university center in recognition of the eighth president of the university jared cohon20 a large grassy area known as the cut forms the backbone of the campus with a separate grassy area known as the mall running perpendicular the cut was formed by filling in a ravine hence the name with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the college of fine arts building the northwestern part of the campus home to hamburg hall newellsimon hall smith hall and gates hillman complex was acquired from the united states bureau of mines in the 1980s in 2006 carnegie mellon trustee jill gansman kraus donated the 80foot 24 mtall sculpture walking to the sky which was placed on the lawn facing forbes ave between the cohon university center and warner hall the sculpture was controversial for its placement the general lack of input that the campus community had and its aesthetic appeal21 in april 2015 carnegie mellon university in collaboration with jones lang lasalle announced the planning of a second office space structure alongside the robert mehrabian collaborative innovation center an upscale and fullservice hotel and retail and dining development along forbes avenue this complex will connect to the tepper quadrangle the heinz college the tata consultancy services building and the gateshillman center to create an innovation corridor on the university campus the effort is intended to continue to attract major corporate partnerships to create opportunities in research teaching and employment with students and faculty22 a panoramic view of carnegie mellon universitys pittsburgh campus from the college of fine arts

center and the cohon university center also visible are the fence and the walking to the sky sculpture campus architecture and designedit the campus began to take shape in the beauxarts architecture style of henry hornbostel winner of the 1904 competition to design the original institution and later the founder of what is now the carnegie mellon school of architecture a college rumor holds that hamerschlag hall was designed so that in the event the college was not successful it could be turned into a factory there was little change to the campus between the first and second world war a 1938 master plan by githens and keally suggested acquisition of new land along forbes avenue but the plan was not fully implemented the period starting with the construction of the graduate school of industrial administration building 1952 and ending with wean hall 1971 saw the institutional change from carnegie institute of technology to carnegie mellon university new facilities were needed to respond to the universitys growing national reputation in artificial intelligence business robotics and the arts in addition an expanding student population resulted in a need for improved facilities for student life athletics and libraries the campus finally expanded to forbes avenue from its original land along schenley park a ravine long known as the cut was gradually filled in to campus level joining the mall as a major campus open space hamerschlag roberts and scott halls are three of the teaching facilities of the college of engineering the buildings of this era reflect current attitudes toward architectural style the international style with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure had been in vogue in urban settings since the 1930s it came late to the carnegie campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among all institutions of higher education to abandon historical styles by the 1960s it was seen as a way to accomplish the needed expansion and at the same time give the campus a new image each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement but not in its form or materials during the 1970s and 1980s the tenure of university president richard cyert 1972–1990 witnessed a period of growth and development the research budget grew from roughly us12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than us110 million in the late 1980s the work of researchers in new fields like robotics and software engineering helped the university build on its reputation one example of this approach was the introduction of the universitys andrew computing network in the mid1980s this pioneering project which linked all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established carnegie mellon as a leader in the use of technology in education and research on april 24 1984 cmuedu carnegie

university traditions the fence the fence – in the early days of carnegie tech there was a single bridge which connected margaret morrison womens college with the carnegie institute of technology the bridge was a meeting place for students in 1916 the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area the administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place the students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence administration was about to give up and tear it down but that night a fraternity as a prank painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party ever since painting the fence has been a carnegie mellon tradition108 the fence at carnegie mellon lies at the center of campus in the area known as the cut students guard the fence 24 hours a day and as long as two vigils are maintained no other student may take the fence the fence can then be painted by the group that has it but only between midnight and 6 am only hand brushes may be used the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine the previous paint cannot be stripped and each new painting adds a new layer the original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1 of surrounding paint and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete today the fence is considered the worlds most painted
