of high demand6061 on march 18 2014 google released the chromecast to 11 new markets including the uk germany and canada62 with the bbc iplayer enabled for uk users63 in july 2014 to commemorate the

receptionedit first generation modeledit nilay patel of the verge gave the chromecast an 8510 score in his review saying the chromecast is basically an impulse purchase that just happens to be the simplest cheapest and best solution for getting a browser window on your tv speaking of the adapters potential he said it seems like the chromecast might actually deliver on all that potential but google still has a lot of work to do in particular patel pointed to apples airplay protocol as an example of an established competitor with many more features70 techcrunchs review of the device said even with a bug or two rearing its head the chromecast is easily worth its 35 pricetag71 gizmodo gave the device a positive review highlighting the ease of setup and sharing video in comparing the device to competitors the review said chromecast isnt googles version of apple tv and its not trying to be but chromecast also costs a third of what those devices do and has plenty of potential given that its sdk is just a few days old72 michael gorman of engadget gave the chromecast an 84100 score writing its a platform thats likely to improve dramatically as more apps start to support the technology in his comparing the chromecast to competing devices gorman illustrated that it initially had support from fewer multimedia services but because of its low price and ease of use he concluded we can wholeheartedly recommend the chromecast for anyone whos been looking for an easy unobtrusive way to put some brains into their dumb tv73 will greenwald of pc magazine rated it 45 saying the google chromecast is the least expensive way to access online services on your hdtv although he noted that the lack of local playback and limited chrome integration holds it back in some respects74 david pogue of the new york times praised the device for its 35 retail price saying its already a fine price for what this gadget does and it will seem better and better the more video apps are made to work with it pogue noted the limitations of the devices screen mirroring feature and said using only mobile devices as a remote control was not especially graceful but he called chromecast the smallest cheapest simplest way yet to add internet to your tv75 sales and impactedit in july 2014 google announced that in the devices first year on sale millions of units had sold and over
