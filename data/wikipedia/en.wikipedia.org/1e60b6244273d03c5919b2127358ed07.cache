artificial insemination icd9cm 6992 mesh d007315 edit on wikidata artificial insemination di is the deliberate introduction of into a females or for the purpose of achieving a pregnancy through in vivo fertilization by means other than sexual intercourse it is a fertility treatment for humans and is common practice in animal breeding including dairy cattle see frozen bovine semen and pigs artificial insemination may employ assisted reproductive technology sperm donation and animal husbandry techniques artificial insemination techniques available include intracervical insemination and intrauterine insemination the beneficiaries of artificial insemination are women who desire to give birth to their own child who may be in a lesbian relationship single women or women who are in a heterosexual relationship but with a male partner who suffers from male infertility intracervical insemination ici is the easiest and most common insemination technique and can be used in the home for selfinsemination without medical practitioner assistance1 compared with natural insemination ie insemination by sexual intercourse artificial insemination can be more expensive and more invasive and may require professional assistance there are laws in some countries which restrict and regulate who can donate sperm and who is able to receive artificial insemination and the consequences of such insemination some women who live in a jurisdiction which does not permit artificial insemination in the circumstance in which she finds herself may travel to another jurisdiction which permits it see

to conceive before artificial insemination is turned to as the solution doctors will require an examination of both the male and female involved in order to remove any and all physical hindrances that are preventing them from naturally achieving a pregnancy the couple is also given a fertility test to determine the motility number and viability of the males sperm and the success of the females ovulation from these tests the doctor may or may not recommend a form of artificial insemination the sperm used in artificial insemination may be provided by either the womans husband or partner partner sperm or by a known or anonymous sperm donor see sperm donation donor sperm if the procedure is successful the woman will conceive and carry a baby to term in the normal manner a pregnancy resulting from artificial insemination is no different from a pregnancy achieved by sexual intercourse in all cases the woman is the biological mother of any child produced by ai and the male whose sperm is used is the biological father there are multiple methods used to obtain the semen necessary for artificial insemination some methods require only men while others require a combination of a male and female those that require only men to obtain semen are masturbation a rectal massage involuntary pollution the collecting of nocturnal emission or the aspiration of sperm by means of a puncture of the testicle and epididymus methods of collecting semen that involve a combination of a male and female include interrupted intercourse intercourse with a collection condom or the post coital aspiration of the semen from the vagina there are a number of reasons why a woman would use artificial insemination to achieve pregnancy for example a womans immune system may be rejecting her partners sperm as invading molecules2 women who have issues with the cervix such as cervical scarring cervical blockage from endometriosis or thick cervical mucus may also benefit from artificial insemination since the sperm must pass through the cervix to result in fertilization donor sperm is increasingly used where a single woman without a male partner or a lesbian couple wish to have a biological child a couple where one person is transgender and no longer has gonads may also use donor sperm to become pregnant preparationsedit timing is critical as the window and opportunity for fertilization is little more than twelve hours from the release of the ovum to increase the chance of success the womans menstrual cycle is closely observed often using ovulation kits ultrasounds or blood tests such as basal body temperature tests over noting the color and texture of the vaginal mucus and the softness of the nose of her cervix to improve the success rate of ai drugs to create a stimulated cycle may be used but the use of such drugs also results in an increased chance of a multiple birth sperm can be provided fresh or washed3 the washing of sperm increases the chances of fertilization pre and postconcentration of motile sperm is counted sperm from a sperm bank will be frozen and quarantined for a period and the donor will be tested before and after production of the sample to ensure that he does not carry a transmissible disease for fresh shipping a semen extender is used if sperm is provided by a private donor either directly or through a sperm agency it is usually supplied fresh not frozen and it will not be quarantined donor sperm provided in this way may be given directly to the recipient woman or her partner or it may be transported in specially insulated containers some donors have their own freezing apparatus to freeze and store their sperm techniquesedit the human female reproductive system the cervix is part of the uterus the cervical canal connects the interiors of the uterus and vagina semen used is used either fresh raw or frozen where donor sperm is supplied by a sperm bank it will always be quarantined and frozen and will need to be thawed before use when an ovum is released semen is introduced into the womans vagina uterus or cervix depending on the method being used sperm is occasionally inserted twice within a treatment cycle intracervical inseminationedit intracervical insemination ici involves injection of unwashed or raw semen into the cervix with a needleless syringe sperm supplied by a sperm bank will be frozen and must be allowed to thaw before insemination the sealed end of the straw itself must be cut off and the open end of the straw is usually fixed straight on to the tip of the syringe allowing the contents to be drawn into the syringe sperm from more than one straw can generally be used in the same syringe where fresh semen is used this must be allowed to liquefy before inserting it into the syringe or alternatively the syringe may be backloaded after the syringe has been filled with semen any enclosed air must be removed by gently pressing the plunger forward the woman lies on her back and the syringe is then inserted into the vagina care is optimal when inserting the syringe so that the tip is as close to the entrance to the cervix as possible a vaginal speculum may be used to hold open the vagina so that the cervix may be observed and the syringe inserted more accurately through the open speculum the plunger is then slowly pushed forward and the semen in the syringe is emptied deep into the vagina the syringe and speculum if used may be left in place for several minutes before removal and the woman is advised to lie still for about halfanhour to improve the success rate ordinary sexual lubricants should not be used in the process but special fertility or sperm friendly lubricants can be used for increased ease and comfort ici is painless and is the easiest and most common insemination technique the process closely replicates the ejaculation of sperm by the penis during sexual intercourse with fresh semen being directly deposited onto the neck of the cervix it is the simplest artificial insemination method and unwashed or raw semen is normally used but semen supplied by a sperm bank which has been prepared for iui use may also be used the procedure is commonly used in home selfinsemination and practitioner insemination procedures and for insemination where semen is provided by private donors when performed at home without the presence of a professional this procedure is sometimes referred to as intravaginal insemination ivi1 a conception cap which is a form of conception device may be inserted into the vagina following insemination and may be left in place for several hours using this method a woman may go about her usual activities while the cervical cap holds the semen in the vagina close to the entrance to the cervix advocates of this method claim that it increases the chances of conception one advantage with the conception device is that fresh nonliquefied semen may be used the partner or donor may ejaculate straight into the cap and this can be immediately inserted into the vagina other methods may be used to insert semen into the vagina notably involving different uses of a conception cap this may for example be inserted filled with sperm which does not have to be liquefied the male may therefore ejaculate straight into the cap alternatively a specially designed conception cap with a tube attached may be inserted empty into the vagina after which liquefied semen is poured into the tube these methods are designed to ensure that donor or partner semen is inseminated as close as possible to the cervix and that it is kept in place there to increase the chances of conception intrauterine inseminationedit intrauterine insemination iui involves injection of washed sperm into the uterus with a catheter if unwashed semen is used it may elicit uterine cramping expelling the semen and causing pain due to content of prostaglandins prostaglandins are also the compounds responsible for causing the myometrium to contract and expel the menses from the uterus during menstruation resting on the table for fifteen minutes after an iui is optimal for the woman to increase the pregnancy rate4 unlike ici intrauterine insemination normally requires a medical practitioner to perform the procedure a female under 30 years of age has optimal chances with iui for the man a tms of more than 5 million per ml is optimal5 in practice donor sperm will satisfy these criteria a promising cycle is one that offers two follicles measuring more than 16 mm and estrogen of more than 500 pgml on the day of hcg administration5 a short period of ejaculatory abstinence before intrauterine insemination is associated with higher pregnancy rates6 however gnrh agonist administration at the time of implantation does not improve pregnancy outcome in intrauterine insemination cycles according to a randomized controlled trial7 iui is a more efficient method of artificial insemination than ici and because of its generally higher success rate is usually the insemination procedure of choice for single women and lesbians using donor sperm in a fertility centre iui can be used in conjunction with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation coh still advanced maternal age causes decreased success rates women aged 38–39 years appear to have reasonable success during the first two cycles of ovarian hyperstimulation and iui however for women aged over 40 years there appears to be no benefit after a single cycle of cohiui8 medical experts therefore recommend considering in vitro fertilization after one failed cohiui cycle for women aged over 40 years8 a double intrauterine insemination theoretically increases pregnancy rates by decreasing the risk of missing the fertile window during ovulation however a randomized trial of insemination after ovarian hyperstimulation found no difference in live birth rate between single and double intrauterine insemination9 intrauterine tuboperitoneal inseminationedit intrauterine tuboperitoneal insemination iutpi involves injection of washed sperm into both the uterus and fallopian tubes the cervix is then clamped to prevent leakage to the vagina best achieved with a specially designed double nut bivalve dnb speculum the sperm is mixed to create a volume of 10 ml sufficient to fill the uterine cavity pass through the interstitial part of the tubes and the ampulla finally reaching the peritoneal cavity and the pouch of douglas where it would be mixed with the peritoneal and follicular fluid iutpi can be useful in unexplained infertility mild or moderate male infertility and mild or moderate endometriosis10 in nontubal sub fertility fallopian tube sperm perfusion may be the preferred technique over intrauterine insemination11 intratubal inseminationedit intratubal insemination iti involves injection of washed sperm into the fallopian tube although this procedure is no longer generally regarded as having any beneficial effect compared with iui12 iti however should not be confused with gamete intrafallopian transfer where both eggs and sperm are mixed outside the womans body and then immediately inserted into the fallopian tube where fertilization takes place pregnancy rateedit approximate pregnancy rate as a function of total sperm count may be twice as large as total motile sperm count values are for intrauterine insemination old data rates are likely higher todaycitation needed main article pregnancy rate the pregnancy or success rates for artificial insemination are 10 to 15 per menstrual cycle using ici13 and 15–20 per cycle for iui13unreliable source in iui about 60 to 70 have achieved pregnancy after 6 cycles14 however these pregnancy rates may be very misleading since many factors including the age and health of the recipient have to be included to give a meaningful answer eg definition of success and calculation of the total population15 for couples with unexplained infertility unstimulated iui is no more effective than natural means of conception1617 the pregnancy rate also depends on the total sperm count or more specifically the total motile sperm count tmsc used in a cycle the success rate increases with increasing tmsc but only up to a certain count when other factors become limiting to success the summed pregnancy rate of two cycles using a tmsc of 5 million may be a tsc of 10 million on graph in each cycle is substantially higher than one single cycle using a tmsc of 10 million however although more costefficient using a lower tmsc also increases the average time taken to achieve pregnant women whose age is becoming a major factor in fertility may not want to spend that extra time samples per childedit the number of samples ejaculates required to give rise to a child varies substantially from person to person as well as from clinic to clinic however the following equations generalize the main factors involved for intracervical insemination n v s × c × r s n r displaystyle nfrac vstimes ctimes rsnr n is how many children a single sample can give rise to vs is the volume of a sample ejaculate usually between 10 ml and 65 ml18 c is the concentration of motile

inseminate an anesthetized woman the woman was not informed about the procedure unlike her infertile husband the case was reported 25 years later in a medical journal21 the sperm bank was developed in iowa starting in the 1920s in research conducted by university of iowa medical school researchers jerome sherman and raymond bunge22 in the 1980s direct intraperitoneal insemination dipi was occasionally used where doctors injected sperm into the lower abdomen through a surgical hole or incision with the intention of letting them find the oocyte at the ovary or after entering the genital tract through the ostium of the fallopian tube2324 social implicationsedit one of the key issues arising from the rise of dependency on assisted reproductive technology arts is the pressure placed on couples to conceive where children are highly desired parenthood is culturally mandatory and childlessness socially unacceptable25 the medicalization of infertility creates a framework in which individuals are encouraged to think of infertility quite negatively in many cultures especially those with large muslim populations donor insemination is religiously and culturally prohibited often meaning that less accessible high tech and expensive arts like ivf are the only solution an overreliance on reproductive technologies in dealing with infertility prevents many – especially for example in the infertility belt of central and southern africa – from dealing with many of the key causes of infertility treatable by artificial insemination techniques namely preventable infections dietary and lifestyle influences25 morality in christianityedit an anglican writer says that to achieve union but not children by means of contraceptives and to achieve children but not union by means of artificial insemination are both equally wrong26 heterosexual intercourse is viewed by the catholic church as an act meant to be experienced only by married couples it is viewed as a physical representation of the spiritual unity of marriage between a husband and wife according to the catechism of the catholic church artificial insemination dissociates the sexual act from the procreative act the act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by two persons giving themselves to one another but one that entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person such a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children27 legal restrictionsedit some countries restrict artificial insemination in a variety of ways for example some countries do not permit ai for single women and some muslim countries do not permit the use of donor sperm as of may 2013 the following european countries permit medically assisted ai for single women armenia28 belarus28 belgium28 bulgaria28 cyprus28 denmark28 estonia28 finland28 germany28 greece28 hungary28 iceland28 ireland28 latvia28 macedonia28 moldova28 montenegro28 netherlands28 romania28 russia28 spain28 ukraine28 united kingdom28 in livestock and petsedit a man performing artificial insemination of a cow a breeding mount with builtin artificial vagina used in semen collection from horses for use in artificial insemination the first viviparous to be artificially fertilized was a dog the experiment was conducted with success by the italian lazzaro spallanzani in 1780 an important pioneer in artificial insemination was also the russian ilya ivanov since 1899 in 1935 suffolk sheep diluted semen was sent from cambridge by plane to krakoiv poland and international research joint prawochenki from poland milovanoff from ussr hammond from cambridge walton from scotland and thomasset from uruguay artificial insemination is used in many nonhuman animals including sheep horses cattle pigs dogs pedigree animals generally zoo animals turkeys and even honeybees it may be used for many reasons including to allow a male to inseminate a much larger number of females to allow use of genetic material from males separated by distance or time to overcome physical breeding difficulties to control the paternity of offspring to synchronise births to avoid injury incurred during natural mating and to avoid the need to keep a male at all such as for small numbers of females or in species whose fertile males may be difficult to manage ia tools brought from the ussr by luis thomasset in 1935 to work at cambridge laboratories and south america semen is collected extended then cooled or frozen it can be used on site or shipped to the females location if frozen the small plastic tube holding the semen is referred to as a straw to allow the sperm to remain viable during the time before and after it is frozen the semen is mixed with a solution containing glycerol or other cryoprotectants an extender is a solution that allows the semen from a donor to impregnate more females by making insemination possible with fewer sperm antibiotics such as streptomycin are sometimes added to the sperm to control some bacterial venereal diseases before the actual insemination estrus may be induced through the use of progestogen and another hormone usually pmsg or prostaglandin f2α artificial insemination of farm animals is very common in todays agriculture industry in the developed world especially for breeding dairy cattle 75 of all inseminations swine are also bred using this method up to 85 of all inseminations it provides an economical means for a livestock breeder to improve their herds utilizing males having very desirable traits although common with cattle and swine ai is not as widely practised in the breeding of horses a small number of equine associations in north america accept only horses that have been conceived by natural cover or natural service – the actual physical mating of a mare to a stallion – the jockey club being the most notable of these as no ai is allowed in thoroughbred breeding29 other registries such as the aqha and warmblood registries allow registration of foals created through ai and the process is widely used allowing the breeding of mares to stallions not resident at the same facility – or even in the same country – through the use of transported frozen or cooled semen in modern species conservation semen collection and artificial insemination is used also in birds in 2013 scientist of the justusliebiguniversity of giessen germany from the working group of michael lierz clinic for birds reptiles amphibians and fish developed a novel technique for semen collection and artificial insemination in parrots producing the worlds first macaw by assisted reproduction30 modern artificial insemination was pioneered by john o almquist of the pennsylvania state university his improvement of breeding efficiency by the use of antibiotics first proven with penicillin in 1946 to control bacterial growth decreasing embrionic mortality and increase fertility and various new techniques for processing freezing and thawing of frozen semen significantly enhanced the practical utilization of ai in the livestock industry and earned him the 31 1981 wolf foundation prize in agriculture many techniques developed by him have since been applied to other
