in 1996 though the old address also remained active for some time afterwards bbc online and beebcomedit bbc website as it appeared in 1997 the bbc director general john birt sought government approval to direct licence fee revenue into the service describing planned bbc internet services as the “third medium” joining the bbcs existing tv and radio networks achieving a change in the bbc charter this led to the official launch of bbc online at the wwwbbccouk address in december 1997 as well as the licence fee funded wwwbbccouk bbc worldwide launched the commercially funded beebcom featuring mostly entertainment focused content with sites including radio times top gear and top of the pops later bbc online launched licence fee funded web sites for top of the pops and top gear resulting in some duplication beebcom was later refocussed as an online shopping guide11 and was closed in 200212 beebcom now redirects to the bbc shop website run by bbc worldwide in 1999 the bbc bought the wwwbbccom domain name for 375000 previously owned by boston business computing13 but the price of this purchase was not revealed until 6 years later14 as of 2005 wwwbbcncorguk no longer exists bbciedit bbci website navbar 2004 in 2001 bbc online was rebranded as bbci the website launched on 7 november 2001 the bbci name was conceived as an umbrella brand for all the bbcs digital interactive services across web digital teletext interactive tv and on mobile platforms1516 the use of letter i prefixes and suffixes to denote information technology or interactivity was very much in vogue at this time according to the bbc the i in bbci stood for interactivity as well as innovation17 as part of the rebrand bbc website pages all displayed a standard navigation bar across the top of the screen offering a categorybased navigation categories tv radio communicate where i live az index and a search18 the navbar was designed to offer a similar navigation system to the ibar on bbci interactive television bbccouk and the return of bbc onlineedit the bbc homepage in march 2010 after three years of consistent use across different platforms the bbc began to drop the bbci brand gradually on 6 may 2004 the bbc website was renamed bbccouk after the main url used to access the site19 interactive tv services continued under the bbci brand until it was dropped completely in 2008 the bbcs online video player the iplayer has however retained an iprefix in its branding on 14 december 2007 a beta version of a new bbccouk homepage was launched with the ability to customise the page by adding removing and rearranging different categories such as news weather and entertainment the widgetbased design was inspired by sites such as facebook and igoogle and allowed the bbc to add new content to the homepage while still retaining users customisations20 the new homepage also incorporated the clock design used in the 1970s on the bbcs television service into the large header and a box containing featured content of the website the new bbc homepage left beta on wednesday 27 february 2008 to serve as the new bbc homepage under the same url as the previous version on 30 january 2010 a new webpage design became available as a beta version21 that by may 2010 replaced the old homepage this homepage expanded on the modules idea and the customisation theme the website allowed certain themes that interested the viewer to be tracked via a new module it also included a new media zone where featured content could be displayed with this new featured box being located across the entire top of the webpage below the header the media zone was also changed so that the content changed by running the mouse over the tabs the header was again changed to include the headings of the major sections of the website these being home news sport weather iplayer tv radio and more spread out evenly across the header this new header was included across the entire website despite the cosmetic appearance of the relaunch the new website was actually relaunched using a completely different operating system allowing the sites four different international versions to be changed and altered easier it also brought their website layouts and operations closer to that of the main website following the launch of the new bbc news website which altered the header bar on that site in october 2010 the new style of header was launched across the whole website starting off with some of the larger yet not obvious sites such as doctor who first before relaunching all of the sites including the homepage with the new look this new style of header included the headings as before but with the search box redesigned and aligned right as with the links which are significantly smaller other links such as bbc id login and mobile versions of the website also appear on the header just to the right of the smaller bbc logo the bbc online homepage in 2011 on 21 september 2011 a new bbc homepage went into beta testing that was drastically different from those before it the new homepage was based on feedback that stated that the current page was too narrow in focus and not distinctive enough with the homepage not displaying the full extend of the bbc online site and that some didnt realise it was the homepage as a result they launched a new version that featured as a centrepiece a revolving carousel of content on the bbc online website with filters beneath to restrict it to and to show more of entertainment lifestyle knowledge and news and sports topics at the top of the page a new header has been inserted giving the date the time through the use of the vintage bbc clock as well as weather prospects for the next three days through the use of the traditional weather symbols below the carousel boxes contain links to the most popular video material web articles and pages on the site as well as tv and radio listings alongside an az list of the bbcs top level domains22 this new site replaced the previous one on 30 november 2011 in a blog post23 from the same day james thornett explained the changes – while the post attracted complaints from users disliking the refreshed layout the newlook site was critically acclaimed and nominated by the design museum as one of their designs of the year in 201224 it also won a peabody award in 2011 because it continued expanded and enhanced one of the greatest traditions in electronic media25 contentedit bbc online contains a variety of content ranging from news sport music science technology and entertainment amongst other

exploit bbc brands commercially have had several attempts at launching services online including beebcom in the late 1990s in 2006 the bbc began making controversial plans to raise revenue by including advertising on the international version of bbc news online accessed from outside the united kingdom47 bbc online is currently freely available worldwide via various urls including bbccomnews but planned video services and a lower than expected licence fee settlement paid for by uk residents only led to the bbc introducing banner advertisements to the site from november 200748 the bbc trust approved the plans for introducing advertisements which also involved creating bbccom as a part of bbc worldwide49 sir michael lyons chairman of the trust confirmed the bbc would not charge for online news following news internationals planned introduction of charges for online content50 prior to this there had been criticism from some as web users outside the uk could use the

such criticisms the bbc negotiated a deal with realnetworks a cutdown version of realplayer which did not contain as much advertising and marketing windows media has also been adopted and since autumn 2006 a windows media stream of all national bbc radio stations has been available more recently the bbc has been experimenting with mp3 downloads and podcasting facilities for an increasing number of

doubleclick media mind specific media yahoo network plus vulnerabilitiesedit in march 2007 a vulnerability was exposed in the bbcs most emailed and most read news sections which could allow for the popularity of a news article to be exaggerated and thus highlight it to other website visitors55 graf reportedit in early 2004 the site was made the focus of a government review launched by the department for culture media and sport led by philip graf sections of the uk internet industry had argued that the bbc site offered things that were available in the commercial sector creating unnecessary competition the review was published in july 2004 and it was recommended that the bbc prioritise news current affairs education and information which is of value to the citizen in response the bbc also shut down a small number of sections of the site including the soaps section in november 2004 the governors of the bbc announced a newer much more tightly drawn remit for bbccouk as part of their response to the review they also announced as graf had recommended a new approach towards external providers which will see bbccouk aiming to spend at least 25 of its eligible budget on content and services through independent commissions by the end of 200607 the implementation of the graf report has seen the popular message boards in the bbc sport section shut down as the bbc tries
