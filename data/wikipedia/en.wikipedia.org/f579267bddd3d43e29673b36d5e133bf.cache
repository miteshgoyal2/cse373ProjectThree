charted song get it together followed by their hit dancing machine their first to crack the top ten since sugar daddy nearly three years before despite those successes most of the jackson 5s followups were not as successful and by 1973 joe jackson had grown tired of motowns uneasiness to continue producing hits for the brothers jackson began producing a nightclub act around his sons and daughters first starting in las vegas and spreading throughout the states by 1975 most of the jacksons opted out of recording any more music for motown desiring creative control and royalties learning that they were earning only 28 of royalties from motown joe jackson began negotiating to have his boys sign a lucrative contract with another company settling for epic records which had offered a royalty rate of 20 per record signing with the company in june 1975 absent from the deal was jermaine jackson who decided to stay in motown followed by his marriage to berrys daughter hazel randy jackson formally
