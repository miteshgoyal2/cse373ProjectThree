1980s though by the late 1980s both had reverted to calling themselves simply fayed7 some have assumed that fayeds addition of al to his name was to imply aristocratic origins like de or von in french and german even though al does not have the same connotations in arabic8 this assumption led to private eye nicknaming him the phoney pharaoh9 united kingdomedit early business dealingsedit fayed and his brothers founded a shipping company in egypt before moving its headquarters to genoa italy with additional offices in london around 1964 fayed entered a close relationship with haitian leader françois duvalier known as papa doc duvalier and became interested in the construction of a fayedduvalier oil refinery in haiti he also associated with the geologist george de mohrenschildt fayed

london store harrods from roland tiny rowland the head of lonrho in 1985 he and his brothers bought the remaining 70 percent of house of fraser for £615m rowland claimed the fayed brothers had lied about their background and wealth and put pressure on the government to investigate them a department of trade and industry dti inquiry into the fayeds was launched the dtis subsequent report was critical but no action was taken against the fayeds and while many believed the contents of the report others felt it was politically motivated12 in 1998 rowland accused fayed of stealing papers and jewels from his harrods safe deposit box fayed was arrested but the charges were dropped13 rowland died in 1998 fayed settled the dispute with a payment to his widow he also sued the metropolitan

again in 2002 al fayed unsuccessfully applied for british citizenship twice – once in 1994 and once in 19991516 it was suggested that the feud with rowland contributed to fayeds being refused british citizenship the first time17 cashforquestionsedit in 1994 in what became known as the cashforquestions affair fayed revealed the names of mps he had paid to ask questions in parliament on his behalf but who had failed to declare their fees it saw the conservative mps neil hamilton and tim smith leave the government in disgrace and a committee on standards in public life established to prevent such corruption occurring again fayed also revealed that the cabinet minister jonathan aitken had stayed for free at the ritz hotel in paris at the same time as a group of saudi arms dealers leading to aitkens subsequent unsuccessful libel case and imprisonment for perjury18 during this period from 1988 to february 1998 alfayeds spokesman was michael cole a former bbc journalist19 although coles pr work for alfayed did not cease in 1998 hamilton lost a subsequent libel action against alfayed in december 199920 and a subsequent appeal against the verdict in december 200021 the former mp has always denied that he was paid by alfayed for asking questions in parliament hamiltons libel action related to a channel 4 dispatches documentary broadcast on 16 january 199722 in which alfayed made claims that the mp had received up to £110000 in cash and received other gratuities for asking parliamentary questions23 hamiltons basis for his appeal was that the original verdict was invalid because alfayed had paid £10000 for documents stolen from the dustbins of hamiltons legal representatives by benjamin pell24 also known as benjy the binman in 2003 fayed moved from surrey uk to switzerland alleging a breach in an agreement with inland revenue in 2005 he moved back to britain saying that he regards britain as home17 he moored a yacht in monaco called the sokar prior to

tutankhamen fled her family and landed in scotland bringing with her the stone of scone according to the chronicle scotland was later named in her honour the tale is disputed by modern historians29 alfayed later declared that the scots are originally egyptians and thats the truth30 in 2009 alfayed revealed that he was a supporter of scottish independence from the united kingdom announcing to the

former senior detective at scotland yard and alfayeds investigator for five years from 1997 was forced to admit on 14 february 2008 that he had no evidence to suggest foul play except for the assertions alfayed had made to him59 his admissions also related to the lack of evidence for alfayeds claims about the alleged pregnancy of the princess and the couples supposed engagement59 the jury verdict given on 7 april 2008 was that diana and dodi had been unlawfully killed through the grossly negligent driving of chauffeur henri paul60 who was intoxicated and the pursuing vehicles61 lawyers for alfayed also accepted that there was no evidence to support the assertion that diana was illegally embalmed in order to cover up a pregnancy a pregnancy which they accepted could not be established by any medical evidence58 they also accepted that there was no evidence to support the assertion the french emergency and medical services had played any role in a conspiracy to harm diana58 following the baker inquest alfayed said that he was abandoning his campaign to prove that diana and dodi were murdered in a conspiracy and said that he would accept the verdict of the jury62
