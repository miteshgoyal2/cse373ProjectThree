smile1 while attending ealing art college tim staffell became friends with farrokh bulsara a fellow student who had assumed the english name of freddie bulsara felt that he and the band had the same tastes and soon became a keen fan of smile in 1970 after staffell left to join the band humpy bong the remaining smile members encouraged by bulsara changed their name to queen and performed their first gig on 18 july2 the band had a number of bass players during this period who did not fit with the bands chemistry it was not until february 1971 that they settled on john deacon and began to rehearse for their first album they recorded four of their own songs liar keep yourself alive the night comes down and jesus for a demo tape no record companies were interested3 it was also around this time freddie changed his surname to mercury inspired by the line mother mercury look what theyve done to me in the song my fairy king4 on 2 july 1971 queen played their first show in the classic lineup of mercury may taylor and deacon at a surrey college outside london5 having attended art college mercury also designed queens logo called the queen crest shortly before the release of the bands first album6 the logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members two lions for leo deacon and taylor a crab for cancer may and two fairies for virgo mercury6 the lions embrace a stylised letter q the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion6 there is also a crown inside the q and the whole logo is overshadowed by an enormous phoenix the whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the royal coat of arms of the united kingdom particularly with the lion supporters6 the original logo as found on the reverseside of the cover of the bands first album was a simple line drawing later sleeves bore more intricatecoloured versions of the logo67 roy thomas baker produced queens first four albums as well as jazz in 1972

productions a subsidiary of trident to manage the band and enable them to use the facilities at trident to record new material whilst the management searched for a record label to sign queen this suited both parties as trident were expanding into management and under the deal queen were able to make use of the hitech recording facilities used by other musicians such as the beatles and elton john to produce new material8 in 1973 queen signed to a deal with tridentemi by july of that year they released their eponymous debut album an effort influenced by heavy metal and progressive rock9

said to have been written by mercury about norman sheffield and the former management at trident who helped make the video so popular because the band was broke despite the success of the previous

albums featured a distinctive no synthesisers sleeve note the note is widely assumed to reflect an antisynth prohardrock stance by the band76 but was later revealed by producer roy thomas baker to be

took place in montreal and the concert is recorded in the live album queen rock montreal85 it was very excessive the style of life i think the excess leaked out from the music into life and became a need queen was a wonderful vehicle and a wonderful magical combination but i think it came close to destroying us all we were the biggest thing in the world for a moment in time and everything that goes with that really messes up your mind somehow weve all suffered freddie obviously went completely awol which is why he got that terrible disease he was utterly out of control for a while in a way all of us were out of control and it screwed us up —brian may on the most turbulent period in the band during the early 1980s86 queen worked with david bowie on the single under pressure the firsttime collaboration with another artist was spontaneous as bowie happened to drop by the studio while queen were recording87 upon its release the song was extremely successful reaching number one in the uk

trademark seventies sound this time being a mixture of rock pop rock dance funk and rb93 most of the album was recorded in munich during the most turbulent period in the bands history and taylor and may lamented the new sound with both being very critical of the influence mercurys personal manager paul prenter had on the singer94 may was also scathing of prenter who was mercurys manager from the early 1980s to 1984 for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations such as the us networks and their vital connection between the artist and the community and for denying them access to mercury95 q magazine would list hot space as one of the top fifteen albums where great rock acts lost the plot96 on 14 and 15 september 1982 the band performed their last two gigs in the us with mercury on lead vocals those concerts were held at the forum in inglewood california97 the band stopped touring north america after their hot space tour as their success there had waned although they

album the works which included the successful singles radio ga ga hammer to fall and i want to break free101102 despite these hit singles the album failed to do well in the us while in the uk it went triple platinum and remained in the albums chart for two years103 that year queen began the works tour the first tour to feature keyboardist spike edney as an extra live musician the tour featured nine soldout dates in october in bophuthatswana south africa at the arena in sun city104105 upon returning to england they were the subject of outrage having played in south africa during the height of apartheid and in violation of worldwide divestment efforts and a united nations cultural boycott the band responded to the critics by stating that they were playing music for fans in south africa and they also stressed that the concerts were played before integrated audiences106 queen donated to a school for the deaf and blind as a philanthropic gesture but were fined by the british musicians

1985 in front of the biggestever tv audience of 19 billion queen performed some of their greatest hits during which the soldout stadium audience of 72000 people clapped sang and swayed in unison113114 the shows organisers bob geldof and midge ure other musicians such as elton john cliff richard and dave grohl and music journalists writing for the bbc cnn rolling stone mtv the telegraph among others

be known as the note heard round the world120 when interviewed for mojo magazine the band said the most amazing sight at live aid was to see the audience clapping to radio ga ga brian may stated id never seen anything like that in my life and it wasnt calculated either we understood our audience and played to them but that was one of those weird accidents because of the music video i remember thinking oh great theyve picked it up and then i thought this is not a queen audience this is a general audience whove bought tickets before they even knew we were on the bill and they all did it how did they know nobody told them to do it121 the band now revitalised by the response to live aid – a shot in the arm roger taylor called it121 — and the ensuing increase in record sales ended 1985 by releasing the single one vision which was the third time after stone cold crazy and under pressure with david bowie that all four bandmembers received a writing credit for the one song122123 also a limitededition boxed set containing all queen albums to date was released under the title of the complete works the package included previously unreleased material most notably queens nonalbum single

with freddie mercury128129 a soldout tour in support of a kind of magic once again they hired spike edney130131 the magic tours highlight was at wembley stadium in london and resulted in the live double album queen at wembley released on cd and as a live concert vhsdvd which has gone five times platinum in the us and four times platinum in the uk14132 queen could not book wembley for a third night but they did play at knebworth park the show sold out within two hours and over 120000 fans packed the park for what was queens final live performance with mercury133 queen began the tour at the

band released the miracle in 1989 the album continued the direction of a kind of magic using a poprock sound mixed with a few heavy numbers it spawned the european hits i want it all breakthru the invisible man scandal and the miracle136 the miracle also began a change in direction of queens songwriting philosophy since the bands beginning nearly all songs had been written by and credited to a single member with other members adding minimally with the miracle the bands songwriting became more collaborative and they vowed to credit the final product only to queen as a group137 1988–1992 mercury illness death and tribute there was all that time when we knew freddie was on the way out we kept our heads down —brian may138 after fans noticed mercurys increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988 the media reported that mercury was seriously ill with aids frequently being mentioned as a likely illness mercury flatly denied this insisting he was merely exhausted and too busy to provide interviews he was now 42 years old and had been heavily involved in music for nearly two decades139 mercury had in fact been diagnosed as being hiv positive during 1987 but did not make his illness public and denied that anything was wrong in spite of mercurys illness the band decided to continue making albums starting with the miracle released in the summer of 1989 and continuing with innuendo released at the beginning of 1991 despite his deteriorating health the lead singer continued to contribute for the last two albums made while mercury was still alive the band credited all songs to queen rather than specific members of the group freeing them of internal conflict and differences in 1990 queen ended their contract with capitol and signed with disneys hollywood records which has since remained the groups music catalogue owner in the united states and canada140141 in february that year mercury made his final public appearance when he joined the rest of queen to collect the brit award for outstanding contribution to british music throughout 1990 media reports persisted that mercury was seriously ill but the singer continued to deny that these reports were true142143 innuendo was released in early 1991 with an eponymous number 1 uk hit and other charting singles released later in the year which included the show must go on this song released as a forerunner to greatest hits ii in october 1991 featured archive footage of queens performances between 1981 and 1989 and along with the manner of its lyrics this continued to fuel the media reports that mercury was dying although this was still officially denied144145 mercury was increasingly ill and could barely walk when the band recorded the show must go on in 1990 because of this may had concerns about whether he was physically capable of singing it146 recalling mercurys successful performance may states he went in and killed it completely lacerated that vocal146 the rest of the band were ready to record when mercury felt able to come into the studio for an hour or two at a time may says of mercury he just kept saying write me more write me stuff i want to just sing this and do it and when i am gone you can finish it off’ he had no fear really125 the bands second greatest hits compilation greatest hits ii followed in october 1991 which is the eighth bestselling album of all time in the uk

faith of his family152153 bohemian rhapsody was rereleased as a single shortly after mercurys death with these are the days of our lives as the double aside the music video for these are the days of our lives contains mercurys final scenes in front of the camera this track had featured at the beginning of the year on the innuendo album and the video for it was recorded in may 1991 which proved to be mercurys final work with queen it had already been released as a single in the us in september that year154 the single went to number one in the uk remaining there for five weeks – the only recording to top the christmas chart twice and the only one to be number one in four different years 1975 1976 1991 and 1992155 initial proceeds from the single – approximately £1000000 – were donated
