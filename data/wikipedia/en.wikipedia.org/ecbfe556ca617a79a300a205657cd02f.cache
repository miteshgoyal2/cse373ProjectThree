student parents jeanne elaine hale mother hubert wayne white father website ryanwhitecom ryan wayne white december 6 1971 – april 8 19901 was an american teenager from kokomo indiana who became a national poster child for hivaids in the united states after failing to be readmitted to school following an aids diagnosis as a hemophiliac he became infected with hiv from a contaminated blood treatment factor viii and when diagnosed in december 1984 was given six months to live doctors said he posed no risk to other students but aids was poorly understood by the general public at the time when ryan tried to return to school many parents and teachers in howard county rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer a lengthy administrative appeal process ensued and news of the conflict turned ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for aids research and public education surprising his doctors ryan white lived five years longer than predicted but died in april 1990 one month before his high school graduation before ryan white aids was a disease stigmatized as an illness impacting the gay community because it was first diagnosed among gay men that perception shifted as ryan and other prominent hivinfected people such as magic johnson arthur ashe and the ray brothers appeared in the media to advocate for more aids research and public education to address the epidemic the us congress passed a major piece of aids legislation the ryan white care act shortly after whites death the act has been reauthorized

blood coagulation disorder associated with the x chromosome which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding for treatment he received weekly infusions of factor viii a blood product created from pooled plasma of nonhemophiliacs an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time4 healthy for most of his childhood he became extremely ill with pneumonia in december 1984 on december 17 1984 during a lung biopsy ryan was diagnosed with aids by this time the scientific community had studied the epidemic in great detail earlier that year that htlviii was identified and isolated by american research scientists confirming the work done by french research scientists who called it lav a lengthy public battle to determine who should be recognized as the discover of the human retro virus delayed development of a test for what would later be called hiv ryan had apparently received a contaminated treatment of factor viii that was infected with hiv as did thousands of other americans with hemophilia and hemophiliacs around the world at that time because the retrovirus that causes aids had been recently identified much of the pooled factor viii concentrate was tainted blood banks and pharmaceuticals dismissed calls by the cdc to use a hepatitis b test as a surrogate until a hiv test could be developed late plasma products were screen and heat treated to deactivate both hiv and hepatitis among hemophiliacs treated with bloodclotting factors between 1979 and 1984 nearly 90 became infected with hiv andor hepatitis c4 at the time of his diagnosis his tcell count had dropped to 25 a healthy individual without hiv will have around 500–1200 doctors predicted ryan white had only six months to live3 after the diagnosis ryan white was too ill to return to school but by early 1985 he began to feel better his mother asked if he could return to school but was told by school officials that he could not on june 30 1985 a formal request to permit

to school17 july 18 indiana court of appeals declines to hear any further appeals18 western middle school in russiaville faced enormous pressure from many parents and faculty to deny white from the campus after his diagnosis became widely known in the school of 360 total students 117 parents and 50 teachers signed a petition encouraging school leaders to ban ryan from school due to the widespread fear and ignorance of aids the principal and later the school board succumbed to this pressure and prohibited readmittance the white family filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision the whites initially filed suit in the us district court in indianapolis the court however declined to hear the case until administrative appeals had been resolved19 on november 25 an indiana department of education officer ruled that the school must follow the indiana board of health guidelines and that ryan white must be allowed to attend school20 the means of transmission of hiv had not yet been fully resolved by the mid to late 80s scientists knew it spread via blood and was not transmittable by any sort of casual contact but as recently as 1983 the american medical association had thought that evidence suggests household contact may transmit aids and the belief that the disease could easily spread persisted21 children with aids were still rare at the time of ryan whites rejection from school the centers for disease control knew of only 148 cases of pediatric aids in the united states6 many families in kokomo believed his presence posed an unacceptable risk22 when ryan was permitted to return to school for one day in february 1986 151 of 360 students stayed home he also worked as a paperboy and many of the people on his route canceled their subscriptions believing that hiv could be transmitted through newsprint5 the indiana state health commissioner dr woodrow myers who had extensive experience treating aids patients in san francisco and the centers for disease control both notified the board that ryan posed no risk to other students but the school board and many parents ignored their statements5 in february 1986 the new england journal of medicine published a study of 101 people who had spent three months living in close but nonsexual contact with people with aids the study concluded that the risk of infection was minimal to nonexistent even when contact included sharing toothbrushes razors clothing combs and drinking glasses sleeping in the same bed and hugging and kissing23 when ryan was finally readmitted in april a group of families withdrew their children and started an alternative school24 threats of violence and lawsuits persisted according to ryans mother people on the street would often yell we know youre queer at ryan22 the editors and publishers of the kokomo tribune which supported ryan both editorially and financially were also ridiculed by members of the community and threatened with death for their actions22 ryan white attended western middle school for eighth grade for the entire 1986–87 school year but was deeply unhappy and had few friends the school required him to eat with disposable utensils use separate bathrooms and waived his requirement to enroll in a gym class25 threats continued when a bullet was fired through the whites living room window no one was home at the time the family decided to leave kokomo3 after finishing the school year his family moved to cicero indiana where the school district required him to enroll at hamilton heights high school located in arcadia indiana on august 31 1987 a very nervous ryan white was greeted by school principal tony cook school system superintendent bob g carnal and a handful of students who had been educated about aids and were unafraid to shake ryans hand26 national spokesmanedit the publicity of ryan whites story catapulted him into the national spotlight amidst a growing wave of aids coverage in the news media between 1985 and 1987 the number of news stories about aids in the american media doubled27 while isolated in middle school white appeared frequently on national television and in newspapers to discuss his tribulations with the disease eventually he became known as a poster child for the aids crisis appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome ryan participated in

conditions3 for the rest of his life he appeared frequently on phil donahues talk show his celebrity crush alyssa milano of the thenpopular tv show whos the boss met ryan and gave him a friendship bracelet and a kiss3 elton john loaned jeanne white 16500 to put toward a down payment on the cicero home and rather than accept repayment placed the repaid money into a college fund for ryans sister28 in high school white drove a red 1988 ford mustang gt a gift from michael jackson29 despite the fame and donations ryan white stated that he disliked the public spotlight loathed remarks that seemingly blamed his mother or his upbringing for his illness and emphasized that he would be willing at any moment to trade his fame for freedom from the disease29 wikisource has the speech ryan gave before the commission whites speech in 1988 ryan white spoke before the presidents commission on the aids epidemic ryan white told the commission of the discrimination he had faced when he first tried to return to school but how education about the disease had made him welcome in the town of cicero ryan white emphasized his differing experiences in kokomo and cicero as an example of the power and importance of aids education25 in 1989 abc aired the television movie the ryan white story starring lukas haas as ryan judith light as jeanne and nikki cox as his sister andrea ryan white had a small cameo appearance as chad in the film playing a boy also suffering from hiv who befriends haas30 others in the film included sarah jessica parker as a sympathetic nurse george dzundza as his doctor and george c scott as ryans attorney who legally argued against school board authorities31 nielsen estimated that the movie was seen by 15 million viewers32 some residents of kokomo felt that the movie

had not been elected to the office during the time of the controversy3132 by early 1990 ryans health was deteriorating rapidly in his final public appearance he hosted an afteroscars party with former president ronald reagan and his wife nancy reagan in california33 although his health was declining ryan white spoke to the reagans about his date to the prom and his hopes of attending college34 deathedit we owe it to ryan to make sure that the fear and ignorance that chased him from his home and his school will be eliminated we owe it to ryan to open our hearts and our minds to those with

home of his mother in the year following his death his grave was vandalized on four occasions35 as time passed ryans grave became a shrine for his admirers36 legacyedit ryan white was one of a handful of highly visible people with aids in the 1980s and early 1990s who helped change the public perception of the disease ryan along with actor rock hudson was one of the earliest public faces of aids along with later public figures who became associated with hivaids such as the ray brothers magic johnson arthur ashe the brady bunchs robert reed tim richmond elizabeth glaser liberace freddie mercury and charlie sheen ryan white helped to increase public awareness that hivaids was a significant epidemic27 numerous charities formed around whites death the indiana university dance marathon started in 1991 raises money for the riley hospital for children between 1991 and 2016 this event helped raise over 28 million for children at riley37 the money raised has also helped found the ryan white infectious disease clinic at the hospital to take care of the nations sickest children ryans personal physician with whom he was close friends dr martin kleiman became the ryan white professor of pediatrics at indiana university school of medicine in indianapolis in a 1993 interview prominent gay rights and aids activist larry kramer said i think little ryan white probably did more to change the face of this illness and to move people than anyone and he continues to be a presence through his mom jeanne white she has an incredibly moving presence as she speaks around the world38 in 1992 ryans mother founded the national nonprofit ryan white foundation the foundation worked to increase awareness of hivaidsrelated issues with a focus on hemophiliacs like ryan white and on families caring for relatives with the disease39 the foundation was active throughout the 1990s with donations reaching 300000 a year in 1997 between 1997 and 2000 however aids donations declined nationwide by 21 and the ryan white foundation saw its donation level drop to 100000 a year in 2000 ryans mother closed the foundation and merged its remaining assets with aids action a larger charity she became a spokeswoman for aids activism and continues to arrange speaking events through the site devoted to her son ryanwhitecom40 whites high school hamilton heights has had a studentgovernment sponsored annual aids walk with proceeds going to a ryan white scholarship fund41 ryans death inspired elton john to create the elton john aids foundation white also became the inspiration for a handful of popular songs elton john donated proceeds from the last song which appears on his album the one to a ryan white fund at riley hospital42 michael jackson dedicated the song gone too soon from his dangerous album to white43 as did 1980s pop star tiffany with the song here in my heart on her new inside album44 in november 2007 the childrens museum of indianapolis opened an exhibit called the power of children making a difference which remains a sobering featured exhibit and continues to develop while it features ryans bedroom and belongings alongside similar tributes to anne frank and ruby bridges45 ryan white and public perception of aidsedit see also hivaids in the united states in the early 1980s aids was known as gayrelated immune deficiency because the disease had first been identified among primarily homosexual communities in new york city and san francisco at the start of the hivaids epidemic in the united states the disease was thought to be a homosexual problem and was largely ignored by policy makers21 whites diagnosis demonstrated to many that aids was not exclusive to lgbt minority and poor people in his advocacy for aids research white always rejected any criticism of homosexuality although not gay himself ryan white was seen by some as an innocent victim of the aids epidemic39 ryan white and his family strongly rejected the language of innocent victim because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with aids were guilty ryans mother told the new york times ryan always said im just like everyone else with aids no matter how i got it and he would never have lived as long as he did without the gay community the people we knew in new york made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in indiana i hear mothers today say theyre not gonna work with no gay community on anything well if it comes to your sons life you better start changing your heart and your attitude around39 ryan white care actedit main article ryan white care act president barack obama signs the ryan white hivaids treatment extension act of 2009 in august 1990 four months after ryans death congress enacted the ryan white
