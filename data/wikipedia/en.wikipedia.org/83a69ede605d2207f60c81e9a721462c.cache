maternity leave in 2001 she was replaced by robson at this time the victorian edition hosted by robson began to be broadcast into sydney this was intended to last only 12 weeks but the victorian version rated higher in sydney than the local version15 this led to seven network executives axing the new south wales edition in favour of an east coast edition doyle returned at the end of 2002 to

never happened in may 2003 seven brisbane officially axed its local version23 in 2013 the queensland edition was relaunched with sharyn ghidella as host24 on 3 february 2014 however the seven network announced the queensland edition would be axed again in favour of a onehour seven news bulletin2 achievementedit today tonight nationally was the last program to win the logie for most popular public affairs program before that award was discontinued criticismedit today tonight is notorious for its sensationalist reporting and is an example of tabloid television where stories rotate around community issues ie diet fads miracle cures welfare cheats shonky builders negligent doctors poorly run businesses and corrupt government officials for this reason the program is constantly ridiculed and criticised perhaps most famously by the satirical group the chaser the show has also been found multiple times to be in breach of the australian communications and media authoritys policies with regard to invasions of privacy and not presenting factual material accurately25 christopher skase controversyedit abc tvs media watch program revealed today tonight on their 12 november 1996 broadcast had fabricated much of a report about disgraced australian businessman christopher skase today tonight sent producer chris adams and reporter david sluggo richardson along with a camera crew to pursue skase who was claiming his health prevented him from being tried richardson alleged that because the today tonight crews videos showed skase was in good health skase used his connections to the majorcan authorities in order to establish police roadblocks to seize the today tonight crews videotapes the only support for this claim was a video of richardson driving past police exclaiming roadblocks lets get out of here media watch proved through examining the broadcast report that this footage was in fact shot in barcelona not majorca the police richardson was passing were in fact the guàrdia urbana de barcelona who use roadblocks to control traffic flow in the city centre26 dole army hoaxedit on 4 february 2002 both today tonight and their main rival a current affair broadcast stories about a socalled dole army operating from melbournes subterranean stormwater drains and recruiting for an organised effort to defraud the australian government of unemployment benefits the next day an anarchist group claimed they had pretended to be the dole army as a hoax and due to lack of research and a desire to vilify the unemployed both networks fell for the elaborate prank27 neopets controversyedit in october 2004 just as a mcdonalds happy meal promotion related to virtual pet site neopets began the show ran a story about a boy that explained that neopets ordered players to play games of chance in order to avoid sending the titular pets to the pound a factual error is that chance games are optional and pets can only be sent to the pound if users want to leave them however this sparked a massive controversy about neopets and mcdonalds themselves blocked australian users access to games of chancecitation needed contempt of court allegationsedit in 2004 today tonight picked up on a story published in melbournes sunday herald sun about a boy allegedly divorcing his mother today tonights story was subsequently discussed on sevens breakfast television program sunrise in 2005 journalists editors and producers from all three media outlets were taken to the sydney magistrates court for breaching the children and young persons act 1989 for naming the child in question presenter naomi robson was found not guilty of contempt of court as the magistrate found she did not have editorial control over the story but producers of the show were fined2829 the serial single mum controversyedit on 18 july 2005 today tonight screened a report by david richardson about australias serial single mum the report was about a single mother named maryanne a private citizen in suburban sydney the program asserted maryanne had five children to five different men and pocketed tens of thousands in welfare from centrelink it was later revealed by media watch that maryanne was working fulltime and had the children to four fathers not five media watch described the exchange between richardson and maryanne as an appalling attack and another offensive beat up from dave sluggo richardson30 the wawa controversyedit on 13 september 2006 naomi robson and a today tonight crew were detained by indonesian authorities in papua for working as journalists despite entering the country on tourist visas31 the seven network claimed its team was sent to the region to do a story on wawa a young boy who was apparently in danger of being ritually killed by his tribe the korowai according to a 60 minutes story on the nine network some months earlier seven also claimed their rivals at nine sabotaged the story and the mission to rescue wawa from his tribe who are believed to practise cannibalism by informing indonesian authorities of their visa arrangements nine refuted sevens claims and threatened legal action seven alleged a nine reporter offered about 100000 to a guide not to help seven with their story sevens director of news and current affairs peter meakin said there is evidence to support the claims that in particular this man cornelius was offered 100000 not to rescue the boy i think the phrase was name your own price he said32 defamation of mark mcgawedit on 2 november 2006 the supreme court of new south wales awarded former gladiator and rugby league star mark mcgaw 385000 for a defamatory story today tonight broadcast in june 2003 the supreme court jury found the story conveyed two defamatory imputations that mcgaw was a man of dangerous domestic violence and that he bashed his lover so severely she was hospitalised with horrific injuries33 chain stuntedit on 20 february 2007 the east coast edition of today tonight led with a story about shirley frey an 84yearold resident of a nursing home in willoughby who was fighting attempts to evict her the story featured footage of her chained in her room the reporter nicolas boot said she was refusing to budge chaining herself to her room in response to the airing of that story the following day officials with the department of health and ageing visited the nursing home according to a spokesman for minister for ageing santo santoro the resident told them the chains had been brought by the crew and the process of chaining her up had been instigated by the program34 35 in response to this incident presenter anna coren was forced to read an apology to viewers on the next nights broadcast and announced seven had launched an internal investigation35 earlier that day boot was suspended34 on 23 february 2007 seven released a statement indicating boot had left his employment with the seven network however no announcement was made as to any actions taken against offcamera staff such as producers over this incident which seven head of news and current affairs peter meakin described as one of the more embarrassing incidents he had had to deal with36 vietnamese sting controversyedit on 8 may 2007 today tonight reported about an alleged vietnamese australian welfare cheat dat van vu though using the generalized title vietnamese sting this resulted in anger among the australian vietnamese community because of the association of ethnicity to criminality and furthermore the vietnamese community was also angered by the usage of the flag of vietnam rather than the flag of south vietnam which many vietnamese australians identify with37 mercedes corbyedit in 2007 today tonight ran a story on mercedes corby sister of convicted drug trafficker schapelle corby mercedes friend jodi power claimed mercedes was a drug trafficker as well38 mercedes sued seven for defamation and in may 2008 a nsw supreme court jury found the story defamed her resulting in a settlement the next day of an undisclosed sum39 earlier on 14 march 2007 coren admitted in an interview with the daily telegraph that a private investigator hired by seven lied about being an official to set up mercedes40 the chasers war on everythingedit abc show the chasers war on everything frequently ridiculed today tonight and its former presenters naomi robson and anna coren in a segment

without permission41 the chasers war on everything featured on today tonight a few times often criticising the comedians about their show and pranks in one interview reporter james thomas was planning to follow the chaser around as a publicity stunt but this failed as chaser members andrew hansen and chas licciardello arrived at the seven networks studios with a van marked as peter meakin booze bus ridiculing the seven networks chief executive peter meakin when he got to the abc we did the very thing today tonight always does to their subjectswe double crossed him karl stefanovics alleged

hurley said stefanovic was tired not drunk that the reason he did not appear on the today show was due to a prior engagement to appear on 60 minutes and that claims of stefanovic being taken off air
