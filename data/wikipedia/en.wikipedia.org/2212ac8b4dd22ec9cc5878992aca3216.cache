the city of seattle it is surrounded on three sides by water and has both enjoyed and suffered its isolation from the mainland of downtown seattle between 1850 and 1930 hundreds of small steampowered ferries called the mosquito fleet3 of steam powered boats carried travelers to and from numerous islands and peninsulas in the puget sound area including west seattle and vashon island the first licensed ferry in the seattle area4 launched on december 24 1888 traveled from seacrest park in west seattle to downtown seattle as well as other waterbound location throughout the puget sound it was a steampowered sidewheel ship named the city of seattle and made two trips a day carrying west seattle homesteaders east to the city and weekend vacationers west to the beachfront5 the service was discontinued when the first bridge across the duwamish river was built over on vashon island the passengeronly ferries were discontinued as the mosquito fleet faced increasing competition from the dieselpowered auto ferries vashon island residents could now drive their vehicles onto a ferry to the fauntleroy terminal in west seattle over time a succession of bridges was installed to connect the west seattle peninsula to downtown proper beginning with the old woodandrail spokane street bridge in 1920 in 1970 calls for a modern solution brought attention to the growing problem of commuting to downtown in 1978 the freighter ship chavez crashed into the lower bridge6 spurring the city to build the highlevel west seattle bridge and the lowlevel spokane street bridge that are still the primary paths into and out of peninsula today as west seattle has grown in popularity travel in and out of the peninsula has become more congested elliott bay water taxiedit the sightseer served as the second elliott bay water taxi the elliott bay water taxi started service in 1997 as a pilot project to give commuters an alternative to the congested west seattle bridge and highway 99 the water taxi was operated by king county metro and only ran between april and october king county leased the mv admiral pete from kitsap harbor tours via argosy cruises and later the mv sightseer from argosy cruises to operate the service the vessel was only capable of traveling 8 knots but the slow speeds proved popular with both commuters and tourists the ferry quickly became a popular tourist attraction due to beautiful view as the vessel crosses elliott bay the short walk to alki beach and the restaurants in west seattle7 vashon passengeronly ferryedit the passengeronly ferry service between vashon island and downtown seattle started as a service of the washington state ferries in the early 1990s the ferries proved popular with commuters as they offered a much faster connection to downtown seattle than the alternative of taking the auto ferry to fauntleroy and driving or taking transit to downtown8 in 2006 the state legislature ordered washington state ferries to discontinue all passenger only ferry services but simultaneously enabled local authorities to form ferry districts with taxcollecting authority the last run operated by the washington state ferries vessels came in september 2009 king county ferry districtedit in april 2007 the county formed the specialpurpose king county ferry district to take over operations of both the west seattle and vashon island passengeronly ferries the district is funded through a property tax levied on all property in the county9 the ferry district took over operation of the west seattledowntown seattle route from king county metro on april 27 200810 king county water taxi at seattles pier 50 in april 2009 the west seattle route was renamed from the elliott bay water taxi to the king county water taxi11 later that year on september 28 2009 the vashon islanddowntown seattle route was transferred from washington state ferries and became the second king county water taxi route12 king county ferry district leased the catamaran mv melissa ann from four seasons marine services to operate the vashon island route in addition to being more stable the catamaran was also faster than the ships operated by the washington state ferries reducing travel time from 30 to 22 minutes12 in april 2010 the west seattle route began operating yearround service from a newly rebuilt dock at seacrest park that allowed for wheelchair access13 at the same time the west seattle route started operating with the catamaran mv rachel marie a sister ship of the melissa ann also leased from four seasons marine services the leased sightseer was returned to argosy cruises14 in march 2013 the district added a third vessel to its fleet by acquiring the mv spirit of kingston that had been previously used on the failed soundrunner ferry between kingston and downtown seattle the spirit of kingston is the first vessel to be owned by the ferry district it was assigned to the west seattle route15 where its smaller size and more efficient engines proved a better fit than the rachel marie the new vessel allowed the rachel marie to serve as a backup saving the district on rental and lease expenses in 2014 the district received federal grants that allowed it to purchase two ships specifically designed for the needs of the king county water taxi king county department of transportationedit in late 2014 the king county council made up of the same members as the king county ferry district voted to assume governance of the king county ferry district the consolidation of the district into county government saves money by eliminating redundant functions16
