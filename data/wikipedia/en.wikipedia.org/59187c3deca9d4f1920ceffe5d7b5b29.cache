inc google intel intuit pixar lucasfilm and ebay all hightechnology companies with a principal place of business in the san francisco–silicon valley area of california the civil class action was filed by five plaintiffs one of whom has died it accused the tech companies of collusion between 2005 and 2009 to refrain from recruiting each others employees contents 1 no cold call agreements 2 department of justice antitrust action 3 civil class action 4 see also 5 references 6 external links no cold call agreementsedit cold calling is one of the main methods used by companies in the hightechnology sector to recruit employees with advanced and specialised skills such as software and hardware engineers programmers animators digital artists web developers and other technical professionals1 cold calling involves communicating directly in any manner with another firms employee who has not otherwise applied for a job opening cold calling may be done in person by phone letter or email2 according to the legal brief filed by a plaintiff in one of the classaction cases cold calling is an effective method of recruiting for the hightechnology sector because employees of other hightechnology companies are often unresponsive to other recruiting strategies and current satisfied employees tend to be more qualified harder working and more stable than those who are actively looking for employment3 amy lambert google’s associate general counsel noted in a blog post shortly after the dojs actions that googles definition of cold calling does not necessarily eliminate recruiting by letter or email but only the process of calling on the telephone by implication recruiting through linkedin incurs recruiting by inmail linkedins own mail contact system in order to maintain a good working relationship with these companies in 2005 we decided not to cold call employees at a few of our partner companies our policy only impacted cold calling and we continued to recruit from these companies through linkedin job fairs employee referrals or when candidates approached google directly in fact we hired hundreds of employees from the companies involved during this time period the challenged no cold call agreements are alleged bilateral agreements between high technology companies not to cold call each others employees the doj alleges that senior executives at each company negotiated to have their employees added to no call lists maintained by human resources personnel or in company hiring manuals the alleged agreements were not limited by geography job function product group or time period the alleged bilateral agreements were between 1 apple and google 2 apple and adobe 3 apple and pixar 4 google and intel 5 google and intuit4 and 6 lucasfilm and pixar5 the civil class action further alleges that agreements also existed to 1 provide notification when making an offer to another companys employee without the knowledge or consent of the employee and 2 agreements that when offering a position to another companys employee neither company would counteroffer above the initial offer3 department of justice antitrust actionedit this section relies

united states department of justice antitrust division filed a complaint in the us district court for the district of columbia alleging violations of section 1 of the sherman act in us v adobe systems inc et al the department of justice alleged that adobe apple google intel intuit and pixar had violated section 1 of the sherman act by entering into a series of bilateral no cold call agreements to prevent the recruitment of their employees a similar but separate suit was filed against lucasfilm on december 21 20106 the doj alleged in their complaint that the companies had reached facially anticompetitive agreements that eliminated a significant form of competitionto the detriment of the affected employees who were likely deprived of competitively important information and access to better job opportunities the doj also alleged that the agreements were not ancillary to any legitimate collaboration were much broader than reasonably necessary for the formation or implementation of any collaborative effort and disrupted the normal pricesetting mechanisms that apply in the labor setting4 the same day it filed the suit the doj and the defendants proposed a settlement7 a final judgment enforcing the settlement was entered by the court on march 17 20118 although the doj complaint only challenged the alleged no cold call agreements in the settlement the companies agreed to a more broad prohibition against attempting to enter into entering into maintaining or enforcing any agreement with any other person to in any way refrain from requesting that any person in any way refrain from or pressuring any person in any way to refrain from soliciting cold calling recruiting or otherwise competing for employees of the other person for a period of five years the court can grant an extension8 the settlement agreement does not provide any compensation for company employees affected by the alleged agreements9 lucasfilm entered into a similar settlement agreement in

employees of adobe apple inc google intel intuit pixar and lucasfilm the last two are subsidiaries of disney against their employer alleging that their wages were repressed due to alleged agreements between their employers not to hire employees from their competitors1112 the case was filed on may 4 2011 by a former software engineer at lucasfilm and alleges violations of california’s antitrust statute business and professions code sections 16720 et seq the cartwright act business and professions code section 16600 and california’s unfair competition law business and professions code sections 17200 et seq focusing on the network of connections around former apple ceo steve jobs the complaint alleges an interconnected web of express agreements each with the active involvement and participation of a company under the control of steve jobsandor a company that shared at least one member of apples board of directors the alleged intent of this conspiracy was to reduce employee compensation and mobility through eliminating competition for skilled labor13 on october 24 2013 the united states district court for the northern district of california granted class certification for all employees of defendant companies from january 1 2005 through january 1 20109 as of october 31 2013 intuit pixar and lucasfilm have reached a tentative settlement agreement pixar and lucasfilm agreed to pay 9 million in damages and intuit agreed to pay 11 million in damages9 in may 2014 judge lucy koh approved the 20 million settlement between lucasfilm pixar and intuit and their employees class members in this settlement which involved fewer than 8 of the 65000 employees affected will receive around 3840 each14 the trial of the class action for the remaining defendant companies was scheduled to begin on may 27 2014 the plaintiffs intended to ask the jury for 3 billion in compensation a number which could in turn have tripled to 9 billion under antitrust law15 however in late april 2014 the four remaining defendants apple inc google intel and adobe systems agreed to settle out of court any settlement must be approved by judge lucy koh1617 on may 23 2014 apple google intel adobe agreed to settle for 3245 million lawyers sought 25 in attorneys’ fees plus expenses of as much as 12 million according to the filing additional award payments of 80000 would be sought for each named plaintiff who served as a class representative18 payouts will average a few thousand dollars based on the salary of the employee at the time of the complaint in june 2014 judge lucy koh expressed concern that the settlement may not be a good one for the plaintiffs michael devine one of the plaintiffs said the settlement is unjust in a letter he wrote to the judge he said the settlement represents only onetenth of the 3 billion in compensation the 64000 workers could have made if the defendants had not colluded19 on august 8 2014 judge koh rejected the settlement as insufficient on the basis of the evidence and exposure rejecting a settlement is unusual in such cases this left the defendants with a choice between raising their settlement offer or facing a trial20 on september 8 2014 judge koh set april 9 2015 as the actual trial date for the remaining defendants with a pretrial conference scheduled for december 19 2014 also as of early september 2014 the defendants had reentered mediation to determine whether a new settlement could be reached21 a final approval hearing was held on july 9 201522 on wednesday september 2 2015 judge lucy h koh signed an order granting motion for final approval of class action settlement the settlement website stated that adobe apple google and intel has reached a settlement of 415 million and other companies settled
