main article living with michael jackson in a 2003 granada television documentary1 titled living with michael jackson british journalist martin bashir interviewed jackson extensively over a period of 8 months the film was broadcast in the uk on february 3 2003 and in the us three days later in one scene jackson introduces the arvizo children and they talk happily about gavins unexpected recovery from cancer then gavin and jackson are interviewed together gavin holding jacksons hand and at one point resting his head on jacksons shoulder at the trial gavin testified that jackson initiated the handholding but that he had put his head on jacksons shoulder because he was really close to jackson and jackson was his best friend in the video gavin tells bashir about a night when he slept in jacksons bed he says that he and jackson both offered to sleep on the floor and give each other the bed but in the end jackson slept on the floor while gavin and star slept in the bed jackson stated in the documentary that many children including macaulay culkin his younger brother kieran and his sisters2 had slept in jacksons bed when bashir asked if jackson could see why some people might disapprove jackson said see when you say bed youre thinking sexual they make that sexual its not sexual were going to sleep later the boy complained that he had not realized that the footage would be broadcast all over the world and that after it aired he was teased by his friends his mother stated that she had not given bashir permission to film her son and was not even aware of the filming prior to the broadcast responding to the controversy santa barbara county district attorney thomas w sneddon jr stated that under california law an adult sleeping in the same bed as a child is not a criminal offense unless affirmative offensive conduct occurs3 michael jackson was initially charged in a criminal complaint by the santa barbara district attorneys office however before the case proceeded very far sneddon changed his mind and obtained an indictment before a county grand jury jackson was indicted for conspiracy to commit child abduction false imprisonment extortion child molestation attempted child molestation and providing alcohol to an underage person for purposes of molestation his alleged coconspirators were not indicted some sources were critical of the charges believing them an attempt to ameliorate pr damage caused by the documentary jackson was indicted based on the accusers allegations of events which allegedly began after the documentary aired and after he and jackson had already been friends for several years part of the defense against this accusation was that it would be absurd for jackson to begin molesting the boy only as soon he was suspected of the crime as his attorney put it the bashir documentary was aired in the us on february 6 2003 gavin arvizos given time frame for the alleged molestations was february 20 2003 through march 12 2003 the family had been acquainted with michael jackson for almost 2 years but the alleged victim claimed he was molested after the footage was filmed and at a time the whole world was already watching rebuttal videoedit in response to the bashir documentary a second video was aired called take two or the footage you were never meant to see it includes bashir praising michaels qualities as a father and his relationships with children in general while in the bashir documentary he says he is disturbed by michaels relationships with children further an interview with the family was filmed on the night of february 19 2003 in videographer hamid moslehis home this part of the production was never aired because moslehi refused to hand it over following a financial dispute with jackson45 it was found by police in a search of moslehis home in november 2003 and it showed the accusers family praising jackson with the accuser insisting no molestation had occurred and that jackson was innocent6 gavin arvizo his sister davellin brother star and mother janet were upfront and said that inappropriate behavior had absolutely not occurred while also calling him a father figure6 they also insisted that although they had slept in jacksons bed jackson himself always slept on the floor6 to further the rebuttal janet arvizo issued the statement the relationship that michael has with my children is beautiful loving fatherson and daughter one to my children and me michael is part of the family66 she also stated that she was considering taking legal action against martin bashir dcfs interviewedit on february 20 2003 janet arvizo was interviewed by the sensitive case unit of the los angeles department of children family services dcfs as part of an investigation jointly carried out with the lapd a school official from the los angeles unified school district had lodged a complaint out of concern for the boy who would later become jacksons accuser and for his younger brother after watching the bashir documentary the official suspected sexual abuse by jackson and general neglect by the mother the entire family insisted that no inappropriate contact with jackson occurred moreover the mother said that the children were never left alone with jackson the case was closed and the charges marked as unfounded afterwards in november 2003 when outside interest arose in connection with charges against jackson a report was made7 plans for a trip to brazil final departure from neverlandedit in mid february 2003 marc schaffel michael jackson and janet arvizo decided to take a trip to brazil for one week while the arvizo family was to be moved into a new apartment and the children checked into a new school district these moves were a result of the negative attention received by michael jackson and the arvizo family after the bashir documentary marc schaffel instructed jacksons employees to help with preparations for the trip to brazil and with the familys move to the new apartment and the arvizo childrens registration in the new school district after the interview with child services janet arvizo brought a jackson employee to meet with karen walker of the los angeles dcfs walker advised the jackson employee that the arvizo family were being harassed by the media as a result of the bashir documentary and needed an apartment suitable for a family as well as the children to be checked into school the trip was disclosed to walker and the apartment change and school district registration would be made while on vacation in brazil the familys plans for a trip to brazil would play a role in future allegations—and more specifically in the conspiracy charge with the nonindicted coconspirators after all preparations were completed for the trip to brazil and for the move to the new apartment janet decided to call off the vacation which was immediately canceled according to witnesses the jackson camp told the family that death threats were made against the family in relation to the airing the arvizos claimed that jackson had planned to trap the family in brazil to keep them from making allegations however the defense asked why jackson would buy the family twoway tickets to and from brazil if his plans were to trap the family in another country the children returned to jacksons neverland ranch and a day later their mother joined them after resuming preparations for the trip to brazil—although she would later testify she did not really want to go from february 25 to march 2 the family along with some of jacksons staff stayed in a hotel in calabasas california and went shopping in preparation for the trip to brazil after that the family stayed at neverland again on march 10 the mother and the accuser drove from neverland to kaiser permanente hospital with a urine sample of the accuser gavin for a scheduled medical checkup on the way to the hospital janet spilled the urine sample on the passengerside floor of the car when asked by a jackson employee what happened janet said that she spilled the urine accidentally at the hospital gavin received numerous tests for his kidney including a dye test the urine sample however was insufficient for one of the tests and it came back inconclusive afterward the accuser returned to neverland while the mother went to stay with her fiance it would be the boys last stay at the neverland ranch apparently the accuser was very angry with his mother that she would not allow him to return mother of accuser seeks legal adviceedit janet arvizo first approached attorney bill dickerman to discuss taking legal action against martin bashir dickerman referred her to larry feldman the attorney who represented jordan chandler the first accuser in 19936 feldman then contacted child psychologist stan katz who told santa barbara sheriffs investigator paul zelis that mr feldman actually referred these kids to me because they had come to him in this lawsuit8 it was then that allegations of child molestation surfaced and katz reported this to the authorities as is compulsory for someone in his profession in such cases he said in a taped conversation that he didnt consider jackson a pedophile but a regressed 10yearold8 larry feldman was the attorney who helped jordan chandler win an outofcourt settlement reportedly for 20 million and dr katz was the psychologist that assisted evan chandler in uncovering whether his son was suffering abuse the defense later focused on feldman and katz stressing that janet went to the same people who helped obtain a settlement from jackson in 1993 prior to ever going to the police the circumstances by which the arvizos allegations surfaced aroused suspicion over their claims and caused some to believe that the family was merely seeking money others believed that janet sought legal advice perhaps because she was afraid that she could be charged with child endangerment for allowing her sons to sleep in jacksons bed santa barbara county sheriffs department investigationedit in june 2003 the santa barbara county sheriffs office started an investigation in july 2003 they first interviewed the family on november 18 2003 a team of more than 70 investigators from the santa barbara county district attorneys office and sheriffs department executed a search warrant upon jacksons neverland ranch said search has been criticized as having involved an excessively large number of law enforcement personnel6 the district attorney opened a website for an open casting call for anyone who had been molested by michael jackson andor who had any information against jackson9 arvizo familyedit jacksons attorney alleged that the charges were made in retaliation by the family after the family realized that jackson was not going to continue supporting them financially10 the family was portrayed during trial as exhibiting a long history of attempting to extort celebrities and abusing legal and governmental systems11 jc penney alleged assault litigation and psychiatric analysisedit in august 1998 the arvizo family was detained on a shoplifting charge at a j c penney department store in west covina california according to jc penney gavin and star arvizo were sent out of the store by their father with an armload of stolen clothes the family was detained and janet started a scuffle with the security guards the shoplifting charge was dropped but janet filed a lawsuit saying that when she was detained she was viciously beaten by three security officers one of whom was female6 in her booking photo from the arrest she appears uninjured but for the lawsuit she submitted two pictures showing bruises all over her body12 the paralegal she hired would later testify at the jackson trial that janet told her the beating was actually inflicted by her husband12 jc penney hired a psychiatrist to evaluate janet arvizo and found her to have rehearsed her children into supporting her story and to be both delusional and depressed although janets own doctor found her to be only the latter6 more than two years after the original alleged incident janet added a further charge that one of the male officers had sexually fondled her breasts and pelvis area for up to seven minutes a claim which shocked even her lawyer6 ultimately the department store settled out of court with the family for 15200012 gavin arvizoedit jacksons accuser gavin arvizo was officially anonymized as john doe by the court and the media until february 200513 he was born in december 1989 and was 13 years old between february 20 and march 12 2003 when the alleged crimes were said to have been committed in 2000 arvizo was diagnosed with cancer and had his spleen and a kidney removed jackson organized a blood drive and accommodated for his chemotherapy treatments6 soon thereafter jamie masada14 the owner of the comedy club laugh factory fulfilled arvizos wish to meet jackson and the boy visited neverland eight times on two of those occasions he and his family met michael jackson during the other six times jackson was either not home or not available in 2001 there were no visits but arvizo had 20 or so telephone conversations with jackson regarding his recovery as the cancer was in remission david arvizoedit gavins father david arvizo visited neverland several times in 2000 sometimes with the whole family and at other times with only the children after 2000 the accusers parents were divorced and his mother received custody of him his older sister and his younger brother in 2002 arvizo pleaded no contest to spousal abuse and in 2003 pleaded no contest to child cruelty6 after completing classes in parenting and anger management david arvizo applied to have a threeyear restraining order against him temporarily lifted to allow him to see his three children6 he claimed he wanted to see for himself how his sons health was and hoped to find out whether the boy and jackson had had sexual contact he blamed his exwife for allowing the boy to sleep in the same room with jackson and also claimed that she had been in a mental hospital as of late 2004 david insisted my children are routinely rehearsed by their mother janet to do or say whatever she wishes6 janet arvizoedit when the arvizo family and jackson were on good terms their mother janet allegedly encouraged her children to call jackson daddy6 janet who also went by the names janet ventura and janet jackson was identified as the most problematic of the prosecution witnesses besides her credibility issues her behavior in the courtroom was widely criticized roger friedman reported its pretty clear that shes mentally ill in some way and that when she first starts testifying shes very sedate and as time goes by and possibly medication wears off she becomes crazier and crazier and you can hear people in the courtroom saying here it comes on a few occasions the courtroom erupted in laughter over her answers15 after the trial jurors criticized her habit of snapping her fingers and staring at them16 she was often unresponsive even to the prosecution was defensive over seemingly small issues and was admonished by the judge for arguing she used repeated catchphrases such as its burned inside my memory and money doesnt buy happiness15 she often answered questions with tangential speeches addressed directly to the jury the press or the defendant defense attorney tom mesereau refused to object to her rambling and emotional diatribes which resulted in prosecutor sneddon repeatedly objecting to his own witnesss answers it was also revealed that janet arvizo had enrolled all three of her children in acting classes and had accused a jc penney security guard of sexually molesting her in 199815 in february 2006 janet arvizo was convicted of welfare fraud for failing to report the 150000 civil settlement in that case she was sentenced to 150 hours of community service and an 8600 fine17 arrest and investigationedit warrant and arrestedit along with the warrant to search the premises was a warrant for the arrest of jackson michael was in las vegas nevada at the time recording a music video for his most recent hit single one more chance from his greatesthits album number ones which had been released at midnight just hours before the warrants were issued and the allegations broke in the media on november 20 jackson flew in a leased jet to santa barbara municipal airport and surrendered himself to california police driven by police to the santa barbara county jail he emerged from the police vehicle in handcuffs many lawyers and jackson supporters saw it as an attempt by both police and media to convince the public of jacksons guilt while some attached a racial element to the polices actions61819 he was charged with lewd or lascivious acts with a child younger than 14 under section 288a of the california penal code jackson posted 3 million bail later requesting a reduced amount the prosecution opposed this reduction arguing that jackson might relocate to another country as a fugitive and citing andrew luster as an example luster had fled to mexico notwithstanding his 1 million bail bond many argued that jackson had good reason to be angered at the excessive bail as phil spector had to pay only 1 million in his murder trial to some the high amount also indicated racism19 after jacksons acquittal the judge ordered that the bail be returned to michael20 the judge 62yearold rodney melville had temporarily exempted jackson from detention in the us until january 6 2004 allowing jackson to schedule a possible trip to britain jackson however did not make use of this exemption shortly after his arrest he was required to surrender his passport to santa barbara authorities at the time of his booking his weight had dipped to 120 pounds 54 kg 86 st a notably low weight for a 5foot11inch 180 cm middleaged man on november 23 fans held a series of public vigils to proclaim his innocence on november 25 2003 it was revealed that unknown to jackson a third party had secretly wired the private jet chartered to take him and his attorney from vegas to california with hidden cameras and audiorecording devices intending to sell video footage of the two to major television and radio networks for a large amount of money all networks declined them however a restraining order prohibiting the videotape from being shown to any third parties was issued against the jet company furthermore jacksons party filed a lawsuit against the perpetrators demanding 500000000citation needed on november 26 2003 it was discovered that xtrajet the company that found the audio recordings and hidden cameras on jacksons plane on monday showed the video to several news organizations on november 24 fox news channel reported that the tape shows jackson calm and relaxed on the plane21 jacksons legal team at that point were awarded 18 million in damages in 200822 xtrajet went bankrupt jackson at the police stationedit during a 60 minutes interview with ed bradley jackson stated that the police had manhandled him very roughly23 the santa barbara county sheriff released a videotape showing jacksons arrest they also released an audiotape of his ride to the police station in it jackson complains about the handcuffs and is politely told by an officer how he can relieve the discomfort he is heard to be whistling and he asks for the air conditioning to be turned on it was police allege these tapes prove that jacksons claims are false jackson along with his family claim that what is being shown is merely a biased portion of what actually occurred california attorney general bill lockyer ordered an independent investigation into jacksons complaints after interviewing 163 witnesses the complaints were rejected in august 2004 chargesedit on december 18 2003 jackson was charged with committing seven counts of child molestation in february and march 2003 and with two counts of administering an intoxicating agent in order to carry out the molestation all pertaining to the same boy under 14 the felony complaint stated that jackson had on seven occasions willfully unlawfully and lewdly committed a lewd and lascivious act upon and with the boys body and certain parts and members thereof with the intent of arousing appealing to and gratifying the lust passions and sexual desires of jackson and the boy and that this sexual conduct had been substantial also that on two of these occasions jackson had administered to the boy an intoxicating agent with intent thereby to enable and assist himself to carry out the aforementioned act jackson denied these allegations and said that the sleepovers were nonsexual while he described the boy on whose statements the accusations were based as a sweet child he maintained that the boy was manipulated by greedy parents at the prosecutions request the judge issued a gag order forbidding the following parties to talk to the news media the defendant the prosecutor defense counsel any attorney working in their offices their agents staff experts any judicial officer or court employee any law enforcement employee and any agency involved in the case or any persons subpoenaed or expected to testify the purpose was to prevent people among whom a jury would be selected from being influenced however the judge would consider proposals to allow either side to answer reporters questions about rumors surrounding the case arraignmentedit jackson was arraigned on january 16 2004 at the court in santa maria he was admonished by the judge for arriving 20 minutes late jackson was represented by attorneys mark geragos benjamin brafman steve cochran and robert sanger jackson entered a plea of not guilty judge melville turned down a media request for publication of 82 pages of documents and related tape recordings on the grounds of violation of the parties privacy rights and complicating the process of selecting an unbiased jury the request concerned the boys accounts of alleged happenings interviews with his family statements made during the childs psychological counseling and information about the chandlers case court sessionsedit in a court session on february 13 2004 it was revealed that the defense had just received 400 pages of evidence from the lead prosecutor and that hundreds more were

counsel and without a judge present in santa barbara starting in march 2004 led to jacksons indictment on april 21 2004 the grand jury had nineteen jurors the indictment required the votes of at least twelve jurors prosecution witnesses testified without defense crossexamination the judge ruled that witnesses before the grand jury could talk to defense attorneys about their knowledge of the case as long as the witnesses did not tell what they saw in the grand jury room or what questions they were asked and their answers many grand jury witnesses were sneaked into the building where the grand jury was meeting sometimes covered in blankets to hide their identities in february 2005 the smoking gun published the grand jury transcripts 1903 pages25 on april 25 2004 mark geragos and ben brafman were replaced as jacksons lead counsel by onetime robert blake defense attorneys thomas mesereau and susan yu26 steve cochran and robert sanger continued to represent mr jackson although cochran left the team prior to trial see transcripts for case no 1133603 the second arraignment was held on april 30 2004 brian oxman was brought onto the team by mesereau the new charges to which jackson pleaded not guilty were similar to the earlier ones allegedly on or about and between february 20 and march 12 2003 but with the addition of conspiracy involving child abduction false imprisonment and extortion the first two referred to the allegation that the accuser although he was free to move within neverland was at some stages not allowed to leave the ranch even when his mother wanted this to occur trialedit the jury selection for the trial began on january 31 2005 and the trial ended on june 13 2005 when the jury returned a unanimous not guilty verdict on all fourteen charges of the twelve jurors eight were women and four were men eight alternate jurors consisted of four men and four women ron zonen conducted the jury selection for the prosecution tom mesereau for the defense tom sneddon gave the opening statement for the prosecution tom mesereau for the defense ron zonen gave the closing argument for the prosecution tom mesereau for the defense tom sneddon ron zonen mag nicola27 and gordon auchinloss examined witnesses for the prosecution tom mesereau and robert sanger for the defense28 brian oxman was removed from the defense mid trial by mesereau and yu from outside the courtroom 2200 reporters covered the trial—more than the o j simpson and scott peterson trials combined29 because no television cameras were allowed inside the courtroom e and british sky broadcasting broadcast a reenactment of the trial the first witness the prosecution called was martin bashir who unsuccessfully fought his subpoena and brought an attorney with him from abc30 his direct testimony was short he gave some career background and testified that he had produced the show living with michael jackson which was then played in its entirety for the courtroom in cross examination bashirs attorney objected to most of the questions citing the california constitutions journalist shield law and the first amendment privilege for journalists which he believed exempted bashir from questions relating to unpublished footage of his documentary or to information about how it was prepared and produced judge melville decided that he would overrule the objections giving bashir the choice to either answer or to follow his lawyers advice while melville would review the testimony later to decide whether to charge bashir with contempt of court bashir refused to answer any questions his attorney objected to which mostly pertained to examples the defense suggested of bashirs deceiving and manipulating jackson31 on the morning of march 10 2005 jackson was hospitalized for a back injury the judge threatened to issue an arrest warrant and forfeiture of the bail if jackson did not appear in court within an hour still wearing pajama pants and slippers jackson was rushed to the courthouse this incident was heavily covered in the media with bill fallon even suggesting jacksons attire indicated his guilt calling jackson a nut mentally ill and adding if anybody has any question about michael jackson being able to commit this crimethis proves he doesnt listen to anybody32 the first alleged sexual act was of jackson masturbating gavin on jacksons bed jackson allegedly initiated the molestation by urging the accuser to masturbate telling him that boys who didnt might rape a girl however in a police interview before the trial gavin was asked what he knew about masturbation and he replied my grandma explained it to me she told me thatif men dont do itthey might go ahead and rape a woman3334 when asked about this coincidence the accuser maintained that both his grandmother and jackson had happened to tell him the same thing but with different motives the accuser testified that during that first sexual incident he was wearing pajamas jackson had given him and that the two of them were under the covers35 jackson allegedly manipulated the accusers genitals for about five minutes causing the accuser to ejaculate count 235 afterwards the accuser averred jackson told him it was okay and they just went to sleep the next night gavin testified the same thing happened again count 3 in jacksons bed both of them wearing jacksons pajamas but now they were on top of the covers and maybe watching tv or something35 this time jackson also tried to guide the accusers hand to jacksons genitals but the accuser pulled away count 6 gavin couldnt remember for sure if he ejaculated the second time but he thought he did35 in an earlier interview with sneddon the accuser claimed he had been molested before the rebuttal video but in court he testified that all molestation took place after the video was filmed36 the number of times he claimed to have been molested is also unclear as he only testified in court about two incidents but he had previously told sergeant steve robel that he thought it was between five and seven times37 the accusers 14yearold brother star testified that hed walked into jacksons bedroom and seen jackson masturbating himself and the sleeping accuser he testified that hed meant to go to sleep in jacksons room had found the door kind of locked so he pushed it and it opened and he walked some ways into the room and stopped when he saw what gavin and michael were doing38 he testified they were on the bed outside of the covers jackson was on his back with his eyes closed and gavin was curled up facing away from jackson and was kind of snoring38 star couldnt remember what his brother had been wearing but said it might have been pants or underwears and that jackson was wearing socks underwears and an undershirt but later said jacksons hand was in his pants3839 he variously used the words pants and underwears for both gavin and jackson to describe what they were wearing one aspect that weakened his testimony was that star the only witness to the alleged molestation claimed he twice walked in on jackson molesting gavin and was completely unnoticed even while tripping the alarm system in the hallway leading to jacksons bedroom an alarm or bell would sound whenever anyone approached and star claimed that on both occasions the alarm went off and jackson didnt hear it neither did he hear nor see the boy come and go38 star said he stood watching for about four seconds before he just went back to the guest units38 star testified that two days later he had an almost identical experience he allegedly walked into jacksons bedroom and saw that the same thing was happening with jackson masturbating stroking up and down and his other hand moving around in stars sleeping brothers underwears38 this time star only stayed for three seconds before returning to the guest units stars account of the sexual act on the second occasion matched neither the description he gave during an interview with psychologist stanley katz nor his statement given in police interviews in 2003 star arvizo said in an interview with the psychologist on may 29 2003 that he witnessed jackson placing his hand on gavins crotch outside his clothes on july 7 2003 during his first interview with sheriffs investigators star changed his story he claimed that during the first incident jackson placed his left hand under the front of his brothers pajama pants star arvizo changed his account still a third time during a police interview on august 13 2003 when he claimed that jackson had placed his hand inside the front of his brothers boxer shorts4041 dr katz grand jury testimony about what star had told him included a story about jackson rubbing his penis against gavins buttocks and another about smelling marijuana in court star denied that hed made the allegations and refused mesereaus offer to refresh his recollection by showing star that page of katz testimony41 the accuser and his brother both testified that on one brief occasion they saw jackson naked but the boys described the incident differently according to star the brothers were watching a movie on jacksons bed and jackson came in to fetch something star testified that jackson had a hardon and that he told the boys who were grossed out that nudity was natural38 star said jackson stayed for two minutes and sat on the bed but neither brother spoke a word during that time38 according to gavin the boys were just laying there when jackson ran up there and got something and went back downstairs without saying anything35 gavin did not describe jackson as having an erection35 the accusers mother janet arvizo testified that on a flight from miami to los angeles she saw michael licking gavins head while he was asleep42 before she testified about it she turned to the jury and said please dont judge me jackson allegedly had an arm around the boy and licked his hair over and over while everyone else on the plane was asleep42 janet said she didnt tell any one what shed seen and she continued to let her children stay at neverland and she later testified that at a point weeks after that incident she still didnt have any concerns about mr jackson at all42 star contradicted his mother when he testified that he had been awake to also witness jackson lick gavins head on the plane he didnt say anyone was asleep just that the accuser was not feeling well and had leaned against jacksons chest38 cynthia bell a flight attendant on that flight said she had not seen jackson cuddling with arvizo during the flight but testified that she had seen jackson put his arm around the accuser while he was listening to music 43 many witnesses testified that the arvizo children were poorly behaved and demanding jackson staff members testified that they broke into mr jacksons wine cellar and had been caught in jacksons bedroom on their own going through his things housekeeper kiki fournier testified that the guest quarters assigned to the boys were trashed by them and that at one point the accusers brother pointed a knife at her in jacksons kitchen 44 cynthia bell a flight attendant on a plane carrying the arvizo children jackson and others testified that gavin was demanding complained about the food and acted unruly during the flight43 witness george lopez once friends with the accusers family gave the family money but had a falling out when the father kept asking for more lopez also described an incident when the arvizos allegedly tried to frame him for stealing 300 from gavins wallet this allegation was used to illustrate a pattern of family behavior however the accusers sister davellin testified that these problems were all caused by her father before the divorce45 other popular comedians testified about their runins with the arvizos chris tucker claimed he had felt sorry for them and had taken them out bought them things and given them money but he felt the arvizos expected too much calling him their brother and taking advantage of him4647 he testified that he had warned michael jackson about the family whom he called cunning47 jay leno testified that gavin arvizo with a woman directing him in the background called him and praised him lavishly he was suspicious and ordered his staff not to let any more calls from them come through48 defense attorneys repeatedly introduced evidence suggesting that the accusers mother janet arvizo had been guilty of welfare fraud and perjury arvizo pled the fifth amendment regarding alleged welfare fraud and was allowed to testify without discussing the accusations she admitted that she had lied under oath in the jc penney case 49 arvizo later pled no contest to charges of welfare fraud and perjury and was ordered to perform 150 hours of community service 50 at the trial the accuser admitted to telling his school administrator that jackson had not molested him 51 conspiracy and false imprisonmentedit count 1 of the charges was conspiracy to commit child abduction false imprisonment and extortion janet arvizo claimed she and her family had been held captive at neverland as well as at a couple of hotels when traveling with jackson she expressed her mistrust of the germans dieter weisner and ron konitzer she testified that they pretended to want to protect her telling her the rebuttal video would appease the killers but that michael ronald dieter frank and vinnieended up being the killers52 at one point janet testified that shed known what questions shed be asked in the rebuttal video that frank went over them with her on the phone beforehand and told her to praise michael on another day of her testimony she claimed the germans had scripted every word of the video even the handholding laughing and the outtakes when they appear to think the camera isnt on and the germans had worked with them daily numerous times to learn it all52 house manager jesus salas testified that the accusers mother was at no time held at neverland against her will and that she had never complained of her children being taken advantage of at neverland other staff testified that the idea that the family were prisoners of neverland was ludicrous that there was no fence surrounding the property and that the guards did not carry weapons during their alleged captivity the arvizos took shopping trips into town billing 331205 worth of purchases to michael jackson4253 they also met with their lawyer and visited a federal building during this time making phone calls to various people though never the police janet testified that she was dropping hints in code about her kidnapping during the calls and explained that she never openly asked anyone for help because of the death threats jacksons coconspirators allegedly made toward her parents54 janet and star claimed that jackson was preventing them from knowing times or dates when mesereau pointed out that there were clocks visible almost everywhere in neverland including a giant flower clock on a prominent hill star admitted that he was surrounded by clocks but claimed that they had the wrong times41 janets claims included that she was restricted to one meal per day and that jacksons associates had threatened to make her children disappear via hotair balloon the arvizos escaped neverland three times in rollsroyces and limos but were convinced to return each time when the prosecution presented a complicated chart of phone calls between jacksons unindicted coconspirators trying to show that they were scheming about the arvizos captivity they accidentally proved that jackson was not even at neverland for several of the days during the 2 12week time frame given for the alleged molestation and may have been in miami the day the molestation and conspiracy were alleged to have started55 pornographyedit the prosecution alleged that jackson showed pornography to children at neverland including the accuser and his brother the raids on neverland produced an accumulation of ten years worth of heterosexual adult magazines such as playboy penthouse and hustler along with various heterosexual pornographic videos and websites on his computer the prosecution alleged these were used for grooming young victims brett barnes and wade robson two men who had been friends with jackson since childhood testified that they had not been aware that jackson possessed sexually explicit material until the trial5657 there were also a few books seized from a library of thousands that the prosecution suggested were evidence of homosexuality andor pedophilia boys will be boys included pictures of boys many naked in various nonsexual activities such as climbing a tree or sitting on a bench the book had an inscription reading to michael from your fan love xxxooo rhonda – 1983 chicago57 wade robson testified he considered boys will be boys not a pornographic book and said he would not be concerned about its owner being in the same bed with a 12yearold57 another book the boy a photographic essay was inscribed look at the true spirit of happiness and joy in these boys faces this is the spirit of boyhood a life i never had and will always dream of this is the life i want for my children mj the book contained pictures of boys in various situations by different photographers including pictures taken during the filming of the 1963 lord of the flies film and showed the boys on the set usually clothed but sometimes nude playing in the sand reading comic books and having pillow fights5859 the only book depicting male sex acts was a rare outofprint book called a sexual study of man which featured many images of adult men engaged in all kinds of homosexual intercourse57 robson said he would be concerned if the books owner were to share his bed with a boy but amended that he would not mind if he considered the total picture of all the material in question57 robson testified that he believed jackson had a sexual interest in women and that he had never seen anything that suggested pedophilia at neverland57 jacksons multiple residences were searched numerous times by various agencies over a period of days without any child pornography ever being found the fbi analyzed sixteen computers and found nothing notable contained in their files60 gavin and star arvizo testified that jackson introduced them to pornography star described a time when he his brother frank tyson and michael jackson had looked at pornography sites on gavins computer the pictures were of naked women and jackson had allegedly whispered to his sleeping son youre missing some pussy before they all watched the simpsons and went to sleep star also testified to twice looking through adult magazines with gavin jackson and aldo cascio he identified a picture of a particular barely legal magazine that he said jackson showed the boys when mesereau pointed out that the magazine had not been published until august 2003—five months after the arvizos had left neverland fingerprints of gavin and michael were found on a particular magazine but it was only analyzed for fingerprints after the 2004 grand jury proceeding when gavin handled the magazine without glovescitation needed alcoholedit the charges included four counts of administering alcohol to a minor which the jury could find was done either with intent to molest a felony charge or without a misdemeanor all three arvizo children testified that michael jackson had served them alcohol gavin testified that the first time he ever drank alcohol was in the wine cellar with jackson where he allegedly swallowed a quantity of vodka thinking it was water35 he testified that after the miami trip he was drinking wine vodka rum or bourbon every night that jackson was home however in an earlier police interview he said he didnt drink a lot at neverland35 the prosecutions grooming theory held that jackson used alcohol to lower gavins inhibitions in order to molest him and the accuser testified that the first time he was molested he and jackson had just come back from drinking in the arcade he also described a time when he was undergoing urine tests related to his cancer treatment and he worried alcohol would be detected but was allegedly pressured by jackson to drink anyway and not take the test stars first time drinking alcohol he claimed was on the flight back from miami jackson allegedly handed him a diet coke can filled with wine38 star testified he did not know what the drink was when he tasted it and that it reminded him of the smell of rubbing alcohol a comparison gavin also made3538 star said gavin and michael were sharing the soda can and acting really weird38 however cynthia bell a flight attendant who had served jackson on the miami flight and other flights testified that she never saw him share his drink with gavin she testified that she had devised the custom of serving jackson wine in diet coke cans during flights because michael jackson didnt like to drink alcohol in front of his children61 evidence of prior bad actsedit the prosecution to show a pattern of behavior claimed they would present evidence admissible under california evidence code 1108 that jackson had molested five boys in the past three of the people they named macaulay culkin brett barnes and wade robson all testified that they were longtime family friends of jackson and had slept in his bed but that jackson never molested them or did anything sexual with them62 culkin said hed never seen him do anything improper with anybody and called the allegations absolutely ridiculous while barnes said they made him very mad566263 all three men described the time they spent in jacksons 2story bedroom as childish fun with video games movies and many people sleeping in the room at one time6364 culkin added that hed never seen jackson do anything improper with anybody and that he was shocked the prosecution would put on witnesses who said jackson molested him without even asking culkin if it was true64 the witnesses three exemployees at neverland ranch who testified that theyd seen jackson molest these young men were ralph chacon kassim abdool and adrian mcmanus65 these three belonged to a group of five exemployees who had sued michael jackson for wrongful termination in 1995 jackson counterclaiming that they had stolen property and sold some of it to tabloids won the suit and was awarded 60000 in damages the exemployees were fined for lying in court and were ordered to pay 14 million for jacksons legal fees65 jason francia the son of a former neverland maid was the only alleged prior victim to testify francia described three times he had been playing with jackson they were tickling each other and jackson ended up tickling francias little private region outside of his clothes for a few minutes each time with francia laughing all the while66 francia testified that the third time jackson had reached up the leg of francias shorts and touched his testicles66 francia claimed he needed five years of therapy because of the ordeal he received settlement money from jackson and testified that he thought he deserved even more francia also admitted that he and his mother had sold stories of his alleged inappropriate tickling to the tabloids66 when jason francia originally talked to the police after the 1993 allegations he told them he had never been touched inappropriately he made that claim only after extensive police questioning in which they repeatedly called jackson a molester and told jason that macaulay culkin was being molested right then and jason could put a stop to it if he confessed34 francia also testified that jackson gave him money after each tickling incident mirroring something francia said in his original police interview that jackson would give him money each time he finished reading a book or got an a66 the final alleged victim was jordan chandler who received a settlement from jackson in the 1993 case ralph chacon a former security guard at neverland ranch testified that he had watched through a window as jackson performed oral sex on chandler in the showers of a rec room65 chacon testified that he did not report the incident to police because he thought he would not be believed 67 adrian mcmanus a maid who had previously worked at neverland also testified that shed seen chandler and jackson kiss on the mouth and jackson put his hand on the boys crotch mcmanus admitted that she had previously told attorneys under oath that she had never seen any molestation mcmanus claimed that she lied because she feared jackson would report her to her superiors if she told police about the incident 67 during cross examination jacksons defense attorney questioned the credibility of both chacon and mcmanus attorney tom mesereau noted that both former neverland employees had been a part of a lawsuit against michael jackson filed in the mid1990s the employees lost the lawsuit and were ordered to pay jacksons legal fees as well as tens of thousands of dollars for stealing property from michael jackson mesereau accused mcmanus and chandler of attempting to get even with jackson for the failed suit 68 jordan chandler who was 25 at the time of the trial chose to leave the country rather than testify and the only person in his family who appeared for questioning was his mother june she denied having seen any molestation but talked about jordan and michael sleeping in the same room on numerous occasions explaining that she initially didnt want them to but was persuaded by jackson who had cried and been hurt that she didnt trust him6970 she testified about jackson buying all kinds of gifts for the family the trips theyd been on together and how fun it was to be part of jacksons world70 she said shed been concerned that her son was starting to dress like jackson and wanting to spend all his time with him70 when asked about the lawsuits that resulted from her familys involvement with michael jackson june chandler made the distinction that even though she was listed as a plaintiff and received settlement money it was not she who sued jackson but rather jordan and his father evan who did so she claimed not to recall that jackson had counter sued for extortion or that her second husband dave schwartz had sued jackson or that evan chandler had sued jackson a second time6970 thomas mesereau said in a harvard lecture later that year the prosecutors tried to get jordan to show up and he wouldnt if he had i had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say it turned out hed gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents34 june chandler testified that she had not spoken to her son jordan in 11 years since 19946970 jacksons financesedit the prosecution sought to have jacksons financial records exposed in the trial they claimed that jackson was a spendaholic who was from 1999 to 2001 spending 35 million a year while earning 11 million to 12 million a year and as a result was on the brink of bankruptcy they argued that this could have been a motive for jackson to resort to the alleged conspiracy to control the public relations damage of the bashir documentary and thus control the resulting financial damage based on motions filed by sanger the judge ruled that the prosecution could subpoena the financial records but that they would only be opened in the trial after he heard testimony that they are relevant despite these allegations according to forbes jackson was still making as much as 75 million a year from his publishing partnership with sony71 prosecution witnesses credibilityedit not only was the credibility of the main accuser his mother and entire family in question but also that of the many witnesses called to testify in the trial prosecution witness chris carter who had been jacksons bodyguard from august 2002 through august 2003 was arrested in las vegas on february 19 2005 after police searched his mothers house and found a handgun in addition he had been accused of robbing a radioshack in october 2003 a subway sandwich shop in august 2004 a kb toys store in january 2005 and a jack in the box restaurant in february 2005 he refused to testify adrian mcmanus a former maid in neverland and one of the neverland five who lost their suit against jackson was convicted of stealing a sketch of elvis presley made by jackson and selling it to a tabloid for 30000 philippe lamarque a potential witness who ultimately did not testify was the host of a porn site called virtual sin tapes of a conversation he had with paul baressi revealed that for 100000 lamarque would say he saw jackson touch macaulay culkins crotch outside of his shorts but for 500000 the hand would go inside the shorts72 journalist matt taibbi wrote the trial featured perhaps the most compromised collection of prosecution witnesses ever assembled in an american criminal casethe chief drama of the trial quickly turned into a race to see if the da could manage to put all of his witnesses on the stand without getting any of them removed from the courthouse in manacles73 verdictedit at approximately 225 pm pdt 2125 utc on june 13 2005 the jury of the superior court of the state of california held in and for the county of santa barbara determined that jackson was not guilty on all 10 felony and all 4 misdemeanor charges court datesedit 200574 january 31 – jury selection begins february 24 – jurors and

jackson showed up late again complaining of back trouble after meeting with attorneys and the doctor melville resumed the court into session without threatening to revoke jacksons bail allegations of media bias against jacksonedit in 2010 charles thomson wrote a piece for the huffington post one of the most shameful episodes in journalistic history in which he detailed the story as he saw it of why the trial that was relayed to us didnt even resemble the trial that was going on inside the courtroom34 luka neskovic also wrote an article for the huffington post how the media shattered the man in the mirror in which he said except for this trial was declared a trial of the century and displayed media at their worst sensationalism exclusivity negativity excentricism chaos and hysteria were some of the features after all that was the thing that interested them and us the most and unfortunately there are few who do not fit into stated majority75 during the trial matt drudge accused the media of largely ignoring testimony and evidence that exonerated jackson and said out heremichael jackson is being literally crucifiedi think if you did a pulse poll of people listening to these local talk shows they would say 95 that michael jackson did all thisbecause its based on the coverage court tv hired tabloid journalist diane dimond to cover the trial even though dimond had previously been sued by jackson and evaded the suit with the help of prosecutor sneddon aftermathedit after the trial michael jackson moved to bahrain the neverland ranch which he said had been despoiled by law enforcement searches was closed in may 2013 choreographer wade robson who had testified in the trial in defense of jackson said in an interview with the today shows matt lauer that from the age of seven to around 14 jackson performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him recent tabloid journalism claimed that during jacksons trial blanca francia a former housekeeper of jacksons testified that she had witnessed jackson showering with robson when robson was 8 or 9 years old which robson denied in may 2013 francia agreed to testify at robsons lawsuit against jackson at robsons request7677 in august 2014 james safechucks lawyers filed claims against jacksons estate that jackson began sexually abusing safechuck when he was 10 years old78 safechuck alleged that jackson sexually abused him over 100 times in a 4year period79 in july 2017 judge beckloff ruled against safechucks case80 see alsoedit michael jackson portal california portal 2000s portal 1993 child sexual
