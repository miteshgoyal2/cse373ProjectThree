internship from wikipedia the free encyclopedia   redirected from intern jump to navigation search intern redirects here for training for a physician who has completed medical school see internship medicine for other senses of this term see intern disambiguation an internship is a job training for white collar and professional careers12 internships for professional careers are similar in some ways but not as rigorous as apprenticeships for professions trade and vocational jobs3 but the lack of standardisation and oversight leaves the term open to broad interpretation45 interns may be high school students college and university students or postgraduate adults these positions may be paid or unpaid and are usually temporary generally an internship consists of an exchange of services for experience between the student and an organization students can also use an internship to determine if they have an interest in a particular career to create a network of contacts to acquire a recommendation letter to add to their curriculum vitae or to gain school credit some interns find permanent paid employment with the organizations for which they worked upon completion of the internship this can be a significant benefit to the employer as experienced interns often need little or no training when they begin regular employment it also helps an employer in gauging a students aptitude since grade inflation has undermined the reliability of academic grades6 unlike a trainee program employment at the completion of an internship is not guaranteed contents 1 types 2 fees for

typesedit internships exist in a wide variety of industries and settings an internship may be paid unpaid or partially paid in the form of a stipend stipends are typically a fixed amount of money that is paid out on a regular basis usually interns that are paid through stipends are paid on a monthly basis paid internships are common in professional fields including medicine architecture science engineering law business especially accounting and finance technology and advertising 7 nonprofit charities and think tanks often have unpaid volunteer positions internships may be parttime or fulltime a typical internship lasts between one and four months8 but can be shorter or longer depending on the organisation involved the act of job shadowing may also constitute interning the two primary types of internships that exist in the united states are work experience most often this is in the second or third year of the school period the placement can be from two months to one full school year during this period the student is expected to use the things they have learned in school and put them into practice this way the student gains work experience in their field of study the gained experience will be helpful to finish the final year of study research graduation or dissertation this is mostly done by students who are in their final year with this kind of internship a student does research for a particular company the company can have something that they feel they need to improve or the student can choose a topic within the company themselves the results of the research study will be put in a report and often will have to be presentedcitation needed european internships are popular among noneuropeans in order to gain international exposure on ones résumé and for foreign language improvement although they may be unpaidcitation needed another type of internship growing in popularity is the virtual internship in which the intern works remotely and is not physically present at the job location it provides the capacity to gain job experience without the conventional requirement of being physically present in an office the internship is conducted via virtual means such as phone email and web communication virtual interns generally have the opportunity to work at their own pace9 fees for internship and charity auctionsedit some companies now find and place students in mostly unpaid internships for a fee10 these companies charge to assist with a search promising to refund their fees if no internship is found11 these programs vary but they claim to provide internship placements at reputable companies provide controlled housing in a new city mentorship and support throughout the summer networking weekend activities in some programs and sometimes academic credit12 another form of paying for internships is through charity auctions a company with an internship will select a charity who will obtain an internship position funded by the auction in some cases companies have created internships simply to help a charity10 some claim that feebased programs and charity auctions restrict internship opportunities to students in wealthier families12 these companies respond that the average student comes from the middle class and that their parents dig deep to pay for it some companies specifically fund scholarships and grants for lowincome applicants critics of internships decry the practice of requiring certain college credits to be obtained only through unpaid internships depending on the cost of the school this is often seen as an unethical practice as it requires students to exchange paidfor and often limited tuition credits in order to work an uncompensated job even if the school does not require credit for an internship companies offering the internship often pressure colleges to give college credit so interns do not complain that they receive nothing for their efforts paying for academic credits can also be seen as a way to ensure that students complete the duration of the internship as they can be held accountable by their academic institution for example a student may be awarded academic credit only after their university receives a positive review from the interns supervisor at the sponsoring organization some employers feel that this enables them to view the intern as having some skin in the game by regionedit internship laws and practices vary widely from country to country and region to region manilaedit manila is often chosen as one of the most popular options for internships specifically for international humanitarian organizations this is mainly because the city houses many humanitarian organizations who are willing and capable to provide training and experience to

newspaper a magazine or a radio station they are required to research and write stories for publication and broadcast and get experience in a fastpaced news environment europeedit denmarkedit work without pay is inappropriate in denmark one way it can be done is as part of a worktrial where a person is tested by the authorities in conjunction with putting the individual back into the workplace21 it is also common within most danish universities to place students in free work jobs the company is then compensated and the intern receives welfare during this period this normally lasts about three months the danish trade unions monitor this type of work very closely so the hiring of an intern does not result in the loss of a paid job2223 in 2008 a new system established by the department of education may lower the motivation of students who take time to work for charities24 students and citizens of the eeaeu area can freely move and reside in denmark under eu rules if their stay exceeds three months then an application for registration with the regional state administration has to be filed25 if the student comes from outside the european union than the following rules to

studies the respective internship provider must be able to offer appropriate work salary and employment conditions must comply with the regulations of the danish collective agreements a detailed description of the internship and its objective must be handed in with the application26 furthermore there are special rules for agricultural healthcare and architectural internships26 european unionedit the european commission operates a sizeable traineeship programme franceedit at french universities internships known as stages are common the duration of french internships usually varies from two to six months which is the maximal legal length french labor law requires that all internships lasting two months or longer include a minimum stipend €360 per hour in 201627 internships in france are also popular for international students the primary reason international students intern in france is to learn to speak french fluently french companies greatly appreciate employees who speak multiple languages and thus international opportunities are available28 germanyedit as in most other countries most students take their internship german praktikum between the fourth or fifth semester of their degree at a university of applied sciences in some fields of study it is common to write the final thesis in a company as part of an internship some degrees do not require practical training in order to graduate another type of internship has emerged in recent years is the post graduation internship the purpose of a post graduation internship is to equip the student with knowledge and tools to be successful in their future position these post graduation internships should last between six and ten months29 italyedit since the italian university system entered the bologna process an internship experience commonly referred to by the french term stage has been made compulsory for almost all those who are studying for a bachelors or a masters degree especially in technical economic or scientific faculties the goal of this process is to reduce the gap between companies demands and the often very theoretical learning offered by italian universities however since the internship is usually completed at university as well and since only few companies who employ student interns rarely offer proper training these internships are generally not considered real work experience almost all students therefore have to do a second or a third internship after they have completed their studies hoping to receive appropriate professional training and possibly getting employed afterward in the same company or in another company in a close or related business italian internships can last up to six months and can be extended for another six months for a potential year long internship internships in italy can be either paid or unpaid student internships especially the ones not involved with the development of a thesis are usually not paid almost all graduate internships are paid but the remuneration is usually only around 600 euros gross per month that is about ¼ of the gross monthly remuneration of an hired young graduate employee and without benefits other than lunch and a few paid days for sickness or vacationcitation needed this poses a problem for graduates considering as well that some companies use graduate interns just to save money making them work for 6 to 12 months without giving them a decent remuneration without offering them proper training or formation and without hiring them after the internship even if they were shown to be productive fastlearning and trustworthy in order to get an internship graduates have to go to interviews which might be held in cities far from the ones in which graduates have been studying netherlandsedit in the netherlands it is also common to perform internships during collegecitation needed which like in belgium and france is called a stage most student internships last between 3 and 10 monthscitation needed companies are not obligated to pay the student so sometimes small companies do not pay anything unpaid internships are also the de facto standard in education the normal internship compensation rate in the netherlands is around €300 per monthcitation needed depending on education level and company generosity netherlands no5 spainedit at spanish universities internship during the education period are uncommon real work experience for students begins only when they are done with their study some spanish companies are getting more used to having student internships—mostly these are international students from other european countries often students want to learn spanish placement organizations may be needed as spanish companies are harder to contact directly the normal stage compensation rate in spain is around €500 per month retribution is regulated in many universities starting from €6 per hour given these rates spanish employers who do hire interns often may be taking advantage of unpaid interships in order to get free labor30 united kingdomedit main article work experience in the united kingdom work experience is offered as part of the national curriculum to secondary school students in years 10 and 11 14 to 16 years of age generally these placements are unpaid during their degree programme students may apply for internships during the summer holidays university staff give students access and students apply direct to employers some students opt to apply for yearlong placements often referred to as sandwich placements between the penultimate and final year of their degree this is done as part of a degree programme some universities and employers hold fairs and exhibitions to encourage students to consider the option and to enable students to meet potential employers31 in the modern labour market graduates with internship work experience are deemed more desirable to employers the purpose of these placements is varied some university students see it as a way to develop their employability by utilising the academic elements of their degree in a practical setting international students may also seek to get understanding about how work is conducted in the englishspeaking world and to experience cultural diversity organisations such as the trades union congress and intern aware have been lobbying for a change in british internships to make interns aware of their employment law rights especially in relation to whether they are entitled to minimum wage and paid holidays3233 the legal status of volunteers and interns is not always clear various factors determine whether an individual is classed as an employee a worker a volunteer or selfemployed and these often require further examination34 north americaedit main article cooperative education canadaedit in canada high school college and university student placements are typically referred to as coops cooperative education programs university coop programs are often highly competitive students must apply to and compete for admission as enrollment is limited partnering employers will post placement opportunities through the university these positions typically span a fourmonth term taking place either during summer break or during the school year some summer internships require proof that the student is returning to school in the fall while some internships are unpaid particularly in media advertising pr and communications there are a few canadian organizations that do offer paid internships not all internships are entrylevel positions organizations may also offer internships for midlevel professionals for example in the province of ontario paid internships are available for immigrants who have extensive experience in other countries but lack relevant canadian experience the nature and scope of unpaid internships in canada is difficult to estimate this is in part because there are no written regulations defining internships directly minimum wage for labour is covered by employment standards legislation and is governed at the provincial level ontario provides for a sixpoint test to be applied to determine if an employeeemployer relationship does not exist where all of the conditions must be met35 the training is similar to that which is given in a vocational school the training is for the benefit of the individual the person providing the training derives little if any benefit from the activity of the individual while he or she is being trained the individual does not displace employees of the person providing the training the individual is not accorded a right to become an employee of the person providing the training the individual is advised that he or she will receive no remuneration for the time that he or she spends in training united statesedit many internships in the united states are career specific students often choose internships based on their major at the university or college level it is not uncommon for former interns to acquire fulltime employment at an organization once they have enough necessary experience the challenging job market has made it essential for college students to gain real world experience prior to graduation yet only 37 of unpaid interns have job offers awaiting them at graduation compared to 60 of paid interns and 36 of students with no internship experience36 in the us company internships are at the center of nigms funded biotechnology training programs37 for science phd students the office of personnel management of the us federal government operation operates a robust internship program for college students and recent graduates38 not all internships are paid many internships that are unpaid involve receiving college credit especially if an internship is correlated with a specific class the us department of labors wage and hour division allows an employer not to pay a trainee if all of the following are true39 the training even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer is similar to what would be given in a vocational school or academic educational instruction the training is for the benefit of the trainees the trainees do not displace regular employees but work under their close observation the employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees and on occasion the employer’s operations may actually be impeded the trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the training period the employer and the trainees understand that the trainees are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training an exception is allowed for individuals who volunteer their time freely and without anticipation of compensation for religious charitable civic or humanitarian purposes to nonprofit organizations40 an exception is also allowed for work performed for a state or local government agency40 some states have their own laws on the subject41 laws in the state of california for example require an employer to pay its interns working in california or offer the intern academic or college credit for their time and labor41 as another example in the state of new york for forprofit companies the activities of trainees or students cannot provide an immediate advantage to the employer on the other hand trainees or students do not receive employee benefits like health and dental insurance pension or retirement credit discounted or free goods and services from the employer etc42 in april 2014 condé nast settled the ballinger vs advance magazine publishers inc lawsuit over unpaid interns43 former w magazine intern lauren ballinger and former new yorker intern matthew leib filed the lawsuit in federal court in the southern district of new york in june 201343 the interns claimed that they were paid below minimum wage when working for the condé nast titles and as a result condé nast decided to discontinue its unpaid intern program43 in 2012 a former harper’s bazaar intern sued hearst magazines because of a claim of violating minimum wage and overtime laws43 the judge dismissed that case but the intern appealed the ruling43 in new york federal court the fox searchlight pictures litigation is a classaction suit claiming that fox violated federal and state minimum wage laws by not paying production interns working on its black swan film43 in june 2013 the judge ruled that the unpaid interns were employees which are entitled to wages under the federal labor standards act43 fox searchlight pictures later appealed the ruling44 south americaedit braziledit internships in brazil are known as estágios and internship workers are known as estagiários the term estágio applies to both company internships and academic internships academic internships are usually arranged for college credit research hours brazilian research projects do not usually allocate funds for paid interns and as a result academic internships are often unpaid company and industry internships are regulated by the lei do estágio internship law which requires that companies provide a monthly salary and personal injury service the lei do estágio further stipulates a limit of 30 worked hours per week45 estagiários also have the right to 30 days of paid holidays for each year worked in practice legal interns in big law and others in professional services routinely work past that limit and receive no vacation time africaedit nigeriaedit an internship in nigeria is called a student industrial
