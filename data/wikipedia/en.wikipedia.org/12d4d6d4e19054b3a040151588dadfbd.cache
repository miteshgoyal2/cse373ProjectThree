broadway cast sing i feel pretty 1957 genesisedit in 1947 jerome robbins approached leonard bernstein and arthur laurents about collaborating on a contemporary musical adaptation of romeo and juliet he proposed that the plot focus on the conflict between an irish catholic family and a jewish family living on the lower east side of manhattan6 during the easter–passover season the girl has survived the holocaust and emigrated from israel the conflict was to be centered around antisemitism of the catholic jets towards the jewish emeralds a name that made its way into the script as a reference7 eager to write his first musical laurents immediately agreed bernstein wanted to present the material in operatic form but robbins and laurents resisted the suggestion they described the project as lyric theater and laurents wrote a first draft he called east side story only after he completed it did the group realize it was little more than a musicalization of themes that had already been covered in plays like abies irish rose when he opted to drop out the three men went their separate ways and the piece was shelved for almost five years89 in 1955 theatrical producer martin gabel was working on a stage adaptation of the james m cain novel serenade about an opera singer who comes to the realization he is homosexual and he invited laurents to write the book laurents accepted and suggested bernstein and robbins join the creative team robbins felt if the three were going to join forces they should return to east side story and bernstein agreed laurents however was committed to gabel who introduced him to the young composerlyricist stephen sondheim sondheim auditioned by playing the score for saturday night his musical that was scheduled to open in the fall laurents liked the lyrics but was not impressed with the music sondheim did not care for laurents opinion serenade ultimately was shelved10 laurents was soon hired to write the screenplay for a remake of the 1934 greta garbo film the painted veil for ava gardner while in hollywood he contacted bernstein who was in town conducting at the hollywood bowl the two met at the beverly hills hotel and the conversation turned to juvenile delinquent gangs a fairly recent social phenomenon that had received major coverage on the front pages of the morning newspapers due to a chicano turf war bernstein suggested they rework east side story and set it in los angeles but laurents felt he was more familiar with puerto rican immigrants and harlem than he was with mexican americans and olvera street the two contacted robbins who was enthusiastic about a musical with a latin beat he arrived in hollywood to choreograph the dance sequences for the king and i and he and laurents began developing the musical while working on their respective projects keeping in touch with bernstein who had returned to new york when the producer of the painted veil replaced gardner with eleanor parker and asked laurents to revise his script with her in mind he backed out of the film freeing him to devote all his time to the stage musical11 collaboration and developmentedit in new york city laurents went to the opening night party for a new play by ugo betti and there he met sondheim who had heard that east side story now retitled west side story was back on track bernstein had decided he needed to concentrate solely on the music and he and robbins had invited betty comden and adolph green to write the lyrics but the team opted to work on peter pan instead laurents asked sondheim if he would be interested in tackling the task initially he resisted because he was determined to write the full score for his next project saturday night had been aborted but oscar hammerstein convinced him that he would benefit from the experience and he accepted12 meanwhile laurents had written a new draft of the book changing the characters backgrounds anton once an irish american was now of polish and irish descent and the formerly jewish maria had become a puerto rican13 the original book laurents wrote closely adhered to romeo and juliet but the characters based on rosaline and the parents of the doomed lovers were eliminated early on later the scenes related to juliets faking her death and committing suicide also were deleted language posed a problem fourletter curse words were uncommon in the theater at the time and slang expressions were avoided for fear they would be dated by the time the production opened laurents ultimately invented what sounded like real street talk but actually was not cut the frabbajabba for example14 sondheim converted long passages of dialogue and sometimes just a simple phrase like a boy like that would kill your brother into lyrics with the help of oscar hammerstein laurents convinced bernstein and sondheim to move one hand one heart which he considered too pristine for the balcony scene to the scene set in the bridal shop and as a result tonight was written to replace it laurents felt that the building tension needed to be alleviated in order to increase the impact of the plays tragic outcome so comic relief in the form of officer krupke was added to the second act he was outvoted on other issues he felt the lyrics to america and i feel pretty were too witty for the characters singing them but they stayed in the score and proved to be audience favorites another song kid stuff was added and quickly removed during the washington dc tryout when laurents convinced the others it was helping tip the balance of the show into typical musical comedy15 bernstein composed west side story and candide concurrently which led to some switches of material between the two works16 tony and marias duet one hand one heart was originally intended for cunegonde in candide the music of gee officer krupke was pulled from the venice scene in candide17 laurents explained the style that the creative team finally decided on18 just as tony and maria our romeo and juliet set themselves apart from the other kids by their love so we have tried to set them even further apart by their language their songs their movement wherever possible in the show we have tried to heighten emotion or to articulate inarticulate adolescence through music song or dance the show was nearly complete in the fall of 1956 but almost everyone on the creative team needed to fulfill other commitments first robbins was involved with bells are ringing then bernstein with candide and in january 1957 a clearing in the woods laurents latest play opened and quickly closed19 when a backers audition failed to raise any money for west side story late in the spring of 1957 only two months before the show was to begin rehearsals producer cheryl crawford pulled out of the project20 every other producer had already turned down the show deeming it too dark and depressing bernstein was despondent but sondheim convinced his friend hal prince who was in boston overseeing the outoftown tryout of the new george abbott musical new girl in town to read the script he liked it but decided to ask abbott his longtime mentor for his opinion and abbott advised him to turn it down prince aware that abbott was the primary reason new girl was in trouble decided to ignore him and he and his producing partner robert griffith flew to new york to hear the score21 in his memoirs prince recalled sondheim and bernstein sat at the piano playing through the music and soon i was singing along with them17 production periodedit larry kert as tony original broadway production 1957 kert and lawrence in the balcony scene 1957 prince began cutting the budget and raising money robbins then announced he did not want to choreograph the show but changed his mind when prince agreed to an eightweek dance rehearsal period instead of the customary four since there was to be more dancing in west side story than in any previous broadway show17 and allowed robbins to hire peter gennaro as his assistant22 originally when considering the cast laurents wanted james dean for the lead role of tony but the actor had recently died sondheim found larry kert and chita rivera who created the roles of tony and anita respectively getting the work on stage was still not easy bernstein said23 everyone told us that west side story was an impossible project and we were told no one was going to be able to sing augmented fourths as with maria also they said the score was too rangy for pop music besides who wanted to see a show in which the firstact curtain comes down on two dead bodies lying on the stage and then we had the really tough problem of casting it because the characters had to be able not only to sing but dance and act and be taken for teenagers ultimately some of the cast were teenagers some were 21 some were 30 but looked 16 some were wonderful singers but couldnt dance very well or vice versa and if they could do both they couldnt act throughout the rehearsal period the new york newspapers were filled with articles about gang warfare keeping the shows plot timely robbins kept the cast members playing the sharks and the jets separate in order to discourage them from socializing with each other and reminded everyone of the reality of gang violence by posting news stories on the bulletin board backstage24 robbins wanted a gritty realism from his sneaker and jeansclad cast he gave the ensemble more freedom than broadway dancers had previously been given to interpret their roles and the dancers were thrilled to be treated like actors instead of just choreographed bodies25 as the rehearsals wore on bernstein fought to keep his score together as other members of the team called on him to cut out more and more of the sweeping or complex operatic passages17 columbia records initially declined to record the cast album saying the score was too depressing and too difficult7 there were problems with oliver smiths designs his painted backdrops were stunning but the sets were for the most part either shabby looking or too stylized prince refused to spend money on new construction and smith was obliged to improve what he had as best he could with very little money to do it26 the prebroadway run in washington dc was a critical and commercial success although none of the reviews mentioned sondheim listed as colyricist who was overshadowed by the betterknown bernstein bernstein magnanimously removed his name as coauthor of the lyrics although sondheim was uncertain he wanted to receive sole credit for what he considered to be overly florid contributions by bernstein robbins demanded and received a conceived by credit and used it to justify his making major decisions regarding changes in the show without consulting the others as a result by opening night on broadway none of his collaborators were talking to him27 it has been rumored that while bernstein was off trying to fix the musical candide sondheim wrote some of the music for west side story and that bernsteins colyricist billing mysteriously disappeared from the credits of west side story during the tryout presumably as a tradeoff28 however suskin states in show tunes that as the writing progressed and the extent of bernsteins lyric contributions became less the composer agreed to rescind his creditcontrary to rumor sondheim did not write music for the show his only contribution came on somethings coming where he developed the main strain of the chorus from music bernstein wrote for the verse29 synopsisedit act 1edit two rival teenage gangs the jets white and the sharks puerto rican immigrants struggle for control of the neighborhood somewhere in the upper west side of new york city amidst the police

the gangs meet under the highway and as the fight between bernardo and diesel begins tony arrives and tries to stop it though bernardo taunts and provokes tony ridiculing his attempt to make peace tony keeps his composure when bernardo pushes tony riff punches him in tonys defense the two draw their switchblades and get in a fight the rumble tony attempts to intervene inadvertently leading to riff being fatally stabbed by bernardo tony kills bernardo in a fit of rage which in turn provokes an allout fight like the fight in the prologue the sound of approaching police sirens is heard and

music and theatrical style resulted in strong reactions from the critics walter kerr wrote in the new york herald tribune on september 27 195768 the radioactive fallout from west side story must still be descending on broadway this morning director choreographer and ideaman jerome robbins has put together and then blasted apart the most savage restless electrifying dance patterns weve been exposed to in a dozen seasons the show rides with a catastrophic roar over the spiderweb fireescapes the shadowed trestles and the plain dirt battlegrounds of a big city feud there is fresh excitement in the next debacle and the next when a gang leader advises his cohorts to play it cool the intolerable tension between an effort at control and the instinctive drives of these potential killers is stingingly graphic when the knives come out and bodies begin to fly wildly through space under buttermilk clouds the sheer visual excitement is breathtaking mr bernstein has permitted himself a few moments of graceful lingering melody in a yearning maria in the hushed falling line of tonight in the wistful declaration of i have a love but for the most part he has served the needs of the onstage threshing machine when hero larry kert is stomping out the visionary insistence of somethings coming both music and tumultuous story are given their due otherwise its the danced narrative that takes urgent precedence the other reviews generally joined in speculation about how the new work would influence the course of musical theater typical was john chapmans review in the new york daily news on september 27 1957 headed west side story a splendid and supermodern musical drama the american theatre took a venturesome forward step when the firm of griffith prince presented west side story at the winter garden last evening this is a bold new kind of musical theatre – a jukebox manhattan opera it is to me extraordinarily exciting the manner of telling the story is a provocative and artful blend of music dance and plot – and the music and the dancing are superb in the score there is the drive the bounce the restlessness and the sweetness of our town it takes up the american musical idiom where it was left when george gershwin died it is fascinatingly tricky and melodically beguiling and it marks the progression of an admirable composer time magazine found the dance and gang warfare more compelling than the love story and noted that the shows putting choreography foremost may prove a milestone in musicaldrama history 6970 while critics speculated about the comictragic darkness of the musical audiences were captivated the story appealed to societys undercurrent of rebellion from authority that surfaced in 1950s films like rebel without a cause west side story took this one step
