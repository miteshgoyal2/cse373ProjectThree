states and canada by michael jackson and the jackson family between july and december 1984 it was the only tour with all six jackson brothers even though jackie was injured for most of the tour the group performed 55 concerts to an audience of approximately 2 million most came to see michael whose album thriller was dominating the popular music world at the time many consider it to be his thriller tour with most of the songs on the set list coming off of his off the wall album and from the thriller album the tour reportedly grossed approximately 75 million us172893978 in 2016 dollars1 and set a new record for the highest grossing tour it showcased michaels single decorated glove black sequined jacket and moonwalk despite its focus on michael it was named after the newly released jacksons album victory although none of the albums songs were performed marlon confirmed this was because michael refused to rehearse or perform them in fact he had only reluctantly joined his brothers who needed the income while he himself did not on the tour tensions between michael and his brothers increased to the point that he announced at the final show that it would be the last time they would perform together ending plans for a european leg the jacksons did make money from the tour along with promoter don king michael donated his share to several charities as he had promised before it but the rancour between him and his brothers had a deep and lasting effect on the jacksons as a family alienating him from them for most of his later life and it effectively ended the jacksons as a performing group the tour was also a financial disaster for promoter chuck sullivan who along with his father billy was eventually forced to sell the new england patriots football team

1983 the jacksons announced plans for a major tour in 1984 at a press conference with boxing promoter don king offering 3 million us6915759 in 2016 dollars1 in upfront advances that spring the victory album was recorded to be released shortly before the tour itself on the eve of the tour in july michael announced in response to complaints about the lottery system for allocating tickets that his entire earnings for the tour would go to charities—the united negro college fund the michael jackson scholarship fund camp good times for terminally ill children and the tj martell foundation for leukemia and cancer research2 at the time the tour was announced the jacksons had not lined up a promoter for the shows in the spring of 1984 chuck sullivan son of billy sullivan owner of the new england patriots of the national football league nfl went to los angeles to see if he could get the jacksons to choose the teams home sullivan stadium which the family also owned for the groups bostonarea shows after using his financial and legal expertise to help his father regain control of the team he had founded and built in the wake of a 1974 boardroom coup the younger sullivan who had promoted concerts as an undergraduate at boston college and during his army service in thailand had begun staging concerts at the stadium to generate extra income for the team3 planning and organizationedit at a meeting frank dileo a vice president at epic records the jacksons label told sullivan that the groups talks with its original promoter had broken down and they were seeking a replacement sensing an opportunity sullivan returned to boston and began putting together the financing to allow stadium management corp smc the patriots subsidiary that operated the stadium to promote the entire victory tour initially he partnered with eddie debartolo then owner of another nfl team the san francisco 49ers in putting together a bid offering the jacksons twothirds of the tours gross revenue against a guaranteed 40 million 922 million in modern dollars13 debartolo withdrew when he began to see the deal as too risky but sullivan persevered by himself and in late april dileo told him at another meeting in los angeles that smc which had never handled a tour would be the promoter of the years most eagerly anticipated concert tour expected to gross 70–80 million the deal was very generous to the jacksons sullivan had agreed that they would receive 834 of gross potential ticket revenues which meant in practical terms that the group would be paid as if the show had sold out regardless of whether it actually did that percentage was at least 25 points above what was at that time the industry standard for artists on tour3 sullivan stadium used as collateral to finance the tour as seen shortly before its demolition in the early 2000s sullivan also guaranteed the jacksons a 366 million 844 million in modern dollars1 advance he put the stadium up as collateral for a 125 million loan to pay the first installment shortly before the tour started the balance was due two weeks later3 the month after winning the tour bid sullivan approached stadium managers at the nfls meetings many of whom were there to bid for future super bowls he sought changes to their usual arrangements with touring performers in order to make the victory tour more profitable kansas citys arrowhead stadium home of the chiefs agreed to accept only a 100000 fee for the three opening concerts instead of its usual percentage of ticket sales and concessions the gator bowl in jacksonville florida provided nearly half a million dollars worth of free goods and services ultimately 26 of the 55 dates were played in 17 stadiums that were home to nfl teams3 but some others balked at sullivans demands to use john f kennedy stadium he asked the city of philadelphia for almost 400000 in tax breaks and subsidies among them were free hotel rooms and suites for all tour workers free use of the stadium and waiver of concession revenue he said the jacksons presence would generate revenue that would make up the difference but the city stood firm on some provisions3 outside of negotiations his behavior on tour further embarrassed the jacksons on some occasions at washingtons rfk stadium he forgot his pass and was denied entry4 sullivan was particularly humiliated when the board of selectmen in foxboro where his familys team and stadium were located uncharacteristically denied a permit for the concert citing the unknown element what that meant has never been clear it has been suggested that they were racially motivated there had been continuing security concerns about the stadium during patriots games and previous concerts but the board had never denied permits on that basis before4 to help defray the tours costs the jacksons sought a corporate sponsor they had all but concluded a lucrative deal with quaker oats when king came to them with a deal he had already signed with pepsi although it would pay them less money they had to take it and break off talks with quaker part of the deal was that michael who did not drink pepsi would have to do two commercials he made sure that his face appeared minimally in them to avoid overexposing his image during filming of one of the two commercials michael suffered second and third degree burns on his scalp when a firework effect malfunctioned catching his hair on fire many people including friends and associates of his believe this incident is what sparked his problems with prescription drug abuse5678 ticket controversy and other business issuesedit king sullivan and the jacksons father joe jackson who no longer managed any of his sons by that point came up with a way to generate additional revenue from ticket sales those wishing to attend would have to send a postal money order for 120 280 in modern dollars1 along with a special form to a lottery to buy blocks of four tickets at 30 apiece us69 in 2016 dollars1 ostensibly to curtail scalpers upon receipt the money was to be deposited into a standard money market account earning 7 annual interest it would take six to eight weeks for the lottery to be held and money to be refunded to the unsuccessful purchasers since only one in ten purchasers would win the lottery and receive tickets there would be more money in the bank for that time period than there were tickets to sell and they expected to earn 10–12 million in interest8 joe jackie tito jermaine marlon and randy were all in favor of the plan but michael was not and he warned them that it would be a public relations disaster the 30 ticket already higher than most touring acts namely prince and bruce springsteen charged at the time was compounded by the requirement to buy four this put tickets out of reach of many of his africanamerican fans who were not financially secure that community was joined by many commentators in the media in vociferously criticizing the jacksons over the plan8 nevertheless when newspapers published the form for tickets to the first show in kansas citys arrowhead stadium in late june fans lined up at stores before they opened to buy them a local radio disk jockey said some newspapers were even stolen from lawns9 on july 5 1984 after receiving a letter from elevenyearold fan ladonna jones who accused the jacksons and their promoters of being selfish and just out for money michael held a press conference to announce changes in the tours organization and also to announce that his share of the proceeds from the tour would be donated to charity jones later received vip treatment at the dallas concert the following is michaels speech at a press conference on july 5 1984 the day before the tour began a lot of people are having trouble getting tickets the other day i got a letter from a fan in texas named ladonna jones shed been saving her money from odd jobs to buy a ticket but with the turned tour system shed have to buy four tickets and she couldnt afford that so we asked our promoter to work out a new way of distributing tickets a way that no longer requires a money order there has also been a lot of talk about the promoter holding money for tickets that didnt sell ive asked our promoter to end the mail order ticket system as soon as possible so that no one will pay money unless they get a ticket finally and most importantly theres something else i am going to announce today i want you to know that i decided to donate all my money i make from our performance to charity there will be further press statements released in the next two weeks afterwards the procedures were modified but all sales continued to be made by mail except for the six final shows at dodger stadium where tickets were also sold through ticketmaster tickets were typically made available only a week to ten days in advance and many tickets ended up in the hands of ticket brokers financial difficultiesedit arrowhead stadium where the tour opened as it appeared at the time the tour sold what was then a record number of tickets despite the high price10 the opening shows were widely covered in the national media and sold out anybody who sees this show will be a better person for years to come king told the media before the first date in kansas city michael jackson has transcended all earthly bounds every race color and creed is waiting for this tour8 sullivan had estimated in june that he would make up to 13 million but by august he had reduced that estimate by more than threequarters to 3 million transporting the 365ton 331 t stage michael had designed which took up onethird of a football field approximately 19200 square feet 1780 m2 required over 30 tractor trailers it was so large it required using some of the seating area in some venues taking as much as a quarter of the potential available seats off the market4 before the tour began sullivan had spent nearly a million dollars on legal fees and insurance among the 250 workers on the tour payroll was an ambiance director who provided homey touches to the traveling parlor the group relaxed in before and after shows overhead costs were soon averaging around a million dollars a week far over expectations and sullivan was unable to pay the 24 million balance on the advance he renegotiated the deal down to 75 of gross potential seat revenues soon after the tour began3 jackson family tensionsedit tensions between michael and his brothers increased during the tour he stayed at his own hotels and flew between stops on a private jet while the rest of the family flew commercial at one point he demanded that a publicist be fired and when he found out right before a show that she had not been he refused to go on until she was michael had also been disappointed that his idol james brown declined his invitation to join the group on stage at madison square garden in new york city due to browns continued outrage about the ticket lottery8 the other jacksons also had grievances with michael he turned down a multimilliondollar offer from a movie producer to film one of the shows that his brothers had accepted only to have a crew he had hired show up to shoot its own film several nights later they subsequently blocked its release despite a pretour agreement that only the jacksons themselves could ride in the van chartered to take them to shows michael began taking child star emmanuel lewis along with them later after a similar agreement over a helicopter that took the brothers to a show at giants stadium in east rutherford new jersey michael showed up with julian lennon son of slain exbeatle john lennon and his brothers glared at him for the entire flight before the tour was halfway completed the brothers were taking separate vehicles to concerts8 the brothers all stayed on different floors of their hotels and refused to talk to each other on the way to shows meetings broke down among factions with two lawyers frequently representing michaels interests another jermaines and one more for the other threeclarification needed it was the worst experience michael had ever had with his brothers said a longtime family friend some were jealous there was denial the whole gamut of human emotions8 other issuesedit health issues also affected the tour jackie jackson missed the first half with a leg injury supposedly sustained during rehearsals at one point michael became so exhausted and dehydrated from the stress of quarreling with his brothers that he was placed under medical care8 by the later shows on the tour its novelty had worn off and the strains were having an effect although the victory album was certified double platinum by the riaa for sales of 2 million copies11 the shows were increasingly failing to sell out dates planned for pittsburgh were cancelled extra shows in chicago made up the difference by early october the time of the shows in torontos exhibition stadium a total of 50000 tickets had gone unsold so sullivan renegotiated again getting the jacksons to agree to revenues based on actual sales3 things did not improve as the tour reached its final leg on the west coast in late november the shows at sun devil stadium in tempe arizona just outside phoenix were canceled officially the reason was that jermaine was too sick with the flu to perform but there was some speculation that slow ticket sales played a role as well sullivan was so short of cash he stopped payment on a 19 million check to the group after the vancouver dates immediately afterwards he suffered a minor heart attack and left the hospital early to renegotiate with the jacksons again claiming losses of 5–6 million by this time the parties were no longer meeting in person the jacksons agreed to waive the stopped payment in return for a greater share of revenue from the six final shows in los angeless dodger stadium sullivans estimated profit was down to half a million dollars3 the jacksons and don king had made money even though sullivan had not and near the end of the tour they began making plans for a european leg when word reached michael he let them know through his representatives that he would not be taking part at the rainsoaked tour finale in los angeles dodger stadium after six soldout shows michael announced at the end of the show to his brothers shocked expressions that this would be the last time they all performed together the plans to go to europe were ended8 aftermathedit michaels announcement generated some great backlash from his brothers don kings reaction was blunt theres no way michael should be as big as he is and treat his family the way he does he feels his father done him wrong his father may have done some wrong but he also had to do a whole lot right  what michaels got to realize is that hes a nigger  hes one of the megastars of the world but hes still going to be a nigger megastar he must accept that not only must he understand that hes got to accept it and demonstrate that he wants to be a nigger why to show that a nigger can do it michael was so upset when he learned of kings remarks that he called his lawyer john branca and said sue the bastard that guy has been pushing my last nerve since day one branca calmed him down and persuaded him to drop the idea8 financially the jacksons themselves ended up making very good money based on excellent ticket sales and the financial deal they struck with sullivan the jacksons netted approximately 36 million which worked out to about 7 million for each brother most of which they spent on expensive lifestyles michael who alone did not need the money donated his share of the proceeds from the tour approx 5 million us11526265 in 2016 dollars1 to three charities as he had earlier promised including the tj martell foundation for leukemia and cancer research the united negro college fund and camp ronald mcdonald for good times12 he had also received an 18 million advance us41494555 in 2016 dollars1 from sullivan for a michael jackson designer jeans brand few of which were ever produced and sold before sullivan had to stop production8 estimates of smcs losses have ranged from 13 million to 22 million 30 million to 507 million in modern dollars1 sullivan and his father quietly put the word out around the nfl that the patriots and their stadium were for sale their 100 million asking price for the combined package made more sense when the patriots qualified for super bowl xx after the next season the first time they had ever done so3 an early deal for the team collapsed and the patriots limped on even after making the super bowl the teams revenue was not nearly enough for the sullivans to service the debt from the victory tour at one point they were so close to bankruptcy that the nfl had to advance them 4 million to make their payroll sullivans woes increased when his wife filed for divorce and he had to set up a luxury box at the stadium as his personal living quarters he allegedly wrote several letters to michael begging the star for money to bail the team out but michael never replied4 the sullivans finally gave up and sold the patriots to victor kiam in 1988 however kiam was unable to keep himself or the team financially stable either and eventually they were sold again in 1992 to james orthwein who nearly moved the team to st louis before selling it in 1994 to robert kraft their current owner under whose management have appeared in eight super bowls winning five kraft had entered the picture some years earlier when he bought sullivan stadium out of bankruptcy he has a victory tour poster in his office as a reminder of how he was able to realize his lifelong dream of owning the patriots4 peopleedit aside from a few months in mid1975 the victory tour era marked the only time that all six jackson brothers worked together at the same time as a band jackie jackson missed most of the tour because of a leg injury that injury was described at the time as a knee injury incurred during strenuous rehearsals13 margaret maldonado the mother of two of jermaine jacksons children has alleged that jackie in fact broke his leg in an automobile accident his first wife enid ran him over in a parking lot after catching him with another woman jackie would recover and was able to rejoin his brothers on stage for the last portion of the tour1314 michael sang all the lead vocals except for a medley of jermaines solo hitscitation needed eddie van halen made at least two special guest appearances doing the beat it guitar solocitation needed shortly after the tour ended michael returned to his solo career and marlon left the group to start his own solo career without the jacksonscitation needed set listedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed
