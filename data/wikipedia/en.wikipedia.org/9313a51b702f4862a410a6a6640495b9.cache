the set and walk through a cloud of smoke and come out as their regular age a boy and his grandmother spot michael and prompts the other tourist fans to get off the bus and chase him for an autograph in an attempt to avoid the overzealous fans including camerahappy japanese tourists accompanied by stereotyped oriental music the press and even the noid plus some gunslingers after stumbling upon the filming of a western helmed by a director resembling steven spielberg jackson soon disguises himself as a rabbit named spike using a costume from one of the film sets imbued with animatronic properties using claymation giving a similar combinedmedia effect as who framed roger rabbit but with more obvious bluescreening but ends up taunting the fans into chasing him once they realize it is him michael steals a motorcycle in order to flee with the fans and paparazzi now also appearing in claymation form giving chase in various other more cartoonish vehicles during the chase he morphs into other celebrities namely sylvester stallone tina turner and peewee herman with the bike also briefly morphing into a jackhammer stop sign waterski and jet pack in repeatedly unsuccessful attempts to throw the fans off after a long chase the fans press are finally thwarted by crashing into a giant claymation cop and are arrested freed of their attention michael rides on into the desert and as the sun rises he pulls over in a canyon to remove the spike costume the costume then comes to life and challenges him to an extended danceoff in the end a passing traffic cop interrupts michael to point out he is in a no dancing zone and when michael turns to show him that he was competing with the rabbit he sees that the rabbit has disappeared the cop then sarcastically asks for michaels autograph as opposed to signature on the ticket just as michael is preparing to leave the rabbits head materializes on a nearby rocky crag which then nods to him and smiles leave me aloneedit the fifth segment of the film is the animated music video for the song leave me alone focusing on media interest in jacksons personal life because he had felt that people wouldnt leave him alone it compares jacksons life to an amusement park it is meant to point out in a mocking tone the way the media unnecessarily sensationalized his life with claims that he had a shrine to elizabeth taylor and bought the elephant mans bones in the video jacksons life is portrayed as a circus due to the presss manipulation and the everyday tugofwar he endured as an artist his beloved thenpet chimp bubbles

they are like animals smooth criminaledit the segment begins with three homeless children sean katie and zeke sneaking through a big city to see their friend michael walk out of his apartment as

happier times their dog skipper runs away and as michael and katie look for him they uncover the lair of mr big whose real name frankie lideo is an allusion to frank dileo michael jackson’s then manager is a drugdealing mobster with an army of henchmen he wants to get the entire population of earth addicted to drugs starting with children he likes to eat monkey nuts and leaves nutshells wherever he goes he is obsessed with spiders as displayed by their abundance at the entrance to his lair he also has them engulfing a model globe when making a speech about his burgeoning drug empire they signify the spread of his proposed control of the world via drug dealing further all his henchmen sport a spider crest on their uniforms mr big discovers michael and katie are spying on his operation the story returns to the shooting in front of michaels apartment unknown to the gangsters michael wished on the falling star and escaped the gunfire leaving only his jacket upon realizing he has escaped again mr big orders his henchmen to track down michael with dogs he is eventually cornered in an alley where he wishes on another falling star and turns into a lancia stratos sportscar that mows down several of mr bigs henchmen michael is pursued through the city streets until he loses the henchmen meanwhile the children scout out club 30s where michael had told them to meet him and find only an abandoned and haunted nightclub as michael arrives katie sees a silhouette of him turning back from a car into himself the door of the club opens with a gust of wind and michael walks in to find it filled with zoot suiters and swing dancers the children gather outside a window of the club and watch michael dance to smooth criminal the song used in the film is much longer than the album release with several lyrics that clarify the story there is also an interlude where jackson joins the other dancers in a modern interpretive dance at the climax of the song mr big lays siege to the club and kidnaps katie michael follows them back to bigs lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen mr big appears and taunts michael by threatening to inject katie with highly addictive narcotics while katie manages to wriggle free mr big decides hes had enough and orders his men to kill katie before finishing off michael but not before a falling star flies by michael transforms into

by april 17 19893 critical receptionedit the film received mixed reviews critics praised the music though complained that there was no plot and that it seemed like a series of music videos tied together variety reported that moonwalker seems unsure of what it was supposed to be at the center of the pic is the smooth criminal segment a musicaldramatic piece full of dancing schmaltzy kids scifi effects and blazing machine guns directed by academy award winner colin chilvers based on a story by jackson around it are really just numerous jackson music videos with little or no linkage although quite enjoyable the whole affair does not make for a structured or professional movie4 moonwalker was released on vhs and remained 1 on billboards video chart for 22 weeks5 the video software dealers association awarded jackson with an award for moonwalker in 19896 in 1989 moonwalker was honoured with a certification of 800000 copies sold by the recording industry association of america

soundtrack10 the release has been censored with the scenes of mr big hitting katie and threatening to inject her with heroin cut11 it is also cropped to 169 from the home releases 43 aspect ratio although the european theatrical release was originally in widescreen which may possibly mean that the cropped version is how the film was intended to be seen because of specific music and film licensing moonwalker has never been officially released by warner bros or any other studio in north america on dvd or bluray however imported regionfree dvd copies of the film from japan or china have surfaced throughout the web certification country certification sales canada 4× platinum12 50000 uk 8× platinum13 400000 usa 8× platinum3 800000 parodyedit a parody sequel of moonwalker was released in 2011 by deram films entitled return of the moonwalker many of the songs from the original are parodied including smooth criminal14 other mediaedit video gamesedit main article michael jacksons moonwalker moonwalker was first adapted in game form to home various computers by british developer us gold this topdown action game followed the segments of the film and bore little resemblance to the latter more popular games developed by sega with michael jacksons cooperation moonwalker was developed into an arcade video game by sega with the help of jackson which was released on the sega system 18 hardware a distinct adaptation was also developed for segas genesismega drive and master system home video game systems the console versions of the game were actually based on an evolved version of the sidescrolling sega mega drive shinobi series enginecitation needed while the arcade version was a threequarters beat em up both the console and arcade versions are based on the smooth criminal segment of the film following michael in suit and fedora through stages based on his different music videos as he rescues children from the drug dealer mr big in the three player simultaneous arcade game contact with bubbles michaels chimp transformed him into a robot warrior replacing michaels star magic and melee dance attacks with missiles and laser beams in the console versions on certain levels rescuing a certain child first would trigger a comet to fall from the sky that could be grabbed transforming michael into the robot which could fly with a rocket pack as well as use lasers and a missile special attack michael automatically changes into a robot for the final showdown with mr bigs henchmen and finally into a space ship for the last battle in a sort of flightsim shooter in the genesismega drive version all incarnations of the game featured the ability of michael to use some form of dance magic which would force his enemies to dance to the music of various tunes from bad or thriller and be destroyed as a result comicedit in 1989 blackthorne publishing adapted the film into a comic book moonwalker 3d 75 in blackthornes 3d series15 this title was a major contributing factor in the demise of blackthorne since the publisher had to pay a large licensing fee for the property and when the comic flopped they experienced a large financial loss16 blackthorne
