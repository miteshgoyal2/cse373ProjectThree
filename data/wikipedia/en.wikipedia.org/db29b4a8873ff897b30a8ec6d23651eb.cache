communication it is not to be confused with the saussurean tradition called semiology which is a subset of semiotics12 this includes the study of signs and sign processes indication designation likeness analogy allegory metonymy metaphor symbolism signification and communication the semiotic tradition explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications as different from linguistics however semiotics also studies nonlinguistic sign systems semiotics is frequently seen as having important anthropological dimensions for example the italian semiotician and novelist umberto eco proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication3 some semioticians focus on the logical dimensions of the science however they examine areas belonging also to the life sciences—such as how organisms make predictions about and adapt to their semiotic niche in the world see semiosis in general semiotic theories take signs or sign systems as their object of study the communication of information in living organisms is covered in biosemiotics including zoosemiotics contents 1 terminology 2 history 3 formulations 4 notable semioticians 5 current

terminologyedit the term derives from the greek σημειωτικός sēmeiōtikos observant of signs4 from σημεῖον sēmeion a sign a mark5 and it was first used in english prior to 1676 by henry stubbes6 spelt semeiotics in a very precise sense to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs78 john locke used the term semeiotike in book four chapter 21 of an essay concerning human understanding 169091011 here he explains how science may be divided into three parts all that can fall within the compass of human understanding being either first the nature of things as they are in themselves their relations and their manner of operation or secondly that which man himself ought to do as a rational and voluntary agent for the attainment of any end especially happiness or thirdly the ways and means whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these is attained and communicated i think science may be divided properly into these three sorts — locke 18231963 p 174 locke then elaborates on the nature of this third category naming it σημειωτική semeiotike and explaining it as the doctrine of signs in the following terms nor is there any thing to be relied upon in physick12 but an exact knowledge of medicinal physiology founded on observation not principles semiotics method of curing and tried not excogitated13 not commanding medicines — locke 18231963 4214 p 175 in the nineteenth century charles sanders peirce defined what he termed semiotic which he sometimes spelled as semeiotic as the quasinecessary or formal doctrine of signs which abstracts what must be the characters of all signs used by  an intelligence capable of learning by experience14 and which is philosophical logic pursued in terms of signs and sign processes1516 the peirce scholar and editor max h fisch17 claimed in 197818 that semeiotic was peirces own preferred rendering of lockes σημιωτική charles w morris followed peirce in using the term semiotic and in extending the discipline beyond human communication to animal learning and use of signals ferdinand de saussure however founded his semiotics which he called semiology in the social sciences it is possible to conceive of a science which studies the role of signs as part of social life it would form part of social psychology and hence of general psychology we shall call it semiology from the greek semeîon sign it would investigate the nature of signs and the laws governing them since it does not yet exist one cannot say for certain that it will exist but it has a right to exist a place ready for it in advance linguistics is only one branch of this general science the laws which semiology will discover will be laws applicable in linguistics and linguistics will thus be assigned to a clearly defined place in the field of human knowledge — cited in chandlers semiotics for beginners introduction while the saussurean semiotic is dyadic signsyntax signalsemantics the peircean semiotic is triadic sign object interpretant being conceived as philosophical logic studied in terms of signs that are not always linguistic or artificial the peircean semiotic addresses not only the external communication mechanism as per saussure but the internal representation machine investigating not just sign processes or modes of inference but the whole inquiry process in general peircean semiotics further subdivides each of the three triadic elements into three subtypes for example signs can be icons indices and symbols yuri lotman introduced eastern europe to semiotics and adopted lockes coinage as the name to subtitle σημειωτική his founding at the university of tartu in estonia in 1964 of the first semiotics journal sign systems studies thomas sebeok assimilated semiology to semiotics as a part to a whole19 and was involved in choosing the name semiotica for the first international journal devoted to the study of signs saussurean semiotics have been challenged with serious criticism for example by jacques derridas assertion that signifier and signified are not fixed coining the expression différance relating to the endless deferral of meaning and to the absence of a transcendent signified for derrida il ny a pas de horstexte there is nothing outside the text he was in obvious opposition to materialists and marxists who argued that a sign has to point towards a real meaning and cannot be controlled by the referents closedloop references historyedit the importance of signs and signification has been recognized throughout much of the history of philosophy and in psychology as well plato and aristotle both explored the relationship between signs and the world20 and augustine considered the nature of the sign within a conventional system these theories have had a lasting effect in western philosophy especially through scholastic philosophy more recently umberto eco in his semiotics and the philosophy of language has argued that semiotic theories are implicit in the work of most perhaps all major thinkers the general study of signs that began in latin with augustine culminated in latin with the 1632 tractatus de signis of john poinsot and then began anew in late modernity with the attempt in 1867 by charles sanders peirce to draw up a new list of categories peirce aimed to base his new list directly upon experience precisely as constituted by action of signs in contrast with the list of aristotles categories which aimed to articulate within experience the dimension of being that is independent of experience and knowable as such through human understanding the estimative powers of animals interpret the environment as sensed to form a meaningful world of objects but the objects of this world or umwelt in jakob von uexkülls term21 consist exclusively of objects related to the animal as desirable undesirable – or safe to ignore 0 in contrast to this human understanding adds to the animal umwelt a relation of selfidentity within objects which transforms objects experienced into things as well as – 0 objects22 thus the generically animal objective world as umwelt becomes a speciesspecifically human objective world or lebenswelt lifeworld wherein linguistic communication rooted in the biologically underdetermined innenwelt innerworld of humans makes possible the further dimension of cultural organization within the otherwise merely social organization of nonhuman animals whose powers of observation may deal only with directly sensible instances of objectivity this further point that human culture depends upon language understood first of all not as communication but as the biologically underdetermined aspect or feature of the human animals innenwelt was originally clearly identified by thomas a sebeok23 sebeok also played the central role in bringing peirces work to the center of the semiotic stage in the twentieth century24 first with his expansion of the human use of signs anthroposemiosis to include also the generically animal signusage zoösemiosis25 then with his further expansion of semiosis based initially on the work of martin krampen26 but taking advantage of peirces point that an interpretant as the third item within a sign relation need not be mental27 to include the vegetative world phytosemiosis peirces distinguished between the interpretant and the interpreter the interpretant is the internal mental representation that mediates between the object and its sign the interpreter is the human who is creating the interpretant28 peirces interpretant notion opened the way to understanding an action of signs beyond the realm of animal life study of phytosemiosis zoösemiosis anthroposemiosis biosemiotics which was his first advance beyond latin age semiotics other early theorists in the field of semiotics include charles w morris29 max black argued that the work of bertrand russell was seminal in the field30 formulationsedit colorcoding hot and coldwater faucets taps is common in many cultures but as this example shows the coding may be rendered meaningless because of context the two faucets taps probably were sold as a coded set but the code is unusable and ignored as there is a single water supply semioticians classify signs or sign systems in relation to the way they are transmitted see modality this process of carrying meaning depends on the use of codes that may be the individual sounds or letters that humans use to form words the body movements they make to show attitude or emotion or even something as general as the clothes they wear to coin a word to refer to a thing see lexical words the community must agree on a simple meaning a denotative meaning within their language but that word can transmit that meaning only within the languages grammatical structures and codes see syntax and semantics codes also represent the values of the culture and are able to add new shades of connotation to every aspect of life to explain the relationship between semiotics and communication studies communication is defined as the process of transferring data andor meaning from a source to a receiver hence communication theorists construct models based on codes media and contexts to explain the biology psychology and mechanics involved both disciplines recognize that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the receiver must decode the data ie be able to distinguish the data as salient and make meaning out of it this implies that there is a necessary overlap between semiotics and communication indeed many of the concepts are shared although in each field the emphasis is different in messages and meanings an introduction to semiotics marcel danesi 1994 suggested that semioticians priorities were to study signification first and communication second a more extreme view is offered by jeanjacques nattiez 1987 trans 1990 16 who as a musicologist considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to his application of semiotics semiotics differs from linguistics in that it generalizes the definition of a sign to encompass signs in any medium or sensory modality thus it broadens the range of sign systems and sign relations and extends the definition of language in what amounts to its widest analogical or metaphorical sense peirces definition of the term semiotic as the study of necessary features of signs also has the effect of distinguishing the discipline from linguistics as the study of contingent features that the worlds languages happen to have acquired in the course of their evolutions from a subjective standpoint perhaps more difficult is the distinction between semiotics and the philosophy of language in a sense the difference lies between separate traditions rather than subjects different authors have called themselves philosopher of language or semiotician this difference does not match the separation between analytic and continental philosophy on a closer look there may be found some differences regarding subjects philosophy of language pays more attention to natural languages or to languages in general while semiotics is deeply concerned with nonlinguistic signification philosophy of language also bears connections to linguistics while semiotics might appear closer to some of the humanities including literary theory and to cultural anthropology semiosis or semeiosis is the process that forms meaning from any organisms apprehension of the world through signs scholars who have talked about semiosis in their subtheories of semiotics include c s peirce john deely and umberto eco cognitive semiotics is combining methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities with providing new information into human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices the research on cognitive semiotics brings together semiotics from linguistics cognitive science and related disciplines on a common metatheoretical platform of concepts methods and shared data cognitive semiotics may also be seen as the study of meaningmaking by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences this involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the center for semiotics at aarhus university denmark with an important connection with the center of functionally integrated neuroscience cfin at aarhus hospital amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are per aage brandt svend østergaard peer bundgård frederik stjernfelt mikkel wallentin kristian tylén riccardo fusaroli and jordan zlatev zlatev later in cooperation with göran sonesson established ccs center for cognitive semiotics at lund university sweden notable semioticiansedit charles sanders peirce 1839–1914 a noted logician who founded philosophical pragmatism defined semiosis as an irreducibly triadic process wherein something as an object logically determines or influences something as a sign to determine or influence something as an interpretation or interpretant itself a sign thus leading to further interpretants31 semiosis is logically structured to perpetuate itself the object may be quality fact rule or even fictional hamlet and may be immediate to the sign the object as represented in the sign or dynamic the object as it really is on which the immediate object is founded the interpretant may be immediate to the sign all that the sign immediately expresses such as a words usual meaning or dynamic such as a state of agitation or final or normal the ultimate ramifications of the sign about its object to which inquiry taken far enough would be destined and with which any interpretant at most may coincide32 his semiotic33 covered not only artificial linguistic and symbolic signs but also semblances such as kindred sensible qualities and indices such as reactions he came c 190334 to classify any sign by three interdependent trichotomies intersecting to form ten rather than 27 classes of sign35 signs also enter into various kinds of meaningful combinations peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his speculative grammar he regarded formal semiotic as logic per se and part of philosophy as also encompassing study of arguments hypothetical deductive and inductive and inquirys methods including pragmatism and as allied to but distinct from logics pure mathematics in addition to pragmatism peirce provided a definition of the term sign as a sign or representamen is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity it addresses somebody that is creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign that sign which it creates i call the interpretant of the first sign the sign stands for something its object not in all respects but in reference to a sort of idea peirce called the sign a representamen in order to bring out the fact that a sign is something that represents something else in order to suggest it that is represent it in some way36 for a summary of peirces contributions to semiotics see liszka 1996 or atkin 2006 ferdinand de saussure 1857–1913 the father of modern linguistics proposed a dualistic notion of signs relating the signifier as the form of the word or phrase uttered to the signified as the mental concept according to saussure the sign is completely arbitrary—ie there is no necessary connection between the sign and its meaning this sets him apart from previous philosophers such as plato or the scholastics who thought that there must be some connection between a signifier and the object it signifies in his course in general linguistics saussure credits the american linguist william dwight whitney 1827–1894 with insisting on the arbitrary nature of the sign saussures insistence on the arbitrariness of the sign also has influenced later philosophers and theorists such as jacques derrida roland barthes and jean baudrillard ferdinand de saussure coined the term sémiologie while teaching his landmark course on general linguistics at the university of geneva from 1906 to 1911 saussure posited that no word is inherently meaningful rather a word is only a signifier ie the representation of something and it must be combined in the brain with the signified or the thing itself in order to form a meaningimbued sign saussure believed that dismantling signs was a real science for in doing so we come to an empirical understanding of how humans synthesize physical stimuli into words and other abstract concepts jakob von uexküll 1864–1944 studied the sign processes in animals he used the german word for environment umwelt to describe the individuals subjective world and he invented the concept of functional circle funktionskreis as a general model of sign processes in his theory of meaning bedeutungslehre 1940 he described the semiotic approach to biology thus establishing the field that now is called biosemiotics valentin voloshinov 1895–1936 was a sovietrussian linguist whose work has been influential in the field of literary theory and marxist theory of ideology written in the late 1920s in the ussr voloshinovs marxism and the philosophy of language tr marksizm i filosofiya yazyka developed a countersaussurean linguistics which situated language use in social process rather than in an entirely decontexualized saussurean langue louis hjelmslev 1899–1965 developed a formalist approach to saussures structuralist theories his best known work is prolegomena to a theory of language which was expanded in résumé of the theory of language a formal development of glossematics his scientific calculus of language charles w morris 1901–1979 in his 1938 foundations of the theory of signs he defined semiotics as grouped into three branches semantics relation between signs and the things to which they refer their signified denotata or meaning syntacticssyntax relations among or between signs in formal structures pragmatics relation between signs and signusing agents or interpreters syntactics is the morrisean branch of semiotics that deals with the formal properties of signs and symbols the interrelation of the signs without regard to meaning semantics deals with the relation of signs to their designata and the objects that they may or do denote the relation between the signs and the objects to which they apply finally pragmatics deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis with all the psychological biological and sociological phenomena that occur in the functioning of signs the relation between the sign system and its human or animal user unlike his mentor george herbert mead morris was a behaviorist and sympathetic to the vienna circle positivism of his colleague rudolf carnap morris was accused by john dewey of misreading peirce37 thure von uexküll 1908–2004 the father of modern psychosomatic medicine developed a diagnostic method based on semiotic and biosemiotic analyses roland barthes 1915–1980 was a french literary theorist and semiotician he often would critique pieces of cultural material to expose how bourgeois society used them to impose its values upon others for instance the portrayal of wine drinking in french society as a robust and healthy habit would be a bourgeois ideal perception contradicted by certain realities ie that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating he found semiotics useful in conducting these critiques barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were secondorder signs or connotations a picture of a full dark bottle is a sign a signifier relating to a signified a fermented alcoholic beverage—wine however the bourgeois take this signified and apply their own emphasis to it making wine a new signifier this time relating to a new signified the idea of healthy robust relaxing wine motivations for such manipulations vary from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo these insights brought barthes very much in line with similar marxist theory signaling and communication between the astatotilapia burtoni algirdas julien greimas 1917–1992 developed a structural version of semiotics named generative semiotics trying to shift the focus of discipline from signs to systems of signification his theories develop the ideas of saussure hjelmslev claude lévistrauss and maurice merleauponty thomas a sebeok 1920–2001 a student of charles w morris was a prolific and wideranging american semiotician although he insisted that animals are not capable of language he expanded the purview of semiotics to include nonhuman signaling and communication systems thus raising some of the issues addressed by philosophy of mind and coining the term zoosemiotics sebeok insisted that all communication was made possible by the relationship between an organism and the environment in which it lives he also posed the equation between semiosis the activity of interpreting signs and life—a view that the copenhagentartu biosemiotic school has further developed yuri lotman 1922–1993 was the founding member of the tartu or tartumoscow semiotic school he developed a semiotic approach to the study of culture—semiotics of culture—and established a communication model for the study of text semiotics he also introduced the concept of the semiosphere among his moscow colleagues were vladimir toporov vyacheslav ivanov and boris uspensky christian metz 1931–1993 pioneered the application of saussurean semiotics to film theory applying syntagmatic analysis to scenes of films and grounding film semiotics in greater context umberto eco 1932–2016 made a wider audience aware of semiotics by various publications most notably a theory of semiotics and his novel the name of the rose which includes second to its plot applied semiotic operations his most important contributions to the field bear on interpretation encyclopedia and model reader he also criticized in several works a theory of semiotics la struttura assente le signe la production de signes the iconism or iconic signs taken from peirces most famous triadic relation based on indexes icons and symbols to which he proposed four modes of sign production recognition ostension replica and invention eliseo verón 1935–2014 developed his social discourse theory inspired in the peircian conception of semiosis the mu group groupe µ founded 1967 developed a structural version of rhetorics and the visual semiotics current applicationsedit chart semiotics of social networking applications of semiotics include it represents a methodology for the analysis of texts regardless of the medium in which it is presented for these purposes text is any message preserved in a form whose existence is independent of both sender and receiver it may improve ergonomic design in situations where it is important to ensure that human beings are able to interact more effectively with their environments whether it be on a large scale as in architecture or on a small scale such as the configuration of instrumentation for human use in some countries its role is limited to literary criticism and an appreciation of audio and visual media this narrow focus may inhibit a more general study of the social and political forces shaping how different media are used and their dynamic status within modern culture issues of technological determinism in the choice of media and the design of communication strategies assume new importance in this age of mass media publication of research is both in dedicated journals such as sign systems studies established by yuri lotman and published by tartu university press semiotica founded by thomas a sebeok and published by mouton de gruyter zeitschrift für semiotik european journal of semiotics versus founded and directed by umberto eco et al the american journal of semiotics

epure eisenstat and dinu 2014 said semiotics allows for the practical distinction of persuasion from manipulation in marketing communication p 59238 semiotics are used in marketing as a persuasive device to influence buyers to change their attitudes and behaviors in the market place two ways that epure eisenstat and dinu 2014 state that semiotics are used are surface signs are used to create personality for the product creativity plays its foremost role at this level underlying the concealed meaning of the text imagery sounds etc38 semiotics analysis is used by scholars and professional researchers as a method to interpret meanings behind symbols and how the meanings are created below is an example of how semiotic analysis is utilized in a research paper published in an academic journal educational research and reviews in 2016 kibar aktin sinop üniversitesi turkey presented a research study on how children fictionalize the past by using their imagination skills in the process of historical thinking aktin 201639 the data collected as part of this project included pictures drawn by preschool age children depicting their recollection of a field trip to a historical museum aktin used semiotics to analyze these drawings through attempting to understand the different aspects of the drawings and the meaning behind the drawings in doing this the researcher and the two experts assisting him were seeking the connotative meaning behind the symbols presented by the young students their analysis was divided into three sections definitional meaning analysis personal meaning analysis contextual meaning analysis definitional meaning analysis consists of the researchers own interpretation and definition of the childrens drawings the images in the drawing are related to what the researcher believes they represent in the literal world personal meaning analysis involves the researcher sitting with the artist and discussing their interpretation of their drawing by doing this the researcher can get an understanding as to what the students were trying to express through their drawings lastly aktin used contextual meaning analysis to perceive the context behind the facets of the drawings to decipher what was derived from the childrens memory and what was purely imaginative this enables the researcher to achieve their goal of understanding how children fictionalize the past by using their imaginative skills marketing semiotics research based on connotations has been stated in the research conducted by pathak gauri and kazi roshan in 2016the research studied whether connotationscontext as semiotic elements affect brand building parameters like brand awareness brand feelings brand image brand reliability brand association brand preferencebonding and brand trustthey have concluded that the type of brand influences the brand building parameters in terms of the marketing semiotic element of connotations their recommendations state that it is

semioticsedit pictorial semiotics43 is intimately connected to art history and theory it goes beyond them both in at least one fundamental way however while art history has limited its visual analysis to a small number of pictures that qualify as works of art pictorial semiotics focuses on the properties of pictures in a general sense and on how the artistic conventions of images can be interpreted through pictorial codes pictorial codes are the way in which viewers of pictorial representations seem automatically to decipher the artistic conventions of images by being unconsciously familiar with them44 according to göran sonesson a swedish semiotician pictures can be analyzed by three models a the narrative model which concentrates on the relationship between pictures and time in a chronological manner as in a comic strip b the rhetoric model which compares pictures with different devices as in a metaphor and c the laokoon or laocoon model which considers the limits and constraints of pictorial expressions by comparing textual mediums that utilize time with visual mediums that utilize space45 the break from traditional art history and theory—as well as from other major streams of semiotic analysis—leaves open a wide variety of possibilities for pictorial semiotics some influences have been drawn from phenomenological analysis cognitive psychology structuralist and cognitivist linguistics and visual anthropology and sociology one of the many ways that pictorial semiotics has been changing has been through the use of emojis in email text or other online conversations though not seen as works of art these small images of happy sad winking faces or even a smiling poo image have made their way into our everyday communication through digital devices in the early advances of mobile technology and the increasing manner in which such devices are used many in the linguistic community felt that vital communication cues such as the importance of nonverbal cues would be lost alshenqeeti 201646 another concern is that with the high use of these symbols would begin to oversimplify our language to where the languages strength would be lost however others have said that the use of emojis in digital conversation has helped to give more clarity to a conversation since the ability to read another person’s facial expressions nonverbal cues or tone of voice isn’t possible in a typed message emojis allow a communicator to convey attitudes and emotions to their message receiver as for oversimplifying our language some have argued that perhaps our language is not being simplified but that new generations are revitalizing the early forms of semiotics like cave paintings or hieroglyphics as technology advances so will the use of emojis or possibly a more advanced form of pictorial symbols to use in digital communication globalizationedit studies have shown that semiotics may be used to make or break a brand culture codes strongly influence whether a population likes or dislikes a brands marketing especially internationally if the company is unaware of a cultures codes it runs the risk of failing in its marketing globalization has caused the development of a global consumer culture where products have similar associations whether positive or negative across numerous markets47 mistranslations may lead to instances of engrish or chinglish terms for unintentionally humorous crosscultural slogans intended to be understood in english this may be caused by a sign that in peirces terms mistakenly indexes or symbolizes something in one culture that it does not in another48 in other words it creates a connotation that is culturallybound and that violates some culture code theorists who have studied humor such as schopenhauer suggest that contradiction or incongruity creates absurdity and therefore humor49 violating a culture code creates this construct of ridiculousness for the culture that owns the code intentional humor also may fail crossculturally because jokes are not on code for the receiving culture50 a good example of branding according to cultural code is disneys international theme park business disney fits well with japans cultural code because the japanese value cuteness politeness and gift giving as part of their culture code tokyo disneyland sells the most souvenirs of any disney theme park in contrast disneyland paris failed when it launched as euro disney because the company did not research the codes underlying european culture its storybook retelling of european folktales was taken as elitist and insulting and the strict appearance standards that it had for employees resulted in discrimination lawsuits in france disney souvenirs were perceived as cheap trinkets the park was a financial failure because its code violated the expectations of european culture in ways that were offensive51 on the other hand some researchers have suggested that it is possible to successfully pass a sign perceived as a cultural icon such as the cocacola or mcdonalds logos from one culture to another this may be accomplished if the sign is migrated from a more economicallydeveloped to a less developed

16891690 first edition of lockes essay concerning human understanding in the concluding division of the sciences chapter locke introduces in §4 σημιωτική as his proposed name synonymous with the doctrine of signs for the development of the future study of the ubiquitous role of signs within human awareness in the 1689–1690 original edition the division of the sciences chapter was chapter xx

further that the present text is based on the original fourth edition of the essay and that readings in the other early authorized editions are adopted in appropriate form where necessary and recorded otherwise in the textual notes the term σημιωτική appears in that 1700 4th edition the last published but not the last prepared within lockes lifetime with exactly the spelling and final accent found in the 16891690 1st edition yet if we turn to the final chapter xxi of the 1975 oxford edition we find on p 720 not σημιωτικὴ but rather do we find substituted the σημειωτικὴ spelling and with final accent reversed note that in modern greek and in some systems for pronouncing classical greek σημιωτική and σημειωτική are pronounced the same prior to locke the notion of sign as transcending the
