karlsbrunn in nassausaarbrücken to north america first settling in york pennsylvania in 1741 and in the 1880s moving to kansas8 accounts vary as to how and when the german name eisenhauer was anglicized to eisenhower9 eisenhowers pennsylvania dutch ancestors who were primarily farmers included hans nikolaus eisenhauer of karlsbrunn who migrated to lancaster pennsylvania in 174110 hanss greatgreatgrandson david jacob eisenhower 1863–1942 was eisenhowers father and was a collegeeducated engineer despite his own father jacobs urging to stay on the family farm eisenhowers mother ida elizabeth stover eisenhower born in virginia of german protestant ancestry moved to kansas from virginia she married david on september 23 1885 in lecompton kansas on the campus of their alma mater lane university11 david owned a general store in hope kansas but the business failed due to economic conditions and the family became impoverished the eisenhowers then lived in texas from 1889 until 1892 and later returned to kansas with 24 to their name at the time david worked as a railroad mechanic and then at a creamery11 by 1898 the parents made a decent living and provided a suitable home for their large family12 the future president was born on october 14 1890 in denison texas the third of seven boys13 his mother originally named him david dwight but reversed the two names after his birth to avoid the confusion of having two davids in the family1 all of the boys were called ike such as big ike edgar and little ike dwight the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name14 by world war ii only dwight was still called ike8 in 1892 the family moved to abilene kansas which eisenhower considered his home town8 as a child he was involved in an accident that cost his younger brother an eye he later referred to this as an experience that taught him the need to be protective of those under him dwight developed a keen and enduring interest in exploring outdoors huntingfishing cooking and card playing from an illiterate named bob davis who camped on the smoky hill river151617 while eisenhowers mother was against war it was her collection of history books that first sparked eisenhowers early and lasting interest in military history he persisted in reading the books in her collection and became a voracious reader in the subject other favorite subjects early in his education were arithmetic and spelling18 his parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family bible reading chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline usually from david19 his mother previously a member with david of the river brethren sect of the mennonites joined the international bible students association later known as jehovahs witnesses the eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915 though eisenhower never joined the international bible students20 his later decision to attend west point saddened his mother who felt that warfare was rather wicked but she did not overrule him21 while speaking of himself in 1948 eisenhower said he was one of the most deeply religious men i know though unattached to any sect or organization he was baptized in the presbyterian church in 195322 eisenhower attended abilene high school and graduated with the class of 190923 as a freshman he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin and which his doctor diagnosed as lifethreatening the doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but dwight refused to allow it and surprisingly recovered though he had to repeat his freshman year24 he and brother edgar both wanted to attend college though they lacked the funds they made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions25 edgar took the first turn at school and dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the belle springs creamery26 edgar asked for a second year dwight consented and worked for a second year at that time a friend swede hazlett was applying to the naval academy and urged dwight to apply to the school since no tuition was required eisenhower requested consideration for either annapolis or west point with his us senator joseph l bristow though eisenhower was among the winners of the entranceexam competition he was beyond the age limit for the naval academy27 he then accepted an appointment to west point in 191127 eisenhower second from left and omar bradley second from right were members of the 1912 west point football team at west point eisenhower relished the emphasis on traditions and on sports but was less enthusiastic about the hazing though he willingly accepted it as a plebe he was also a regular violator of the more detailed regulations and finished school with a less than stellar discipline rating academically eisenhowers best subject by far was english otherwise his performance was average though he thoroughly enjoyed the typical emphasis of engineering on science and mathematics28 in athletics eisenhower later said that not making the baseball team at west point was one of the greatest disappointments of my life maybe my greatest29 he made the varsity football team and was a starter as running back and linebacker in 1912 when he tackled the legendary jim thorpe of the carlisle indians30 eisenhower suffered a torn knee in that his last game he reinjured his knee on horseback and in the boxing ring81531 so he turned to fencing and gymnastics8 eisenhower later served as junior varsity football coach and cheerleader at west point he played football3233 he graduated in the middle of the class of 191534 which became known as the class the stars fell on because 59 members eventually became general officers personal life while eisenhower was stationed in texas he met mamie doud of boone iowa8 he and her family were also immediately taken with one another he proposed to her on valentines day in 191635 a november wedding date in denver was moved up to july 1 due to the pending us entry into world war i they moved many times during their first 35 years of marriage36 the eisenhowers had two sons doud dwight icky eisenhower 1917–1921 died of scarlet fever at the age of three37 eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death38 their second son john eisenhower 1922–2013 was born in denver colorado39 john served in the united states army retired as a brigadier general became an author and served as us ambassador to belgium from 1969 to 1971 coincidentally john graduated from west point on dday june 6 1944 he married barbara jean thompson on june 10 1947 john and barbara had four children david barbara ann susan elaine and mary jean david after whom camp david is named40 married richard nixons daughter julie in 1968 portrait of mamie eisenhower eisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life and he joined the augusta national golf club in 194841 he played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game to the point of golfing during winter he ordered his golf balls painted black so he could see them better against snow on the ground he had a small basic golf facility installed at camp david and became close friends with the augusta national chairman clifford roberts inviting roberts to stay at the white house on several occasions roberts an investment broker also handled the eisenhower familys investments roberts also advised eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs which proved financially lucrative41 oil painting was one of eisenhowers hobbies38 while at columbia university he began the art after watching thomas e stephens paint mamies portrait in order to relax eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life the images were mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as mamie their grandchildren general montgomery george washington and abraham lincoln42 wendy beckett stated that eisenhowers work simple and earnest rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president a conservative in both art and politics he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as a piece of canvas that looks like a brokendown tin lizzie loaded with paint has been driven over it38 angels in the outfield was eisenhowers favorite movie43 his favorite reading material for relaxation were the western novels of zane grey44 with his excellent memory and ability to focus eisenhower was skilled at card games he learned poker which he called his favorite indoor sport in abilene eisenhower recorded west point classmates poker losses for payment after graduation and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him a classmate reported that after learning to play contract bridge at west point eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months45 eisenhower continued to play bridge throughout his military career while stationed in the philippines he played regularly with president manuel quezon and was dubbed the bridge wizard of manila during wwii an unwritten qualification for an officers appointment to eisenhowers staff was the ability to play a sound game of bridge he played even during the stressful weeks leading up to the dday landings his favorite partner was general alfred gruenther considered the best player in the us army he appointed gruenther his secondincommand at nato partly because of his skill at bridge saturday night bridge games at the white house were a feature of his presidency he was a strong player though not an expert by modern standards the great bridge player and popularizer ely culbertson described his game as classic and sound with flashes of brilliance and said that you can always judge a mans character by the way he plays cards eisenhower is a calm and collected player and never whines at his losses he is brilliant in victory but never commits the bridge players worst crime of gloating when he wins bridge expert oswald jacoby frequently participated in the white house games and said the president plays better bridge than golf he tries to break 90 at golf at bridge you would say he plays in the 70s46 world war i see also military career of dwight d eisenhower after graduation in 1915 second lieutenant eisenhower requested an assignment in the philippines which was denied he served initially in logistics and then the infantry at various camps in texas and georgia until 1918 in 1916 while stationed at fort sam houston eisenhower was football coach for st louis college now st marys university47 eisenhower was an honorary member of the sigma beta chi fraternity at st marys universitycitation needed in late 1917 while in charge of training at ft oglethorpe in georgia his wife mamie had their first son when the us entered world war i he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to ft leavenworth kansas48 in february 1918 he was transferred to camp meade in maryland with the 65th engineers his unit was later ordered to france but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps where he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in the national army49 he commanded a unit that trained tank crews at camp colt – his first command – at the site of picketts charge on the gettysburg pennsylvania civil war battleground though eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat he displayed excellent organizational skills as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers strengths and make optimal placements of personnel50 once again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to france this time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed a week before his departure date51 completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time despite receiving the distinguished service medal for his work at homecitation needed in world war ii rivals who had combat service in the first great war led by gen bernard montgomery sought to denigrate eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty despite his stateside experience establishing a camp completely equipped for thousands of troops and developing a full combat training schedule52 in service of generals eisenhower far right with three unidentified men in 1919 four years after graduating from west point after the war eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major a rank he held for 16 years10 the major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads in the nation indeed the convoy averaged only 5 mph from washington dc to san francisco later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for eisenhower as president53 he assumed duties again at camp meade maryland commanding a battalion of tanks where he remained until 1922 his schooling continued focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it his new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with george s patton sereno e brett and other senior tank leaders their leadingedge ideas of speedoriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry eisenhower was even threatened with courtmartial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment and he relented5455 from 1920 eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals – fox conner john j pershing douglas macarthur and george marshall he first became executive officer to general conner in the panama canal zone where joined by mamie he served until 1924 under conners tutelage he studied military history and theory including carl von clausewitzs on war and later cited conners enormous influence on his military thinking saying in 1962 that fox conner was the ablest man i ever knew conners comment on eisenhower was he is one of the most capable efficient and loyal officers i have ever met56 on conners recommendation in 1925–26 he attended the command and general staff college at fort leavenworth kansas where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers5758 he then served as a battalion commander at fort benning georgia until 1927 during the late 1920s and early 1930s eisenhowers career in the postwar army stalled somewhat as military priorities diminished many of his friends resigned for highpaying business jobs he was assigned to the american battle monuments commission directed by general pershing and with the help of his brother milton eisenhower then a journalist at the agriculture department he produced a guide to american battlefields in europe59 he then was assigned to the army war college and graduated in 1928 after a oneyear assignment in france eisenhower served as executive officer to general george v mosely assistant secretary of war from 1929 to february 193360 major dwight d eisenhower graduated from the army industrial college washington dc in 1933 and later served on the faculty it was later expanded to become the industrial college of the armed services and is now known as the dwight d eisenhower school for national security and resource strategy6162 his primary duty was planning for the next war which proved most difficult in the midst of the great depression63 he then was posted as chief military aide to general macarthur army chief of staff in 1932 he participated in the clearing of the bonus march encampment in washington dc although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised macarthur against taking a public role in it he later wrote the armys official incident report endorsing macarthurs conduct6465 in 1935 he accompanied macarthur to the philippines where he served as assistant military adviser to the philippine government in developing their army eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with his patron regarding the role of the philippine army and the leadership qualities that an american army officer should exhibit and develop in his subordinates the dispute and resulting antipathy between eisenhower and macarthur lasted the rest of their lives66 historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of winston churchill george s patton george marshall and general montgomery during world war ii eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with macarthur and that a positive relationship endured67 while in manila mamie suffered a lifethreatening stomach ailment but recovered fully eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936 he also learned to fly making a solo flight over the philippines in 1937 and obtained his private pilots license in 1939 at fort lewis6869 also around this time he was offered a post by the philippine commonwealth government namely by then philippine president manuel l quezon on recommendations by macarthur to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned now named quezon city but he declined the offer70 eisenhower returned to the united states in december 1939 and was assigned as commanding officer co of the 1st battalion 15th infantry regiment at fort lewis washington later becoming the regimental executive officer in march 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated ix corps under major general kenyon joyce in june 1941 he was appointed chief of staff to general walter krueger commander of the third army at fort sam houston in san antonio texas after successfully participating in the louisiana maneuvers he was promoted to brigadier general on october 3 19417172 although his administrative abilities had been noticed on the eve of the american entry into world war ii he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations world war ii after the japanese attack on pearl harbor eisenhower was assigned to the general staff in washington where he served until june 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat japan and germany he was appointed deputy chief in charge of pacific defenses under the chief of war plans division wpd general leonard t gerow and then succeeded gerow as chief of the war plans division next he was appointed assistant chief of staff in charge of the new operations division which replaced wpd under chief of staff general george c marshall who spotted talent and promoted accordingly73 at the end of may 1942 eisenhower accompanied lt gen henry h arnold commanding general of the army air forces to london to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in england maj gen james e chaney74 he returned to washington on june 3 with a pessimistic assessment stating he had an uneasy feeling about chaney and his staff on june 23 1942 he returned to london as commanding general european theater of operations etousa based in london and with a house on coombe kingston upon thames75 and took over command of etousa from chaney76 he was promoted to lieutenant general on july 7 operations torch and avalanche eisenhower as a major general 1942 eisenhower as general of the army 1945 in november 1942 he was also appointed supreme commander allied expeditionary force of the north african theater of operations natousa through the new operational headquarters allied expeditionary force headquarters aefhq the word expeditionary was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasonsnot in citation given the campaign in north africa was designated operation torch and was planned underground within the rock of gibraltar eisenhower was the first nonbritish person to command gibraltar in 200 years77 french cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign and eisenhower encountered a preposterous situation with the multiple rival factions in france his primary objective was to move forces successfully into tunisia and intending to facilitate that objective he gave his support to françois darlan as high commissioner in north africa despite darlans previous high offices of state in vichy france and his continued role as commanderinchief of the french armed forces the allied leaders were thunderstruck by this from a political standpoint though none of them had offered eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation eisenhower was severely criticized for the move darlan was assassinated on december 24 by fernand bonnier de la chapelle eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of bonnier de la chapelle by associates of darlan acting without authority from either vichy or the allies considering it a criminal rather than a military matter78 eisenhower later appointed general henri giraud as high commissioner who had been installed by the allies as darlans commanderinchief and who had refused to postpone the execution79 operation torch also served as a valuable training ground for eisenhowers combat command skills during the initial phase of generalfeldmarschall erwin rommels move into the kasserine pass eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates he also was initially indecisive in his removal of lloyd fredendall commanding us ii corps he became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns80 in february 1943 his authority was extended as commander of afhq across the mediterranean basin to include the british eighth army commanded by general sir bernard montgomery the eighth army had advanced across the western desert from the east and was ready for the start of the tunisia campaign eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of etousa to become commander of natousa general eisenhower general patton and president roosevelt in sicily 1943 after the capitulation of axis forces in north africa eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of sicily once mussolini the italian leader had fallen in italy the allies switched their attention to the mainland with operation avalanche but while eisenhower argued with president roosevelt and british prime minister churchill who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the italians the germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country the germans made the already tough battle more difficult by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the allied forces 2 to 1 nevertheless the invasion of italy was highly successful for the allied commanders81 supreme allied commander and operation overlord eisenhower speaks with men of the 502nd parachute infantry regiment part of the 101st airborne division on june 5 1944 the day before the dday invasion in december 1943 president roosevelt decided that eisenhower – not marshall – would be supreme allied commander in europe the following month he resumed command of etousa and the following month was officially designated as the supreme allied commander of the allied expeditionary force shaef serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in europe in may 194582 he was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the allied assault on the coast of normandy in june 1944 under the code name operation overlord the liberation of western europe and the invasion of germany from left front row includes army officers simpson patton spaatz eisenhower bradley hodges and gerow in 1945 eisenhower as well as the officers and troops under him had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the germans—a beach landing assault his first struggles however were with allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the normandy invasion he argued with roosevelt over an essential agreement with de gaulle to use french resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the germans in advance of overlord83 admiral ernest j king fought with eisenhower over kings refusal to provide additional landing craft from the pacific84 he also insisted that the british give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate overlord to the point of threatening to resign unless churchill relented as he did85 eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in france in advance of overlord and argued with churchill over the latters concern with civilian casualties de gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the germans and eisenhower prevailed86 he also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly george s patton by severely reprimanding him when patton earlier had slapped a subordinate and then when patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy87 the dday normandy landings on june 6 1944 were costly but successful two months later august 15 the invasion of southern france took place and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the afhq to the shaef many thought that victory in europe would come by summers end but the germans did not capitulate for almost a year from then until the end of the war in europe on may 8 1945 eisenhower through shaef commanded all allied forces and through his command of etousa had administrative command of all us forces on the western front north of the alps he was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families this prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion88 eisenhowers sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed it has been called one of the great speeches of history our landings in the cherbourghavre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and i have withdrawn the troops my decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available the troops the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone89 liberation of france and victory in europe eisenhower with allied commanders following the signing of the german instrument of surrender at reims once the coastal assault had succeeded eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through france on germany field marshal montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st army groups attack being made in the north while generals bradley 12th us army group and devers sixth us army group insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front respectively eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize allied forces often by giving them tactical though sometimes ineffective latitude many historians conclude this delayed the allied victory in europe however due to eisenhowers persistence the pivotal supply port at antwerp was successfully albeit belatedly opened in late 1944 and victory became a more distinct probability90 in recognition of his senior position in the allied command on december 20 1944 he was promoted to general of the army equivalent to the rank of field marshal in most european armies in this and the previous high commands he held eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy although he had never seen action himself he won the respect of frontline commanders he interacted adeptly with allies such as winston churchill field marshal bernard montgomery and general charles de gaulle he had serious disagreements with churchill and montgomery over questions of strategy but these rarely upset his relationships with them he dealt with soviet marshal zhukov his russian counterpart and they became good friends91 the germans launched a surprise counter offensive in the battle of the bulge in december 1944 which the allies turned back in early 1945 after eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the air force to engage92 german defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the soviets and the western front with the allies the british wanted berlin but eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack berlin and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit the british backed down but then wanted eisenhower to move into czechoslovakia for political reasons washington refused to support churchills plan to use eisenhowers army for political maneuvers against moscow the actual division of germany followed the lines that roosevelt churchill and stalin had previously agreed upon the soviet red army captured berlin in a very largescale bloody battle and the germans finally surrendered on may 7 194593 in 1945 eisenhower anticipated that someday an attempt would be made to recharacterize nazi crimes as propaganda holocaust denial and took steps against it by demanding extensive still and movie photographic documentation of nazi death camps after world war ii military governor in germany and army chief of staff the sphere of influence for general eisenhower in alliedoccupied germany following the german unconditional surrender eisenhower was appointed military governor of the us occupation zone based at the ig farben building in frankfurt am main he had no responsibility for the other three zones controlled by britain france and the soviet union except for the city of berlin which was managed by the fourpower authorities through the allied kommandatura as the governing body upon discovery of the nazi concentration camps he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the nuremberg trials he reclassified german prisoners of war pows in us custody as disarmed enemy forces defs who were no longer subject to the geneva convention eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the joint chiefs of staff jcs in directive jcs 1067 but softened them by bringing in 400000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization949596 in response to the devastation in germany including food shortages and an influx of refugees he arranged distribution of american food and medical equipment97 his actions reflected the new american attitudes of the german people as nazi victims not villains while aggressively purging the exnazis9899 in warsaw 1945 in november 1945 eisenhower returned to washington to replace marshall as chief of staff of the army his main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the soviet union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained he strongly supported the new united nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs however in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the soviets truman was guided by the us state department and ignored eisenhower and the pentagon indeed eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the japanese writing first the japanese were ready to surrender and it wasnt necessary to hit them with that awful thing second i hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon100 initially eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the soviets101 he even visited warsaw in 1945 invited by bolesław bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city102 however by mid1947 as east–west tensions over economic recovery in germany and the greek civil war escalated eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop soviet expansion101 1948 presidential election in june 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to eisenhower that he might become president of the united states after the war believing that a general should not participate in politics one author later wrote that figuratively speaking eisenhower kicked his politicalminded visitor out of his office as others asked him about his political future eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job from dogcatcher to grand high supreme king of the universe and another that he could not serve as army chief of staff if others believed he had political ambitions in 1945 truman told eisenhower during the potsdam conference that if desired the president would help the general win the 1948 election103 and in 1947 he offered to run as eisenhowers running mate on the democratic ticket if macarthur won the republican nomination104 as the election approached other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged eisenhower to run for president in january 1948 after learning of plans in new hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming republican national convention eisenhower stated through the army that he was not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office lifelong professional soldiers he wrote in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason should abstain from seeking high political office103 eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president republican thomas e dewey was considered the probable winner and would presumably serve two terms meaning that eisenhower at age 66 in 1956 would be too old to have another chance to run105 president at columbia university and nato supreme commander the supreme commanders of the four powers on june 5 1945 in berlin bernard montgomery dwight d eisenhower georgy zhukov and jean de lattre de tassigny in 1948 eisenhower became president of columbia university an ivy league university in new york city where he was inducted into phi beta kappa106 the assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction107 during that year eisenhowers memoir crusade in europe was published108 critics regarded it as one of the finest us military memoirs and it was a major financial success as well eisenhowers profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the us department of the treasury that eisenhower was not a professional writer but rather marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences and thus he had to pay only capital gains tax on his 635000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate this ruling saved eisenhower about 400000109 eisenhowers stint as the president of columbia university was punctuated by his activity within the council on foreign relations a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the marshall plan and the american assembly eisenhowers vision of a great cultural center where business professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature his biographer blanche wiesen cook suggested that this period served as the political education of general eisenhower since he had to prioritize wideranging educational administrative and financial demands for the university through his involvement in the council on foreign relations he also gained exposure to economic analysis which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy whatever general eisenhower knows about economics he has learned at the study group meetings one aid to europe member claimed eisenhower accepted the presidency of the university to expand his ability to promote the american form of democracy through education he was clear on this point to the trustees involved in the search committee he informed them that his main purpose was to promote the basic concepts of education in a democracy as a result he was almost incessantly devoted to the idea of the american assembly a concept he developed into an institution by the end of 1950 within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university eisenhower was requested to advise us secretary of defense james forrestal on the unification of the armed services about six months after his appointment he became the informal chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in washington two months later he fell ill and he spent over a month in recovery at the augusta national golf club he returned to his post in new york in midmay and in july 1949 took a twomonth vacation outofstate because the american assembly had begun to take shape he traveled around the country during midtolate 1950 building financial support from columbia associates an alumni association eisenhower was unknowingly building resentment and a reputation among the columbia university faculty and staff as an absentee president who was using the university for his own interests as a career military man he naturally had little in common with the academics110 the contacts gained through university and american assembly fundraising activities would later become important supporters in eisenhowers bid for the republican party nomination and the presidency meanwhile columbia universitys liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university presidents ties to oilmen and businessmen including leonard mccollum the president of continental oil frank abrams the chairman of standard oil of new jersey bob kleberg the president of the king ranch h j porter a texas oil executive bob woodruff the president of the cocacola corporation and clarence francis the chairman of general foods as the president of columbia eisenhower gave voice and form to his opinions about the supremacy and difficulties of american democracy his tenure marked his transformation from military to civilian leadership his biographer travis beal jacobs also suggested that the alienation of the columbia faculty contributed to sharp intellectual criticism of him for many years111 the trustees of columbia university refused to accept eisenhowers resignation in december 1950 when he took an extended leave from the university to become the supreme commander of the north atlantic treaty organization nato and he was given operational command of nato forces in europe eisenhower retired from active service as an army general on may 31 1952 and he resumed his presidency of columbia he held this position until january 20 1953 when he became the president of the united states nato did not have strong bipartisan support in congress at the time that eisenhower assumed its military command eisenhower advised the participating european nations that it would be incumbent upon them to demonstrate their own commitment of troops and equipment to the nato force before such would come from the warweary united states at home eisenhower was more effective in making the case for nato in congress than the truman administration was by the middle of 1951 american and european support for nato was substantial enough to give it a genuine military power nevertheless eisenhower thought that nato would become a truly european alliance with the american and canadian commitments ending after about ten years112 presidential campaign of 1952 main article united states presidential election 1952 button from the 1952 campaign president truman symbolizing a broadbased desire for an eisenhower candidacy for president again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a democrat it was at this time that eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the democratic party and declared himself and his family to be republicans113 a draft eisenhower movement in the republican party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of noninterventionist senator robert a taft the effort was a long struggle eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their president henry cabot lodge who served as his campaign manager and others succeeded in convincing him and in june 1952 he resigned his command at nato to campaign fulltime114 eisenhower defeated taft for the nomination having won critical delegate votes from texas eisenhowers campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan i like ike it was essential to his success that eisenhower express opposition to roosevelts policy at yalta and against trumans policies in korea and china—matters in which he had once participated115116 in defeating taft for the nomination it became necessary for eisenhower to appease the right wing old guard of the republican party his selection of richard m nixon as the vicepresident on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose nixon also provided a strong anticommunist presence as well as some youth to counter ikes more advanced age117 1952 electoral vote results in the general election against the advice of his advisors eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the south refusing to surrender the region to the democratic party the campaign strategy dubbed k1c2 was to focus on attacking the truman and roosevelt administrations on three issues korea communism and corruption in an effort to accommodate the right he stressed that the liberation of eastern europe should be by peaceful means only he also distanced himself from his former boss president truman two controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff but did not affect the campaign one involved a report that nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates the second issue centered on eisenhowers relented decision to confront the controversial methods of joseph mccarthy on his home turf in a wisconsin appearance118 just two weeks prior to the election eisenhower vowed to go to korea and end the war there he promised to maintain a strong commitment against communism while avoiding the topic of nato finally he stressed a corruptionfree frugal administration at home he defeated democratic candidate adlai stevenson ii in a landslide with an electoral margin of 442 to 89 marking the first republican return to the white house in 20 years116 in the election he also brought with him a republican majority in the house by eight votes and in the senate actually a tie with nixon providing the majority vote119 eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century and at age 62 was the oldest man elected president since james buchanan in 1856 president truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president having succeeded to the presidency in 1945 upon the death of franklin roosevelt120 eisenhower was the only general to serve as president in the 20th century and was the most recent president to have never held elected office prior to the presidency until donald trump who never held public office nor served in the military the other presidents who did not have prior elected office were zachary taylor ulysses s grant william howard taft and herbert hoover election of 1956 main article united states presidential election 1956 1956 electoral vote results the united states presidential election of 1956 was held on november 6 1956 eisenhower the popular incumbent successfully ran for reelection the election was a rematch of 1952 as his opponent in 1956 was stevenson a former illinois governor whom eisenhower had defeated four years earlier compared to the 1952 election eisenhower gained kentucky louisiana and west virginia from stevenson while losing missouri his voters were less likely to bring up his leadership record instead what stood out this time was the response to personal qualities— to his sincerity his integrity and sense of duty his virtue as a family man his religious devotion and his sheer likeableness121 presidency 1953–1961 main article presidency of dwight d eisenhower due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning truman and eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations122 after selecting his budget director joseph m dodge eisenhower asked herbert brownell jr and lucius d clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments he accepted their recommendations without exception they included john foster dulles and george m humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships and one woman oveta culp hobby eisenhowers cabinet consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader was dubbed by one journalist eight millionaires and a plumber123 the cabinet was known for its lack of personal friends office seekers or experienced government administrators he also upgraded the role of the national security council in planning all phases of the cold war124 prior to his inauguration eisenhower led a meeting of advisors at pearl harbor addressing foremost issues agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term to bring the korean war to an end to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent and to end price and wage controls125 eisenhower also conducted the first preinaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952 he used this meeting to articulate his anticommunist russia policy his inaugural address as well was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the united nations126 february 1959 white house portrait eisenhower made greater use of press conferences than any previous president holding almost 200 over his two terms while he saw the benefit of maintaining a good relationship with the press he saw more value in them as a means of direct communication with the american people127 throughout his presidency eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism128 a selfdescribed progressive conservative129 who used terms like progressive moderate and dynamic conservatism to describe his approach130 he continued all the major new deal programs still in operation especially social security he expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinetlevel agency the department of health education and welfare while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers he implemented integration in the armed services in two years which had not been completed under truman131 when the 1954 congressional elections approached it became evident that the republicans were in danger of losing their thin majority in both houses eisenhower was among those who blamed the old guard for the losses and he took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the gop eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate progressive republican i have just one purpose  and that is to build up a strong progressive republican party in this country if the right wing wants a fight they are going to get it  before i end up either this republican party will reflect progressivism or i wont be with them anymore132 eisenhower initially planned on serving only one term but as with other decisions he maintained a position of maximum flexibility in case leading republicans wanted him to run again during his recovery from a heart attack late in 1955 he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the gops potential candidates the group in addition to his doctor concluded a second term was well advised and he announced in february 1956 he would run again133134 eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about nixons repeating as the vice president on his ticket the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition he personally favored robert b anderson a democrat who rejected his offer eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party135 in 1956 eisenhower faced adlai stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 576 of the popular vote the level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations136 eisenhower valued the brief respites and the amenities of an office which he endowed with an arduous daily schedule he made full use of his valet chauffeur and secretarial support—he rarely drove or dialed a phone number he was an avid fisherman golfer painter and bridge player and preferred active rather than passive forms of entertainment137 on august 26 1959 eisenhower was aboard the maiden flight of air force one which replaced the previous presidential aircraft the columbine138 interstate highway system main article interstate highway system remarks in cadillac square detroit president eisenhower delivered remarks about the need for a new highway program at cadillac square in detroit on october 29 1954 text of speech excerpt problems playing this file see media help eisenhower was assured of an enduring achievement when he championied and signed the bill that authorized the interstate highway system in 1956139 he justified the project through the federal aid highway act of 1956 as essential to american security during the cold war it was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible war hence the highways were designed to facilitate their evacuation and ease military maneuvers eisenhowers goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the us armys 1919 transcontinental motor convoy he was assigned as an observer for the mission which involved sending a convoy of us army vehicles coast to coast140141 his subsequent experience with encountering german autobahn limitedaccess road systems during the concluding stages of world war ii convinced him of the benefits of an interstate highway system noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country he thought an interstate highway system in the us would not only be beneficial for military operations but provide a measure of continued economic growth142 the legislation initially stalled in the congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by eisenhower in june 1956143 foreign policy eisenhower with indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru us president eisenhower visits taiwan and its president chiang kaishek at taipei in 1953 the republican partys old guard presented eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the yalta agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the executive branch however the death of joseph stalin in march 1953 made the matter a moot point144 at this time eisenhower gave his chance for peace speech in which he attempted unsuccessfully to forestall the nuclear arms race with the soviet union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials biographer stephen ambrose opined that this was the best speech of eisenhowers presidency145146 nevertheless the cold war escalated during his presidency when the soviet union successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in late november 1955 eisenhower against the advice of dulles decided to initiate a disarmament proposal to the soviets in an attempt to make their refusal more difficult he proposed that both sides agree to dedicate fissionable material away from weapons toward peaceful uses such as power generation this approach was labeled atoms for peace147 the un speech was well received but the soviets never acted upon it due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the us arsenal indeed eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons while reducing conventional forces and with them the overall defense budget a policy formulated as a result of project solarium and expressed in nsc 1622 this approach became known as the new look and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953148 in 1955 american nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament the failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the russians to permit any sort of inspections in talks located in london that year they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections the tables were then turned on eisenhower when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the us to permit inspections in may of that year the russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to austria and paved the way for a geneva summit with the us uk and france149 at the geneva conference eisenhower presented a proposal called open skies to facilitate disarmament which included plans for russia and the us to provide mutual access to each others skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure russian leader nikita khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand150 in 1954 eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in southeast asia and also in central america he believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in vietnam this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism from laos through malaysia and indonesia ultimately to india likewise the fall of guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring mexico151 that year the loss of north vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed european defence community edc were serious defeats but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism saying long faces dont win wars152 as he had threatened the french in their rejection of edc he afterwards moved to restore west germany as a full nato partner153 with eisenhowers leadership and dulles direction cia activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries154 the cia in part deposed the leaders of iran in operation ajax of guatemala through operation pbsuccess and possibly the newly independent republic of the congo léopoldville155 in 1954 eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the soviet union with dulles recommendation he authorized the deployment of thirty lockheed u2s at a cost of 35 million156 the eisenhower administration also planned the bay of pigs invasion to overthrow fidel castro in cuba which john f kennedy was left to carry out157 space race further information space race eisenhower and the cia had known since at least january 1957 nine months before sputnik that russia had the capability to launch a small payload into orbit and was likely to do so within a year158 he may also privately have welcomed the russian satellite for its legal implications by launching a satellite russia had in effect acknowledged that space was open to anyone who could access it without needing permission from other nations on the whole eisenhowers support of the nations fledgling space program was officially modest until the soviet launch of sputnik in 1957 gaining the cold war enemy enormous prestige around the world he then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education the eisenhower administration determined to adopt a nonaggressive policy that would allow spacecrafts of any state to overfly all states a region free of military posturing and launch earth satellites to explore space159 his open skies policy attempted to legitimize illegal lockheed u2 flyovers and project genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory160 however nikolai bulganin and nikita khrushchev declined eisenhowers proposal at the geneva conference in july 1955161 in response to sputnik being launched in october 1957 eisenhower created nasa as a civilian space agency in october 1958 signed a landmark science education law and improved relations with american scientists162 fear spread through the united states that the soviet union would invade and spread communism so eisenhower wanted to not only create a surveillance satellite to detect any threats but ballistic missiles that would protect the united states in strategic terms it was eisenhower who devised the american basic strategy of nuclear deterrence based upon the triad of b52 bombers landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms and polaris submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms163 nasa planners projected that human spaceflight would pull the united states ahead in the space race as well as accomplishing their long time goal however in 1960 an ad hoc panel on maninspace concluded that maninspace can not be justified and was too costly164 eisenhower later resented the space program and its gargantuan price tag—he was quoted as saying anyone who would spend 40 billion in a race to the moon for national prestige is nuts165 korean war china and taiwan eisenhower in korea with general chung ilkwon and baik seonyup 1952 in late 1952 eisenhower went to korea and discovered a military and political stalemate once in office when the chinese began a buildup in the kaesong sanctuary he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded his earlier military reputation in europe was effective with the chinese166 the national security council the joint chiefs of staff and the strategic air command sac devised detailed plans for nuclear war against china167 with the death of stalin in early march 1953 russian support for a chinese hardline weakened and china decided to compromise on the prisoner issue168 in july 1953 an armistice took effect with korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950 the armistice and boundary remain in effect today the armistice concluded despite opposition from secretary dulles south korean president syngman rhee and also within eisenhowers party has been described by biographer ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable and limited war unwinnable168 a point of emphasis in ikes campaign had been his endorsement of a policy of liberation from communism as opposed to a policy of containment this remained his preference despite the armistice with korea169 throughout his terms eisenhower took a hardline attitude toward china as demanded by conservative republicans with the goal of driving a wedge between china and the soviet union170 eisenhower continued trumans policy of recognizing the republic of china based in formosataiwan as the legitimate government of china not the beijing regime there were localized flareups when the red army began shelling the islands of quemoy and matsu in september 1954 eisenhower received recommendations embracing every variation of response to the aggression of the chinese communists he thought it essential to have every possible option available to him as the crisis unfolded171 the sinoamerican mutual defense treaty with taiwan was signed in december 1954 he requested and secured from congress their formosa resolution in january 1955 which gave eisenhower unprecedented power in advance to use military force at any level of his choosing in defense of formosa and the pescadores the resolution bolstered the morale of the chinese nationalists and signaled to beijing that the us was committed to holding the line171 eisenhower openly threatened the chinese with use of nuclear weapons authorizing a series of bomb tests labeled operation teapot nevertheless he left the chinese communists guessing as to the exact nature of his nuclear response this allowed eisenhower to accomplish all of his objectives—the end of this communist encroachment the retention of the islands by the chinese nationalists and continued peace172 defense of taiwan from an invasion remains a core american policy173 by the end of 1954 eisenhowers military and foreign policy experts—the nsc jcs and state dept—had unanimously urged him on no less than five occasions to launch an atomic attack against china yet he consistently refused to do so and felt a distinct sense of accomplishment in having sufficiently confronted communism while keeping world peace174 the middle east and eisenhower doctrine eisenhower with the shah of iran mohammad reza pahlavi 1959 even before he was inaugurated eisenhower accepted a request from the british government to restore the shah of iran mohammad reza pahlavi to power he therefore authorized the central intelligence agency to overthrow prime minister mohammad mosaddegh175 this resulted in an increased strategic control over iranian oil by us and british companies176 in november 1956 eisenhower forced an end to the combined british french and israeli invasion of egypt in response to the suez crisis receiving praise from egyptian president gamal abdel nasser simultaneously he condemned the brutal soviet invasion of hungary in response to the hungarian revolution of 1956 he publicly disavowed his allies at the united nations and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from egypt177 eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against britain and france in his memoirs which were published in 1965178 eisenhower and vice president richard nixon with their host king saud of saudi arabia at the mayflower hotel 1957 after the suez crisis the united states became the protector of unstable friendly governments in the middle east via the eisenhower doctrine designed by secretary of state dulles it held the us would be prepared to use armed force  to counter aggression from any country controlled by international communism further the united states would provide economic and military aid and if necessary use military force to stop the spread of communism in the middle east179 eisenhower applied the doctrine in 1957–58 by dispensing economic aid to shore up the kingdom of jordan and by encouraging syrias neighbors to consider military operations against it more dramatically in july 1958 he sent 15000 marines and soldiers to lebanon as part of operation blue bat a noncombat peacekeeping mission to stabilize the prowestern government and to prevent a radical revolution from sweeping over that country180 the mission proved a success and the marines departed three months later the deployment came in response to the urgent request of lebanese president camille chamoun after sectarian violence had erupted in the country washington considered the military intervention successful since it brought about regional stability weakened soviet influence and intimidated the egyptian and syrian governments whose antiwest political position had hardened after the suez crisis180 most arab countries were skeptical about the eisenhower doctrine because they considered zionist imperialism the real danger however they did take the opportunity to obtain free money and weapons egypt and syria supported by the soviet union openly opposed the initiative however egypt received american aid until the six day war in 1967181 as the cold war deepened dulles sought to isolate the soviet union by building regional alliances of nations against it critics sometimes called it pactomania182 southeast asia early in 1953 the french asked eisenhower for help in french indochina against the communists supplied from china who were fighting the first indochina war eisenhower sent lt general john w iron mike odaniel to vietnam to study and assess the french forces there183 chief of staff matthew ridgway dissuaded the president from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary eisenhower stated prophetically that this war would absorb our troops by divisions184 eisenhower did provide france with bombers and noncombat personnel after a few months with no success by the french he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes further requests for assistance from the french were agreed to but only on conditions eisenhower knew were impossible to meet – allied participation and congressional approval185 when the french fortress of dien bien phu fell to the vietnamese communists in may 1954 eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the chairman of the joint chiefs the vice president and the head of ncs186 eisenhower responded to the french defeat with the formation of the seato southeast asia treaty organization alliance with the uk france new zealand and australia in defense of vietnam against communism at that time the french and chinese reconvened geneva peace talks eisenhower agreed the us would participate only as an observer after france and the communists agreed to a partition of vietnam eisenhower rejected the agreement offering military and economic aid to southern vietnam187 ambrose argues that eisenhower by not participating in the geneva agreement had kept the us out of vietnam nevertheless with the formation of seato he had in the end put the us back into the conflict188 in late 1954 gen j lawton collins was made ambassador to free vietnam the term south vietnam came into use in 1955 effectively elevating the country to sovereign status collins instructions were to support the leader ngo dinh diem in subverting communism by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign189 in february 1955 eisenhower dispatched the first american soldiers to vietnam as military advisors to diems army after diem announced the formation of the republic of vietnam rvn commonly known as south vietnam in october eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military economic and technical assistance190 in the years that followed eisenhower increased the number of us military advisors in south vietnam to 900 men191 this was due to north vietnams support of uprisings in the south and concern the nation would fall187 in may 1957 diem then president of south vietnam made a state visit to the united states for ten days president eisenhower pledged his continued support and a parade was held in diems honor in new york city although diem was publicly praised in private secretary of state john foster dulles conceded that diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives192 after the election of november 1960 eisenhower in briefing with john f kennedy pointed out the communist threat in southeast asia as requiring prioritization in the next administration eisenhower told kennedy he considered laos the cork in the bottle with regard to the regional threat193 1960 u2 incident main article 1960 u2 incident a u2 reconnaissance aircraft in flight on may 1 1960 a us oneman u2 spy plane was reportedly shot down at high altitude over soviet union airspace the flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an eastwest summit conference which had been scheduled in paris 15 days later194 captain francis gary powers had bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto russian soil four days after powers disappeared the eisenhower administration had nasa issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had gone missing north of turkey it speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged and falsely claimed that the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties195 soviet premier nikita khrushchev announced that a spyplane had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot as a result the eisenhower administration thinking the pilot had died in the crash authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a weather research aircraft which had unintentionally strayed into soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed difficulties with his oxygen equipment while flying over turkey196 the soviets put captain powers on trial and displayed parts of the u2 which had been recovered almost fully intact197 the 1960 four power paris summit with eisenhower nikita khrushchev harold macmillan and charles de gaulle collapsed because of the incident eisenhower refused to accede to khrushchevs demands that he apologize therefore khrushchev would not take part in the summit up until this event eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the soviet union nuclear arms reduction and berlin were to have been discussed at the summit eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that stupid u2 business197 the affair was an embarrassment for united states prestige further the senate foreign relations committee held a lengthy inquiry into the u2 incident197 in russia captain powers made a forced confession and apology on august 19 1960 powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to imprisonment on february 10 1962 powers was exchanged for rudolf abel in berlin and returned to the us195 civil rights while president truman had begun the process of desegregating the armed forces in 1948 actual implementation had been slow eisenhower made clear his stance in his first state of the union address in february 1953 saying i propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the president to end segregation in the district of columbia including the federal government and any segregation in the armed forces198 when he encountered opposition from the services he used government control of military spending to force the change through stating wherever federal funds are expended  i do not see how any american can justify  a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds199 when robert b anderson eisenhowers first secretary of the navy argued that the us navy must recognize the customs and usages prevailing in certain geographic areas of our country which the navy had no part in creating eisenhower overruled him we have not taken and we shall not take a single backward step there must be no second class citizens in this country200 the administration declared racial discrimination a national security issue as communists around the world used the racial discrimination and history of violence in the us as a point of propaganda attack201 eisenhower told district of columbia officials to make washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children202203 he proposed to congress the civil rights act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law the 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the justice department and a civil rights commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875204 in 1957 the state of arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the brown decision eisenhower demanded that arkansas governor orval faubus obey the court order when faubus balked the president placed the arkansas national guard under federal control and sent in the 101st airborne division they escorted and protected nine black students entry to little rock central high school an allwhite public school for the first time since the reconstruction era205 martin luther king jr wrote to eisenhower to thank him for his actions writing the overwhelming majority of southerners negro and white stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in little rock206 relations with congress eisenhower had a republican congress for only his first two years in office in the senate the republican majority was by a onevote margin senator robert a taft assisted the president greatly in working with the old guard and was sorely missed when his death in july 1953 left eisenhower with his successor william knowland whom eisenhower disliked207 this prevented eisenhower from openly condemning joseph mccarthys highly criticized methods against communism to facilitate relations with congress eisenhower decided to ignore mccarthys controversies and thereby deprive them of more energy from involvement of the white house this position drew criticism from a number of corners208 in late 1953 mccarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the 1954 senate elections eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists209 among eisenhowers objectives in not directly confronting mccarthy was to prevent mccarthy from dragging the atomic energy commission aec into mccarthys witch hunt for communists which would interfere with and perhaps delay the aecs important work on hbombs the administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the aec j robert oppenheimer had urged that the hbomb work be delayed eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance though he knew this would create fertile ground for mccarthy210 in may 1955 mccarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to white house personnel eisenhower was furious and issued an order as follows it is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the executive branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters  it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications or any documents or reproductions concerning such advice be disclosed this was an unprecedented step by eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting and soon became a tradition known as executive privilege ikes denial of mccarthys access to his staff reduced mccarthys hearings to rants about trivial matters and contributed to his ultimate downfall211 in early 1954 the old guard put forward a constitutional amendment called the bricker amendment which would curtail international agreements by the chief executive such as the yalta agreements eisenhower opposed the measure212 the old guard agreed with eisenhower on the development and ownership of nuclear reactors by private enterprises which the democrats opposed the president succeeded in getting legislation creating a system of licensure for nuclear plants by the aec213 the democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election214 eisenhower had to work with the democratic majority leader lyndon b johnson later us president in the senate and speaker sam rayburn in the house both from texas joe martin the republican speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955 wrote that eisenhower never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill there were exceptions leonard w hall for example who as chairman of the republican national committee tried to open the administrations eyes to the political facts of life with occasional success however these exceptions were not enough to right the balance215 speaker martin concluded that eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with congress with results often the reverse of what he has desired because members of congress resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the white house without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them the chief wants this the administration never made use of many republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking215 judicial appointments supreme court main articles dwight d eisenhower supreme court candidates and dwight d eisenhower judicial appointments eisenhower appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states earl warren 1953 chief justice john marshall harlan ii 1954 william j brennan 1956 charles evans whittaker 1957 potter stewart 1958 whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired stewart and harlan were conservative republicans while brennan was a democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism216 in selecting a chief justice eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as lawandorder conservatives noting privately that warren represents the kind of political economic and social thinking that i believe we need on the supreme court  he has a national name for integrity uprightness and courage that again i believe we need on the court217 in the next few years warren led the court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the court states admitted to the union alaska – january 3 1959 49th state hawaii – august 21 1959 50th state health issues eisenhower began chain smoking cigarettes at west point often three or four packs a day he joked that he gave himself an order to stop cold turkey in 1949 but evan thomas says the true story was more complex at first he removed cigarettes and ashtrays but that did not work he told a friend i decided to make a game of the whole business and try to achieve a feeling of some superiority so i stuffed cigarettes in every pocket put them around my office on the deskand made it a practice to offer a cigarette to anyone who came in while mentally reminding myself as i sat down i do not have to do what that poor fellow is doing218 he was the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office but people around him deliberately misled the public about his health on september 24 1955 while vacationing in colorado he had a serious heart attack219 dr howard snyder his personal physician misdiagnosed the symptoms as indigestion and failed to call in the help that was urgently needed snyder later falsified his own records to cover his blunder and to protect eisenhowers need to portray he was healthy enough to do his job220221222 the heart attack required six weeks hospitalization during which time nixon dulles and sherman adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the president223 he was treated by dr paul dudley white a cardiologist with a national reputation who regularly informed the press of the presidents progress instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as president his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery224 as a consequence of his heart attack eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on november 25 1957 this incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand the stroke had caused an aphasia the president also suffered from crohns disease225 chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine226 which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on june 9 1956227 to treat the intestinal block surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine228 his scheduled meeting with indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru was postponed so he could recover at his farm229 he was still recovering from this operation during the suez crisis eisenhowers health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits but he still indulged in alcohol during a visit to england he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on august 29 1959 however before dinner at chequers on the next day his doctor general howard snyder recalled eisenhower drank several ginandtonics and one or two gins on the rocks  three or four wines with the dinner230 the last three years of eisenhowers second term in office were ones of relatively good health eventually after leaving the white house he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks231 a severe heart attack in august 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs232 in august 1966 he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis for which he underwent surgery on december 12 1966 when his gallbladder was removed containing 16 gallstones231 after eisenhowers death in 1969 see below an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma233 a benign adrenalinesecreting tumor that may have made the president more vulnerable to heart disease eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death231 end of presidency the official white house portrait of dwight d eisenhower the 22nd amendment to the us constitution was ratified in 1951 and it set term limits to the presidency of two terms truman as the incumbent was not covered eisenhower became the first us president constitutionally prevented from running for reelection to a third term eisenhower was also the first outgoing president to come under the protection of the former presidents act two living former presidents herbert hoover and harry s truman left office before the act was passed under the act eisenhower was entitled to receive a lifetime pension stateprovided staff and a secret service detail234 in the 1960 election to choose his successor eisenhower endorsed nixon over democrat john f kennedy he told friends i will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to kennedy116 he actively campaigned for nixon in the final days although he may have done nixon some harm when asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of nixons policy ideas he had adopted eisenhower joked if you give me a week i might think of one i dont remember kennedys campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials nixon narrowly lost to kennedy eisenhower who was the oldest president in history at that time then 70 was succeeded by the youngest elected president as kennedy was 43116 it was originally intended for president eisenhower to have a more active role in the campaign as he wanted to respond to attacks kennedy made on his administration however first lady mamie eisenhower expressed concern to second lady pat nixon about the strain campaigning would put on his heart and wanted the president to back out of it without letting him know of her intervention vice president nixon himself also received concern from white house physician major general howard snyder who informed him that he could not approve a heavy campaign schedule for the president and his health had been exacerbated by kennedys attacks nixon then convinced eisenhower not to go ahead with the expanded campaign schedule and limit himself to the original schedule nixon reflected that if eisenhower had carried out his expanded campaign schedule he might have had a decisive impact on the outcome of the election especially in states that kennedy won with razorthin margins it was years later before mamie told dwight why nixon changed his mind on dwights campaigning235 eisenhowers farewell address january 17 1961 length 1530 on january 17 1961 eisenhower gave his final televised address to the nation from the oval office236 in his farewell speech eisenhower raised the issue of the cold war and role of the us armed forces he described the cold war we face a hostile ideology global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insidious in method  and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military–industrial complex236 he elaborated we recognize the imperative need for this development  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist  only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together236 because of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office eisenhower had resigned his permanent commission as general of the army before entering the office of president of the united states upon completion of his presidential term his commission was reactivated by congress and eisenhower again was commissioned a fivestar general in the united states army237238 postpresidency death and funeral eisenhower speaks to the press at the 1964 republican national convention president lyndon johnson with eisenhower aboard air force one in october 1965 eisenhowers funeral service graves of dwight d eisenhower doud dwight icky eisenhower and mamie eisenhower in abilene kansas following the presidency eisenhower moved to the place where he and mamie had spent much of their postwar time the home was a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at gettysburg pennsylvania 70 miles from his ancestral home in elizabethville dauphin county pennsylvania239240 they also maintained a retirement home in palm desert california241 in 1967 the eisenhowers donated the gettysburg farm to the national park service after leaving office eisenhower did not completely retreat from political life he flew to san antonio where he had been stationed years earlier to support john w goode the unsuccessful republican candidate against the democrat henry b gonzalez for texas 20th congressional district seat242 he addressed the 1964 republican national convention in san francisco and appeared with party nominee barry goldwater in a campaign commercial from his gettysburg retreat243 that endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because goldwater had in the late 1950s criticized eisenhowers administration as a dimestore new deal244 on january 20 1969 the day nixon was inaugurated as president eisenhower issued a statement praising his former vice president and calling it a day for rejoicing245 on the morning of march 28 1969 eisenhower died in washington dc of congestive heart failure at walter reed army medical center he was 78 years old the following day his body was moved to the washington national cathedrals bethlehem chapel where he lay in repose for 28 hours on march 30 his body was brought by caisson to the united states capitol where he lay in state in the capitol rotunda on march 31 eisenhowers body was returned to the national cathedral where he was given an episcopal church funeral service2 that evening eisenhowers body was placed onto a special train for its journey from the nations capital to abilene kansas this was the last time a funeral train has been used as part of funeral proceedings for an american presidentcitation needed his body arrived on april 2 and was interred that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the eisenhower presidential library the presidents body was buried as a general of the army the family used an 80 standard soldiers casket and dressed his body in his famous short green jacket the medals worn were the army distinguished service medal with three oak leaf clusters the navy distinguished service medal and the legion of merit eisenhower is buried alongside his son doud who died at age 3 in 1921 his wife mamie was buried next to him after her death a decade later in 19792 president richard nixon eulogized eisenhower saying some men are considered great because they lead great armies or they lead powerful nations for eight years now dwight eisenhower has neither commanded an army nor led a nation and yet he remained through his final days the worlds most admired and respected man truly the first citizen of the world246 legacy and memory eisenhowers reputation declined in the immediate years after he left office during his presidency he was widely seen by critics as an inactive uninspiring golfplaying president this was in stark contrast to his vigorous young successor john f kennedy who was 26 years his junior despite his unprecedented use of army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at central high school in little rock eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists wanted eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the 1960 u2 incident and the associated international embarrassment247248 for the soviet unions perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the space race and for his failure to publicly oppose mccarthyism in particular eisenhower was criticized for failing to defend george marshall from attacks by joseph mccarthy though he privately deplored mccarthys tactics and claims249 eisenhower signs the legislation that changes armistice day to veterans day june 1 1954 historian john lewis gaddis has summarized the turnaround in evaluations by historians historians long ago abandoned the view that eisenhowers was a failed presidency he did after all end the korean war without getting into any others he stabilized and did not escalate the sovietamerican rivalry he strengthened european alliances while withdrawing support from european colonialism he rescued the republican party from isolationism and mccarthyism he maintained prosperity balanced the budget promoted technological innovation facilitated if reluctantly the civil rights movement and warned in the most memorable farewell address since washingtons of a military–industrial complex that could endanger the nations liberties not until reagan would another president leave office with so strong a sense of having accomplished what he set out to do250 although conservatism in politics was strong during the 1950s and eisenhower generally espoused conservative sentiments his administration concerned itself mostly with foreign affairs an area in which the careermilitary president had more knowledge and pursued a handsoff domestic policy eisenhower looked to moderation and cooperation as a means of governance251 although he sought to slow or contain the new deal and other federal programs he did not attempt to repeal them outright and in doing so was popular among the liberal wing of the republican party251 conservative critics of his administration found that he did not do enough to advance the goals of the right according to hans morgenthau eisenhowers victories were but accidents without consequence in the history of the republican party252 president john f kennedy meets with eisenhower at camp david april 22 1961 three days after the failed bay of pigs invasion since the 19th century many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or gatekeeper sometimes described as the presidents private secretary sometimes with no official title at all253 eisenhower formalized this role introducing the office of white house chief of staff – an idea he borrowed from the united states army every president after lyndon johnson has also appointed staff to this position initially gerald ford and jimmy carter tried to operate without a chief of staff but each eventually appointed one as president eisenhower also initiated the up or out policy that still prevails in the us military whereby officers who are passed over for promotion twice are usually honorably but quickly discharged to make way for younger more able officers as an army officer eisenhower had been stuck at the rank of major for 16 years between the two world wars on december 20 1944 eisenhower was appointed to the rank of general of the army placing him in the company of george marshall henry hap arnold and douglas macarthur the only four men to achieve the rank in world war two and along with omar bradley one of only five men to achieve the rank since the august 5 1888 death of philip sheridan and the only five men to hold the rank as a fivestar general the rank was created by an act of congress on a temporary basis when public law 78482 was passed on 14 december 1944254 as a temporary rank subject to reversion to permanent rank six months after the end of the war the temporary rank was then declared permanent 23 march 1946 by public law 333 of the 79th congress which also awarded full pay and allowances in the grade to those on the retired list255256 it was created to give the most senior american commanders parity of rank with their british counterparts holding the ranks of field marshal and admiral of the fleet this second general of the army rank is not the same as the postcivil war era version because of its purpose and five stars eisenhower founded people to people international in 1956 based on his belief that citizen interaction would promote cultural interaction and world peace the program includes a student ambassador component which sends american youth on educational trips to other countries257 frank gasparros
