and the highest mountain in the us state of washington it is a large active stratovolcano located 54 miles 87 km southsoutheast of seattle in the mount rainier national park it is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous united states and the cascade volcanic arc with a summit elevation of 14411 ft 4392 m45 mt rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world and it is on the decade volcano list6 because of its large amount of glacial ice mt rainier could produce massive lahars that could threaten the entire puyallup river valley and poses a grave threat to the southern sections of the seattle metropolitan area a city of over 650000 people with more than 37 million living in its metropolitan area7 contents 1 name 2 geographical

təˡqʷuʔbəʔ mother of waters in the lushootseed language spoken by the puyallup people8 another hypothesis is that tacoma means larger than mount baker in lushootseed ta larger plus koma kulshan mount baker9 other names originally used include tahoma tacobeh and pooskaus10 the current name was given by george vancouver who named it in honor of his friend rear admiral peter rainier11 the map of the lewis and clark expedition of 18041806 refers to it as mt regniere although rainier had been considered the official name of the mountain theodore winthrop in his posthumously published 1862 travel book the canoe and the saddle referred to the mountain as tacoma and for a time both names were used interchangeably although mt tacoma was preferred in the city of tacoma1213 in 1890 the united states board on geographic names declared that the mountain would be known as rainier14 following this in 1897 the pacific forest reserve became the mount rainier forest reserve and the national park was established three years later despite this there was still a movement to change the mountains name to tacoma and congress was still considering a resolution to change the name as late as 19241516 in the lead up to super bowl xlviii the washington state senate passed a resolution on friday january 31 2014 temporarily renaming the mountain mount seattle seahawks until the midnight after the super bowl monday february 3 201417 in response to the renaming of 53 mountains in colorado after the 53 members of the denver broncos by governor of colorado john hickenlooper18 after the 2015

in seattle as seen from the bainbridge island ferry with port of seattle cranes mt rainier just after taking off from seatac mount rainier is the highest mountain in washington and the cascade range this peak is located just east of eatonville and just southeast of seattle and tacoma20 mount rainier is ranked third of the 128 ultraprominent mountain peaks of the united states mount rainier has a topographic prominence of 13210 ft 4026 m which is greater than that of k2 the worlds secondtallest mountain at 13189 ft 4020 m21 on clear days it dominates the southeastern horizon in most of the seattletacoma metropolitan area to such an extent that locals sometimes refer to it simply as the mountain22 on days of exceptional clarity it can also be seen from as far away as corvallis oregon at marys peak and victoria british columbia23 with 26 major glaciers24 and 36 sq mi 93 km2 of permanent snowfields and glaciers25 mount rainier is the most heavily glaciated peak in the lower 48 states the summit is topped by two volcanic craters each more than 1000 ft 300 m in diameter with the larger east crater overlapping the west crater geothermal heat from the volcano keeps areas of both crater rims free of snow and ice and has formed the worlds largest volcanic glacier cave network within the icefilled craters26 with nearly 2 mi 32 km of passages27 a small crater lake about 130 by 30 ft 396 by 91 m in size and 16 ft 5 m deep the highest in north america with a surface elevation of 14203 ft 4329 m occupies the lowest portion of the west crater below more than 100 ft 30 m of ice and is accessible only via the caves2829 the carbon puyallup mowich nisqually and cowlitz rivers begin at eponymous glaciers of mount rainier the sources of the white river are winthrop emmons and fryingpan glaciers the white carbon and mowich join the puyallup river which discharges into commencement bay at tacoma the nisqually empties into puget sound east of lacey and the cowlitz joins the columbia river between kelso and longview a panorama of the south face of mount rainier viewed from westside road washington state route 706 subsidiary peaksedit the broad top of mount rainier contains three named summits the highest is called the columbia crest the second highest summit is point success 14158 ft 4315 m at the southern edge of the summit plateau atop the ridge known as success cleaver it has a topographic prominence of about 138 ft 42 m so it is not considered a separate peak the lowest of the three summits is liberty cap 14112 ft 4301 m at the northwestern edge which overlooks liberty ridge the sunset amphitheater and the dramatic willis wall liberty cap has a prominence of 492 ft 150 m and so would qualify as a separate peak under most strictly prominencebased rules a prominence cutoff of 400 ft 122 m is commonly used in washington state30 high on the eastern flank of mount rainier is a peak known as little tahoma peak 11138 ft 3395 m an eroded remnant of the earlier much higher mount rainier it has a prominence of 858 ft 262 m and it is almost never climbed in direct conjunction with columbia crest so it is usually considered a separate peak if considered separately from mt rainier little tahoma peak would be the third highest mountain peak in washington3132 geologyedit hazard map mount rainier is a stratovolcano in the cascade volcanic arc that consists of lava flows debris flows and pyroclastic ejecta and flows its early volcanic deposits are estimated at more than 840000 years old and are part of the lily formation about 29 million to 840000 years ago the early deposits formed a protorainier or an ancestral cone prior to the presentday cone33 the present cone is more than 500000 years old34 the volcano is highly eroded with glaciers on its slopes and appears to be made mostly of andesite rainier likely once stood even higher than today at about 16000 ft 4900 m before a major debris avalanche and the resulting osceola mudflow approximately 5000 years ago35 in the past rainier has had large debris avalanches and has also produced enormous lahars volcanic mudflows due to the large amount of glacial ice present its lahars have reached all the way to puget sound a distance of more than 30 mi 48 km around 5000 years ago a large chunk of the volcano slid away and that debris avalanche helped to produce the massive osceola mudflow which went all the way to the site of presentday tacoma and south seattle36 this massive avalanche of rock and ice removed the top 1600 ft 500 m of rainier bringing its height down to around 14100 ft 4300 m about 530 to 550 years ago the electron mudflow occurred although this was not as largescale as the osceola mudflow37 after the major collapse approximately 5000 years ago subsequent eruptions of lava and tephra built up the modern summit cone until about as recently as 1000 years ago as many as 11 holocene tephra layers have been found33 modern activity and the current threatedit teide nyiragongo vesuvius etna santorini unzen sakurajima taal merapi ulawun mauna loa colima santa maría avachinsky koryaksky galeras rainier mount rainier is one of the 16 decade volcanoes the most recent recorded volcanic eruption was between 1820 and 1854 but many eyewitnesses reported eruptive activity in 1858 1870 1879 1882 and 1894 as well38 although mount rainier is now dormant as of 2016update seismic monitors have been located in mount rainier national park and on the mountain itself to monitor activity39 however an eruption could be deadly for all living in areas within the immediate vicinity of the volcano and an eruption would also cause trouble from vancouver canada to san francisco40 because of the massive amounts of ash blasting out of the volcano into the atmosphere mount rainier is located in an area that itself is part of the eastern rim of the pacific ring of fire this includes mountains and calderas like mount shasta and lassen peak in california crater lake three sisters and mount hood in oregon mount saint helens mount adams glacier peak and mount baker in washington and mount cayley garibaldi silverthrone and mount meager in british columbia all of the above are dormant but alive and scientists on both sides of the border gather research of the past eruptions of each in order to predict how mountains in this arc will behave and what they are capable of in the future including mount rainier4142 of these only two have erupted since the beginning of the twentieth century lassen in 1915 and st helens in 1980 and 2004 however past eruptions in this volcanic arc have multiple examples of subplinian eruptions or higher crater lakes last eruption as mount mazama was large enough to cause its cone to implode43 and mt rainiers closest neighbor mount st helens had a huge chunk of the side of the mountain blow up in a phreatic explosion caused by a mix of gas and water where st helens was once perfectly symmetrical there is now thirty five years later a huge crater at the top of one face statistics place the likelihood of a major eruption in this range at 23 per century44 mount rainier is currently listed as a decade volcano or one of the 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes45 if mt rainier were to erupt as powerfully as mount st helens did in its may 18 1980 eruption the effect would be cumulatively greater because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to mount st helens37 the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding rainier and the simple fact that mt rainier is a much bigger volcano almost twice the size of st helens46 lahars from rainier pose the most risk to life and property47 as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits according to the united states geological survey usgs about 150000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of rainier7 not only is there much ice atop the volcano the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity according to geoff clayton a geologist with a washington state geology firm rh2 engineering a repeat of the osceola mudflow would destroy enumclaw orting kent auburn puyallup sumner and all of renton36 such a mudflow might also reach down the duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown seattle and cause tsunamis in puget sound and lake washington48 rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava48 one of many emergency evacuation route signs in case of volcanic eruption or lahar around mt rainier according to k scott a scientist with the usgs a home built in any of the probabilistically defined inundation areas on the new maps is more likely to be damaged or destroyed by a lahar than by firefor example a home built in an area that would be inundated every 100 years on the average is 27 times more likely to be damaged or destroyed by a flow than by fire people know the danger of fire so they buy fire insurance and they have smoke alarms but most people are not aware of the risks of lahars and few have applicable flood insurance49 the volcanic risk is somewhat mitigated by lahar warning sirens and escape route signs in pierce county50 the more populous king county is also in the lahar area but currently has no zoning restrictions due to volcanic hazard51 more recently since 2001 funding from the federal government for lahar protection in the area has dried up leading local authorities in atrisk cities like orting to fear a disaster similar to the armero tragedy5253 seismic backgroundedit typically up to five earthquakes are recorded monthly near the summit swarms of five to ten shallow earthquakes over two or three days take place from time to time predominantly in the region of 13000 feet 4 km below the summit these earthquakes are thought to be caused by the circulation of hot fluids beneath mount rainier presumably hot springs and steam vents within mount rainier national park are generated by such fluids54 seismic swarms not initiated with a mainshock are common features at volcanoes and are rarely associated with eruptive activity rainier has had several such swarms there were dayslong swarms in 2002 2004 and 2007 two of which 2002 and 2004 included m 32 earthquakes a 2009 swarm produced the largest number of events of any swarm at rainier since seismic monitoring began over two decades earlier55 yet another swarm was observed in 201156 glaciersedit threedimensional representation of mount rainier nisqually glacier is seen clearly from the southeast of the mountain glaciers are among the most conspicuous and dynamic geologic features on mount rainier they erode the volcanic cone and are important sources of streamflow for several rivers including some that provide water for hydroelectric power and irrigation together with perennial snow patches the 26 major glaciers cover about 36 square miles 93 km2 of the mountains surface and have a volume of about 1 cubic mile 42 km32425 glaciers flow under the influence of gravity by the combined action of sliding over the rock on which they lie and by deformation the gradual displacement between and within individual ice crystals maximum speeds occur near the surface and along the centerline of the glacier during may 1970 nisqually glacier was measured moving as fast as 29 inches 74 cm per day flow rates are generally greater in summer than in winter probably due to the presence of large quantities of meltwater at the glacier base25 the size of glaciers on mount rainier has fluctuated significantly in the past for example during the last ice age from about 25000 to about 15000 years ago glaciers covered most of the area now within the boundaries of mount rainier national park and extended to the perimeter of the present puget sound basin25 between the 14th century and 1850 many of the glaciers on mount rainier advanced to their farthest extent downvalley since the last ice age many advances of this sort occurred worldwide during this time period known to geologists as the little ice age during the little ice age the nisqually glacier advanced to a position 650 to 800 ft 200 to 240 m downvalley from the site of the glacier bridge tahoma and south tahoma glaciers merged at the base of glacier island and the terminus of emmons glacier reached within 12 mi 19 km of the white river campground25 retreat of the little ice age glaciers was slow until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid between the height of the little ice age and 1950 mount rainiers glaciers lost about onequarter of their length beginning in 1950 and continuing through the early 1980s however many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the midcentury the carbon cowlitz emmons and nisqually glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s since the early1980s however many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed25 the glaciers on mount rainier can generate mudflows through glacial outburst floods not associated with any eruption the south tahoma glacier generated 30 floods in the 1980s and early 1990s and again in august 201557 human historyedit artist rendering of mount tacoma from commencement bay 188858 viewed from the northwest tacoma liberty cap is the apparent summit with mowich face below59 at the time of european contact the river valleys and other areas near the mountain were inhabited by many pacific northwest tribes who hunted and gathered berries in its forests and mountain meadows these included the nisqually cowlitz yakama puyallup and muckleshootcitation needed captain george vancouver reached puget sound in early may 1792 and became the first european to see the mountain11 in 1833 dr william fraser tolmie explored the area looking for medicinal plants hazard stevens and p b van trump received a heros welcome in the streets of olympia after their successful summit climb in 18706061 the first female ascent was made in 1890 by fay fuller accompanied by van trump and three other teammates62 john muir climbed mount rainier in 1888 and although he enjoyed the view he conceded that it was best appreciated from below muir was one of many who advocated protecting the mountain in 1893 the area was set aside as part of the pacific forest reserve in order to protect its physical and economic resources primarily timber and watersheds63 citing the need to also protect scenery and provide for public enjoyment railroads and local businesses urged the creation of a national park in hopes of increased tourism on march 2 1899 president william mckinley established mount rainier national park as americas fifth national park congress dedicated the new park for the benefit and enjoyment of the people64 and  for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber mineral deposits natural curiosities or wonders within said park and their retention in their natural condition65 on 24 june 1947 kenneth arnold reported seeing a formation of nine unidentified flying objects over mount rainier his description led to the term flying saucers66 in 1998 the united states geological survey began putting together the mount rainier volcano lahar warning system to assist in the emergency evacuation of the puyallup river valley in the event of a catastrophic debris flow it is now run by the pierce county department of emergency management tacoma at the mouth of the puyallup is only 37 mi 60 km west of rainier and moderately sized towns such as puyallup and orting are only 27 and 20 mi 43 and 32 km away respectively67 mt rainier appears on four distinct united states postage stamp issues in 1934 it was the 3cent issue in a series of national park stamps and was also shown on a souvenir sheet issued for a philatelic convention the following year in 1935 both of these were reprinted by postmaster general james a farley as special issues given to officials and friends because of complaints by the public farleys follies were reproduced in large numbers the second stamp issue is easy to tell from the original because it is imperforate both stamps and souvenir sheets are widely available68 the washington state quarter which was released on april 11 2007 features mount rainier and a salmon6970 climbingedit climbers on ingraham glacier above little tahoma mountain climbing on mount rainier is difficult involving traversing the largest glaciers in the us south of alaska most climbers require two to three days to reach the summit with a success rate of approximately 50 climbing teams require experience in glacier travel selfrescue and wilderness travel about 8000 to 13000 people attempt the climb each year71 about 90 via routes from camp muir on the southeast flank72 most of the rest ascend emmons glacier via camp schurman on the northeast about half of the attempts are successful with weather and physical conditioning of the climbers being the most common reasons for failure all climbers who plan to climb above high camps camp muir and camp schurman are required by law to purchase a mount rainier climbing pass and register for their climb73 additionally solo climbers must fill out a solo climbing request form and receive written permission from the superintendent before attempting to climb74 climbing routesedit all climbing routes on mount rainier require climbers to possess some level of technical climbing skill this includes ascending and descending the mountain with the use of technical climbing equipment such as crampons ice axes harnesses and ropes difficulty and technical challenge of climbing mount rainier can vary wildly between climbing routes routes are graded in nccs alpine climbing format the normal route to the summit of mount rainier is the disappointment cleaver route grade iiiii as climbers on this route have access to the permanently established camp muir it sees the significant majority of climbing traffic on the mountain this route is also the most common commercially guided route the term cleaver is used in the context of a rock ridge that separates two glaciers the reason for naming this cleaver a disappointment is unrecorded but it is thought to be due to climbers reaching it only to recognize their inability to reach the summit75 an alternative route to the disappointment cleaver is the ingraham glacier direct route grade ii and is often used when the disappointment cleaver route cannot be climbed due to poor route conditions the emmons glacier route grade ii is an alternative to the disappointment cleaver route and poses a lower technical challenge to climbers the climbers on the route can make use of camp schurman 9500 ft a glacial camp site unlike camp muir camp schurman has no permanent structure so climbers must carry their overnight equipment to the location76 the liberty ridge route grade iv was first climbed by ome daiber arnie campbell and jim burrow in 1935 and is listed as one of the fifty classic climbs of north america by steve roper and allen steck the liberty ridge route is a considerably more challenging and objectively dangerous route than the normal route to the summit this route only accounts for approximately 2 of climbers on the mountain but accounts for approximately 25 of deaths on the mountain77 the liberty ridge route runs up the center of the north face of mount rainier and crosses the very active carbon glacier dangers and accidentsedit about two mountaineering deaths each year occur because of rock and ice fall avalanche falls and hypothermia associated with severe weather 58 reported since and including the 1981 accident through 2010 per american alpine club accidents in north american mountaineering and the nps the worst mountaineering accident on mount rainier occurred in 1981 when eleven people lost their lives in an ice fall on the ingraham glacier78 this was the largest number of fatalities on mount rainier in a single incident since 32 people were killed in a 1946 plane crash on the south tahoma glacier79 more recently the mountain received media attention in 2012 as one of the park rangers lost his life when several climbers were caught in a storm while trying to ascend the mountain while trying to help load the climbers into a rescue helicopter the ranger lost his footing and slid 3700 feet 1100 m to his death8081 in one of the worst disasters on the mountain in over thirty years six climbers—two guides and four clients—last heard from on may 28 2014 were presumed dead on may 31 2014 when lowflying search helicopters pinged the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by the climbers officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after the climbers fell 3300 feet 1000 m while attempting or returning from the summit via the liberty ridge climbing route searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on the carbon glacier at 9500 ft 2900 m possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing though the exact cause of the accident is unknown82 the bodies of three of the guest climbers were spotted on august 7 2014 during a training flight and subsequently recovered on august 19 2014 the bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located8384 outdoor recreationedit hiking backcountry skiing photography and camping are popular in the park hiking trails including the wonderland trail—a 93mile or 150kilometre circumnavigation of the peak—provide access to the
