historyedit in 1690 in what is now the americas there were criminal court cases involving child abuse1 in 1692 states and municipalities identified care for abused and neglected children as the responsibility of local government and private institutions2 in 1696 the kingdom of england first used the legal principle of parens patriae which gave the royal crown care of charities infants idiots and lunatics returned to the chancery this principal of parens patriae has been identified as the statutory basis for us governmental intervention in families child rearing practices3 in 1825 states enacted laws giving socialwelfare agencies the right to remove neglected children from their parents and from the streets these children were placed in almshouses in orphanages and with other families in 1835 the humane society founded the national federation of child rescue agencies to investigate child maltreatment in the late19th century private child protection agencies – modeled after existing animal protection organizations – developed to investigate reports of child maltreatment present cases in court and advocate for child welfare legislation4 in 1853 the childrens aid society was founded in response to the problem of orphaned or abandoned children living in new york city5 rather than allow these children to become institutionalized or continue to live on the streets the children were placed in the first “foster” homes typically with the intention of helping these families work their farms as slave labor67 in 1874 the first case of child abuse was criminally prosecuted in what has come to be known as the case of mary ellen outrage over this case started an organized effort against child maltreatment8 in 1909 president theodore roosevelt convened the white house conference on child dependency which created a publicly funded volunteer organization to establish and publicize standards of child care6 by 1926 18 states had some version of county child welfare boards whose purpose was to coordinate public and private child related work7 issues of abuse and neglect were addressed in the social security act in 1930 which provided funding for intervention for “neglected and dependent children in danger of becoming delinquent” 8 in 1912 the federal childrens bureau was established with a mandate that included services related to child maltreatment in 1958 amendments to the social security act mandated that states fund child protection efforts9 in 1962 professional and media interest in child maltreatment was sparked by the publication of c henry kempe and associates the battered child syndrome in jama by the mid1960s in response to public concern that resulted from this article 49 us states passed childabuse reporting laws10 in 1974 these efforts by the states culminated in the passage of the federal child abuse prevention and treatment act capta public law 93247 providing federal funding for wideranging federal and state childmaltreatment research and services11 in 1980 congress passed the first comprehensive federal child protective services act the adoption assistance and child welfare act of 1980 public law 96272 which focused on family preservation efforts to help keep families together and children out of foster care or other outofhome placement options12 partly funded by the federal government child protective services cps agencies were first established in response to the 1974 capta which mandated that all states establish procedures to investigate suspected incidents of child maltreatment13 in the 1940s and 1950s due to improved technology in diagnostic radiology the medical profession began to take notice of what they believed to be intentional injuries the socalled shaken baby syndrome 14 in 1961 c henry kempe began to further research this issue eventually identifying and coining the term battered child syndrome14 at this same time there were also changing views about the role of the child in society fueled in part by the civil rights movement7 in 1973 congress took the first steps toward enacting federal legislature to address the issues of poverty and minorities the child abuse prevention and treatment act15 was passed in 1974 which required states to prevent identify and treat child abuse and neglect8 shortly thereafter in 1978 the indian child welfare act icwa was passed in response to attempts to destroy the native americans by taking large numbers of native american children separating them from their tribes and placed in foster care or sending them to far away schools where they were maltreated lost and sometimes died16 this legislation not only opened the door for consideration of cultural issues while stressing ideas that children should be with their families leading to the beginnings of family preservation programs17 in 1980 the adoption assistance and child welfare act18 was introduced as a way to manage the high numbers of children in placement7 although this legislation addressed some of the complaints from earlier pieces of legislation around destroying due process for parents these changes were not designed to alleviate the high numbers of children in placement or continuing delays in permanence17 this led to the introduction of the home visitation models which provided funding to private agencies to force parents into intensive services in cases where the children were not favorable on the adoption market7 in addition to family services the focus of federal child welfare policy changed to try to address permanence for the large numbers of foster children care17 several pieces of federal legislation attempted to ease the process of forcing adoption and taking away parental rights including incentives for adoption and removal with the adoption assistance act18 the 1988 child abuse prevention adoption and family services act and the 1992 child abuse domestic violence adoption and family services act19 the 1994 multiethnic placement act which was revised in 1996 to add the interethnic placement provisions also attempted to promote permanency through adoption creating regulations that adoptions could not be delayed or denied due to issues of due process fairness constitutional compliance parental rights the childrens right discrimination race color or national origin of the child or the adoptive parent20 all of these policies led up to the 1997 adoption and safe families act asfa much of which guides current practice changes in the adoptions and safe families act showed an interest in cosmetically shifting the emphasis towards childrens health and safety concerns and away from a policy of reuniting children with their birth parents without regard to prior abusiveness20 this law requires counties to provide reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify families but required that states move to terminate parental rights for children who had been in foster care for 15 out of the last 22 months with several exceptions72021 comparison to other similar systemsedit united kingdomedit the united kingdom has a comprehensive child welfare system under which local authorities have duties and responsibilities towards children in need in their area this covers provision of advice and services accommodation and care of children who become uncared for and also the capacity to initiate proceedings for the removal of children from their parents carecare proceedings the criteria for the latter is significant harm which covers physical sexual and emotional abuse and neglect in appropriate cases the care plan before the court will be for adoption the local authorities also run adoption services both for children put up for adoption voluntarily and those becoming available for adoption through court proceedings the basic legal principle in all public and private proceedings concerning children under the children act 1989 is that the welfare of the child is paramount in recognition of attachment issues social work good practice requires a minimal number of moves and the 1989 children act enshrines the principle that delay is inimical to a childs welfare care proceedings have a time frame of 26 weeks although capable of extension under certain circumstances and concurrent planning is required the final care plan put forward by the local authority is required to provide a plan for permanence whether with parents family members longterm foster parents or adopters the court routinely joins children as parties to their own care proceedings and their best interests are explored and advanced by childrens guardians independent social workers who specialise in representation of children in proceedings it is a feature of care proceedings that judges of all levels are expected to adhere to the recommendations of the childrens guardian unless there are cogent reasons not to nevertheless drift and multiple placements still occur as many older children are difficult to place or maintain in placements the role of independent visitor a voluntary post was created in the united kingdom under the 1989 children act to befriend and assist children and young people in care in england wales and scotland there never has been a statutory obligation to report alleged child abuse to the police however both the children act 1989 and 2004 makes clear a statutory obligation on all professionals to report suspected child abuse the statutory guidance working together to safeguard children 2006 created the role of local authority designated officer this officer is responsible for managing allegations of abuse against adults who work with children teachers social workers church leaders youth workers etc local safeguarding children boards lscbs are responsible ensuring agencies and professionals in their area effectively safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the event of the death or serious injury of a child lscbs can initiate a serious case review aimed at identifying agency failings and improving future practice the planned contactpoint database under which information on children is shared between professionals has been halted by the newly elected coalition government may 2010 the database was aimed at improving information sharing across agencies lack of information sharing had been identified as a failing in numerous highprofile child death cases critics of the scheme claimed it was evidence of a big brother state and too expensive to introduce working together to safeguard children 2006 updated in 2010 and the subsequent the protection of children in england a progress report laming 2009 continue to promote the sharing of data between those working with vulnerable children22 a child in suitable cases can be made a ward of court and no decisions about the child or changes in its life can be made without the leave of the high court in england the murder of victoria climbié was largely responsible for various changes in child protection in england including the formation of the every child matters programme in 2003 a similar programme – getting it right for every child – girfec was established in scotland in 2008 a bill is being debated in the uk parliament which many people and organisations fear will take away the statutory duty local authorities have to protect vulnerable children23 canadaedit in ontario services are provided by independent childrens aid societies24 the societies receive funding from and are under the supervision of the ontario ministry of children and youth services25 however they are regarded as a nongovernmental organization ngo which allows the cas a large degree of autonomy from interference or direction in the daytoday running of cas by the ministry the child and family services review board exists to investigate complaints against cas and maintains authority to act against the societies26 costa ricaedit the patronato nacional de la infancia pani is responsible for child protection in costa rica27 the agency was founded in 1930 by dr luis felipe gonzalez flores a costa rican magnate at the time it was founded to combat infant mortality that at the time was rampant in costa rica the idea was to put infants up for adoption that the mother could not afford to support abortion is a crime in costa rica27 in 1949 after the costa rican civil war a new constitution was written it called for the agency to be an autonomous institution in the government autonomous from any ministry27 today the focus is on the un convention on the rights of the child the agency still favors adoption since abortion is illegal in costa rica braziledit for decades before 1990 there had been pressure from ngos and childrens organizations for protecting children battered by poverty and hunger and despised by sections of the community in brazil after this became a chapter on the rights of children and adolescents in the constitution of the federative republic of brazil in 1990 an even greater victory when the statute of the child and adolescent was approved by both houses of the national congress legally obligating the government to protect child rights this ensured a comprehensive child welfare system in brazil to ensure that the statutes provisions are enforced councils for the rights of the child and adolescent were set up at federal state and local levels the national council for the rights of children and adolescents conanda is federal authority the councils of guardianship are the local authorities and have duties and responsibilities towards children in their area all work is based in statute of the child and adolescent law no 8069 july 13 199028 effects of early maltreatment of childrenedit children with histories of maltreatment such as physical and psychological neglect physical abuse and sexual abuse are at risk of developing psychiatric problems2930 such children are at risk of developing a disorganized attachment313233 disorganized attachment is associated with a number of developmental problems including dissociative symptoms34 as well as depressive anxiety and actingout symptoms3536 standards for reportingedit generally speaking a report must be made when an individual knows or has reasonable cause to believe or suspect that a child has been subjected to abuse or neglect these standards guide mandatory reporters in deciding whether to make a report to child protective services37 persons responsible for the childedit in addition to defining acts or omissions that constitute child abuse or neglect several states statutes provide specific definitions of persons who can get reported to child protective services as perpetrators of abuse or neglect these are persons who have some relationship or regular responsibility for the child this generally includes parents grandparents guardians foster parents relatives legal guardians or bystanders once taken away from home the stated goal of cps is to reunite the child with their family in some cases due to the nature of abuse children are not able to see or converse with the abusers if parents fail to complete court ordered terms and conditions the children in care may never return home37 child protective services statisticsedit the united states governments administration for children and families reported that in 2004 approximately 35 million children were involved in investigations of alleged abuse or neglect in the us while an estimated 872000 children were determined to have been abused or neglected and an estimated 1490 children died that year because of abuse or neglect in 2007 1760 children died as the result of child abuse and neglect38 child abuse impacts the most vulnerable populations with children under age five years accounting for 76 of fatalities39 in 2008 83 children per 1000 were victims of child abuse and neglect and 102 children per 1000 were in out of home placement40 on september 30 2010 there were approximately 400000 children in foster care in the us of which 36 percent were ages 5 and under during that same period almost 120000 birth to five yearolds entered foster care and a little under 100000 exited foster care41 us child protective services cps received a little over 25 million reports of child maltreatment in 2009 of which 619 were assigned to an investigation42 research using national data on recidivism indicates that 22 of children were rereported within a 2year period and that 7 of these rereports were substantiated43 child protective services recidivism in the united statesedit in order to understand cps recidivism in the us there are several terms that readers must familiarize themselves with two oftenused terms in cps recidivism are rereport also known as rereferral and recurrence either of the two can occur after an initial report of child abuse or neglect called an index report although the definitions of rereport and recurrence is not consistent the general difference is that a rereport is a subsequent report of child abuse or neglect after an initial report also known as an index report whereas recurrence refers to a confirmed also known as substantiated rereport after an initial report of child abuse and neglect borrowing from the definition used by pecora et al 200044 recidivism is defined as “recurring child abuse and neglect the subsequent or repeated maltreatment of a child after identification to public authorities” it is important to highlight that this definition is not allinclusive because it does not include abused children who are not reported to authorities44 recidivism statisticsedit there are three main sources of recidivism data in the us—the national child abuse and neglect data system ncands the national survey of child and adolescent wellbeing nscaw and the national incidence study nis—and they all have their own respective strengths and weaknesses ncands was established in 1974 and it consists of administrative data of all reports of suspected child abuse and neglect investigated by cps nscaw was established in 1996 and is similar to ncands in that it only includes reports of child abuse and neglect investigated by cps but it adds clinical measures related to child and family wellbeing that ncands is lacking nis was established in 1974 and it consists of data collected from cps as well however it attempts to gather a more comprehensive picture of the incidence of child abuse and neglect by collecting data from other reporting sources called community sentinels45 minnesotaedit in 2014 mn governor mark dayton declared child protective services suffered a colossal failure in the torture and murder of fouryearold eric dean and called for the forming of a task force to investigate how 15 reports of child abuse by mandated reporters could be ignored and the child die in his book invisible children author mike tikkanen draws attention to the lack of awareness lawmakers have surrounding programs and policies impacting abused and neglected children and calls for transparency reporting and ongoing public discussion in hopes of better understanding of the issues minnesota is not unusual in experiencing profound institutional failure in its child protection systems this year as the huffington post recorded over 1000 children abused to death while observed by cps in the last six years arizona restructured its cps after it disregarded over 6000 cases of child abuse california nebraska colorado florida and texas all experienced significant failures in their child protection services in the past few years criticismedit brenda scott in her 1994 book out of control whos watching our child protection agencies criticizes cps stating child protective services is out of control the system as it operates today should be scrapped if children are to be protected in their homes and in the system radical new guidelines must be adopted at the core of the problem is the antifamily mindset of cps removal is the first resort not the last with insufficient checks and balances the system that was designed to protect children has become the greatest perpetrator of harm46 it does deserve note that child protection agencies fall under information privacy law and thus are legally unable to refute or deny many accusations whereby admitting that certain families or persons are even involved with their agency this legal conundrum further fuels speculation of secrecy and conspiracy and thus opponents of the agency can make many specific allegations in public without being disproved publicly texasedit the texas department of family and protective services had itself been an object of reports of unusual numbers of poisonings death rapes and pregnancies of children under its care since 2004 the texas family and protective services crisis management team was created by executive order after the critical report forgotten children of 2004 texas child protective services was hit with a rare if not unprecedented legal sanction for a groundless cause of action and ordered to pay 32000 of the spring familys attorney fees judge schneider wrote in a 13page order the offensive conduct by cps has significantly interfered with the legitimate exercise of the traditional core functions of this court47 2008 raid of yfz ranchedit main article yfz ranch in april 2008 the largest child protection action in american history raised questions as the cps in texas removed hundreds of minor children infants and women incorrectly believed to be children from the yfz ranch polygamist community with the assistance of heavily armed police with an armored personnel carrier investigators including supervisor angie voss convinced a judge that all of the children were at risk of child abuse because they were all being groomed for underage marriage the state supreme court disagreed releasing most children back to their families investigations would result in criminal charges against some men in the community gene grounds of victim relief ministries commended cps workers in the texas operation as exhibiting compassion professionalism and caring concern48 however cps performance was questioned by workers from the hill country community mental healthmental retardation center one wrote i have never seen women and children treated this poorly not to mention their civil rights being disregarded in this manner after assisting at the emergency shelter others who were previously forbidden to discuss conditions working with cps later produced unsigned written reports expressed anger at the cps traumatizing the children and disregarding rights of mothers who appeared to be good parents of healthy wellbehaved children cps threatened some mhmr workers with arrest and the entire mental health support was dismissed the second week due to being too compassionate workers believed poor sanitary conditions at the shelter allowed respiratory infections and chicken pox to spread49 cps problem reportsedit the texas department of family and protective services as with other states had itself been an object of reports of unusual numbers of poisonings death rapes and pregnancies of children under its care since 2004 the texas family and protective services crisis management team was created by executive order after the critical report forgotten children50 of 2004 texas comptroller carole keeton strayhorn made a statement in 2006 about the texas foster care system51 in fiscal 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively 30 38 and 48 foster children died in the states care the number of foster children in the states care increased 24 percent to 32474 in fiscal 2005 while the number of deaths increased 60 percent compared to the general population a child is four times more likely to die in the texas foster care system in 2004 about 100 children were treated for poisoning from medications 63 were treated for rape that occurred while under state care including fouryear old twin boys and 142 children gave birth though others believe ms strayhorns report was not scientifically researched and that major reforms need to be put in place to assure that children in the conservatorship of the state get as much attention as those at risk in their homes disproportionality and disparity in the child welfare systemedit in the united states data suggests that a disproportionate number of minority children particularly african american and native american children enter the foster care system52 national data in the united states provides evidence that disproportionality may vary throughout the course of a childs involvement with the child welfare system differing rates of disproportionality are seen at key decision points including the reporting of abuse substantiation of abuse and placement into foster care53 additionally once they enter foster care research suggests that they are likely to remain in care longer54 research has shown that there is no difference in the rate of abuse and neglect among minority populations when compared to caucasian children that would account for the disparity55 the juvenile justice system has also been challenged by disproportionate negative contact of minority children56 because of the overlap in these systems it is likely that this phenomenon within multiple systems may be related constitutional issuesedit in may 2007 the united states 9th circuit court of appeals found in rogers v county of san joaquin no 051607157 that a cps social worker who removed children from their natural parents into foster care without obtaining judicial authorization was acting without due process and without exigency emergency conditions violated the 14th amendment and title 42 united state code section 1983 the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution says that a state may not make a law that abridges the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states and no state may deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws title 42 united states code section 198358 states that citizens can sue in federal courts any person who acting under a color of law to deprive the citizens of their civil rights under the pretext of a regulation of a state see59 in a case of santosky v kramer 455 us 745 1982 the supreme court reviewed a case when department of social services removed two younger children from their natural parents only because the parents had been previously found negligent toward their oldest daughter60 when the third child was only three days old dss transferred him to a foster home on the ground that immediate removal was necessary to avoid imminent danger to his life or health the supreme court vacated previous judgment and stated before a state may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child due process requires that the state support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence but until the state proves parental unfitness the child and their parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship60 a district of columbia court of appeals concluded that the lower trial court erred in rejecting the relative custodial arrangement selected by the natural mother who tried to preserve her relationship with the child61 the previous judgment granting the foster mothers adoption petition was reversed the case remanded to the trial court to vacate the orders granting adoption and denying custody and to enter an order granting custody to the childs relative61 notable lawsuitsedit in 2010 an exfoster child was awarded 30 million by jury trial in california santa clara county for sexual abuse damages that happened to him in foster home from 1995 to 19996263 the

county district attorneys office62 the sex acts he forced the children in his foster care to perform sent him to prison for 220 years later in 2010 giarretto institute the private foster family agency responsible for licensing and monitoring jacksons foster home and others also was found to be negligent and liable for 75 percent of the abuse that was inflicted on the victim and jackson was liable for the rest62 this was a landmark case that has since set a precedent in future proceedings against the department of children and families64 in 2009 oregon department of human services has agreed to pay 2 million into a fund for the future care of twins who were allegedly abused by their foster parents it was the largest such settlement in the agencys history65 according to the civil rights suit filed on request of twins adoptive mother in december 2007 in us federal court kids were kept in makeshift cages—cribs covered with chicken wire secured by duct tape—in a darkened bedroom known as the dungeon the brother and sister often went without food water or human touch the boy who had a shunt put into his head at birth to drain fluid didnt receive medical attention so when police rescued the twins he was nearly comatose the same foster family previously took in their care hundreds of other children over nearly four decades66 dhs said the foster parents deceived child welfare workers during the checkup visits65 several lawsuits were brought in 2008 against the florida department of children families dcf accusing it of mishandling reports that thomas ferrara 79 a foster parent was molesting girls6768 the suits claimed that though there were records of sexual misconduct allegations against ferrara in 1992 1996 and 1999 the dcf continued to place foster children with ferrara and his thenwife until 200067 ferrara was arrested in 2001 after a 9yearold girl told detectives he regularly molested her over two years and threatened to hurt her mother if she told anyone records show that ferrara had as many as 400 children go through his home during his 16 years as a licensed foster parent from 1984 to 200067 officials stated that the lawsuits over ferrara end up costing the dcf almost 226 million68 similarly in 2007 floridas dcf paid 12 million to settle a lawsuit that alleged dcf ignored complaints that another mentally challenged immokalee girl was being raped by her
