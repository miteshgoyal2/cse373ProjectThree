were met with intense scrutiny the violence led to a moratorium on large mardi gras celebrations in the city and tarnished the neighborhoods reputation contents 1 background 2 fat tuesday 3 reactions 4 investigations and legal proceedings 5 references backgroundedit pioneer square was often described as the center of seattles nightlife at the time with its numerous bars and clubs the neighborhood had been the site of mardi gras celebrations since 1977 with more than 90 civilians and 30 officers injured during disorders in 19791 festivities on the friday and saturday leading up to 2001s fat tuesday were broken up by police with the citys bicycle patrol at the forefront of squashing festivities on saturday the seattle police department estimated a total between 4000 and 6000 people gathered in the area after midnight the crowd pelted the officers with rocks and bottles after a suspect was arrested for carrying a handgun windows were also smashed before the crowd was dispersed through the use of pepper spray rubber bullets and concussion grenades2 the heavyhanded tactics led to complaints from event goers3 up to 2000 people gathered in the neighborhood on sunday evening with fewer incidents4 celebrations were also violent in austin fresno and philadelphia that year56 fat tuesdayedit over 4000 party goers initially filled the neighborhood and its bars on tuesday evening police estimated large crowds began forming in the central plaza at 900 pm and eventually spilled into the surrounding streets the celebrations included drinking dancing and women baring their breasts for beads3 throngs of men began groping the women as they exposed themselves7 police estimated that the crowd swelled to anywhere between 5000 and 7000 people as the evening continued2 sporadic fighting broke out at about 1040 pm police donned riot gear and formed lines but rarely entered the crowd some arrests were made at the periphery of the neighborhoods main square cars were vandalized and overturned small fires were set and the windows of business were shattered2 police were then notified that young men were brandishing handguns and other weapons towards people by midnight groups roved through the crowd randomly attacking people along the stretch of yesler way between first and second avenues3 paramedics were not able to reach some victims due to the lack of police control in the area8 the police stood by and did nothing as a group assaulted a female teenager when a bystander kris kime attempted to protect her the group beat him to death910 witnesses said kime was struck and knocked to the ground as he tried to help the frightened woman who had fallen in the melee kime died of massive head injuries11 about 70 others were reported injured with 2 suffering gunshot wounds812 at 1230 am 25 to 30 young men advanced on a line of police the police retreated while bottles and other debris were thrown a team of bicycle officers made a quick charge toward the crowd with pepper spray before retreating fighting escalated with little police interference until shots were fired from within the mass of people at 130 am with the assistance of an armored vehicle police advanced on the crowd with tear gas pepper spray and flashbangs the crowds were finally dispersed shortly after 200 am3 reactionsedit the day after the riot local newspapers carried a picture of a black man with brass knuckles engaged in an assault which came to symbolize the riot13 an editorial in the stranger said the incident was racially motivated and that much of the violence was directed at white civilians14 witnesses said gangs of black youth yelled racially charged slurs and sought white victims15 some eyewitnesses said that most of the attackers were black but that race was not a factor in who was victimized according to the seattle weekly police did not initially see the attacks as solely or even predominately racial violence16 racial issues overshadowed the sexual assaults that took place one man was charged with forcibly fondling a woman a photograph of a partially nude woman being groped by some two dozen men while lying topless and on her back won an award from the national press photographer association despite not being previously published in a newspaper17 in the wake of the riot schell announced a moratorium on mardi gras celebrations in seattle3 schell lost to greg nickels and mark sidran in the citys 2001 mayoral primary elections king county executive ron sims called the mardi gras riot and the protests at the 1999 world trade organization meeting defining issues10 in schells failed bid for reelection nickels made kimes death a political issue in his campaign saying the certificate of death would hang in his office should he become mayor he kept the pledge upon taking the office as mayor nickels retained gil kerlikowske as police chief despite criticism of the police departments inaction during the incident18 on the day after the mardi gras riot seattle experienced the 68 mw nisqually earthquake the worst in 37 years its scale caused people to refocus their attention on earthquake recovery and away from the violence outside the seattle area the incidents attracted little media attention and have largely been forgotten in 2011 local bars reattempted mardi gras celebrations in pioneer square smaller mardi gras events had been held but it was the first to consist of a collaboration between multiple establishments19 another group had considered organizing an event but the permitting process was too restrictive20 investigations and legal proceedingsedit gil kerlikowske kerlikowske originally ordered the police at the scene not to intervene instead maintaining a perimeter around the growing violence8 the city of seattle acknowledged that the police strategy during the incidents presented a public safety threat and the city made an almost 2000000 settlement with kimes family mayor paul schell who was at asleep at home during the events of tuesday evening appointed a threemember task force panel to investigate the cause of the riot10 he instructed them not to discuss the lack of police intervention which the public had been concerned about initially task force meetings were closed to the public but protest forced the city to open them to attendance the seattle police officers guild later voted no confidence in the chief citing the mardi gras riot as one of the reasons21 that night 21 were arrested dozens were later questioned by police after being identified through the use of videotape photographs and reports from eyewitnesses22 investigations showed that roughly 75 of the over 100 suspects were black many of the suspects had criminal records and were believed to be affiliated with gangs23 the man photographed and videotaped wearing brass knuckles and beating people aaron slaughter was sentenced to three years in prison for assaults on a woman and two men it ran concurrently with a ninemonth sentence he received for rendering criminal assistance during a brawl less than three months later24 a 17yearold jerell thomas was found guilty in the death of kime after jurors saw video footage of thomas hitting kime in the head three times he was also convicted of two counts of seconddegree assault for attacking two other men with a skateboard11 he originally received a 15year sentence his conviction was later overturned by a states supreme court decision finding that assailants could not be found guilty of murder if the intent of the assault was not to take a life in 2006 thomas avoided a new trial and plead guilty to seconddegree manslaughter he received a 10year sentence25 in december 2009 thomas was released from prison early he soon reoffended26
