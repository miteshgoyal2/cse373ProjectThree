gallery 5 references 6 external links historyedit first hotel adlonedit in the late 19th century european hotels which generally offered no more than overnight accommodation evolved to become social gathering places which could host large receptions given by nobility and the wealthy modeled on american hotels like the waldorf astoria new hotel buildings arose all over the continent with lavishly decorated ballrooms dining halls arcades smoking lounges libraries and coffeehouses in 1873 the hotel imperial opened in vienna followed by the hôtel ritz paris in 1898 and the london ritz in 1906 in berlin the capital of the german empire wilhelmine high society was eager to keep up with their rival metropolitan cities palais redern about 1900 in 1905 lorenz adlon a successful wine merchant and restaurateur originally from mainz purchased two properties on unter den linden adlon ran several coffeehouses in berlin among others in the berlin zoological garden and had raised capital to build a hotel on pariser platz at the heart of the german capital he convinced kaiser wilhelm ii that berlin needed a luxury hotel at the level of those in paris london and the other european capitals and so the kaiser personally interceded with the owners of the palais redern a neorenaissance landmark designed by karl friedrich schinkel in 1830 which sat at adlons chosen location the kaiser cleared the way for adlons purchase of the palais and for the subsequent demolition of the historic building designed by carl gause and robert leibnitz the hotel was built at a cost of 20 million gold marks 2 million of which were the majority of adlons personal fortune behind a rather sober façade the hotel was the most modern in germany with hot and cold running water an onsite laundry as well as its own power plant to generate electricity it boasted a huge lobby with enormous square marble columns a restaurant a cafe a palm court a ladies lounge a library a music room a smoking room a barber shop a cigar shop an interior garden with a japanesethemed elephant fountain and numerous grand ballrooms the hotel was decorated in a mix of neobaroque and louis xvi styles and furnished by the mainz company of bembé where lorenz adlon had been an apprentice carpenter in his youth it was located in the heart of the government quarter next to the british embassy on wilhelmstrasse facing the french and american embassies on pariser platz and only blocks from the reich chancellery and other government ministries further south on wilhelmstrasse hotel adlon 1926 the adlon opened on october 23 1907 with the kaiser his wife and many other notables in attendance it quickly became the social center of berlin as the rooms in the stadtschloss were cold and drafty the kaiser paid an annual retainer to keep suites available for his guests1 likewise the foreign office used the adlon for accommodation during state visits with guests including tsar nicholas ii of russia and maharaja bhupinder singh of patiala notable guests of the early years included industrialists such as thomas edison henry ford and john d rockefeller as well as politicians like walter rathenau gustav stresemann and the french prime minister aristide briand many wealthy berliners lived for extended periods of time in the hotel while its ballrooms hosted official government functions and society events after world war i and the abdication of the kaiser lorenz adlon remained a staunch monarchist and thus never imagined normal traffic would pass through the brandenburg gates central archway which had been reserved for the kaiser alone he therefore never looked before crossing in front of it tragically this resulted in adlon being hit by a car in 1918 at that spot three years later on april 7 1921 he was again hit by a car at exactly the same spot this time fatally lorenzs son louis adlon took over management of the hotel with his wife hedda who was germanborn but had been raised in america during the golden twenties the adlon remained one of the most famous hotels in europe hosting celebrity guests including louise brooks charlie chaplin mary pickford emil jannings albert einstein enrico caruso thomas mann josephine baker and marlene dietrich and also politicians like franklin roosevelt paul von hindenburg and herbert hoover the hotel was a favorite hangout of international journalists including william l shirer who mentions it frequently in his writings the hotel remained a social center of the city throughout the nazi period though the nazis themselves preferred the hotel kaiserhof a few blocks south and directly across from the propaganda ministry and hitlers chancellery on wilhelmplatz the adlon continued to operate normally throughout world war ii even constructing a luxurious bomb shelter for its guests and a huge brick wall around the lobby level to protect the function rooms from flying debris parts of the hotel were converted to a military field hospital during the final days of the battle of berlin the hotel survived the war without any major damage having avoided the bombs and shelling that had leveled the city however on the night of may 2 1945 a fire started in the hotels wine cellar by drunken red army soldiers left the main building in ruinscitation needed louis adlon himself was arrested in his home near potsdam by soviet troops on april 25 after they mistook him for a general due to his title of generaldirektor he died on a street in falkensee on may 7 1945 of cardiac insufficiency according to the death certificate2 east german hotel adlonedit
