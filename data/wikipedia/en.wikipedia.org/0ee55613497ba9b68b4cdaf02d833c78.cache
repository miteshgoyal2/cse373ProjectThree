state house staffer to counter the environmental protection agency wage and price controls and to respond to the defeat of barry goldwater in the 1964 presidential election1516 conservative legislators felt the word conservative was unpopular with the public at the time however so the organization was renamed as the american legislative exchange council15 in 1975 with the support of the american conservative union alec registered as a federal nonprofit agency1718 bill moyers and greenpeace have attributed the establishment of alec to the influential powell memorandum which led to the rise of a new business activist movement in the 1970s1920 alec was cofounded by conservative activist paul weyrich who also cofounded the heritage foundation1415 henry hyde who later became a us congressman and lou barnett who later became national political director of ronald reagans political action committee also helped to found alec early members included a number of state and local politicians who went on to statewide office including bob kasten tommy thompson and scott walker of wisconsin john engler of michigan terry branstad of iowa mitch daniels of indiana and john boehner and john kasich of ohio21 several members of congress also were involved in the organization during its early years including rep jack kemp of new york sen jesse helms of north carolina sen james l

government to embark on negotiations with a goal of dismantling apartheid23 in 1985 alec also published a memo that opposed the current homosexual movement portrayed homosexuality as a result of a conscious choice and said that pedophilia was one of the more dominant practices within the homosexual world24 alec spokesman bill meierling discussed the document in 2013 and said that alec does not draft model bills on social issues and added im also sad that the critics would not acknowledge that organizations change over time24 duane parde served as the executive director from december 1996 to january 200625 lori roman who served in the same role from 2006 to 2008 had an imperious style that led to financial difficulties and the departure of two thirds of alecs staff5 according to dolores mertz then a democratic iowa state representative and chairwoman of the alec board alec became increasingly partisan during that period with roman once telling mertz she didnt like democrats and she wasnt going to work with them26 ron scheberle became executive director in 2010 after acting as a lobbyist for verizon communications previously gte and as an alec board member14 by 2011 the number of alec legislative members had reached 2000 including more than 25 percent of all state legislators nationwide approximately 1000 bills based on alec language were being introduced in state legislatures every year with approximately 20 of those bills being enacted5 2011 to presentedit prior to 2011 alecs practices and its ties to specific pieces of legislation were little known outside of political circles27 in july 2011 the nation published a series of articles produced in collaboration with the center for media and democracy cmd that showcased some of the alec model bills and described ties to the koch family and cmd launched a website alec exposed that documented more than 800 of alec model bills the legislators and corporations that had helped to draft them and the states that enacted them27 the joint effort and particularly its coverage of alecs push for tough voter id laws prompted the advocacy group color of change to launch a public campaign to pressure corporations to withdraw their alec memberships27 the criticism among media outlets and political opponents was that alec was secretly subverting democratic institutions to further the aims of its corporate benefactors27 oregon state representative and alec member gene whisnant said in december 2011 were getting a lot of attention saying were trying to destroy the earth and everything on it5 alec staff and members promoted the organization as promoting publicprivate partnerships for the advancement of free market principles27 alec senior director of membership and development chaz cirame said the hook about some conspiracy or some secret organization is a lot better story than one about bringing state legislators together to talk about best practices around the country5 in 2012 alec was the subject of an occupy movement protest an internal revenue service complaint by common cause and calls for attorney general investigations in several states28 the shooting of trayvon martin on february 26 2012 led to increased public attention on standyourground gun laws that alec had supported27 color of change launched a new campaign in april to pressure alec corporate members to withdraw29 more than sixty corporations and foundations including cocacola wendys kraft foods mcdonalds amazoncom general electric apple procter gamble walmart the bill melinda gates foundation and the medical insurance group blue cross and blue shield dropped support of alec in the ensuing weeks or let their memberships lapse3031323334353637 thirtyfour legislative members also left alec38 alec responded by releasing a statement describing efforts by its critics as a campaign launched by a coalition of extreme liberal activists committed to silencing anyone who disagrees with their agenda2739 conservative political commentator ben shapiro wrote that liberals intimidated alec by wielding the corpse of trayvon martin as part of a broader anticapitalist push40 doug clopp of common cause credited alec exposed for the successful campaign saying that for 40 years you couldnt get the kind of accountability were seeing now because alec its members its legislators its bills were secret27 former visa inc lobbyist41 newt gingrich aide and gopac executive director lisa b nelson succeeded scheberle as ceo of alec in 201442 in late 2014 a number of technologyoriented companies such as google microsoft facebook ebay and yahoo announced that they were ending their ties to alec multiple companies cited environmental concerns as a point of contention with the organization43 google executive chairman eric schmidt remarked that alec was just literally lying about recent global climate change44454647 yahoo uber and lyft also announced withdrawals later that same week474849 occidental petroleum and northrop grumman also cut ties with alec50 in response to the departure of northrop grumman an alec spokesperson said like any other membership group membership in alec ebbs and flows and in 2014 we gained far more privatesector members than we lost51 tmobile and bp severed ties with alec in 20155253 organizationedit see also list of members of the american legislative exchange council as of december 2013

legislative seats in iowa and south dakota54 it also has approximately 300 corporate foundation and other privatesector members43 the chairmanship of alec is a rotating position with a new legislator appointed to the position each year as of 2012update 28 out of 33 of its chairs had been republicans26 alec has nine task forces that generate model bills that members may customize and introduce for debate in their own state legislatures private sector members effectively have veto power over model bills drafted by the task forces1314 the alec public safety and elections task force which promoted stand your ground gun laws and voter identification requirements was disbanded in april 2012 thereafter the national center for public policy research announced the creation of a voter id task force to replace the one discontinued by alec5556 bills drafted by the task forces must be approved by the alec board of directors composed exclusively of legislators before they are designated as model bills14 alec also has a private enterprise advisory council which meets whenever the board of directors meets14 council members include representatives from prominent corporations such as exxonmobil pfizer att sap se state farm insurance and koch industries57 alec statements assert that the council provides advice to the board of directors57 former alec cochairman noble ellington said in 2011 i really kind of think of us as one board although he added it’s certainly not our goal to sit there and do everything that business wants to have done14 daytoday operations are run from alecs arlington virginia office by an executive director and a staff of approximately 30 alecs bylaws specify that full membership shall be open to persons dedicated to the preservation of individual liberty basic

conservative and libertarian thinktanks spn is a member of alec60 and alec is an associate member of the spn61 spn encourages its members to join alec62 and many members of spn are also members of alec some of the think tanks in the spn write model legislation which then is introduced at alec private meetings63 alec is spns sister organisation according to the guardian64 alec is registered as a charity in 37 states28 in 2003 donald ray kennard then a louisiana state representative and alec national chairman said we are a very very conservative organization were just espousing what we really believe in13 craig horn a north carolina state representative and alec member said of alec in 2013 its a lightning rod organization because it has a decidedly conservative bent—there’s no doubt about it65 notable policies and model billsedit the alec website states that its goal is to advance the fundamental principles of freemarket enterprise limited government and federalism66 in 2003 donald ray kennard then a louisiana state representative and alec national chairman said we are a very very conservative organization were just espousing what we really believe in13 craig horn a north carolina state representative and alec member said of alec in 2013 its a lightning rod organization because it has a decidedly conservative bent—there’s no doubt about it65 although alec originally focused on social issues such as abortion which it opposed in more recent years the group has focused more on business and regulatory matters513 according to john nichols of the nation alecs agenda seems to be dictated at almost every turn by multinational corporations its to clear the way for lower taxes less regulation a lot of protection against lawsuits and alec is very very active in the opening up of areas via privatization for corporations to make more money particularly in places you might not usually expect like public education67 a brookings institution study of state legislation introduced in 2011–2012 found that alec model bills that became law were linked most often to controversial social and economic issues the study concluded that this phenomenon has hurt alec because dirtying its hands with social issues undermines alecs ability to exercise influence over fiscal ones68 stand your ground lawsedit stand your ground gun laws expanded to 30 states through the support of alec after florida passed its law in 2005697071 after the florida law had been passed alec adopted a model bill with the same wording3 in the wake of the shooting of trayvon martin in 2012 alecs support for stand your ground laws ultimately led to the departure of highprofile corporate members such as cocacola microsoft bank of america and general motors39 voter identificationedit prior to 2012 legislation based on alec model bills was introduced in many states to mandate or strengthen requirements that voters produce stateissued photographic identification the bills were passed and signed into law in six states5 voter identification bills introduced in 34 states would have made voting more difficult for students the elderly and the poor14 immigrationedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it august 2014 the support our law enforcement and safe neighborhoods act an arizona law commonly known as sb 1070 was drafted during an alec meeting in december 2009 and became an alec model bill72 enacted in 2010 sb 1070 was described as the toughest illegal immigration law in the us73 portions of sb 1070 were held by the supreme court to be preempted by federal law in 201274 bills similar to sb 1070 were passed in alabama georgia indiana and utah and have been introduced in 17 other states14 animal and ecological terrorism actedit one of alecs model bills is the animal and ecological terrorism act which classifies certain property destruction acts of intimidation and civil disobedience by environmental and animal rights activists as terrorism this model bill appeared across the us in various forms since it was drafted in 2003 the federal animal enterprise terrorism act has notable similarities and at points almost verbatim language to alecs model animal and ecological terrorism act the senate version of the animal enterprise terrorism act was sponsored by senator james inhofe a longtime member of alec75 many aggag bills are also similar to alecs model animal and ecological terrorism act which would make it against the law to film videotape or take photographs on livestock farms in order to defame the facility or its owner people found to be in violation would be put in a terrorist registry7677 criminal sentencing and prison managementedit according to governing magazine alec has been a major force behind both privatizing state prison space and keeping prisons filled13 alec has developed model bills advancing tough on crime initiatives including truth in sentencing and three strikes laws78 critics argue that by funding and participating in alecs criminal justice task force private prison companies directly influence legislation for tougher longer sentences corrections corporation of america and wackenhut corrections two of the largest forprofit prison companies in the us as of 2004update have been contributors to alec79 alec also has worked to pass state laws to allow the creation of privatesector forprofit prisons8081 marie gottschalk professor of political science at the university of pennsylvania said that alec has played a major role in liberating the private sector to employ penal labor and expand the privatization of corrections82 economist paul krugman wrote in 2012 that alec had a special interest in privatization—that is on turning the provision of public services from schools to prisons over to forprofit corporations and as such played a significant role in the penal–industrial complex as an example krugman wrote that the american bail coalition had declared publicly that alec was its life preserver83 alec disbanded the task force that favored harsh sentencing and now says it supports reducing prison overcrowding and lowering the costs associated with the criminal justice system78 it now promotes investing taxpayer money in alternatives to incarceration such as electronic monitoring78 energy and the environmentedit alec pushed for deregulation of the electricity industry in the 1990s maneuvering between two private sector members the former energy trader enron and the utilities trade association edison electric institute eei resulted in eei withdrawing its alec membership enrons position on the matter was adopted by alec and subsequently by many state legislatures13 in 2011 alec adopted model legislation having to do with public right to know laws regarding what fluids are used in hydraulic fracturing also known as fracking that was promoted as a victory for the right of consumers to know about potential drinking water contaminants in spite of the fact that the bill contained loopholes that would allow energy companies to withhold the names of certain fluid contents for reasons including that they have been deemed trade secrets9 alec has promoted a model bill that called plans in 2011 by the federal environmental protection agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions a train wreck that would harm the economy and it has supported efforts by various states to withdraw from regional climate change compacts5 in 2013 their resolution stated alec is very concerned about the potential economic impact of greenhouse gas regulation on electricity prices and the harm epa regulations may have on the economic recovery84 alec also has promoted a model bill that would call on the federal government to approve the proposed keystone xl project which would extend a synthetic crude oil pipeline from oil sands in alberta canada to nebraska8586 in 2013 alec planned legislation that would weaken state clean energy regulations and penalize homeowners who install their own solar panels and redistribute the electricity back into the grid whom alec has described as freeriders because they do not pay for the infrastructure costs of recirculating their generated power84 also in 2013 alec adopted a model bill saying that the role of human activity in causing climate change was uncertain that manmade climate change could be deleterious neutral or possibly beneficial and that the cost of regulating greenhouse gas emissions could cause great economic dislocation alec also has invited climate change skeptics such as craig idso to speak at its national meetings in 2015 common cause and the league of conservation voters pointed to such behavior to accuse alec of denying climate change alec responded by threatening legal action denying that alec supports climate change denial and saying it has more recently welcomed debate on the subject and supported renewable energy and carbon tax policies to curb global warming87 several corporations have announced that their affiliations with alec will be allowed to lapse over disagreement with the groups opposition to action on climate change these include ford motor company88 british petroleum89 microsoft google and royal dutch shell a statement by shell said its stance on climate change is clearly inconsistent with our ownwe have long recognized both the importance of the climate challenge and the critical role energy has in determining quality of life for people across the world an alec spokesperson responded climate change activists have conflated our opposition to the government picking winners and losers as climate change denial90 in december 2016 tesla motors not an alec member hosted an alec event in washington dc where alec promoted its energy innovation project that was partly funded by the clearpath foundation the project guides states toward innovation and entrepreneurship surrounding us energy resources9192 telecommunications and information technologyedit att and verizon drafted alec model legislation prohibiting public broadband services and sunsetting the public switched telephone network pstn93unreliable source names of its 172member task force the agenda of a december 2010 meeting and its minutes that included a resolution regarding traffic pumping were published by common cause94 in february 2014 senate bill 304 in kansas was introduced prohibiting cities and counties from building public broadband networks and providing internet service to businesses and citizens95 the bill contains an underserved area exemption for public wifi but the exemption criterion is not met anywhere in kansas the city of chanute kansas which has led broadband development since the 1980s financed through its public electricity company including free wifi in its college hospital and public spaces and a 4g mobile data network felt under attack by the bill95 the bill failed96 health careedit alec opposes the individual health insurance mandate enacted by the patient protection and affordable care act commonly known as the aca or obamacare alec filed an amicus brief in national federation of independent business v sebelius urging the supreme court to strike down the individual mandate of the aca in 2011 alec published the state legislators guide to repealing obamacare which has served as a road map for repeal efforts5 alec also has drafted a variety of model bills designed to block implementation of the law5 in august 2013 alec approved the health care freedom act as a model bill that aims to strip health insurers of their licenses to do business at the federal health care exchanges of aca if they accepted any subsidies under the system sean riley the head of the alec health and human services task force said the aim of the proposed legislation was to protect businesses from the acas employer mandate6 slate journalist david weigel has called the bill a sneak attack on the aca97 health insurance experts have predicted that if the bill were widely adopted by republicancontrolled states it would seriously disrupt the exchange and threaten the aca6 wendell potter former health insurance executive and cmd fellow said you cannot build the healthcare system based on the free market unless you have subsidies if they are taken away the whole thing collapses6 in 1989 alec published the draft hiv assault act which made it a crime for someone who is knowingly infected with hiv the virus that causes aids to have sex with a person who is not infected without disclosing the hiv infection the bill made having such sex without disclosure a criminal offense even when hiv was not transmitted alan smith who worked on the draft said the proposed law was a response to worries that people with aids were deliberately infecting others to make sure more people got it so more research money could be devoted to curing it7 other issuesedit alec has worked to privatize public education98 it frequently promotes model bills that expand publicprivate partnerships in education5 it has provided model legislation that led to the enactment of aggressive personal and corporate income tax cuts in kansas in 201299 governor sam brownback who promoted and signed the legislation was advised by the supplyside economist and alec board member arthur laffer who said at the time that the cuts would pay for themselves and lead to increased growth100 by fall 2014 however the tax cuts had led to the depletion of a 700 million budget surplus and although kansas had experienced 66 job growth from 2010 to 2013 that figure lagged behind the nations overall 88 job growth for the same period101 it also has promoted a model bill that limits liability for parent companies that acquire subsidiaries responsible for asbestosrelated injuries14 outside the united statesedit in july 2012 the guardian ran an article reporting that alec had taken action to oppose plain cigarette packaging laws outside the united states it is contacting governments that are planning to introduce bans on cigarette branding including the uk and australia102 alecs actions in funding and advising these efforts against plain packaging of tobacco products was cited as partial motivation for an academic study on the effectiveness of plain packaging which found that plain packaging can reduce positive perceptions of smoking and dissuade tobacco use103 karla jones a task force director for alec told participants at a meeting that proposed laws in canada the uk and australia would prohibit branding of tobacco products she said that the brands were the corporations most valuable assets alec wrote to the australian government stating that us legislators opposed the requirements for plain packaging alec also has stated that generic cigarettes increase cigarette consumption rather than reducing it102 training and assistanceedit in addition to providing a forum for the drafting of model legislation that may be adapted easily alec also provides assistance and training to its legislative members the oregon cochairman of alec gene whisnant described the organization in 2012 as a great resource for parttime legislators with limited staff resources28 mark pocan a democratic congressman from wisconsin and former member of the wisconsin assembly said in 2012 that alec advises members dont just introduce a single piece of legislation introduce 14 that way people cant oppose any one bill16 at one alec meeting media experts gave messaging advice and taught legislators how to use twitter to move alec bills through their chambers16 attendants also offered to write oped articles in local newspapers for the legislators and to put lawmakers in touch with other subject matter experts16 secrecy and transparencyedit although governing magazine reported in 2003 that alec meetings traditionally had been open to the public13 news organizations have reported since then that many meetings are held in private alec policy seminars are open to reporters and other nonmembers but public conference agendas unlike those distributed to members do not include the names of presenters the lists of legislative and privatesector board chairs nor the corporate sponsors of the seminars1214 task force meetings and billdrafting sessions are held behind closed doors1214 bloggers from thinkprogress and alternet were removed from conferences for attempting to take photographs of such sessions and tweeting the names of alec members who participated14 in 2013 washington post columnist dana milbank was turned away from the alec annual policy summit and told by spokesperson bill meierling that subcommittee meetings and task force meetings were closeddoor meierling said alec was introducing transparency gradually but it cant just kick the doors open104 shortly after the milbank incident the brookings institution reported that alecs activities during its closeddoor meetings are still a mystery and that alec could have a tremendous influence over lawmaking in the american states or it could have none at all—we just dont know68 in 2014 nebraska legislator and former alec member jeremy nordquist described alec as a faceless organization saying its allowing these corporate interests to just duck and cover and hide from really stepping into the public square and putting their ideas forward105 alec does not disclose its membership list nor the origins of its model bills843 lawmakers generally propose alecdrafted bills in their states without disclosing the alec authorship513 for instance in 2012 the starledger analyzed more than 100 bills and regulations previously proposed by the administration of new jersey governor chris christie and found a pattern of similarities with alec model bills that was too strong to be accidental the connections were based not on similarity of broad ideas but on specific numbers time frames benchmarks and language legislative staffers in the christie administration had mined alec for advice on budgetary matters medicaid changes and privatizing government servicesbeginning in the earliest days of christies governorship william schluter vice chairman of the new jersey ethics commission and a former republican state senator said there was a clear connection between alec and the proposed new jersey legislation a christie spokesperson denied any connection between the two12 one exception to this pattern came in november 2011 when former florida state representative rachel burgin introduced legislation to call on the federal government to reduce its corporate tax rate she mistakenly included the boilerplate whereas it is the mission of the american legislative exchange council to advance jeffersonian principles of free markets limited government federalism and individual liberty27106 when the inclusion of the alec mission statement was discovered the bill was withdrawn and resubmitted without the phrase the american prospect journalist abby rapoport wrote that the incident seems to confirm what many have assumed was occurring in state legislatures—and while burgins bill was hardly a major piece of legislation alecs reach in important policy areas seems hard to overestimate107 critics sometimes argue that by adopting alec model bills without disclosure state officials are handing off the duty of doing their own work to a businesscentered lobby12 in early 2012 democratic lawmakers in arizona and wisconsin introduced the alec accountability act of 2012 which would have required corporations to disclose alec funding108 arizona house of representatives assistant minority leader steve farley sponsor of the arizona bill argued that corporations have the right to present arguments but not secretly109 prior to 2013 access to alec model bills was restricted and its website required a password to access them1213 on july 13 2011 the center for media and democracy in cooperation with the nation posted 850 model bills created during a 30year period and created a web project alec exposed to host these model bills5110111112 the leak has been credited with triggering critical coverage about alec in both leftwing and mainstream media outlets5 alec subsequently published its model bills on its websitecitation needed although the brookings institution wrote in 2013 that there was reason to believe its list was incomplete68 on october 1 2012 common cause a liberal political advocacy group along with the center for media and democracy cmd filed a lawsuit under a wisconsin open records law alleging five republican lawmakers did not disclose whether they had used personal email accounts for correspondence with alec113 in one instance a wisconsin legislative representative had requested of alec in june 2012 that all correspondence be sent to his personal account114 according to cmd the legislators settled the suit in late october 2012 allowing their personal emails to be searched for such contacts and paying 2500 in court costs as part of the settlement115 in 2013 alecs north carolina state chairman jason saine described the organization as a resource for experts you can tap that follow a philosophy that you do from a less government viewpoint and said its not just some big secretive organization that its been portrayed65 corporate influence and allegations of lobbying activityedit corporate influenceedit the level of influence that the alec privatesector members hold over its publicsector members has been controversial according to the new york times special interests effectively turn alecs lawmaker members into stealth lobbyists providing them with talking points signaling how they should vote and collaborating on bills affecting hundreds of issues like school vouchers and tobacco taxes9 the guardian has described alec as a dating agency for republican state legislators and big corporations bringing them together to frame rightwing legislative agendas in the form of model bills6 the free lancestar has reported that alec had matured into one of big businesss most effective lobbying tools116 bloomberg businessweek described the organization as a bill laundry that offers companies substantial benefits that seem to have little to do with ideology14 chris taylor a democratic wisconsin state assemblyman who attended an alec conference in 2013 described alec as a welloiled machine and said in my observation it was the corporations and the rightwing think tanks driving the agendas corporations have as big a say as the legislators in the model legislation that is adopted117 alec legislative members generally deny being overly influenced by the organization or its model legislation and argue that corporate input in the drafting process helps to promote business growth5118 alec is unique in the sense that it puts legislators and companies together and they create policy collectively said scott pruitt then an oklahoma state representative and alec task force chair13 vance wilkins a former republican speaker of the virginia house of delegates and alec member said in 2002 just because business writes a bill doesnt make it bad we get bills from all angles and we still have to debate the issue116 whisnant alecs oregon cochair acknowledged in 2012 that corporations sometimes write model bills to promote their own interests and added but that doesnt mean ill support them28 harvey morgan another former virginia delegate and alec member said of alec conferences you know before you go that the bigbusiness view will prevail and thats not necessarily bad i still would like them to be a little more objective116 alan rosenthal a former rutgers university political science professor and expert on state legislatures and lobbying119 said in 2012 legislators dont sit down with a quill pen and draft legislation i think legislators should have the right to turn to wherever they want to get the ideas they prefer i have some confidence that theyre not being flimflammed28 experts agree that regardless of its propriety the alec model has been very effective bloomberg politics reported in 2014 that alec had no equal in accessing conservative policymakers43 rosenthal said of alec youve had the interest groups having access and sitting on other task forces but here youve really perfected it youve not only got them gaining access and interacting with legislators but you have them shaping policy together it seems to me thats a pretty major advance13 edwin bender executive director of the nonpartisan120121 national institute on money in state politics has said what makes alec different is its effectiveness in not just bringing the people together but selling a piece of legislation that was written by the industry and for the industry and selling it as a piece of mainstream legislation13 allegations of lobbying activityedit in april 2012 common cause filed a complaint with the internal revenue service objecting to alecs tax status as a nonprofit organization and alleged that lobbying accounted for more than 60 of its expenditures alec formally denied lobbying8122 although delores mertz who had previously served as chairwoman of the alec board said she was concerned about the lobbying thats going on especially with alecs 501c3 status26 reporting on the allegations bloomberg businessweek compared alecs work to that of lobbyists noting part of alecs mission is to present industrybacked legislation as grassroots work and that being a nonprofit rather than a lobby group allows deductibility of membership dues and freedom from disclosing the names of legislators who attend its educational seminars or the executives who give presentations to those legislators8 william schluter vice chairman of the new jersey ethics commission and a former republican state senator said of alecs activities when you get right down to it this is not different from lobbying it is lobbying any kind of large organization that adds to public policy or has initiatives involving public policy should be disclosed—not only their name but who is backing them12 according to governing magazine alec legislators often have their travel expenses paid as scholarships and are wined and dined and golfcoursed by private sector members5 in july 2013 common cause submitted a supplemental brief to the irs complaining about these practices123 alec responded to the original common cause complaint by denying it engaged in lobbying while saying that liberal groups were attacking alec because they dont have a comparable group that is as effective as alec in enacting policies into law124 as of 2015update the irs investigation remained open125 statutes in colorado south carolina and indiana exempt alec specifically by name from having to register as a lobbyist and report lobbying expenditures126 in 2013 alec created a 501c4 organization called the jeffersonian project that according to the guardian would allow alec to be far more overt in its lobbying activities than its current charitable status as a 501c339 fundingedit as of 2011update corporation think tank and trade group members accounted for almost 99 of alecs 7 million budget14 legislators pay 100 in biennial membership dues or 50 per year while nonlegislators pay 7000 to 25000 to join and more to participate in the task forces51265 in 2010 npr reported that tax records showed that corporations had collectively paid as much as 6 million a year to alec127 alecs total revenue in 2011 was 9 million65 in 2010 alec received 100000 each from att allergan and rj reynolds tobacco company to be named as president level sponsors at its annual meeting14 eleven other members including pfizer pfe and the institute for legal reform paid 50000 each to be named as chairman level sponsors14 as of 2011update altria the blue cross blue shield association and bp america were also 50000 chairman level sponsors14 exxon mobils foundation donated 30000 to alec in both 2005 and 2006 alan jeffers an exxon mobil spokesman said the company paid 39000 in dues in 2010 and sponsored a reception at the annual meeting in san diego for 25000 in august 2011 exxon spent 45000 to sponsor a workshop on natural gas128 according to the center for public integrity alec received 150000 from charles and david koch in 2011129 greenpeace claims that alec has received 525858 from koch foundations between 2005 and 2011130 corporate members also pay 3000 to 10000 for seats on task forces14 according to a december 2013 article in the guardian alec faced a funding shortfall after losing more than a third of its projected income when some 400 state legislators left its membership along with more than 60 corporate donors39 the organizations 2013 tax return indicated a 13 drop in total revenue from 84 million to 73 million131 see alsoedit
