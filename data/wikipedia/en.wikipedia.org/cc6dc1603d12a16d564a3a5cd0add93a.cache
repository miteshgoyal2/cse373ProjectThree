meteorology weather category · portal tropical cyclone category climatology climate category climate change category global warming category · portal v t e climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time ie decades to millions of years climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions or in the time variation of weather within the context of longerterm average conditions climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes variations in solar radiation received by earth plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions certain human activities have been identified as primary causes of ongoing climate change often referred to as global warming1 scientists actively work to understand past and future climate by using observations and theoretical models a climate record—extending deep into the earths past—has been assembled and continues to be built up based on geological evidence from borehole temperature profiles cores removed from deep accumulations of ice floral and faunal records glacial and periglacial processes stableisotope and other analyses of sediment layers and records of past sea levels more recent data are provided by the instrumental record general circulation models based on the physical sciences are often used in theoretical approaches to match past

its mean and spread2 of the climate system when considered over long periods of time regardless of cause3 accordingly fluctuations over periods shorter than a few decades such as el niño do not represent climate change the term climate change is often used to refer specifically to anthropogenic climate change also known as global warming anthropogenic climate change is caused by human activity as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of earths natural processes4 in this sense especially in the context of environmental policy the term climate change has become synonymous with anthropogenic global warming within scientific journals global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate change includes global warming and everything else that increasing greenhouse gas levels affect5 a related term is climatic change in 1966 the world meteorological organization wmo proposed the term climatic change to encompass all forms of climatic variability on timescales longer than 10 years regardless of cause change was a given and climatic was used as an adjective to describe this kind of change as opposed to political or economic change when it was realized that human activities had a potential to drastically alter the climate the term climate change replaced climatic change as the dominant term to reflect an anthropogenic cause climate change was incorporated in the title of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and the un framework convention on climate change unfccc climate change used as a noun became an issue rather than the technical description of changing weather6 causes see also attribution of recent climate change on the broadest scale the rate at which energy is received from the sun and the rate at which it is lost to space determine the equilibrium temperature and climate of earth this energy is distributed around the globe by winds ocean currents and other mechanisms to affect the climates of different regions factors that can shape climate are called climate forcings or forcing mechanisms7 these include processes such as variations in solar radiation variations in the earths orbit variations in the albedo or reflectivity of the continents atmosphere and oceans mountainbuilding and continental drift and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations there are a variety of climate change feedbacks that can either amplify or diminish the initial forcing some parts of the climate system such as the oceans and ice caps respond more slowly in reaction to climate forcings while others respond more quickly there are also key threshold factors which when exceeded can produce rapid change forcing mechanisms can be either internal or external internal forcing mechanisms are natural processes within the climate system itself eg the thermohaline circulation external forcing mechanisms can be either natural eg changes in solar output the earths orbit volcano eruptions or anthropogenic eg increased emissions of greenhouse gases and dust whether the initial forcing mechanism is internal or external the response of the climate system might be fast eg a sudden cooling due to airborne volcanic ash reflecting sunlight slow eg thermal expansion of warming ocean water or a combination eg sudden loss of albedo in the arctic ocean as sea ice melts followed by more gradual thermal expansion of the water therefore the climate system can respond abruptly but the full response to forcing mechanisms might not be fully developed for centuries or even longer internal forcing mechanisms scientists generally define the five components of earths climate system to include atmosphere hydrosphere cryosphere lithosphere restricted to the surface soils rocks and sediments and biosphere8 natural changes in the climate system internal forcings result in internal climate variability9 examples include the type and distribution of species and changes in oceanatmosphere circulations oceanatmosphere variability main article thermohaline circulation see also climate inertia pacific decadal oscillation 1925 to 2010 the ocean and atmosphere can work together to spontaneously generate internal climate variability that can persist for years to decades at a time1011 examples of this type of variability include the el niñosouthern oscillation the pacific decadal oscillation and the atlantic multidecadal oscillation these variations can affect global average surface temperature by redistributing heat between the deep ocean and the atmopshere1213 andor by altering the cloudwater vaporsea ice distribution which can affect the total energy budget of the earth1415 the oceanic aspects of these circulations can generate variability on centennial timescales due to the ocean having hundreds of times more mass than in the atmosphere and thus very high thermal inertia for example alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat in the worlds oceans due to the long timescales of this circulation ocean temperature at depth is still adjusting to effects of the little ice age16 which occurred between the 1600 and 1800s a schematic of modern thermohaline circulation tens of millions of years ago continentalplate movement formed a landfree gap around antarctica allowing the formation of the acc which keeps warm waters away from antarctica life life affects climate through its role in the carbon and water cycles and through such mechanisms as albedo evapotranspiration cloud formation and weathering171819 examples of how life may have affected past climate include glaciation 23 billion years ago triggered by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis which depleted the atmosphere of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and introduced free oxygen2021 another glaciation 300 million years ago ushered in by longterm burial of decompositionresistant detritus of vascular landplants creating a carbon sink and forming coal2223 termination of the paleoceneeocene thermal maximum 55 million years ago by flourishing marine phytoplankton2425 reversal of global warming 49 million years ago by 800000 years of arctic azolla blooms2627 global cooling over the past 40 million years driven by the expansion of grassgrazer ecosystems2829 external forcing mechanisms milankovitch cycles from 800000 years ago in the past to 800000 years in the future variations in co2 temperature and dust from the vostok ice core over the last 450000 years orbital variations main article milankovitch cycles slight variations in earths orbit lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the earths surface and how it is distributed across the globe there is very little change to the areaaveraged annually averaged sunshine but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution the three types of orbital variations are variations in earths eccentricity changes in the tilt angle of earths axis of rotation and precession of earths axis combined together these produce milankovitch cycles which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods30 their correlation with the advance and retreat of the sahara30 and for their appearance in the stratigraphic record3132 the ipcc notes that milankovitch cycles drove the ice age cycles co2 followed temperature change with a lag of some hundreds of years and that as a feedback amplified temperature change33 the depths of the ocean have a lag time in changing temperature thermal inertia on such scale upon seawater temperature change the solubility of co2 in the oceans changed as well as other factors impacting airsea co2 exchange34 solar output main article solar variation variations in solar activity during the last several centuries based on observations of sunspots and beryllium isotopes the period of extraordinarily few sunspots in the late 17th century was the maunder minimum the sun is the predominant source of energy input to the earth other sources include geothermal energy from the earths core tidal energy from the moon and heat from the decay of radioactive compounds both long and shortterm variations in solar intensity are known to affect global climate three to four billion years ago the sun emitted only 70 as much power as it does today if the atmospheric composition had been the same as today liquid water should not have existed on earth however there is evidence for the presence of water on the early earth in the hadean3536 and archean3735 eons leading to what is known as the faint young sun paradox38 hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different atmosphere with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently exist39 over the following approximately 4 billion years the energy output of the sun increased and atmospheric composition changed the great oxygenation event – oxygenation of the atmosphere around 24 billion years ago – was the most notable alteration over the next five billion years the suns ultimate death as it becomes a red giant and then a white dwarf will have large effects on climate with the red giant phase possibly ending any life on earth that survives until that time solar output also varies on shorter time scales including the 11year solar cycle40 and longerterm modulations41 solar intensity variations possibly as a result of the wolf spörer and maunder minimum are considered to have been influential in triggering the little ice age42 and some of the warming observed from 1900 to 1950 the cyclical nature of the suns energy output is not yet fully understood it differs from the very slow change that is happening within the sun as it ages and evolves research indicates that solar variability has had effects including the maunder minimum from 1645 to 1715 ad part of the little ice age from 1550 to 1850 ad that was marked by relative cooling and greater glacier extent than the centuries before and afterward4344 some studies point toward solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot activity affecting global warming and climate may be influenced by the sum of all effects solar variation anthropogenic radiative forcings etc4546 interestingly a 2010 study47 suggests “that the effects of solar variability on temperature throughout the atmosphere may be contrary to current expectations” in an aug 2011 press release48 cern announced the publication in the nature journal the initial results from its cloud experiment the results indicate that ionisation from cosmic rays significantly enhances aerosol formation in the presence of sulfuric acid and water but in the lower atmosphere where ammonia is also required this is insufficient to account for aerosol formation and additional trace vapours must be involved the next step is to find more about these trace vapours including whether they are of natural or human origin further information cosmic ray § postulated role in climate change volcanism in atmospheric temperature from 1979 to 2010 determined by msu nasa satellites effects appear from aerosols released by major volcanic eruptions el chichón and pinatubo el niño is a separate event from ocean variability the eruptions considered to be large enough to affect the earths climate on a scale of more than 1 year are the ones that inject over 100000 tons of so2 into the stratosphere49 this is due to the optical properties of so2 and sulfate aerosols which strongly absorb or scatter solar radiation creating a global layer of sulfuric acid haze50 on average such eruptions occur several times per century and cause cooling by partially blocking the transmission of solar radiation to the earths surface for a period of a few years the eruption of mount pinatubo in 1991 the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century affected the climate substantially subsequently global temperatures decreased by about 05 °c 09 °f for up to three years5152 thus the cooling over large parts of the earth reduced surface temperatures in 1991–93 the equivalent to a reduction in net radiation of 4 watts per square meter53 the mount tambora eruption in 1815 caused the year without a summer54 much larger eruptions known as large igneous provinces occur only a few times every fifty – one hundred million years – through flood basalt and caused in earth past global warming and mass extinctions55 small eruptions with injections of less than 01 mt of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere impact the atmosphere only subtly as temperature changes are comparable with natural variability however because smaller eruptions occur at a much higher frequency they too have a significant impact on earths atmosphere4956 seismic monitoring maps current and future trends in volcanic activities and tries to develop early warning systems in climate modelling the aim is to study the physical mechanisms and feedbacks of volcanic forcing57 volcanoes are also part of the extended carbon cycle over very long geological time periods they release carbon dioxide from the earths crust and mantle counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological carbon dioxide sinks the us geological survey estimates are that volcanic emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human activities which generate 100–300 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes58 a review of published studies indicates that annual volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide including amounts released from midocean ridges volcanic arcs and hot spot volcanoes are only the equivalent of 3 to 5 days of humancaused output the annual amount put out by human activities may be greater than the amount released by supererruptions the most recent of which was the toba eruption in indonesia 74000 years ago59 although volcanoes are technically part of the lithosphere which itself is part of the climate system the ipcc explicitly defines volcanism as an external forcing agent60 plate tectonics main article plate tectonics over the course of millions of years the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography this can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphereocean circulation61 the position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation the locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe and therefore in determining global climate a recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the isthmus of panama about 5 million years ago which shut off direct mixing between the atlantic and pacific oceans this strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what is now the gulf stream and may have led to northern hemisphere ice cover6263 during the carboniferous period about 300 to 360 million years ago plate tectonics may have triggered largescale storage of carbon and increased glaciation64 geologic evidence points to a megamonsoonal circulation pattern during the time of the supercontinent pangaea and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons65 the size of continents is also important because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland a larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents or islands human influences increase in atmospheric co2 levels main article global warming in the context of climate variation anthropogenic factors are human activities which affect the climate the scientific consensus on climate change is that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities66 and it is largely irreversible67 “science has made enormous inroads in understanding climate change and its causes and is beginning to help develop a strong understanding of current and potential impacts that will affect people today and in coming decades this understanding is crucial because it allows decision makers to place climate change in the context of other large challenges facing the nation and the world there are still some uncertainties and there always will be in understanding a complex system like earth’s climate nevertheless there is a strong credible body of evidence based on multiple lines of research documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities while much remains to be learned the core phenomenon scientific questions and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations” — united states national research council advancing the science of climate change of most concern in these anthropogenic factors is the increase in co2 levels this is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion followed by aerosols particulate matter in the atmosphere and the co2 released by cement manufacture68 other factors including land use ozone depletion animal husbandry ruminant animals such as cattle produce methane69 as do termites and deforestation are also of concern in the roles they play – both separately and in conjunction with other factors – in affecting climate microclimate and measures of climate variables70 physical evidence global temperature anomalies for 2015 compared to the 1951–1980 baseline 2015 was the warmest year in

on other plots northern hemisphere temperature alpine glacier extent vertically inverted as marked and human history as noted by the us nsf arctic temperature anomalies over a 100year period as estimated by nasa typical high monthly variance can be seen while longerterm averages highlight trends evidence for climatic change is taken from a variety of sources that can be used to reconstruct past climates reasonably complete global records of surface temperature are available beginning from the midlate 19th century for earlier periods most of the evidence is indirect—climatic changes are inferred from changes in proxies indicators that reflect climate such as vegetation ice cores72 dendrochronology sea level change and glacial geology temperature measurements and proxies the instrumental temperature record from surface stations was supplemented by radiosonde balloons extensive atmospheric monitoring by the mid20th century and from the 1970s on with global satellite data as well the 18o16o ratio in calcite and ice core samples used to deduce ocean temperature in the distant past is an example of a temperature proxy method as are other climate metrics noted in subsequent categories historical and archaeological evidence main article historical impacts of climate change climate change in the recent past may be detected by corresponding changes in settlement and agricultural patterns73 archaeological evidence oral history and historical documents can offer insights into past changes in the climate climate change effects have been linked to the collapse of various civilizations73 decline in thickness of glaciers worldwide over the past halfcentury glaciers glaciers are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change74 their size is determined by a mass balance between snow input and melt output as temperatures warm glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt the converse is also true glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings variability in temperature precipitation and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season therefore one must average over a decadal or longer timescale andor over many individual glaciers to smooth out the local shortterm variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate a world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on satellites this compilation tracks more than 100000 glaciers covering a total area of approximately 240000 km2 and preliminary estimates indicate that the remaining ice cover is around 445000 km2 the world glacier monitoring service collects data annually on glacier retreat and glacier mass balance from this data glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s stable or growing conditions during the 1920s and 1970s and again retreating from the mid1980s to present75 the most significant climate processes since the middle to late pliocene approximately 3 million years ago are the glacial and interglacial cycles the present interglacial period the holocene has lasted about 11700 years76 shaped by orbital variations responses such as the rise and fall of continental ice sheets and significant sealevel changes helped create the climate other changes including heinrich events dansgaard–oeschger events and the younger dryas however illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing glaciers leave behind moraines that contain a wealth of material—including organic matter quartz and potassium that may be dated—recording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated similarly by tephrochronological techniques the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of soil or volcanic tephra horizons whose date of deposit may also be ascertained arctic sea ice loss main articles arctic sea ice decline and climate change in the arctic the decline in arctic sea ice both in extent and thickness over the last several decades is further evidence for rapid climate change77 sea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface it covers millions of square miles in the polar regions varying with the seasons in the arctic some sea ice remains year after year whereas almost all southern ocean or antarctic sea ice melts away and reforms annually satellite observations show that arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 133 percent per decade relative to the 1981 to 2010 average78 play media this video summarizes how climate change associated with increased carbon dioxide levels has affected plant growth vegetation a change in the type distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur given a change in the climate some changes in climate may result in increased precipitation and warmth resulting in improved plant growth and the subsequent sequestration of airborne co2 a gradual increase in warmth in a region will lead to earlier flowering and fruiting times driving a change in the timing of life cycles of dependent organisms conversely cold will cause plant biocycles to lag79 larger faster or more radical changes however may result in vegetation stress rapid plant loss and desertification in certain circumstances8081 an example of this occurred during the carboniferous rainforest collapse crc an extinction event 300 million years ago at this time vast rainforests covered the equatorial region of europe and america climate change devastated these tropical rainforests abruptly fragmenting the habitat into isolated islands and causing the extinction of many plant and animal species80 forest genetic resources even though this is a field with many uncertainties it is expected that over the next 50 years climate changes will have an effect on the diversity of forest genetic resources and thereby on the distribution of forest tree species and the composition of forests diversity of forest genetic resources enables the potential for a species or a population to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes drought pests diseases and forest fire however species are not naturally capable to adapt in the pace of which the climate is changing and the increasing temperatures will most likely facilitate the spread of pests and diseases creating an additional threat to forest trees and their populations82 to inhibit these problems human interventions such as transfer of forest reproductive material may be needed83 pollen analysis palynology is the study of contemporary and fossil palynomorphs including pollen palynology is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant species which vary under different climate conditions different groups of plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material they resist decay changes in the type of pollen found in different layers of sediment in lakes bogs or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities these changes are often a sign of a changing climate8485 as an example palynological studies have been used to track changing vegetation patterns throughout the quaternary glaciations86 and especially since the last glacial maximum87 top arid ice age climate middle atlantic period warm and wet bottom potential vegetation in climate now if not for human effects like agriculture88 cloud cover and precipitation see also cloud and precipitation past precipitation can be estimated in the modern era with the global network of precipitation gauges surface coverage over oceans and remote areas is relatively sparse but reducing reliance on interpolation satellite clouds and precipitation data has been available since the 1970s89 quantification of climatological variation of precipitation in prior centuries and epochs is less complete but approximated using proxies such as marine sediments ice cores cave stalagmites and tree rings90 in july 2016 scientists published evidence of increased cloud cover over polar regions91 as predicted by climate models92 climatological temperatures substantially affect cloud cover and precipitation for instance during the last glacial maximum of 18000 years ago thermaldriven evaporation from the oceans onto continental landmasses was low causing large areas of extreme desert including polar deserts cold but with low rates of cloud cover and precipitation88 in contrast the worlds climate was cloudier and wetter than today near the start of the warm atlantic period of 8000 years ago88 estimated global land precipitation increased by approximately 2 over the course of the 20th century though the calculated trend varies if different time endpoints are chosen complicated by enso and other oscillations including greater global land cloud cover precipitation in the 1950s and 1970s than the later 1980s and 1990s despite the positive trend over the century overall899394 similar slight overall increase in global river runoff and in average soil moisture has been perceived93 dendroclimatology dendroclimatology is the analysis of tree ring growth patterns to determine past climate variations95 wide and thick rings indicate a fertile wellwatered growing period while thin narrow rings indicate a period of lower rainfall and lessthanideal growing conditions ice cores the antarctic temperature changes during the last several glacial and interglacial cycles of the present ice age analysis of ice in a core drilled from an ice sheet such as the antarctic ice sheet can be used to show a link between temperature and global sea level variations the air trapped in bubbles in the ice can also reveal the co2 variations of the atmosphere from the distant past well before modern environmental influences the study of these ice cores has been a significant indicator of the changes in co2 over many millennia and continues to provide valuable information about the differences between ancient and modern atmospheric conditions animals remains of beetles are common in freshwater and land sediments different species of beetles tend to be found under different climatic conditions given the extensive lineage of beetles whose genetic makeup has not altered significantly over the millennia knowledge of the present climatic range of the different species and the age of the sediments in which remains are found past climatic conditions may be inferred96 similarly the historical abundance of various fish species has been found to have a substantial relationship with observed climatic conditions97 changes in the primary productivity of autotrophs in the oceans can affect marine food webs98 sea level change main articles sea level and sea level rise the estimated change in sea level caused by carbon dioxide emissions global sea level change for much of the last century has generally been estimated using tide gauge measurements collated over long periods of time to give a longterm average more recently altimeter measurements — in combination with accurately determined satellite orbits — have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change99 to measure sea levels prior to instrumental measurements scientists have dated coral reefs that grow near the surface of the ocean coastal sediments marine terraces ooids in limestones and nearshore archaeological remains the predominant dating methods used are uranium series and radiocarbon with cosmogenic radionuclides being sometimes used to date terraces that have experienced relative sea level fall in the early pliocene global temperatures were 1–2˚c warmer than the present temperature yet sea level was 15–25 meters higher than today100101102 see also
