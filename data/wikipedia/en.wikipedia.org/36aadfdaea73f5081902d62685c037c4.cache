battle of seattle battle of port gamble coeur dalene war battle of pine creek battle of four lakes battle of spokane plains the battle of seattle was a january 26 1856 attack by native americans upon seattle washington2 at the time seattle was a settlement in the washington territory that had recently named itself after chief seattle sealth a leader of the suquamish and duwamish peoples of central puget sound3 backed by artillery fire and supported by marines from the united states navy sloopofwar decatur anchored in elliott bay seattles harbor then called duwamsh bay3 the settlers suffered only two deaths it is not known if any of the native american raiders died though the historian phelps writes that they later would admit to 28 dead and 80 wounded the battle part of the multiyear puget sound war or yakima war lasted a single day23 contents 1 terrain 2 prelude 3 battle 4 aftermath 5 casualties 6 notes and references terrainedit the seattle settlement of the time was located roughly where seattles pioneer square now sits t s phelpss memoir of the time described the settlement as …on a point or rather a small peninsula projecting from the eastern shore and about two miles 3 km from the mouth of duwamsh river debouching at the head of the bay the northern part of this peninsula is connected with the mainland by a low neck of marshy ground and about onesixteenth of a mile from its southeastern extremity a firm hard sandpit nearly joined it to the adjacent shore severed only by a narrow channel through which the surplus waters of an inclosed swamp escaped into the bay the south and west sides rose abruptly from the beach forming an embankment from three to fifteen feet high and proceeding thence northerly the ground undulated for an eighth of a mile when it gradually sloped towards the swamp and neck at the intersection of the latter with the main and overlooking the water rose a mound about thirty feet above the level of the bay and to the eastward through a depression in the hills and passing the head of the swamp was a broad indian trail leading to lake duwamsh now lake washington distant two and a half miles3 phelps remarks that the tailings from henry yeslers then recently erected mill were steadily filling in the marshy land at the north of the head or peninsula where the settlement was located3 further he describes the arrangement of the troops arrayed in defense on the nights before the battle the divisions… nightly occupied the shore vigilantly guarding the people as they slept and resting only when the morning light released them from the apprehended attack … they were distributed along the line of defense in the following order the fourth under lieutenant dallas commencing at southeast point extended along the bay shore to the sandbar where meeting with the right of the first division lieutenant drake the latter continued the line facing the swamp to a point halfway from the bar to a hotel situated midway between the bar and yeslers place and there joined the second under lieutenant hughes whose left resting on the hotel see mother damnable completed an unbroken line between the latter and southeast point while the howitzers crew lieutenant morris was stationed near plummers house to sweep the bar and to operate wherever circumstances demanded the third division lieutenant phelps occupied that portion of the neck lying between the swamp and mound east of yeslers place to secure the approaches leading from the lake and the marines under sergeant carbine garrisoned the blockhouse the divisions thus stationed left a gap between the second and third which the width and impassable nature of the swamp at this place rendered unnecessary to close thereby enabling a portion of the town to be encompassed which otherwise would have been exposed the distance between the blockhouse and southeast point following the sinuosities of the bay and swamp shores was threequarters of a mile to be defended by ninetysix men eighteen marines and five officers leaving gunner stocking carpenter miller clerks francis and ferguson and fifteen men with lieutenant middleton to guard the ship3 preludeedit the battle was part of the puget sound war a series of skirmishes in the region that had been occurring over the course of several months beginning october 28 1855 the natives had been angered by treaties imposed by territorial governor isaac stevens there had been fighting between federal troops and natives in southern king county thurston county2 and pierce county just five days before the attack on seattle governor stevens had declared a war of extermination upon the indians4 the sloop decatur had been called to puget sound both because of the trouble with local natives and to deter frequent raids by an alliance of haida from the queen charlotte islands and the tongass group of the tlingit from what was then russian america captained by isaac l sterret the vessel struck an uncharted reef near bainbridge island on december 7 1855 and was heavily damaged according to naval custom the reef was then named decatur reef they limped into seattle for repairs which lasted until january 19 sterret was temporarily taken off active duty december 10 although later returned to active duty however on the day of the battle decatur was commanded by guert gansevoort3 decatur lay at anchor in deep water in a position from which it had total command of the settlement with 16 shipborne 32pounders firing fuzed shells3 to the defense on land the ship contributed two ninepounder cannon and 18 stands of arms2 about this time the raiders were attacking the white river settlers those who survived fled to seattle there they joined the fifty or so seattle settlers assisted by marines from the decatur they had constructed a blockhouse23 from lumber originally intended for shipment to san francisco only days before the battle january 21 governor stevens arrived in seattle aboard uss active discounting rumors of war almost immediately upon his departure reports from friendly natives warned that the governor had been completely mistaken and that an attack was imminent these reports have been variously credited to chief seattle his daughter princess angeline or another chief sucquardle known also as curley or curly jim23 david swinson doc maynard reputed to have had far more than the usual concern for the natives rights and wellbeing evacuated 434 friendly natives to the west side of puget sound at his own expense and with the assistance of his wife25 the settlers had to some extent organized themselves for their own defense as volunteers under a captain hewett however this company of volunteers had disbanded and reformed several times over the months leading up to the battle on the evening january 22 with decatur now in a commanding position its leaders declared that they would not serve longer while there was a ship in port to protect them phelps writes that a more reckless undisciplined set of men has seldom been let loose to prey upon any community than these eighty embryo soldiers upon seattle… after much rough argument about thirty of their number became partially convinced that their individual safety depended upon unity of action under a competent leader and they finally consented to form a company provided mr peixotto would consent to serve as captain that gentleman accepted the honor…3 emily denny mentions the company as being captained by hewitt and including william gilliam as 1st lieutenant dt denny as corporal and robert olliver as sergeant6 phelps perhaps diplomatically names both hewitt and peixotto as captains3 phelps lists the hostile natives as including the kliktat klickitat and spokane palouses palus wallawalla yakami yakama kamialk nisqually puyallup lake duwamishrelated living near lake washington and other tribes estimated at six thousand warriors marshaled under the three generalsinchief coquilton owhi and lushi assisted by many subordinate chiefs they had failed to recruit several tribes or nations from the olympic peninsula nor did they succeed in winning the snoqualmie over to their cause despite the cordial hatred snoqualmie chief patkanim7 held toward the whites he decided that it was more expedient to take their side in the war3 portrait of chief leschi portrait of chief owhi two hostile chiefs—phelps says owhi and lushi presumably leschi2 other sources say owhi and coquilton—disguised themselves as friendly indians and reconnoitered the situation the night before the battle2 phelps describes this in some detail he himself was the sentry whom they tricked with a plausible story3 according to phelps account it would appear that at least two native chiefs were playing a double game curley jim had been considered friendly enough by the settlers to remain within their encampment conversely his nephew yarkekeeman had been considered one of the hostile force but according to phelps had every intention of betraying it from within curley jim now left the settlement in the company of his visitors and they parleyed around midnight at the lodge of a chief named tecumseh yarkekeeman and several chiefs of lesser note were also present they set out a plan to slaughter all of the settlers and us military curley requested that his friend henry yesler be allowed to live but accepted being overruled in the matter3 they resolved to attack in only a few hours around 2 am phelps wrote that that plan would have succeeded since no defender was planning for a predawn assault however yarkekeeman convinced the raiders to try a midmorning attack using a small decoy force to draw the decaturs men out of the welldefended areas to do battle on first hill3 there are no reliable estimates of the size of the attacking force isaac stevens who was not present wrote to washington that settlers estimated that 200 to 500 indians had taken the field against them phelps put the number of enemy at 2000 but write crowley and wilma frontier military officers often inflated the number of opposing forces to reinforce their accomplishments or to minimize their failures23 historian murray morgan writes that early reports seem to have multiplied by ten the actual numbers there could not have been more than one hundred and fifty4 many settlers resided on scattered claims divided by thick forest because to establish a land claim it was necessary to live on it6 some settlers doubted that the indians would attack and had to run for the blockhouse on the morning of the battle the first fatality of the engagement was jack drew a deserter from decatur who attempted to enter a cabin through a window and was shot dead by fifteenyearold milton holgate6 battleedit battle of seattle emily inez denny because the natives only common language was chinook jargon a trade language that many of the white settlers also spoke the settlers were able to hear and understand the attackers shouted orders and revealed many incidents of the battle they were anxious to conceal3 an indian known as jim a relative of curleys who died a few months later in a hunting accident evaded curleys vigilance and warned dr williamson of the impending attack williamson sent a messenger to yesler who informed gansevoort and decaturs troops abandoned their breakfast and returned to the positions they had held by night 52 women and children found refuge on board decatur and others on board the barque brontes the noncombatants of the friendly tribes took to their canoes to get out of the way curleys sister and yarkekeemans mother licumulow nancy whom phelps describes as short stout and incapable of running warned as she headed for her canoe that the kliktat were gathered around tom peppers house which was in the forest near the crest of first hill decatur fired off a howitzer shell in that direction the first shot of the battle phelps and a few others had been trying unsuccessfully to rouse the volunteers from their torpor at the sound of the howitzer shell they rushed as one for the blockhouse there sergeant carbine several times charged them out of one door to return as often by the other till wearying of the trouble he left them to cower behind the wooden bulwarks protected from the bullets of the foe23 the third division contrary to orders charged up the trail that led towards the lake this foolhardy charge met with an undeserved success as they pushed the attackers back without taking any casualties themselves klakum held a position behind a tree and shot at peixotto standing on the blockhouse steps but missed and killed a boy milton g holgate who was standing a few steps higher on the south end settlers on the peninsula faced off against natives on the mainland with a slough dividing them phelps describes the incessant rattle of smallarms and an uninterrupted whistling of bullets mingled with the furious yells of the indians but there were few casualties a settler was killed when he ducked from behind a stump to get some drinking water3 clarence bagley quoting william bell two days after the event says the casualty was christian white phelps writing 17 years later says it was robert wilson2 hans carl an invalided sailor on decatur died shortly thereafter but for reasons unrelated to the battle3 aftermathedit news of the attack spread rapidly by 4 pm it was known in bellingham at noon the day after the battle active steamed into elliott bay governor stevens aboard stevens was in phelpss words at last compelled to acknowledge the presence of hostile indians in the territory active headed south in the direction of steilacoom which seemed the most likely next target of an attack dropping the governor at olympia on the way3 yarkekeeman reported that the hostile chiefs were illprovisioned because confident of victory they expected to provision themselves from the settlers supplies they spent the next several weeks scouring the land for food3 two days after the battle coquilton threatened through a messenger that within one moon he would return with twenty thousand warriors and attacking by land and water destroy the place in spite of all the warship could do to prevent the threat was taken seriously and it was decided that seattles defenses must be improved henry yesler volunteered ships cargo of house lumber and on february 1 decaturs divisions began a twoweek project to erect two fences five feet high placed eighteen inches apart and filled in with welltamped earth 1200 yards 1100 m long and enclosing a large portion of the town a second blockhouse was also erected and an old ships cannon plus a 6pounder fieldpiece borrowed from active functioned as its artillery3 trees and undergrowth were removed variously attacked with levers axes and shovels or burned in place to provide an esplanade and enable decaturs howitzer to sweep the shores much brush was also cleared from the towns inland edges to reduce the cover for future attacks on february 24 uss massachusetts arrived and on march 28 uss john hancock3 the now well defended town did not however face a second battle defeat in the battle of seattle had discouraged the hostile natives and they did not again amass a comparable force furthermore governor stevens had convinced patkanim and his men to take on the role of bounty hunters paying them handsomely for collecting the scalps of leaders of the hostile tribes a task at which they were gruesomely successful3 morgan does not describe the battle as a victory for the americans rather he writes that both sides were dismayed the whites by the realization that the enemy really would attack a town the indians by their first experience with exploding shells rather than cannonballs4 also by stevenss order a courtmartial convened at seattle on may 15 for the trial of klakum and twenty other indians the military trial acquitted them deeming their actions as having been legitimate warfare not criminal acts and they were released after a declaration of peace it was certainly not the end of violence between settlers and natives in the region but it was the end of outright war3 nine days after the battle chief leschi and chief kitsap along with a group of 17 indians appeared at the home of john mcleod near the nisqually river mcleod was a former employee of the hudsons bay company had a nisqually wife and was trusted by the hostile indians leschi said neither he nor his band had taken part in the attack on seattle and that he thought the attack had been foolish leschi also asked that john swan another trusted white man visit leschis camp on the green river for a peace conference when swan did visit leschis camp a few days later he counted about 150 men of fighting age nearly all were from west of the cascades with only 10–20 from the east4 casualtiesedit two settlers died in the battle christian white or robert wilson see above and teenager milton holgate one sailor hans carl died of causes unrelated to the battle phelps characterizes the low casualties as incredible and miraculous given that one hundred and sixty men were for seven hours exposed to an almost uninterrupted storm of bullets the casualties on the native side are unknown phelps claimed personally to have seen ten die from one shell and that they later would admit to 28 dead and 80 wounded but remarked that the native women secreted the dead beyond all chance of discovery3 no indian bodies were found2 according to seattle lore decades after the battle seattles future fire chief gardner kellogg was excavating his house and found a shell from decatur that had buried itself without exploding he stuck it under a stump that he was trying to burn out and went off to lunch dexter horton stopped by to warm the seat of his pants at the fire and as it exploded nearly became the last casualty of the battle of seattle6 notes and referencesedit
