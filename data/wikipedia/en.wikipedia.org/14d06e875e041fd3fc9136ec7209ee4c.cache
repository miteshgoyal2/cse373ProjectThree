tunnel dstt also referred to as the metro bus tunnel is a 13milelong 21 km pair of public transit tunnels in seattle washington united states the tunnel serves downtown seattle running west under pine street from 9th avenue to 3rd avenue and south under 3rd avenue to south jackson street it was used only by buses from its opening in 1990 until 2005 and since 2009 it has been shared by buses and light rail the doubletrack tunnel and its stations except convention place constitute parts of the central link light rail line which continues north to the university of washington station and south through the rainier valley to seattle–tacoma international airport as part of sound transits link light rail network its five stations are also served by king county metro and sound transit express buses that leave the tunnel north via interstate 5 south via the sodo busway or east via interstate 90 the dstt is the busiest section of the link light rail network with an average of over 10000 weekday boardings it is owned by king county metro and shared with sound transit through a jointoperating agreement signed in 2002 the downtown seattle transit tunnel is one of two tunnels in the united states shared by buses and trains the other being the mount washington transit tunnel in pittsburgh and is the only one in the united states with shared stations though proposals for a rapid transit tunnel under 3rd avenue were introduced in the 1910s and 1920s planning for the modern bus and rail metro bus tunnel only began in 1974 the king county metro council approved the bus tunnel proposal in november 1983 but construction did not begin until march 1987 the tunnel between convention place and westlake stations was built using the cutandcover method closing pine street for 19 months and disrupting nearby retail businesses the segment from westlake to the international district was bored with two tunnelboring machines heading north from union station and finishing within a month of each other tests of normal buses and the breda dualmode buses built specifically for tunnel routes began in march 1989 tunnel construction was declared complete in june 1990 at a cost of 469 million light rail tracks were installed in anticipation of future rapid transit service through the tunnel which was later found to be poorly insulated and unusable for link light rail soft openings and public previews of the five tunnel stations were held from august 1989 to september 1990 with regular bus service beginning on september 15 carrying 28000 daily passengers in its first year of operation for the next several years until june 2004 service in the tunnel was provided exclusively by dualmode buses which ran as trolleybuses in the tunnel – like the citys extensive trolleybus system – and as diesel buses on surface streets and freeways the tunnel was closed on september 24 2005 for modification to accommodate both buses and sound transits central link light rail trains with shared lanes and platforms the roadway was lowered by 8 inches 20 cm and other improvements were made to prepare for light rail service new hybrid electric buses were moved into the tunnel to replace the breda fleet as the overhead wire was replaced for light rail trains the tunnel reopened on september 24 2007 and light rail service began on july 18 2009 a stub tunnel branching from the main tunnel was constructed under pine street to allow light rail trains to stop and reverse direction it was later used as the first segment of a light rail extension to capitol hill and the university of washington that opened in 2016 plans call for the downtown transit tunnel to lose its bus service during the permanent closure of convention place station in 2019 from that point on the

total of 11 wheelchairaccessible elevators connect the tunnel stations to the surface67 as part of the citys public art program that began in 1973 the downtown seattle transit tunnel and its stations were furnished with 15 million equivalent to 3 million in 2016 dollars8 in artwork by 25 artists commissioned by king county metro910 all tunnel stations except convention place are 60 feet 18 m below street level and consist of two side platforms two pickup lanes and a passing lane in the middle1112 the northern portal accessible to buses at street level from olive way and from interstate 5 via an express lane ramp is convention place station at the intersection of 9th avenue and pine street near the washington state convention center convention place is the only busexclusive station in the tunnel and consists of four sheltered platforms in a sunken openair layover space below street level13 buses enter the tunnel under 9th avenue passing under the historic camlin hotel before joining the university link tunnel used by light rail trains headed north for three blocks under pine street to capitol hill station1415 the dstt enters westlake station under pine street between 3rd and 6th avenues located between the westlake center shopping mall and westlake park the station features a twoblocklong mezzanine with exits to pine street and several retailers including the westlake center macys in the former the bon marché flagship store and the headquarters of nordstrom as well as the king county metro customer service center16 the area around the station is known as the westlake hub with connections to the south lake union streetcar and the seattle center monorail as well as the king county metro and sound transit buses17 leaving westlake station the tunnel turns south under century square to follow 3rd avenue and its transit mall through the central business district parallel to the shoreline of elliott bay15 three blocks south of pine street buses and trains enter university street station located between union and seneca streets adjacent to benaroya hall and 1201 third avenue in the financial district the station has a split mezzanine with entrances to 2nd avenue and university street accessible from the north half and an entrance to seneca street from the south half18 from university street the tunnel continues under 3rd avenue for five blocks entering the pioneer square neighborhood and historic district at this point 3rd avenue passes several of seattles skyscrapers including the historic seattle tower safeco plaza the fourth and madison building and the wells fargo center15 within university street station the tunnel passes over the centuryold great northern tunnel with a clearance of 15 feet 5 m19 pioneer square station is located between cherry street and yesler way with four entrances to nearby streets and prefontaine place serving two mezzanines the station serves the administrative centers of the seattle and king county governments

station include centurylink field to the west and uwajimaya a block to the southeast1525 south of the station the light rail tracks and bus lanes are separated by railway signals at an underground bus layover and staging area next to the tunnel comfort room for bus drivers26 the southern portal of the tunnel is located under the intersection of airport way and 5th avenue south at the western terminus of the interstate 90 express lanes for highoccupancy vehicles27 light rail trains and southbound buses continue from the tunnel in separated lanes on the sodo busway while eastbound buses use a ramp that merges with the interstate 90 express lanes that will be retrofitted for the east link light rail service in 202328 serviceedit a king county metro bus and sound transit link light rail train at university street station one of the shared bus–rail stations the downtown seattle transit tunnel is part of the third avenue transit spine the busiest transit corridor in seattle serving a combined average of 54000 weekday riders with bus stops on the surface29 the tunnel has a theoretical capacity of 40 trains per hour per direction with a minimum of 90second headways carrying 22000 passengers per hour per direction30 but is only able to carry 12000 per hour per direction in 4car light rail vehicles with current systems in place31 prior to the start of link light rail service the dstt could serve up to 145 buses during the afternoon rush hour32 as of 2012update the dstt carries 52600 daily riders of which 10000 are on light rail33 the tunnel carries a segment of the central link light rail line which runs from the university of washington station through downtown seattle and the rainier valley to seattle–tacoma international airport trains serve all downtown tunnel stations excluding convention place station13 20 hours a day every day during regular weekday service trains run roughly every six to 10 minutes during rush hour and midday operation respectively with longer headways of 15 minutes in the early morning and 20 minutes at night during weekends central link trains arrive every 10 minutes during midday hours and every 15 minutes during mornings and evenings light rail service from westlake to international districtchinatown takes approximately seven minutes434 as of september 2016update the dstt is served by seven bus routes stopping at all five tunnel stations at each station bus routes are divided into three bays labeled with their general direction bay a is served by three routes heading north toward northgate and the university district and east to kirkland via state route 520 bay c is served by three routes heading south through the sodo busway toward the rainier valley and renton and bay d is served by a single route sound transit express route 550 heading east to mercer island and bellevue via interstate 903536 since june 2012 inbound buses have been allowed to drop off and pick up passengers at the front end of the platform enabled after the elimination of the ride free area to speed up boarding times37 during closures of the downtown seattle transit tunnel tunnel buses are rerouted onto 2nd and 4th avenues between yesler way and pine street and stewart street and olive way between 2nd and boren avenues metro also runs a special route the route 97 link shuttle between all link light rail stations during service disruptions38 operationsedit the dstt is open for 20 hours on weekdays and saturdays from 500 am to 100 am the following day and for 18 hours on sundays from 600 am to midnight5 at the time of its opening in 1990 the metro bus tunnel only operated from 500 am to 700 pm on weekdays and 1000 am to 600 pm on saturdays with no sunday service39 the operating hours were temporarily extended into weekday nights from 1998 to 2000 at the request of the seattle seahawks and seattle mariners40 but were cut after the passage of initiative 695 and subsequent loss of motor vehicle excise tax revenue41 preparations for link light rail service restored latenight and full weekend hours for the tunnel introduced in june 2009 after sound transit express route 550 moved all of its trips into the tunnel42 coordination between buses and trains in the tunnel is managed by the link light rail operations control center occ located at the king county metro communication and control center in sodo the occ controls vehicle separation between buses and trains by using onboard radiofrequency identification tags installed on tunnel buses and light rail vehicles their locations tracked by passing over induction loops embedded in the tunnel roadway signals at each station indicate when a driver can proceed through the tunnel43 within the dstt bus speed limits are set at 15 miles per hour 24 kmh in stations and staging areas and 30 miles per hour 48 kmh between stations44 light rail trains and buses are required to wait in the tunnels between stations until the platform is cleared of vehicles ahead45 buses are mandated to keep a minimum of six seconds of separation between each other26 king county metro and sound transit the joint operators of the tunnel use two types of vehicles in the downtown seattle transit tunnel kinkisharyomitsui light rail vehicles and new flyer dieselelectric hybrid buses46 the buses dubbed tunnel buses by king county metro were ordered in 2004 to replace a fleet of breda dualmode electric trolleybuses whose overhead wire was to be removed in the tunnels renovation for light rail47 59 of the dualmode breda coaches were converted into fully electric trolleybuses between 2004 and 2007 and moved to surface routes4849 where they continued to operate for more than a decade before being fully replaced in 201650 the new flyer lowfloor 61footlong 19 m articulated buses feature a hush mode that allows buses to operate solely on stored electric power within the tunnel minimizing emissions and noise51 historyedit previous subway proposalsedit several proposals for a cutandcover subway tunnel under 3rd avenue in downtown seattle were presented to the city of seattle by predecessors of the seattle planning commission throughout the 20th century the first major proposal was part of urban planner virgil bogues plan for seattle in 1911 as route 1 of a proposed rapid transit network route 1 ran southeast on 3rd avenue from a circular ring around a proposed civic center in the denny regrade neighborhood to king street station paralleled to the west by a subway on 1st avenue known as route 17 stations on the line were to have additional entrances from department stores and other major businesses on 3rd avenue5253 the plan was supported by city engineer reginald h thomson and the municipal league among others but opposed by businesses fearing it would shift the commercial district further north and by the three daily newspapers published in seattle a special municipal election for the comprehensive plan was held on march 5 1912 in which seattle voters rejected it by a 10000vote margin5455 although bogues proposal was ultimately rejected some elements of the plan were independently studied by others including a rapid transit subway in downtown seattle in 1920 city engineer arthur h dimmock published a report recommending a rapid transit system for the city of seattle centered around a cutandcover subway tunnel under 3rd avenue from virginia street to yesler way the line was to connect to surface and elevated lines at dexter avenue olive way and south jackson street serving the neighborhoods of fremont eastlake capitol hill and north delridge in west seattle5657 the proposal which was expected not to be acted upon for at least 15 years gained little support and was called a project of purely academic interest by mayor hugh m caldwell who doubted that any rapid transit proposal would be seriously considered during his term58 the seattle city planning commission proposed its own rapid transit system in 1926 centered on an elevated line over western avenue with a possible parallel subway under 3rd avenue from yesler way to pike street59 the seattle traffic research commission published a report in 1928 recommending a subway under 2nd avenue from king street station to pike street as part of a longer rapid transit line serving the university district and fremont60 in the late 1950s the seattle transit commission proposed building a rapid transit system on the existing rightofway used by interstate 5 between tacoma seattle and everett with a twostation subway under 5th avenue in downtown seattle61 the most significant rapid transit proposal came as part of the forward thrust initiatives of the late 1960s which was centered around a downtown subway under 3rd avenue the subway would be fed by lines from ballard lake city the university district capitol hill bellevue and renton combining for a planned minimum headway of 15 minutes at rush hour 25 minutes during midday and five minutes at all other times62 the stations on 3rd avenue were to be situated at south jackson street and 5th avenue south james and cherry streets seneca and spring streets and pike and pine streets all planned to open by 1985 and operated by the municipality of metropolitan seattle63 seattle voters were asked to provide 385 million equivalent to 265 billion in 2016 dollars8 to supplement a 765 million grant equivalent to 527 billion in 2016 dollars8 from the urban mass transportation administration umta during a municipal election on february 13 1968 narrowly passing the bond by 508 but falling short of the required 60 percent supermajority64 a second attempt on may 19 1970 with an adjusted 440 million local contribution equivalent to 271 billion in 2016 dollars8 and 881 million federal grant equivalent to 543 billion in 2016 dollars8 failed to pass with only 46 approval amid a local recession caused by layoffs at boeing the earmarked funds intended for the forward thrust rapid transit project were instead allocated to atlanta to build its rapid transit system65 bus tunnel proposal and approvaledit the concept of a downtown bus tunnel was first proposed in 1974 during discussions between governor dan evans and seattle mayor wes uhlman about regional transportation projects in response to the proposed extension of interstate 90 into seattle via a third floating bridge crossing lake washington66 metro transit later commissioned a study into the bus tunnel67 released the following july which determined that it would not be able to adequately meet the rush hour demand of downtown bus ridership by 1980 the study suggested that a doubledecked tunnel with automated guideway transit to complement bus service running from union station to the seattle center would be able to meet projected demand at an estimated cost of 450 million68 ultimately the plan was rejected because of the high cost of ventilation for diesel buses that would use the tunnel69 the bus tunnel proposal resurfaced in 1979 outlining a tunnel from south jackson street to pine street that would carry 200 buses an hour in each direction at a cost of up to 350 million with the option of conversion for electric rail transit in the future the tunnel was suggested by metro officials and engineering consultants parsons brinckerhoff as a solution to worsening downtown traffic and was better received than alternative concepts69 the proposal gained further support from metro transit in its longterm metro 1990 plan adopted in 1981 as a transit mall or tunnel under 3rd avenue carrying buses that could be converted for a light rail system the puget sound council of governments pscog a regional planning agency endorsed metro transits proposal and integrated the tunnel into its proposed light rail line connecting seattle to snohomish county7071 the metro transit committee debated the inclusion of the bus tunnel in the projects environmental impact assessment well into 1983 seattle members opposing the tunnel in favor of a transit mall and suburban members supporting a bus tunnel that would be converted to a light rail system7273 on september 22 umta requested that a preferred alternative be declared by the end of november which prompted the metro council to expedite its decision metro council executive director neil peterson favored the tunnel alternative while the seattle city council and mayor charles royer preferred the transit mall but stated that a tunnel would be a longterm solution to downtown congestion74 the seattle city council reversed its decision on their preferred alternative voting unanimously on october 17 in favor of an electriconly transit tunnel along with mayor royer they were willing to compromise on petersons proposed dualmode buses to serve suburban commuters where trolleybuses were not feasible75 the metro council approved the downtown bus tunnel by a unanimous vote on november 3 1983 estimating a cost of 300 million to build a fivestation tunnel under 3rd avenue and pine street to be completed in 1989 along with the conversion of 3rd avenue into a landscaped transit mall76 planning funding and designedit metro unveiled its preliminary plans for the bus tunnel in january 1984 selecting five sites for stations along 3rd avenue and pine street at union station the king county courthouse between seneca and union streets at the westlake mall and near the washington state convention center the burlington northern railroad opposed metros preference for the tunnel to cross the existing great northern tunnel by going under it the agency stating that passing over would require a cutandcover tunnel that would disrupt city hall park77 the following month metro announced that it would use a fleet of 200 dualmode buses for the first decade of tunnel operations with an eventual switch to subway trains the bored tunnel would be able to carry 180 buses an hour in each direction serving either a wide island platform or two smaller side platforms that would be dug out from the surface7879 in april metro published the draft environmental impact statement for the tunnel project estimating a cost of 387 million equivalent to 892 million in 2016 dollars8 and a completion date of june 198980 the cost of the project drew criticism at public hearings for using a significant portion of metros capital budget a total of 840 million from sales tax revenue approved by voters in 1980 as well as potential disruption to business during the cutandcover construction of the stations and pine street segment of the tunnel8182 umta ranked metros bus tunnel project as first among transit projects favored to receive federal funding in 1985 despite its reliance on unproven dualmode buses metro tested a prototype renault per 180 dualmode trolleybus in 1983 describing it as problematic after finding it exceeded freeway axle load limits by 2 short tons 18 t and having to replace several parts after several mechanical failures83 congress later appropriated 20 million to the city of seattle for the bus tunnel project in october 1984 allowing for rightofway acquisition to begin84 but the funds were withheld until restrictions on new transit projects were lifted by the united states senate the following may85 the downtown transit project subcommittee unanimously approved metro recommendations that would reduce the number of bus tunnel stations from six to five saving 35 million as well as opting for tunnel boring machines for the 3rd avenue segment to minimize surfacelevel disruptions that would be present from cutandcover excavation86 stations would be located at union station south of jackson street under 3rd avenue and james street under 3rd avenue and university street at the westlake mall and at 9th avenue and pine street near the washington state convention center87 the metro council approved the station sites and use of tunnelboring machines in july 1985 proceeding with final design by approving a 259 million contract with parsons brinckerhoff for engineering work related to the project8889 in march 1986 the federal government offered metro a contract committing 195 million in umta funding toward the bus tunnel requiring that a decision on whether to move forward with the project be made by december 3190 a month later the king county council asked metro to consider delaying construction of the bus tunnel while waiting for assurance on federal funding being able to cover half of the 395 million cost of the project the council was scheduled to begin awarding contracts for utility relocation along 3rd avenue and pine street in preparation for tunnel construction91 on may 15 the reagan administration signed a contract with metro to commit 197 million of the 395 million required for the bus tunnel project assuming reauthorization of a mass transit grant program by congress while also extending the deadline for a final decision to september 198792 hours later the metro council awarded the first construction contract for utility relocation with construction set to begin in july93 the metro council accepted the umta contract during their june 5 meeting allowing for bidding on tunnel construction to begin94 the tunnel construction contract was awarded to the joint venture of guy f atkinson construction and dillingham construction in late september for 4416 million beating seven competing bids with an estimate far lower than the approximately 61 million predicted by metro engineers9596 the contract for the dualmode trolleybuses was awarded by the metro council to breda costruzioni ferroviarie in october consisting of an order for 236 buses at a cost of 133 million equivalent to 291 million in 2016 dollars897 it was approved by umta in november98 constructionedit a dualmode bus at westlake station in 1990 operating as an electric trolleybus while in the tunnel construction on the bus tunnel project began with partial closures of 3rd avenue in july 1986 for utility relocation narrowing traffic to one lane in either direction and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour99 to prepare for extended periods of service disruption on 3rd avenue metro transit also moved its electric trolleybus routes onto 1st avenue100 excavation of the 3rd avenue tunnel segment began with the ceremonial launch of the mighty mole a 140shortton 130 t 129footlong 39 m tunnel boring machine tbm on march 6 198711101 the tbm designed by robbins company of kent washington and built by nicholson manufacturing in seattle began digging the western tunnel from union station the following may102 a second identical mighty mole tbm began digging the parallel eastern tunnel on june 29103 during tunnel boring under 3rd avenue between spring street and madison street on october 21 a small earthflow damaged a water main and caused pavement on 3rd avenue to drop 8 inches 20 cm shutting down water in the nearby seattle city light and 1001 fourth avenue plaza buildings104 while repairing the broken water main electricians working on damaged highvoltage cables caused a small power outage that affected eight downtown buildings on the night of october 28 but were able to restore power by the following morning105 work on the western tunnel was briefly interrupted in november when the tbm hit an unexpectedly large pocket of loose sand under madison street that had to be stabilized with grout to prevent damage to the adjacent seattle city light building106 boring on both tunnels was stopped in early january 1988 when a pocket of wet sand was encountered 300 feet 91 m before the planned 90degree turn onto pine street107 metro and tunnel contractors atkinsondillingham who had scheduled tunnel excavation for completion in midjanuary closed 3rd avenue between pike and pine streets and installed 40 drilled wells to remove water from the sand pocket in february108 digging resumed on the western tunnel on march 14109 and the tbm reached westlake station on april 9 completing the first of the two tunnels110 the eastern tunnel was completed a month later on may 18 allowing for parts of the tbms to be salvaged and the steel outer shells to be buried in the tunnel111 the pine street segment of the tunnel was planned to be dug cutandcover from the surface in preparation for utility relocation work on pine street metro moved 36 bus routes serving the corridor to other east–west streets in february 1987112 on april 27 excavation of the tunnel began with the closure of pine street and its offramp to interstate 5 to automobile traffic between 3rd avenue and boren avenue113 workers finished digging in late august allowing the project to progress to concrete pouring for the roadway114 pine street was briefly reopened for the christmas shopping season beginning november 1 at the request of downtown merchants with a temporary surface laid over backfill for automobiles and pedestrians115 on january 4 the street was closed to automobile traffic once again along with the intersection of 5th avenue and pine street and the pike street offramp of i5 to install utility lines and a permanent roadway116 pine street was fully reopened to traffic on november 1 1988 coinciding with the completion of westlake park and the westlake center shopping mall a year ahead of schedule117 by october 1988 metro reported that 53 of major construction was complete and anticipated that the tunnel would be completed in may 1990 and opened for service in september 1990118 seattle mayor norm rice and city council members paul kraabel and george benson recommended a limited opening of the tunnel for the 1990 goodwill games to be held in july119 but metro rejected the proposal so that the safety systems of the tunnel could be tested adequately before service began120 testing in the bus tunnel began with a ceremonial first run on march 15 1989 first with a diesel bus and then one of the breda dualmode trolleybuses operating in diesel mode as the overhead trolley wires had not yet been installed121122 wooden planks and steel plates covered slots in the concrete roadway where rails would be installed later121122 local media were given a tour the next day122 by january 1990 the tunnel stations were declared nearly complete with only minor work still undone123 murals and other interactive art installations were placed in the nearly complete stations from december 1989 onward as part of a 15 million arts program124 tunnel construction was finished on june 7 1990 leaving metro to test safety systems and train personnel for regular service to begin in september125 the initial cost of the tunnel project was estimated in 1984 to be 3346 million but the final costs rose 56 over budget to a total of 4687 million equivalent to 859 million in 2016 dollars8126127 the projects cost overruns were blamed on unanticipated soil conditions on the approach to pine street from 3rd avenue complaints and payouts to downtown businesses disrupted by tunnel construction and the death of an electrician during construction11 excavated dirt from the project was used as fill for runway expansion at paine field in nearby everett128 south african granite scandaledit a minor scandal involving the bus tunnel project emerged in late 1988 over the discovery that granite to be used by metro in the tunnels stations had been sourced from south africa the verde fontaine granite was quarried in south africa which had been under apartheid rule at the time but was cut and finished in italy allowing for it to be approved despite the metro councils ongoing boycott of south african goods129130 the verde fontaine granite was selected for use as benches and interior walls in westlake and pioneer square stations by architecture firm tra metro was unaware that verde fontaine was only quarried in south africa the granites origin was discovered by an activist from the black contractors coalition in late 1988 who notified metro and members of the metro council metro determined that replacing the 24000 square feet 2200 m2 of granite would cost 500000 and delay both stations but would not delay the planned 1990 opening and would be covered by contingency funds in the projects budget131 during a press conference on january 25 1989 metro director alan gibbs confirmed that the granite had been quarried in south africa and announced that an investigative report would be delivered to the metro council transit committee the following week132 the announcement was met with calls from king county councilman ron sims to fire the responsible metro officials who knowingly allowed the purchase133 metros ban on south african goods was stricter than the federal sanctions which only prohibited importation of specific materials such as steel coal uranium and agricultural products and was used by umta to threaten to pull its funding for the bus tunnel project134 a report by the metro council rules committee delivered in march stated that the granites origin was discovered in early 1988 and was authorized by tunnel superintendent david kalberer with the assumption that only a small amount would be used to furnish university street station135 kalberer who received praise for his work on the project before the scandal admitted that the failure to consult the metro councils tunnel subcommittee before signing off on the deal was his mistake136 metro director alan gibbs resigned on february 23 as a result of the scandal and was succeeded by technical director richard sandaas in september137138 the granite was rejected by metro and was returned to the supplier in italy135136 before this discovery in september 1987 africanamerican rights groups had forced tunnel contractor atkinsondillingham to return 36 steel beams from south africa used for temporary shoring at pioneer square station this led metro director alan gibbs to propose a ban on south african materials by metro for its projects which was adopted by a resolution of the metro council on september 17139140 opening and busonly operationedit regular service in the bus tunnel began on september 15 1990 on five routes serving the university district north seattle and renton139 the limited service was the result of delays in the manufacturing of dualmode buses from breda which were fully delivered in 1991141142 the opening was preceded by soft openings of each individual station beginning with westlake station in august 1989 and ending with convention place station the day before the beginning of service143144 a ceremonial walk and run was held on september 9 1990 and attracted 5000 participants145146 in its first year of operations the bus tunnel carried 28000 daily passengers on 688 scheduled bus trips the tunnel reduced the number of buses operated on 3rd avenue at peak hours from 190 to 86 with 20 metro routes using the tunnel147 the seattle times called it a qualified success commenting that the tunnel was like a minisubway system the papers editorial board also requested that metro expand tunnel hours to keep buses running for latenight workers and entertainment events held on weekends148 on december 9 1991 the sodo busway opened extending bus service from the tunnel into sodo and moving southbound routes off interstate 5149 direct access from interstate 90 to the bus tunnel was opened in february 1992 as part of a reversible express lane system for the new floating bridge150 renovation for light railedit aerial view of convention place station the northern terminus of the tunnel and the only station not served by link light rail trains the bus tunnel was originally intended to be converted for use by light rail trains at some point in the future151 metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988 appropriating half of the 5 million used to install them during construction the remainder coming from federal sources152153 to save 15 million in costs metro eliminated most of the rails electrical insulation a move that would later make them unusable for rail service154 a regional transit authority was formed in the early 1990s to build and operate a light rail system that would use the bus tunnel within downtown seattle the authority later named sound transit gained voter approval in november 1996 to build a 39 billion system between seattle–tacoma international airport downtown seattle and the university district155 in 1998 sound transit found that the rails in the tunnel would need to be replaced at a cost of up to 110 million and require a full closure for two years the plan would also require the purchase of new hybrid electric buses to replace the breda fleet as the electrical systems were incompatible convention place station would have to be abandoned as it was too shallow to support a northern extension under interstate 5156157 sound transit approved its route for the light rail project named central link in november 1999 including four of the five stations in the downtown transit tunnel excluding convention place158 king county executive ron sims proposed transferring ownership of the tunnel along with 130 million in debt and liabilities for maintenance and operations from king county metro to sound transit in 2004159 the two agencies signed an agreement in may 2000 that formally transferred ownership and responsibility for the tunnel to sound transit in exchange for 1956 million paid to king county metro metro would retain ownership of convention place station and other assets while sound transit would convert the tunnel to rail operation after 2004160161 sound transit underwent a funding crisis in 2001 after the central link light rail project was found to be over budget and would not be able to open until 2009 three years later than planned162 the light rail project was truncated to westlake station in downtown seattle and to tukwila the sections north of downtown and south to the airport being deferred to a later date163 the king county council called for a new agreement to be negotiated with sound transit adding requirements for an adopted plan for light rail service to northgate and for a study into new riders that light rail would bring to the tunnel over a conventional bus network164 in early 2002 sound transit also explored and ultimately rejected a proposal to build a parallel railonly tunnel under 5th avenue that would cost 1 billion165 sound transit and the king county council signed a new jointoperations agreement in june 2002 leaving king county metro as owners of the tunnel and sound transit responsible for paying part of the tunnels debt service at an estimated cost of 65 million the agreement would allow for buses and light rail trains to share the tunnel and its stations beginning in 2009 after a twoyear closure for renovations166167 a separate agreement signed in may 2003 selected king county metro as the operator of the light rail line168 metro began testing a fleet of new hybrid dieselelectric buses in 2002 intending to use them in the bus tunnel before and after the conversion to joint busrail operations169 the first few of a planned fleet of 235 hybrid dieselelectric articulated buses began operating on tunnel bus routes in june 2004170 the breda dualmode trolleybuses were removed from the tunnel in january 2005 and would later be refurbished into electriconly trolleybuses for use on the citys trolleybus network48 the last day of trolleybus operation in the tunnel was january 24 2005 with only a single dualmode bus in service on the final day171172 in february 2004 sound transit announced that it would begin the closure and renovation of the bus tunnel in september 2005 two years earlier than scheduled to save money and reduce construction delays173 construction of a stub tunnel under pine street near convention place station to be used for light rail train storage and turnback as well as a future extension to capitol hill began in january 2005174 the bus tunnel was closed on september 24 2005 moving the tunnels 21 routes and 140 buses per hour to surface streets175 3rd avenue was converted to a transitpriority corridor during peak periods restricting general traffic to oneblock travel176 the 827 million construction contract for the transit tunnel renovation was awarded to balfour beatty in august 2004 12 percent below sound transits estimates177178 the majority of the cost was paid by sound transit and supplemented by 81 million from king county metro175 as part of the renovations the tunnels roadway was lowered by eight inches 20 cm to allow for level boarding required by the americans with disabilities act as a result metro added strobe lights to bus mirrors which were lowered to head height and added warning signs new electrical mechanical and emergency systems were installed along with a new communications system connecting to a jointoperations center154 the project ended up costing 94 million in total 34 percent over the budget set in 2004179 during the closure metro found that average travel time through downtown increased only 11 percent during the afternoon peak period and ridership on popular routes only dropped slightly180 joint bus and train operationsedit the tunnel reopened to service on september 24 2007 with tunnel routes modified to group common destinations together181182 stations were given new entrance signs lighting fixtures electronic passenger information signs and restored paint183 the peak busonly restrictions on 3rd avenue remained in place after the reopening along with the skipstop service that metro implemented on the street184 the tunnel was temporarily closed for nine days in december after a computer glitch disrupted the tunnels new emergencycontrol system which was repaired and replaced185 simulated light rail testing in the tunnel began on may 20 2009 with twocar trains operating alongside inservice buses making it the first joint bus and rail tunnel with stations in the united states186 service on the central link light rail line began on july 18 2009 operating from westlake station in the tunnel to tukwila international boulevard station near the airport187188 light rail service was extended north from westlake to university of washington station via capitol hill station on march 19 2016189 coinciding with the moving of several bus routes out of the tunnel to accommodate increased train frequencies190191 futureedit in november 2015 king county metro agreed to sell convention place station to the washington state convention center in a 147 million deal the convention center plans to build a new expansion on the property necessitating the closure of the station and transit tunnel to buses earlier than planned192 in 2017 sound transit and the seattle department of transportation announced that the tunnel would become railonly in 2019193 two years sooner than the planned switch in 2021 to coincide with the opening of the northgate link extension194 see alsoedit trolleybuses in seattle referencesedit a b
