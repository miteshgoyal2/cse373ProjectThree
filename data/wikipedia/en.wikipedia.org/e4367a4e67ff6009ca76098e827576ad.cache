on the linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets androids user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation using touch gestures that loosely correspond to realworld actions such as swiping tapping and pinching to manipulate onscreen objects along with a virtual keyboard for text input in addition to touchscreen devices google has further developed android tv for televisions android auto for cars and android wear for wrist watches each with a specialized user interface variants of android are also used on game consoles digital cameras pcs and other electronics initially developed by android inc which google bought in 2005 android was unveiled in 2007 along with the founding of the open handset alliance – a consortium of hardware software and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices beginning with the first commercial android device in september 2008 the operating system has gone through multiple major releases with the current version being 80 oreo released in august 2017 android applications apps can be downloaded from the google play store which features over 27 million apps as of february 2017 android has been the bestselling os on tablets since 2013 and runs on the vast majoritya of smartphones as of may 2017update android has two billion monthly active users and it has the largest installed base of any operating system androids source code is released by google under an open source license although most android devices ultimately ship with a combination of free and open source and proprietary software including proprietary software required for accessing google services android is popular with technology companies that require a readymade lowcost and customizable operating system for hightech devices its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the opensource code as a foundation for communitydriven projects which deliver updates to older devices add new features for advanced users or bring android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems the extensive variation of hardware in android devices causes significant delays for software upgrades with new versions of the operating system and security patches typically taking months before reaching consumers or sometimes not at all the success of android has made it a target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies contents 1 history 2 features 21 interface 22 applications 23 memory

running a prerelease version of android android inc was founded in palo alto california in october 2003 by andy rubin rich miner nick sears and chris white1213 rubin described the android project as tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owners location and preferences13 the early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in april 200414 the company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals and by five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching android as a handset operating system that would rival symbian and microsoft windows mobile1415 rubin had difficulty attracting investors early on and android was facing eviction from its office space steve perlman a close friend of rubin brought him 10000 in cash in an envelope and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding perlman refused a stake in the company and has stated i did it because i believed in the thing and i wanted to help andy1617 in july 200513 google acquired android inc for at least 50 million18 its key employees including rubin miner and white joined google as part of the acquisition13 not much was known about the secretive android at the time with the company having provided few details other than that it was making software for mobile phones13 at google the team led by rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the linux kernel google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible upgradeable system19 google had lined up a series of hardware components and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation20 speculation about googles intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through december 200621 an early prototype had a close resemblance to a blackberry phone with no touchscreen and a physical qwerty keyboard but the arrival of 2007s apple iphone meant that android had to go back to the drawing board2223 google later changed its android specification documents to state that touchscreens will be supported although the product was designed with the presence of discrete physical buttons as an assumption therefore a touchscreen cannot completely replace physical buttons24 in september 2007 informationweek covered an evalueserve study reporting that google had filed several patent applications in the area of mobile telephony2526 eric schmidt andy rubin and hugo barra at a 2012 press conference announcing googles nexus 7 tablet on november 5 2007 the open handset alliance a consortium of technology companies including google device manufacturers such as htc motorola and samsung wireless carriers such as sprint and tmobile and chipset makers such as qualcomm and texas instruments unveiled itself with a goal to develop the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices272829 the first commercially available smartphone running android was the htc dream also known as tmobile g1 announced on september 23 20083031 since 2008 android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat with the first few android versions being called cupcake donut eclair and froyo respectively during its announcement of android kitkat in 2013 google explained that since these devices make our lives so sweet each android version is named after a dessert although a google spokesperson told cnn in an interview that it’s kind of like an internal team thing and we prefer to be a little bit — how should i say — a bit inscrutable in the matter i’ll say32 in 2010 google launched its nexus series of devices a lineup in which google partnered with different device manufacturers to produce new devices and introduce new android versions the series was described as having played a pivotal role in androids history by introducing new software iterations and hardware standards across the board and became known for its bloatfree software with timely updates33 at its developer conference in may 2013 google announced a special version of the samsung galaxy s4 where instead of using samsungs own android customization the phone ran stock android and was promised to receive new system updates fast34 the device would become the start of the google play edition program and was followed by other devices including the htc one google play edition35 and moto g google play edition36 in 2015 ars technica wrote that earlier this week the last of the google play edition android phones in googles online storefront were listed as no longer available for sale and that now theyre all gone and it looks a whole lot like the program has wrapped up3738 from 2008 to 2013 hugo barra served as product spokesperson representing android at press conferences and google io google’s annual developerfocused conference he left google in august 2013 to join chinese phone maker xiaomi3940 less than six months earlier googles thenceo larry page announced in a blog post that andy rubin had moved from the android division to take on new projects at google and that sundar pichai would become the new android lead4142 pichai himself would eventually switch positions becoming the new ceo of google in august 2015 following the companys restructure into the alphabet conglomerate4344 making hiroshi lockheimer the new head of android4546 in june 2014 google announced android one a set of hardware reference models that would allow device makers to easily create highquality phones at low costs designed for consumers in developing countries474849 in september google announced the first set of android one phones for release in india5051 however recode reported in june 2015 that the project was a disappointment citing reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners and misfires from the search company that has never quite cracked hardware52 plans to relaunch android one surfaced in august 201553 with africa announced as the next location for the program a week later5455 a report from the verge in january 2017 stated that google is expanding its lowcost android one program while google itself probably won’t produce android one phones for the us the phones are reportedly due “before the middle of the year” and will be backed by lots of marketing money from google5657 google introduced the pixel and pixel xl smartphones in october 2016 marketed as being the first phones made by google5859 and exclusively featured certain software features such as the google assistant before wider rollout6061 the pixel phones replaced the nexus series62 with a new generation of pixel phones launched in october 201763 features see also list of features in android interface androids default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation using touch inputs that loosely correspond to realworld actions like swiping tapping pinching and reverse pinching to manipulate onscreen objects along with a virtual keyboard64 game controllers and fullsize physical keyboards are supported via bluetooth or usb6566 the response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user internal hardware such as accelerometers gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented67 or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device simulating control of a steering wheel68 android devices boot to the homescreen the primary navigation and information hub on android devices analogous to the desktop found on personal computers android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets app icons launch the associated app whereas widgets display live autoupdating content such as a weather forecast the users email inbox or a news ticker directly on the homescreen69 a homescreen may be made up of several pages between which the user can swipe back and forth70 thirdparty apps available on google play and other app stores can extensively retheme the homescreen71 and even mimic the look of other operating systems such as windows phone72 most manufacturers customize the look and features of their android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors73 along the top of the screen is a status bar showing information about the device and its connectivity this status bar can be pulled down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates70 notifications are short timely and relevant information about your app when it’s not in use and when tapped users are directed to a screen inside the app relating to the notification74 beginning with android 41 jelly bean expandable notifications allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for it to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from the notification75 an all apps screen lists all installed applications with the ability for users to drag an app from the list onto the home screen a recents screen lets users switch between recently used apps70 applications see also android software development and google play applications apps which extend the functionality of devices are written using the android software development kit sdk76 and often the java programming language77 java may be combined with cc78 together with a choice of nondefault runtimes that allow better c support79 the go programming language is also supported although with a limited set of application programming interfaces api80 in may 2017 google announced support for android app development in the kotlin programming language8182 the sdk includes a comprehensive set of development tools83 including a debugger software libraries a handset emulator based on qemu documentation sample code and tutorials initially googles supported integrated development environment ide was eclipse using the android development tools adt plugin in december 2014 google released android studio based on intellij idea as its primary ide for android application development other development tools are available including a native development kit ndk for applications or extensions in c or c google app inventor a visual environment for novice programmers and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks in january 2014 google unveiled an framework based on apache cordova for porting chrome html 5 web applications to android wrapped in a native application shell84 android has a growing selection of thirdparty applications which can be acquired by users by downloading and installing the applications apk android application package file or by downloading them using an application store program that allows users to install update and remove applications from their devices google play store is the primary application store installed on android devices that comply with googles compatibility requirements and license the google mobile services software8586 google play store allows users to browse download and update applications published by google and thirdparty developers as of july 2013update there are more than one million applications available for android in play store87 as of july 2013update 50 billion applications have been installed8889 some carriers offer direct carrier billing for google play application purchases where the cost of the application is added to the users monthly bill90 as of may 2017 there are over one billion active users a month for gmail android chrome google play and maps due to the open nature of android a number of thirdparty application marketplaces also exist for android either to provide a substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with google play store provide applications that cannot be offered on google play store due to policy violations or for other reasons examples of these thirdparty stores have included the amazon appstore getjar and slideme fdroid another alternative marketplace seeks to only provide applications that are distributed under free and open source licenses85919293 memory management since android devices are usually batterypowered android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum when an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that while available for immediate use rather than closed it does not use battery power or cpu resources9495 android manages the applications stored in memory automatically when memory is low the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes starting with those that have been inactive for longest9697 lifehacker reported in 2011 that thirdparty task killers were doing more harm than good98 virtual reality at google io on may 2016 google announced daydream a virtual reality platform that relies on a smartphone and provides vr capabilities through a virtual reality headset and controller designed by google itself99 the platform is built into android starting with android nougat differentiating from standalone support for vr capabilities the software is available for developers and was released in 2016 hardware htc dream or tmobile g1 the first commercially released device running android 2008 see also android hardware requirements the main hardware platform for android is the arm armv7 and armv8a architectures with x86 mips and mips64 and x8664 architectures also officially supported in later versions of android100101102 the unofficial androidx86 project provided support for the x86 architectures ahead of the official support103104 mips architecture was also supported before google did since 2012 android devices with intel processors began to appear including phones105 and tablets while gaining support for 64bit platforms android was first made to run on 64bit x86 and then on arm64 since android 50 lollipop 64bit variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the 32bit variants100 requirements for the minimum amount of ram for devices running android 71 range from in practice 2 gb for best hardware down to 1 gb for the most common screen to absolute minimum 512 mb for lowest spec 32bit smartphone the recommendation for android 44 is to have at least 512 mb of ram106 while for low ram devices 340 mb is the required minimum amount that does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor107 android 44 requires a 32bit armv7 mips or x86 architecture processor latter two through unofficial ports103108 together with an opengl es 20 compatible graphics processing unit gpu109 android supports opengl es 11 20 30 31 and as of latest major version 32 and vulkan some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the opengl es and suitable gpu hardware is required to run such applications109 android devices incorporate many optional hardware components including still or video cameras gps orientation sensors dedicated gaming controls accelerometers gyroscopes barometers magnetometers proximity sensors pressure sensors thermometers and touchscreens some hardware components are not required but became standard in certain classes of devices such as smartphones and additional requirements apply if they are present some other hardware was initially required but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether for example as android was developed initially as a phone os hardware such as microphones were required while over time the phone function became optional89 android used to require an autofocus camera which was relaxed to a fixedfocus camera89 if present at all since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when android started to be used on settop boxes in addition to running on smartphones and tablets several vendors run android natively on regular pc hardware with a keyboard and mouse110111112113 in addition to their availability on commercially available hardware similar pc hardwarefriendly versions of android are freely available from the androidx86 project including customized android 44114 using the android emulator that is part of the android sdk or thirdparty emulators android can also run nonnatively on x86 architectures115116 chinese companies are building a pc and mobile operating system based on android to compete directly with microsoft windows and google android117 the chinese academy of engineering noted that more than a dozen companies were customising android following a chinese ban on the use of windows 8 on government pcs118119120 development android green figure next to its original packaging android is developed by google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released at which point the source code is made available to the android open source project121 this source code can be found without modification on select devices mainly the nexus series of devices122 the source code is in turn adapted by original equipment manufacturers oems to run on their hardware123124 androids source code does not contain the often proprietary device drivers that are needed for certain hardware components125 in 2007 the green android logo was designed for google by graphic designer irina blok the design team was tasked with a project to create a universally identifiable icon with the specific inclusion of a robot in the final design after numerous design developments based on science fiction and space movies the team eventually sought inspiration from the human symbol on restroom doors and modified the figure into a robot shape as android is opensource it was agreed that the logo should be likewise and since its launch the green logo has been reinterpreted into countless variations on the original design126 update schedule see also android version history google announces major incremental upgrades to android on a yearly basis127 the updates can be installed on devices overtheair128 the latest major release is 80 oreo announced in march 2017129 and released the following august130131 compared to its primary rival mobile operating system apples ios android updates typically reach various devices with significant delays except for devices within the google nexus brand updates often arrive months after the release of the new version or not at all132 this is partly due to the extensive variation in hardware in android devices133 to which each upgrade must be specifically tailored a time and resourceconsuming process134 manufacturers often prioritize their newest devices and leave old ones behind135 additional delays can be introduced by wireless carriers that after receiving updates from manufacturers further customize and brand android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending the upgrade out to users135136 there are also situations in which upgrades are not possible due to one manufacturing partner not providing necessary updates to drivers137 the lack of aftersale support from manufacturers and carriers has been widely criticized by consumer groups and the technology media138139140 some commentators have noted that the industry has a financial incentive not to upgrade their devices as the lack of updates for existing devices fuels the purchase of newer ones141 an attitude described as insulting140 the guardian complained that the method of distribution for updates is complicated only because manufacturers and carriers have designed it that way140 in 2011 google partnered with a number of industry players to announce an android update alliance pledging to deliver timely updates for every device for 18 months after its release however there has not been another official word about that alliance since its announcement135142 in 2012 google began decoupling certain aspects of the operating system particularly its core applications so they could be updated through the google play store independently of the os one of those components google play services is a closedsource systemlevel process providing apis for google services installed automatically on nearly all devices running android 22 froyo and higher with these changes google can add new system functionality through play services and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself143 as a result android 42 and 43 jelly bean contained relatively fewer userfacing changes focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements144 in may 2016 bloomberg reported that google was making efforts to keep android more uptodate including accelerated rates of security updates rolling out technological workarounds reducing requirements for phone testing and ranking phone makers in an attempt to shame them into better behavior as stated by bloomberg as smartphones get more capable complex and hackable having the latest software work closely with the hardware is increasingly important hiroshi lockheimer the android lead admitted that it’s not an ideal situation further commenting that the lack of updates is the weakest link on security on android wireless carriers were described in the report as the most challenging discussions due to carriers slow approval time due to testing on their networks despite some carriers including verizon and sprint having already shortened their respective approval times htcs thenexecutive jason mackenzie called monthly security updates unrealistic in 2015 and google was trying to persuade carriers to exclude security patches from the full testing procedures in a further effort for persuasion google shared a list of top phone makers measured by updated devices with its android partners and is considering making the list public mike chan cofounder of phone maker nextbit and former android developer said that the best way to solve this problem is a massive rearchitecture of the operating system or google could invest in training manufacturers and carriers to be good android citizens145146147 linux kernel androids kernel is based on one of the linux kernels longterm support lts branches as of 2017 android devices mainly use versions 318 or 44 of the linux kernel148 the actual kernel depends on the individual device149 androids variant of the linux kernel has further architectural changes that are implemented by google outside the typical linux kernel development cycle such as the inclusion of components like device trees ashmem ion and different out of memory oom handling150151 certain features that google contributed back to the linux kernel notably a power management feature called wakelocks152 were initially rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because they felt that google did not show any intent to maintain its own code153154 google announced in april 2010 that they would hire two employees to work with the linux kernel community155 but greg kroahhartman the current linux kernel maintainer for the stable branch said in december 2010 that he was concerned that google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream linux154 google engineer patrick brady once stated in the companys developer conference that android is not linux156 with computerworld adding that let me make it simple for you without linux there is no android157 ars technica wrote that although android is built on top of the linux kernel the platform has very little in common with the conventional desktop linux stack156 in august 2011 linus torvalds said that eventually android and linux would come back to a common kernel but it will probably not be for four to five years158 in december 2011 greg kroahhartman announced the start of android mainlining project which aims to put some android drivers patches and features back into the linux kernel starting in linux 33159 linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 35 kernel after many previous attempts at merger the interfaces are the same but the upstream linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes to memory the traditional suspend that android uses and to disk hibernate as it is known on the desktop160 google maintains a public code repository that contains their experimental work to rebase android off the latest stable linux versions161162 the flash storage on android devices is split into several partitions such as system for the operating system itself and data for user data and application installations163 in contrast to desktop linux distributions android device owners are not given root access to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as system are readonly however root access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in android which is used frequently by the opensource community to enhance the capabilities of their devices164 but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware165 android is a linux distribution according to the linux foundation166 googles opensource chief chris dibona167 and several journalists168169 others such as google engineer patrick brady say that android is not linux in the traditional unixlike linux distribution sense android does not include the gnu c library it uses bionic as an alternative c library and some of other components typically found in linux distributions170 as of latest version android oreo google mandates a minimum kernel version and kernel configuration for security reasons eg linux kernel 44 or newer version number requirement can be relaxed based on hardware or dropped for upgraded devices171 software stack androids architecture diagram on top of the linux kernel there are the middleware libraries and apis written in c and application software running on an application framework which includes javacompatible libraries development of the linux kernel continues independently of other androids source code bases until version 50 android used dalvik as a process virtual machine with tracebased justintime jit compilation to run dalvik dexcode dalvik executable which is usually translated from the java bytecode following the tracebased jit principle in addition to interpreting the majority of application code dalvik performs the compilation and native execution of select frequently executed code segments traces each time an application is launched172173174 android 44 introduced android runtime art as a new runtime environment which uses aheadoftime aot compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the installation of an application in android 44 art was an experimental feature and not enabled by default it became the only runtime option in the next major version of android 50175 for its java library the android platform uses a subset of the now discontinued apache harmony project176 in december 2015 google announced that the next version of android would switch to a java implementation based on openjdk177 androids standard c library bionic was developed by google specifically for android as a derivation of the bsds standard c library code bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the linux kernel the main benefits of using bionic instead of the gnu c library glibc or uclibc are its smaller runtime footprint and optimization for lowfrequency cpus at the same time bionic is licensed under the terms of the bsd licence which google finds more suitable for the androids overall licensing model174 aiming for a different licensing model toward the end of 2012 google switched the bluetooth stack in android from the gpllicensed bluez to the apachelicensed bluedroid178 android does not have a native x window system by default nor does it support the full set of standard gnu libraries this made it difficult to port existing linux applications or libraries to android170 until version r5 of the android native development kit brought support for applications written completely in c or c179 libraries written in c may also be used in applications by injection of a small shim and usage of the jni180 since marshmallow toybox a collection of command line utilities mostly for use by apps as android doesnt provide a command line interface by default replaced similar toolbox collection181 android has another operating system trusty os within it as a part of trusty software components supporting a trusted execution environment tee on mobile devices trusty and the trusty api are subject to change applications for the trusty os can be written in cc c support is limited and they have access to a small c library all trusty applications are singlethreaded multithreading in trusty userspace currently is unsupported thirdparty application development is not supported in the current version and software running on the os and processor for it run the drm framework for protected content there are many other uses for a tee such as mobile payments secure banking fulldisk encryption multifactor authentication device reset protection replayprotected persistent storage wireless display cast of protected content secure pin and fingerprint processing and even malware detection182 opensource community android has an active community of developers and enthusiasts who use the android open source project aosp source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system183 these communitydeveloped releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturercarrier channels with a comparable level of quality184 provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates or bring android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems such as the hp touchpad community releases often come prerooted and contain modifications not provided by the original vendor such as the ability to overclock or overundervolt the devices processor185 cyanogenmod was the most widely used community firmware186 and cyanogenmod has been discontinued and lineageos is the successor of cyanogenmod187 historically device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of thirdparty firmware development manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this188 moreover modified firmware such as cyanogenmod sometimes offer features such as tethering for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium as a result technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions are common in many devices however as communitydeveloped software has grown more popular and following a statement by the librarian of congress in the united states that permits the jailbreaking of mobile devices189 manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding third party development with some including htc188 motorola190 samsung191192 and sony193 providing support and encouraging development as a result of this over time the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders similar to nexus series of phones although usually requiring that users waive their devices warranties to do so188 however despite manufacturer acceptance some carriers in the us still require that phones are locked down frustrating developers and customers194 security and privacy see also mobile security and warrior pride scope of surveillance by public institutions as part of the broader 2013 mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in september 2013 that the american and british intelligence agencies the national security agency nsa and government communications headquarters gchq respectively have access to the user data on iphone blackberry and android devices they are reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information including sms location emails and notes195 in january 2014 further reports revealed the intelligence agencies capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the internet by social networks and other popular applications such as angry birds which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons gchq has according to the guardian a wikistyle guide of different apps and advertising networks and the different data that can be siphoned from each196 later that week the finnish angry birds developer rovio announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations and called upon the wider industry to do the same197 the documents revealed a further effort by the intelligence agencies to intercept google maps searches and queries submitted from android and other smartphones to collect location information in bulk196 the nsa and gchq insist their activities are in compliance with all relevant domestic and international laws although the guardian stated the latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information especially for those outside the us who enjoy fewer privacy protections than americans196 common security threats research from security company trend micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of android malware where text messages are sent from infected phones to premiumrate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties198 security threats on android are reportedly growing exponentially however google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons199200 and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users199 google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare200 and a survey conducted by fsecure showed that only 05 of android malware reported had come from the google play store201 in august 2015 google announced that devices in the google nexus series would begin to receive monthly security patches google also wrote that nexus devices will continue to receive major updates for at least two years and security patches for the longer of three years from initial availability or 18 months from last sale of the device via the google store202203204 the following october researchers at the university of cambridge concluded that 877 of android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support205206207 ron amadeo of ars technica wrote also in august 2015 that android was originally designed above all else to be widely adopted google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share so it was happy to give up control and give everyone a seat at the table in exchange for adoption now though android has around 75–80 percent of the worldwide smartphone market—making it not just the worlds most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system period as such security has become a big issue android still uses a software update chainofcommand designed back when the android ecosystem had zero devices to update and it just doesnt work208 following news of googles monthly schedule some manufacturers including samsung and lg promised to issue monthly security updates209 but as noted by jerry hildenbrand in android central in february 2016 instead we got a few updates on specific versions of a small handful of models and a bunch of broken promises210 in a march 2017 post on googles security blog android security leads adrian ludwig and mel miller wrote that more than 735 million devices from 200 manufacturers received a platform security update in 2016 and that our carrier and hardware partners helped expand deployment of these updates releasing updates for over half of the top 50 devices worldwide in the last quarter of 2016 they also wrote that about half of devices in use at the end of 2016 had not received a platform security update in the previous year stating that their work would continue to focus on streamlining the security updates program for easier deployment by manufacturers211 furthermore in a comment to techcrunch ludwig stated that the wait time for security updates had been reduced from six to nine weeks down to just a few days with 78 of flagship devices in north america being uptodate on security at the end of 2016212 patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lowerpriced devices213214 however the opensource nature of android allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them for highly secure uses for example samsung has worked with general dynamics through their open kernel labs acquisition to rebuild jelly bean on top of their hardened microvisor for the knox project215216 android smartphones have the ability to report the location of wifi access points encountered as phone users move around to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points these databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones allowing them to run apps like foursquare google latitude facebook places and to deliver locationbased ads217 third party monitoring software such as taintdroid218 an academic researchfunded project can in some cases detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers219 technical security features android applications run in a sandbox an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the systems resources unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed220 since february 2012 google has used its google bouncer malware scanner to watch over and scan apps available in the google play store221222 a verify apps feature was introduced in november 2012 as part of the android 42 jelly bean operating system version to scan all apps both from google play and from thirdparty sources for malicious behavior223 originally only doing so during installation verify apps received an update in 2014 to constantly scan apps and in 2017 the feature was made visible to users through a menu in settings224225 before installing an application the google play store displays a list of the requirements an app needs to function after reviewing these permissions the user can choose to accept or refuse them installing the application only if they accept226 in android 60 marshmallow the permissions system was changed apps are no longer automatically granted all of their specified permissions at installation time an optin system is used instead in which users are prompted to grant or deny individual permissions to an app when they are needed for the first time applications remember the grants which can be revoked by the user at any time227228 the new permissions model is used only by applications developed for marshmallow using its software development kit sdk and older apps will continue to use the previous allornothing approach permissions can still be revoked for those apps though this might prevent them from working properly and a warning is displayed to that effect229230 in september 2014 jason nova of android authority reported on a study by the german security company fraunhofer aisec in antivirus software and malware threats on android nova wrote that the android operating system deals with software packages by sandboxing them this does not allow applications to list the directory contents of other apps to keep the system safe by not allowing the antivirus to list the directories of other apps after installation applications that show no inherent suspicious behavior when downloaded are cleared as safe if then later on parts of the app are activated that turn out to be malicious the antivirus will have no way to know since it is inside the app and out of the antivirus’ jurisdiction the study by fraunhofer aisec examining antivirus software from avast avg bitdefender eset fsecure kaspersky lookout mcafee formerly intel security norton sophos and trend micro revealed that the tested antivirus apps do not provide protection against customized malware or targeted attacks and that the tested antivirus apps were also not able to detect malware which is completely unknown to date but does not make any efforts to hide its malignity231 in august 2013 google announced android device manager renamed find my device in may 2017232233 a service that allows users to remotely track locate and wipe their android device234235 with an android app for the service released in december236237 in december 2016 google introduced a trusted contacts app letting users request locationtracking of loved ones during emergencies238239 licensing the source code for android is opensource it is developed in private by google with the source code released publicly when a new version of android is released google publishes most of the code including network and telephony stacks under the noncopyleft apache license version 20 which allows modification and redistribution240241 the license does not grant rights to the android trademark so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from google under individual contracts associated linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft gnu general public license version 2 developed by the open handset alliance with the source code publicly available at all times typically google collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device part of the nexus series featuring the new version of android then makes the source code available after that device has been released242 the only android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tabletonly 30 honeycomb release the reason according to andy rubin in an official android blog post was because honeycomb was rushed for production of the motorola xoom243 and they did not want third parties creating a really bad user experience by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of android intended for tablets244 only the base android operating system including some applications is opensource software whereas most android devices ship with a substantial amount of proprietary software such as google mobile services which includes applications such as google play store google search and google play services – a software layer that provides apis for the integration with googleprovided services among others these applications must be licensed from google by device makers and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements86 custom certified distributions of android produced by manufacturers such as touchwiz and htc sense may also replace certain stock android apps with their own proprietary variants and add additional software not included in the stock android operating system85 there may also be binary blob drivers required for certain hardware components in the device85125 some stock applications in aosp code that were formerly used by earlier versions of android such as search music and calendar have been abandoned by google in favor of nonfree replacements distributed through play store google search google play music and google calendar that are no longer opensource moreover opensource variants of some applications also exclude functions that are present in their nonfree versions such as photosphere panoramas in camera and a google now page on the default home screen exclusive to the proprietary version google now launcher whose code is embedded within that of the main google application85245246247 richard stallman and the free software foundation have been critical of android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as replicant because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of android devices are usually proprietary and because the google play store application can forcibly install or deinstall applications and as a result invite nonfree software although the free software foundation has not found google to use it for malicious reasons248249 leverage over manufacturers google licenses their google mobile services software along with android trademarks only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet googles compatibility standards specified in the android compatibility program document250 thus forks of android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of googles nonfree components stay incompatible with applications that require them and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of google play store85 examples of such android forks are amazons fire os which is used on the kindle fire line of tablets and oriented toward amazon services the nokia x software platform a fork used by the nokia x family oriented primarily toward nokia and microsoft services and other forks that exclude google apps due to the general unavailability of google services in certain regions such as china251252 in 2014 google also began to require that all android devices which license the google mobile services software display a prominent powered by android logo on their boot screens86 members of the open handset alliance which include the majority of android oems are also contractually forbidden from producing android devices based on forks of the os85253 in 2012 acer inc was forced by google to halt production on a device powered by alibaba groups aliyun os with threats of removal from the oha as google deemed the platform to be an incompatible version of android alibaba group defended the allegations arguing that the os was a distinct platform from android primarily using html5 apps but incorporated portions of androids platform to allow backwards compatibility with thirdparty android software indeed the devices did ship with an application store which offered android apps however the majority of them were pirated254255256 reception androidx86 running on an asus eeepc netbook android has been unofficially ported to traditional pcs for use as a desktop operating system android received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007 although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with google to form the open handset alliance it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with android257 the idea of an opensource linuxbased development platform sparked interest258 but there were additional worries about android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market such as nokia and microsoft and rival linux mobile operating systems that were in development259 these established players were skeptical nokia was quoted as saying we dont see this as a threat and a member of microsofts windows mobile team stated i dont understand the impact that they are going to have260 since then android has grown to become the most widely used smartphone operating system261262 and one of the fastest mobile experiences available263 reviewers have highlighted the opensource nature of the operating system as one of its defining strengths allowing companies such as nokia nokia x family264 amazon kindle fire barnes noble nook ouya baidu and others to fork the software and release hardware running their own customised version of android as a result it has been described by technology website ars technica as practically the default operating system for launching new hardware for companies without their own mobile platforms261 this openness and flexibility is also present at the level of the end user android allows extensive customisation of devices by their owners and apps are freely available from nongoogle app stores and third party websites these have been cited as among the main advantages of android phones over others261265 despite androids popularity including an activation rate three times that of ios there have been reports that google has not been able to leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn android into the money maker that analysts had expected266 the verge suggested that google is losing control of android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of nongoogle apps and services – amazons kindle fire line uses fire os a heavily modified fork of android which does not include or support any of googles proprietary components and requires that users obtain software from its competing amazon appstore instead of play store85 in 2014 in an effort to improve prominence of the android brand google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an android logo on the boot screen86 android has suffered from fragmentation267 a situation where the variety of android devices in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them makes the task of developing applications that work consistently across the ecosystem harder than rival platforms such as ios where hardware and software varies less for example according to data from opensignal in july 2013 there were 11868 models of android device numerous different screen sizes and eight android os versions simultaneously in use while the large majority of ios users have upgraded to the latest iteration of that os268 critics such as apple insider have asserted that fragmentation via hardware and software pushed androids growth through large volumes of low end budgetpriced devices running older versions of android they maintain this forces android developers to write for the lowest common denominator to reach as many users as possible who have too little incentive to make use of the latest hardware or software features only available on a smaller percentage of devices269 however opensignal who develops both android and ios apps concluded that although fragmentation can make development trickier androids wider global reach also increases the potential reward268 market share main article usage share of operating systems research company canalys estimated in the second quarter of 2009 that android had a 28 share of worldwide smartphone shipments270 by may 2010 android had a 10 worldwide smartphone market share overtaking windows mobile271 whilst in the us android held a 28 share overtaking iphone os272 by the fourth quarter of 2010 its worldwide share had grown to 33 of the market becoming the topselling smartphone platform273 overtaking symbian274 in the us it became the topselling platform in april 2011 overtaking blackberry os with a 312 smartphone share according to comscore275 by the third quarter of 2011 gartner estimated that more than half 525 of the smartphone sales belonged to android276 by the third quarter of 2012 android had a 75 share of the global smartphone market according to the research firm idc277 in july 2011 google said that 550000 android devices were being activated every day278 up from 400000 per day in may279 and more than 100 million devices had been activated280 with 44 growth per week278 in september 2012 500

share varies by location in july 2012 mobile subscribers aged 13 in the united states using android were up to 52284 and rose to 90 in china285 during the third quarter of 2012 androids worldwide smartphone shipment market share was 75277 with 750 million devices activated in total in april 2013 android had 15 million activations per day282 as of may 2013update 48 billion applications apps have been installed from the google play store286 and by september 2013 one billion android devices have been activated287 as of february 2017update the google play store has over 27 million android applications published288 and as of may 2016update apps have been downloaded more than 65 billion times289 the operating systems success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the socalled smartphone wars between technology companies290291 android devices account for more than half of smartphone sales in most markets including the us while only in japan was apple on top

windows ios and mac os x devices combined299 according to statcounter which tracks only the use for browsing the web android is the most popular mobile operating system since august 2013300 android is the most popular operating system for web browsing in india and several other countries eg virtually all of asia with japan and north korea exceptions according to statcounter android is most used on mobile in all african countries and it stated mobile usage has already overtaken desktop in several countries including india south africa and saudi arabia301 with virtually all countries in africa having done so already except for seven countries including egypt such as ethiopia and kenya in which mobile including tablets usage is at 9046 android only accounts for 7581 of all use there302303 while android phones in the western world commonly include googles proprietary addons such as google play to the otherwise opensource operating system this is increasingly not the case in emerging markets abi research claims that 65 million devices shipped globally with opensource android in the second quarter of 2014 up from 54 million in the first quarter depending on country percent of phones estimated to be based only on androids source code aosp forgoing the android trademark thailand 44 philippines 38 indonesia 31 india 21 malaysia 24 mexico 18 brazil 9304 according to a january 2015 gartner report android surpassed a billion shipments of devices in 2014 and will continue to grow at a doubledigit pace in 2015 with a 26 percent increase year over year this made it the first time that any generalpurpose operating system has reached more than one billion end users within a year by reaching close to 116 billion end users in 2014 android shipped over four times more than ios and os x combined and over three times more than microsoft windows gartner expected the whole mobile phone market to reach two billion units in 2016 including android305 describing the statistics farhad manjoo wrote in the new york times that about one of every two computers sold today is running android it has become earth’s dominant computing platform18 according to a statisticas estimate android smartphones had an installed base of 18 billion units in 2015 which was 76 of the estimated total number of smartphones worldwide306307b android has the largest installed base of any mobile

market share317 according to an april 2017 statcounter report android overtook microsoft windows to become the most popular operating system for total internet usage318319 it has maintained the plurality since then320 in september 2015 google announced that android had 14 billion monthly active users321322 this changed to 2 billion monthly active users in may 2017323324 adoption on tablets the firstgeneration nexus 7 tablet running android 41 jelly bean despite its success on smartphones initially android tablet adoption was slow325 one of the main causes was the chicken or the egg situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an android tablet due to a lack of high quality tablet applications but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet applications until there was a significant market for them326327 the content and app ecosystem proved more important than hardware specs as the selling point for tablets due to the lack of android tabletspecific applications in 2011 early android tablets had to make do with existing smartphone applications that were illsuited to larger screen sizes whereas the dominance of apples ipad was reinforced by the large number of tabletspecific ios applications327328 despite app support in its infancy a considerable number of android tablets alongside those using other operating systems such as the hp touchpad and blackberry playbook were rushed out to market in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the ipad327 infoworld has suggested that some android manufacturers initially treated their first tablets as a frankenphone business a shortterm lowinvestment opportunity by placing a smartphoneoptimized android os before android 30 honeycomb for tablets was available on a device while neglecting user interface this approach such as with the dell streak failed to gain market traction with consumers as well as damaging the early reputation of android tablets329330 furthermore several android tablets such as the motorola xoom were priced the same or higher than the ipad which hurt sales an exception was the amazon kindle fire which relied upon lower pricing as well as access to amazons ecosystem of applications and content327331 this began to change in 2012 with the release of the affordable nexus 7 and a push by google for developers to write better tablet applications332 according to international data corporation shipments of androidpowered tablets surpassed ipads in q3 2012333 as of the end of 2013 over 1916 million android tablets had sold in three years since 2011334335 this made android tablets the mostsold type of tablet in 2013 surpassing ipads in the second quarter of 2013336 according to statcounters web use statistics as of august 15 2017 android tablets represent the majority of tablet devices used in south america 5746337 and africa 6908338 while being a distant second to ios in north america 2529 and europe 3264 despite having sizeable majorities in many central american caribbean and eastern european states339 and representing the majority in asia 5125340 notably in india 6598341 and indonesia 8218342 android is an extremely distant second at 1193 in oceania as well mostly due to australia 1071 and new zealand 169 while in some countries such as nauru over 80 of tablets are believed to use android343 as well android is more often than not used by the minority of web users in antarctica which has no permanent population344 in march 2016 galen gruman of infoworld stated that android devices could be a real part of your business theres no longer a reason to keep android at arms length it can now be as integral to your mobile portfolio as apples ios devices are345 a year earlier gruman had stated that microsofts own mobile office apps were better on ios and android than on microsofts own windows 10 devices346 platform usage   oreo 02   nougat 178   marshmallow 320   lollipop 277   kitkat 145   jelly bean 66

es 30 or higher application piracy in general paid android applications can easily be pirated348 in a may 2012 interview with eurogamer the developers of football manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was 91 for their game football manager handheld349 however not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue for example in july 2012 the developers of the game windup knight said that piracy levels of their game were only 12 and most of the piracy came from china where people cannot purchase apps from google play350 in 2010 google released a tool for validating authorized purchases for use within apps but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial to crack google responded that the tool especially its initial release was intended as a sample framework for developers to modify and build upon depending on their needs not as a finished piracy solution351 android jelly bean introduced the ability for paid applications to be encrypted so that they may work only on the device for which they were purchased352353 legal issues further information oracle v google smartphone wars and patent troll both android and android phone manufacturers have been involved in numerous patent lawsuits on august 12 2010 oracle sued google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the java programming language354 oracle originally sought damages up to 61 billion355 but this valuation was rejected by a united states federal judge who asked oracle to revise the estimate356 in response google submitted multiple lines of defense counterclaiming that android did not infringe on oracles patents or copyright that oracles patents were invalid and several other defenses they said that androids java runtime environment is based on apache harmony a clean room implementation of the java class libraries and an independently developed virtual machine called dalvik357 in may 2012 the jury in this case found that google did not infringe on oracles patents and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the java apis used by google was not copyrightable358359 the parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code360 on may 9 2014 the federal circuit partially reversed the district court ruling ruling in oracles favor on the copyrightability issue and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court361362 in december 2015 google announced that the next major release of android android nougat would switch to openjdk which is the official opensource implementation of the java platform instead of using the nowdiscontinued apache harmony project as its runtime code reflecting this change was also posted to the aosp source repository176 in its announcement google claimed this was part of an effort to create a common code base between java on android and other platforms177 google later admitted in a court filing that this was part of an effort to address the disputes with oracle as its use of openjdk code is governed under the gnu general public license gpl with a linking exception and that any damages claim associated with the new versions expressly licensed by oracle under openjdk would require a separate analysis of damages from earlier releases176 in june 2016 a united states federal court ruled in favor of google stating that its use of the apis was fair use363 in addition to lawsuits against google directly various proxy wars have been waged against android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of android devices with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an android device to market364 both apple and microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement with apples ongoing legal action against samsung being a particularly highprofile case in january 2012 microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with eleven android device manufacturers whose products account for 70 percent of all android smartphones sold in the us365 and 55 of the worldwide revenue for android devices366 these include samsung and htc367 samsungs patent settlement with microsoft included an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running microsofts windows phone operating system364 microsoft has also tied its own android software to patent licenses requiring the bundling of microsoft office mobile and skype applications on android devices to subsidize the licensing fees while at the same time helping to promote its software lines368369 google has publicly expressed its frustration for the current patent landscape in the united states accusing apple oracle and microsoft of trying to take down android through patent litigation rather than innovating and competing with better products and services370 in august 2011 google purchased motorola mobility for us125 billion which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect android since motorola mobility held more than 17000 patents371372 in december 2011 google bought over a thousand patents from ibm373 in 2013 fairsearch a lobbying organization supported by microsoft oracle and others filed a complaint regarding android with the european commission alleging that its freeofcharge distribution model constituted anticompetitive predatory pricing the free software foundation europe whose donors include google disputed the fairsearch allegations374 on april 20 2016 the eu filed a formal antitrust complaint against google based upon the fairsearch allegations arguing that its leverage over android vendors including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary google software hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into android and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of android constituted anticompetitive practices375 in august 2016 google was fined us675 million by the russian federal antimonopoly service fas under similar allegations by yandex376 other uses ouya a video game console which runs android google has developed several variations of android for specific use cases including android wear for wearable devices such as wrist watches377378 android tv for televisions379380 android auto for cars381382 and brillo383 later renamed android things for smart devices and internet of things384385 the open and customizable nature of android allows device makers to use it on other electronics as well including laptops and netbooks386387 smartbooks388 cameras389 headphones390 home automation systems game consoles mirrors391 media players392 and landline telephones393 ouya a video game console running android became one of the most successful kickstarter campaigns crowdfunding us85m for its development394395 and was later followed by other androidbased consoles such as nvidias shield portable – an android device in a video game controller form factor396 in 2011 google demonstrated androidhome a home automation technology which uses android to control a range of household devices including light switches power sockets and thermostats397 prototype light bulbs were announced that could be controlled from an android phone or tablet but android head andy rubin was cautious to note that turning a lightbulb on and off is nothing new pointing to numerous failed home automation services google he said was thinking more ambitiously and the intention was to use their position as a cloud services provider to bring google products into customers homes398399 parrot unveiled an androidbased car stereo system known as asteroid in 2011400 followed by a successor the touchscreenbased asteroid smart in 2012401 in 2013 clarion released its own androidbased car stereo the ax1402 in january 2014 at the consumer electronics show ces google announced the formation of the open automotive alliance a group including several major automobile makers audi general motors hyundai and honda and nvidia which aims to produce androidbased in car entertainment systems for automobiles bringing the best of android into the automobile in a safe and seamless way403 android comes preinstalled on a few laptops a similar functionality of running android applications is also available in googles chrome os and can also be installed on personal computers by end users404 on those platforms android provides additional functionality for physical keyboards405 and mice together with the alttab key combination for switching applications quickly with a keyboard in december 2014 one reviewer commented that androids notification system is vastly more complete and robust than in most environments and that android is absolutely usable as ones primary desktop operating system406 in october 2015 the wall street journal reported that android will serve as googles future main laptop operating system with the plan to fold chrome os into it by 2017407408 googles sundar pichai who led the development of android explained that mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of as desktop today407 and back in 2009 google cofounder sergey brin himself said that chrome os and android would likely converge over time409 lockheimer who replaced pichai as head of android and chrome os responded to this claim with an official google blog post stating that while weve been working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems theres no plan to phase out chrome os which has guaranteed autoupdates for five years410 that is unlike android where support is shorter with eol dates being at least 3 years into the future for android tablets for education411 see also
