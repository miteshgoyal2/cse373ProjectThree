republican convention and an unsuccessful candidate for district attorney in 18561 in 1857 he moved to dubuque iowa which would serve as his hometown for the last fifty years of his life civil waredit

abraham lincoln for president of the united states during the subsequent civil war he was on the staff of iowa governor samuel j kirkwood who ordered him to help the state raise regiments for the war he personally helped raise four regiments he was given the rank of lieutenant colonel during the war although it was unlikely he actually served in uniform in 1862 in the midst of the war allison was elected to the united states house of representatives as the representative of iowas newly created 3rd congressional district3 as a congressman and member of the house ways and means committee1 he pushed for higher tariffs postwar political careeredit portrait of senator allison which hangs in the us capitol following the war allison continued to serve in the house after winning reelection in 1866 and 1868 in january 1870 he was an unsuccessful candidate for election by the iowa general assembly to the united states senate seat for 1871–1877 losing to iowa supreme court justice george g wright4 allison declined to be a candidate for renomination to his own house seat later that year but instead focused on laying the groundwork to run for iowas other senate seat then held by james harlan which was up in january 1872 following november 1871 state legislative races5 in the 1871 state legislative races candidates were nominated and elected on the direct issue of whether they would vote for harlan allison or james f wilson for senator6 enough legislators who favored allison were nominated and elected in 1871 that in january 1872 he won the required number of votes to take harlans us senate seat effective march 4 187356 allison was reelected to sixyear terms in the us senate six times — in 1878 1884 1890 1896 and 1902 allison chaired the 1884–1886 allison commission a bipartisan joint congressional committee among the first to explore the question of whether federal intervention politicizes scientific research7 it considered the charge that parts of the government were engaged in research for theoretical not practical purposes the majority report favored the status quo and congress upheld it7 in 1885 the commissions finding of misuse of funds at the us coast and geodetic survey led to the dismissal of several officials but exonerated charles sanders peirce as allison earned seniority he also earned one of the most powerful committee positions from 1881–93 and again from 1895 to 1908 he was chairman of the senate appropriations committee where he had great influence allisons combined years as chairman of the committee make him the longestserving chairman to date he was also a member of the senate committee of indian affairs and its chairman from 1875 to 18811 the senate finance committee and the committee on engrossed bills he became chairman of the senate republican conference in 1897 he was twice asked to serve as the secretary of the treasury first by president chester arthur to which allison agreed but then the next day declined8 then by president benjamin harrison in 1897 president william mckinley offered him the position of us secretary of state1 again allison declined9 it was just as well no republican senator was so well fitted for the duties of responsible statesmanship or positioned so well for thirty years he sat on the senate finance committee and took a critical role in framing legislation in 1881 he became chairman of the appropriations committee and continued to serve there until his death in 1908 after 1897 he was chosen as chairman of the republican caucus an unofficial position but one generally accorded to the most venerable and respected party member in the senate eminently conservative trusted by the railroad interests allisons pragmatism made him the centrist that everybody could deal with even the democrats when in 1888 a republican alternative was needed to the mills tariff bill coming out of the house allison handled the details the bill that emerged from committee was purely for campaign purposes nobody thought that it could pass but it put the best face on protectionist principles and later served as a model for the 1890 mckinley tariff which allison played a large part in framing in 1897 when the dingley tariff bill reached the senate allison did most of the work reconciling discontented interests when the bland bill allowing the free coinage of silver came to the senate allison altered it the resulting blandallison act of 1878 simply had the government buy a certain more limited amount of silver which the treasury was permitted to put into circulation as silver dollars it was far less inflationary than blands original bill the act passed over the veto of president rutherford b hayes it remained unchanged until the sherman silver purchase act of 1890 in 1892 allison chaired the brussels monetary conference and in 1900 was one of the fathers of the gold standard act in 1896 he became a darkhorse candidate for the presidency10 however support for his candidacy faded when it became clear that mckinley would be nominated on the first ballot11 allison is the man of experience an admiring reporter wrote in 1906 the sage old pilot of the senate they say that no man who has ever been in the senate knew so much about it as he does he is the political forecaster the compromiser the weather prophet the man who brings irreconcilable things together it is said that the oldest inhabitant cannot recall having heard allison give utterance to an opinion on any subject whatever doubtless he does give utterance to them but never except in the inner councils of the caesars sagacious to the point of craft it does not annoy him to know that the epithet most frequently applied to him is the old foxwhen he rises in his place in the senate he disdains to talk as if he were making a speech he leaves all that to the youngsters whose sum of knowledge does not equal all that he has forgotten he never rises except to shed light on some knotty point and when he does it is always as briefly as possible and in a conversational voice that is almost an undertone then he drops back into his seat and with sublime indifference lets the talk go on12 allison was married twice the first marriage was to anna carter who died in 1859 four years after the marriage his second marriage was to mary neally who died in 1883 ten years after their marriage although allison was a rich man he did not spend much time thinking about moneymaking rather he was very focused on public and political affairs the 1908 senate raceedit main article united states senate election in iowa 1908 in 1908 as allison neared his 44th year in congress and his 80th birthday he sought a record seventh term in the senate13 however iowas republican governor at the time albert b cummins had aspired to become a us senator for several years and as leader of republican progressives had targeted his partys old guard for retirement or if necessary defeat after seeming to promise that he would not challenge allison in 1908 cummins ran against allison for the republican nomination in the states firstever congressional primary on june 2 1908 much like allisons 1873 race for the senate against incumbent harlan5 cummins 1908 race for the senate against incumbent allison was very acrimonious6 however this time the incumbent prevailed allison won a clear victory over cummins by over ten thousand votes14 as a reflection of the nature of its preference for allison over cummins the ames times reported the primary results under a twolevel banner headline simply stating glory to god15 death and his legacyedit sen william boyd allison monument des moines iowa 1916 allison did not live to see the 1908 general election or a seventh term two months after his primary win he died in dubuque16 while many were surprised by his death news reports soon indicated that he had been under constant medical care for more than two years and that those familiar with his condition had expected his death1 he was interred in linwood cemetery in dubuque governor cummins was elected by the legislature to fill the unexpired term of senator allison and for the term beginning march 4 1909 and was reelected in 1914 and 1920 but in 1926 he lost in the republican primary to smith w brookhart senator cummins died shortly after his loss in the june 1926 primary
