guilds members elected roxana robinson as president and judy blume richard russo and james shapiro as vice presidents freelancers suitedit in june 2014 the guild announced final approval of an 18 million settlement of a classaction suit it brought in 2000 along with the american society of journalists and authors the national writers union and 21 freelance writers the suit claimed that major electronics databases such as lexisnexis had violated the rights of thousands of freelancers their work had originally appeared in newspapers and magazines including the new york times and time magazine and had then been resold to the databases without the writers permission5 the publishers had argued that the databases constituted a fair revision of the original print articles but the united states supreme court ruled in june 2001 that the writers must be compensated for their digital rights6 further litigation and negotiation led to a settlement that will provide payments to the freelancers of up to 1500 per article7 conflict with googleedit main article authors guild v google on september 20 2005 the authors guild together with herbert mitgang betty miles and daniel hoffman filed a class action lawsuit against google for its book search project8 according to the authors guild google was committing copyright infringement by making digital copies of books that were still in copyright google countered that their use was fair according to us copyright law on october 28 2008 the authors guild the association of american publishers and google announced that they had settled authors guild v google google agreed to a 125 million payout 45 million of that to be paid to rightsholders whose books were scanned without permission the google book search settlement agreement allowed for legal protection for googles scanning project even though neither side changed its position about whether scanning books was fair use or copyright infringement the settlement also would have established a new regulatory organization the book rights registry which would be responsible for allocating fees from google to rightsholders the settlement between the authors guild and google was rejected in 2011 by a judge at the district court level who thought the settlement was not in the authors best interest9 in october 2015 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit sided with google citing fair use and that the scanned and posted excerpts works does not harm the authors by having parts of the books online10 in late december 2015 the authors guild filed a writ of certiorari with the supreme court against google in their longstanding battle over whether copyright laws allows for the search engine to scan and post excerpts from books for the google books service11 which in april 2016 declined to review the case leaving the lower courts decision standing12 referencesedit authors guild retrieved 20120112  doreen carvajal 19980427 authors
