world trade organization ministerial conference of 1999 from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search location of seattle the wto ministerial conference of 1999 was a meeting of the world trade organization convened at the washington state convention and trade center in seattle washington usa over the course of three days beginning tuesday november 30 1999 a week before the meeting delegates admitted failure to agree on the agenda and the presence of deep disagreements with developing countries1 intended as the launch of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations that would have been called the millennium round the negotiations were marred by poor organization and controversial management of large street protests2 developing country representatives became resentful and uncooperative on being excluded from talks as the united states and the european union attempted to cement a mutual deal on agriculture the negotiations collapsed and were reconvened at doha qatar in november 2001 the doha venue enabled onsite public protest to be excluded necessary agenda concessions were made to include the interests of developing countries which had by then further established their own negotiation blocs such as the nonaligned movement and the shanghai cooperation organisation thus the current round is called the doha development round which has since 2008 remained stalled as a result of diverging perspectives regarding tariffs agriculture and nontariff barriers such as agricultural subsidies antiglobalization activists made headlines around the world in 1999 when they forced the seattle wto ministerial conference of 1999 to end early with direct action tactics contents 1 1st december3 11 agricultural working group 12 working group on implementation and rules 13 working group on market access 14 other issues 2 2nd december4 21 agricultural working group 22 working group on market access 23 working group on trade and labour standards 24 working group on systemic issues 3 3rd december5 4 cultural references 5 see also 6 notes 7 external links 71 archives 1st december3edit agricultural working groupedit the agricultural working group primarily focused on improving the text of the draft ministerial declaration which they intended to utilise as a starting point for further negotiations regarding agricultural trades and tariffs the text dealt with the objectives of the negotiations — whether agricultural products should ultimately be treated the same as industrial products provisions for developing countries to be discussed on 2 december reductions in subsidies and protection multifunctionality how to deal with nontrade objectives such as environmental protection food security etc and other issues a proposed timetable for the negotiations working group on implementation and rulesedit ministers from developing countries demanded that imperialist economies such as the us and the eu stop controversial agricultural subsidies which hindered globalisation japan said abusive use of antidumping measures should be regarded as a disguised form of protectionism that nullifies tariff reductions overnight it said that improvement of the ad agreement is a lynchpin of the new round and that many developing countries support this jamaica said that the 71 acp countries have been marginalised regarding certain issues of the world trade organisation it called for turning sd into hard commitments the extension of transition periods for trims and customs valuation and increase in funding and human resources for technical cooperation it asked that the waiver for preferential trade treatment given to acp countries must be extended to give time for them to be integrated into the global economy iceland proposed negotiations to remove subsidies on fisheries it was supported by a number of delegations including the us peru indonesia norway chile and ecuador working group on market accessedit disagreements regarding market access centred primarily around coverage and scope of the negotiations — whether they should cover all nonagricultural products or whether some could be excluded agricultural products are negotiated under agriculture overall objective of the negotiations the current text does not say how much tariffs should be reduced nontariff measures affecting access to markets antidumping measures customs valuation import licensing rules of origin safeguard measures subsidies etc differences of opinion exist on many of these issues how the negotiations should be organised how to address developing countries’ concerns — one proposal is for exports from least developed countries to be given bound zero tariffs in richer countries other issuesedit the two other issues considered on the 1st december were investment and competition policy ministers contemplated whether or not they could agree to start negotiations on investment andor competition as part of the round of negotiations that will incorporate agriculture services and other topics if not could they agree to develop elements that might eventually be incorporated in agreements on investment and competition and return to the question of whether or not to undertake negotiations at the fourth ministerial session 2nd december4edit agricultural working groupedit a new draft was proposed by the singaporean delegation emphasising the integration of agriculture into mainstream world trade organisation policies the reduction of socalled export subsidies developing country issues ending the meeting the chairman said he was walking a tightrope he was being pulled equally in both directions he said the danger was that if he moved one way or another he would fall off the rope but he observed that the text was only for launching new negotiations the new round is where the real battle will begin he said if the round is concluded it will boost global welfare by tens of billions of dollars he concluded working group on market accessedit questions raised in the consultations held by the chairman focused on the methodology of tariffcutting negotiations a number of delegations are proposing a common approach unlike in the uruguay round where members cut tariffs on a requestoffer basis this would be a harmonised approach that would facilitate comparisons of tariff reduction proposals another position is using the combination of requestoffer and harmonisation in the negotiations certain major traders are calling a reference in the text to an effective increase in market access the accelerated tariff liberalisation initiative for certain product sectors was also raised working group on trade and labour standardsedit this working group was set up to help create a labour standards working group within the wto or a body operated jointly by a number of international organisations to look at the issues opinions differed with a number of developing countries opposing the creation of either type of body working group on systemic issuesedit elements raised by member governments in this discussion concerned the derestriction of documents improving the wtos organisational structure to improve transparency and decisionmaking improving information flows and enhancing public understanding of and participation in the workings of the organisation 3rd december5edit informal meetings continued through the night of december 2 and into december 3 the main discussions were in meetings in which some 20–40 ministers took part the people attending these meetings varied according to subject and the chairpeople did their utmost to ensure that participants represented a crosssection of the members’ positions on the relevant subjects progress was reported in a number of areas but by late afternoon it was clear that there was too little time left to complete the work of narrowing the gaps bringing the draft declaration back to the plenary working groups making any additional changes arising from the working groups and then approving the declaration by consensus the conference had simply run out of time cultural referencesedit actordirector stuart townsend released a film about the protests surrounding the conference in 2007 entitled battle in seattle the seattlebased hiphop duo blue scholars released the song 50 thousand

commissioner said yesterday there was a serious risk that the meeting would be unable to launch a world trade round however mike moore wto directorgeneral said he was still confident that next weeks
