and give it a different name as opposed to their stated intent to repeal and replace99 business boehner joined the board of tobacco company reynolds american on september 15 2016100 legacy in reporting his pending retirement politico summarized his speakership boehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave but it was that movement that gave him constant problems he clashed with social conservatives over the debt limit government funding obamacare and taxes but his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with president barack obama he and obama tried — but repeatedly failed — to cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement but boehner has had some significant victories including the trade deal that congress passed this year and changes to entitlement programs101 paul kane in the washington post emphasizes how none of the big deals he sought were ever reached boehner never landed the really big deal he craved not the 4 trillion taxandentitlement deal he reached for in 2011 not the repackaged version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014102 furthermore kane argues boehners persona alienated conservative republicans who demanded more vigorous attacks on obama and instead perceived a country club republican who loved to play 18 holes of golf and drink merlot afterward while cutting deals in an era of shouting and confrontation on talk radio or cable tv boehner’s easygoing style did not fit103 personal life boehner and his wife debbie were married in 1973 and live in the wetherington section of west chester township they have two daughters lindsay and tricia104 in february 2014 boehner and his wife bought a 835000 condo in marco island florida105 notes the german pronunciation of
