lava lamp from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search an original mathmos astro lava lamp a lava lamp or astro lamp is a decorative novelty item invented in 1963 by british accountant edward craven walker the founder of the british lighting company mathmos the lamp consists of a bolus of a special coloured wax mixture inside a glass vessel the remainder of which contains clear or translucent liquid the vessel is then placed on a box containing an incandescent light bulb whose heat causes temporary reductions in the density and viscosity of the wax the warmed wax rises through the surrounding liquid cools loses its buoyancy and falls back to the bottom of the vessel in a cycle that is visually suggestive of pāhoehoe lava hence the name the lamps are designed in a variety of styles and colours contents 1 operation 2 history 3 hazards 4 see also 5 notes 6 external links operationedit a blue lava lamp a classic lava lamp contains a standard incandescent or halogen lamp which heats a tall often tapered glass bottle a formula from 1968 us patent consisted of water and a transparent translucent or opaque mix of mineral oil paraffin wax and carbon tetrachloride1p 2 line 30 the clear water or mineral oil can optionally be coloured with transparent dyes common wax has a density much lower than that of water and would float on top under any temperature however carbon tetrachloride is heavier than water also nonflammable and miscible with wax and is added to the wax to make its density at room temperature slightly higher than that of the water when heated the wax mixture becomes less dense than the water because the wax expands more than water when both are heated1p 1 lines 40 45 it also becomes fluid and blobs of wax ascend to the top of the device where they cool which increases their density relative to that of the water and then they descend1p 1 line 47 a metallic wire coil in the base of the bottle acts as a surface tension breaker to recombine the cooled blobs of wax after they descend play media video of an orange lava lamp in operation however lava lamps made in china for the us market since 1970 do not use carbon tetrachloride because its use was banned that year due to toxicity2 the manufacturer haggerty stated that their current formulation is a trade secret3 the underlying fluid mechanics phenomenon is a form of rayleigh–taylor instability the bulb is normally 25 to 40 watts generally it will take 45–60 minutes for the wax to warm up enough to form freely rising blobs when operating the lamp at standard room temperature it may take as long as 2 to 3 hours if the room is below standard room temperature once the wax is molten the lamp should not be shaken or knocked over or the two fluids may emulsify and the fluid surrounding the wax blobs will remain cloudy rather than clear some recombination will occur as part of the normal cycle of the wax in the container but the only means to recombine all of the wax is to turn off the lamp and wait a few hours the wax will settle back down at the bottom forming one blob once again severe cases can require many heatcool cycles to clear in 2015 a new design was introduced into the market that uses ferrofluid in place of wax4 historyedit former lava lamp factory at 1650 irving park road chicago british accountant edward cravenwalker invented the lava lamp in 1963 after watching a homemade egg timer which was made from a cocktail shaker filled with liquids as it was bubbling on a stove top in a pub5 his us patent 3387396 for display device was filed in 1965 and issued in 19681 cravenwalkers company was named crestworth and was based in poole dorset in the united kingdom cravenwalker named the lamp astro and had variations such as the astro mini and the astro coach lantern in 1965 two men named adolph wertheimer and hy spector were intrigued by walker’s invention when they saw it at a german trade show they bought the american rights and began the lava manufacturing corporation in chicago il to sell what they called the lava lite lamp in the late 1970s the us rights were sold to larry haggerty who created a subsidiary of his company haggerty enterprises called lava world international which produced american lava lamps for over 30 years6 cravenwalker retained the rights for the rest of the world and took on two business partners in the late 1980s named cressida granger and david mulley eventually granger and mulley took over the company and they changed the name to mathmos in 1992 edward cravenwalker remained a consultant until his death in 2000 mathmos continues to make lava lamps and related products mathmos won two queens awards for export as well as best multimedia prize at the design week awards7 astro lava lamp was launched in 1963 and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 20138 mathmos lava lamps are still made in the original factory in poole dorset in 2008 american lava lamp maker lava world international was acquired by talon merchant capital and the name was again changed to lava lite llc as of 2016 lava lamps are sold under lifespan brands in north america9 hazardsedit in 2004 24yearold philip quinn from kent washington was killed by a lava lamp on a kitchen stove heat from the stove built up pressure in the lamp until it exploded and a shard of glass pierced his heart causing fatal injuries quinn was found dead in his home10 the circumstances of his death were later reenacted in a 2006 episode of the popular science tv series mythbusters the show found that even if shards of glass are not thrown with lethal velocity during such an attempt the resulting spray of hot liquid from the lamp could easily cause severe burns to anyone nearby the show noted that the safety instructions clearly state that lava lamps should not be heated by any source other than the specifically rated bulbs and purposedesigned bases that are provided11 see alsoedit lava lavarand a
