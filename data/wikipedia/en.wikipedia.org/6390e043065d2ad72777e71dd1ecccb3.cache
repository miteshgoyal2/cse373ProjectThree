government in matters relating to enforcement of antitrust laws particularly in proceedings against the tobacco trust see united states v american tobacco co 221 us 106 191189 and the combination of the anthracite coal railroads10 the case which brought him to the attention of president wilson was the governments case against the american tobacco company in which mcreynolds presented the governments case while the company was represented by clarence darrow and 17 other attorneys11 on march 15 1913 following the successful conclusion of this case with attorney general wickershams recommendation wilson appointed mcreynolds as the 48th united states attorney general where he remained until august 29 1914 during his time in private practice mcreynolds earned a reputation as an ardent trust buster1012 and continued working against trusts during his time as the us attorney general101213 in spite of his views on corporate monopolies mcreynolds was also very supportive of laissezfaire economic policies14 and wilson found him difficult to work with2131516 supreme courtedit on august 19 1914 wilson appointed him to the supreme court to a seat vacated by the sudden death of horace h lurton mcreynolds was confirmed by the united states senate and received his commission the same day starting with the new term on october 12 1914 when the supreme court building opened in 1935 mcreynolds like most of the other justices refused to move his office into the new building he continued to work out of the office he maintained in his apartmentcitation needed his reason was that with the country in the turmoil of the great depression it was unconscionable to have spent so much money on a single building17 important opinionsedit in his 27 years on the bench he authored 506 decisions an average of just under 19 opinions for each term of the court during his tenure in addition he authored 157 dissents 93 of which were against the new deal1819 his fierce opposition in the face of franklin roosevelts new deal legislation to fight the great depression led to his being labeled one of the four horsemen along with george sutherland willis van devanter and pierce butler15 mcreynolds voted to strike down the tennessee valley authority in ashwander v tva the national industrial recovery act in schechter poultry corporation v united states the agricultural adjustment act of 1933 in united states v butler the bituminous coal conservation act of 1935 in carter v carter coal co and the social security act 42 usca § 301 et seq in steward machine co v davis 301 us 548 57 s ct 883 81 l ed 1279 19372 he continued to vote against new deal measures after the courts 1937 switch to upholding new deal legislation howard ball called mcreynolds the most strident court critic of roosevelts new deal programs20 as a confirmed opponent of federal authority aimed toward social ends or economic regulation he had the singleminded passion of a zealot2 mcreynolds was a firm believer in laissezfaire economic theory which he said was constitutionally enshrined2 see lochner v new york after the lochner era ended in 1937—the courts switch in time that saved nine—mcreynolds became a dissenter16 unrepentant after the courts about face through his 1941 retirement his dissents decried the federal governments exercises of power in steward machine co v davis 301 us 548 19371 he dissented from a decision of the court upholding the social security act he wrote i can not find any authority in the constitution for making the federal government the great almoner of public charity throughout the united states p 6032 mcreynoldss supreme court nomination supreme courts official portrait of james clark mcreynolds ca 1941 justice mcreynolds wrote two early decisions using the fourteenth amendment to protect civil liberties meyer v nebraska 262 us 390 1923 and pierce v society of sisters 268 us 510 1925 meyer involved a state law that prohibited the teaching of modern foreign languages in public schools meyer who taught german in a lutheran school was convicted under this law mcreynolds wrote that the liberty guaranteed by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment included an individuals right to contract to engage in any of the common occupations of life to acquire useful knowledge to marry to establish a home and bring up children to worship god according to the dictates of his conscience and generally to enjoy privileges essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men these two decisions survived the postlochner era16 pierce involved a challenge to a law forbidding parents to send their children to any but public schools justice mcreynolds wrote the opinion for a unanimous court holding that the act violated the liberty of parents to direct the education of their children mcreynolds wrote that the fundamental liberty upon which all governments in this union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only these decisions were revived long after mcreynolds departed from the bench to buttress the courts announcement of a constitutional right to privacy in griswold v connecticut 381 us 479 1965 and later the constitutional right to abortion in roe v wade 410 us 113 1973 mcreynolds authored the decision in united states v miller 307 us 174 1939 which was the only supreme court case that directly involved the second amendment until district of columbia v heller in 200819 text of united states v miller 307 us 174 1939 is available from  findlaw  justia  in the field of tax law mcreynolds wrote for the court in burnet v logan 283 us 404 1931 a significant decision setting out the courts doctrine regarding open transactions mcreynolds also wrote the dissent in the gold clause cases which required the surrender of all gold coins gold bullion and gold certificates to the government by may 1 1933 under executive order 6102 issued by president franklin roosevelt personality and conflictsedit mcreynolds was labeled scrooge by journalist drew pearsonc chief justice william howard taft thought him selfish prejudiced and someone who seems to delight in making others uncomfortable … he has a continual grouch and is always offended because the court is doing something that he regards as undignified2122 taft also wrote that mcreynolds was the most irresponsible member of the court and that in the absence of mcreynolds everything went smoothly23 early on his temperament affected his performance in the court15 for example he deemed john clarke another wilson appointee to the court to be too liberal and refused to speak with him15 clarke made an early decision to leave the court and mcreynoldss antipathy was a factor given by clarke24 however another possible reason was his hope of an appointment by president wilson as his representative to the nascent league of nations and writing to the president that he felt it was his duty to devote what might remain to me of life and health and strength to doing what i could to cultivate public opinion in our country to having our government take some share in the effort which many other nations are making to devise some rational substitute for irrational war17 indeed mcreynolds refused to sign the customary joint memorial letter given to departing members25 in a letter taft commented that this is a fair sample of mcreynoldss personal character and the difficulty of getting along with him26 justice mcreynolds february 3 1940 taft wrote that although he considered mcreynolds an able man he found him to be selfish to the last degree fuller of prejudice than any man i have ever known … one who delights in making others uncomfortable he has no sense of duty … really seems to have less of a loyal spirit to the court than anybody27 in 1929 mcreynolds asked taft to announce opinions assigned to him mcreynolds explaining that an imperious voice has called me out of town i dont think my sudden illness will prove fatal but strange things some time sic happen around thanksgiving28 duck hunting season had opened and mcreynolds was off to maryland for some shooting in 1925 he left so suddenly on a similar errand that he had no opportunity to notify the chief justice of his departure taft was infuriated as two important decisions he wanted to deliver were delayed because mcreynolds had not handed in a dissent before leaving29 he would go into tirades about unamericans and political subversives2 a blatant bigot15d31 mcreynolds would not accept jews drinkers blacks women smokers married or engaged individuals as law clerks32 time called him puritanical intolerably rude savagely sarcastic incredibly reactionary and antisemitic333435 mcreynolds refused to speak to louis brandeis the first jewish member of the court for three years following brandeiss appointment and when brandeis retired in 1939 did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to justices on their retirement3436 he habitually left the conference room whenever brandeis spoke34 when benjamin cardozos appointment was being pressed on president herbert c hoover mcreynolds joined with fellow justices pierce butler and willis van devanter in urging the white house not to afflict the court with another jew37 when news of cardozos appointment was announced mcreynolds is claimed to have said huh it seems that the only way you can get on the supreme court these days is to be either the son of a criminal or a jew or both3839 during cardozos swearingin ceremony mcreynolds pointedly read a newspaper38 and would often hold a brief or record in front of his face when cardozo delivered an opinion from the bench40 likewise he refused to sign opinions authored by brandeis13 according to john frush knox 1907–1997 mcreynoldss law clerk for one term 1936–1937 following the sevenyear clerkship of maurice mahoney and one author of a memoir of his service mcreynolds never spoke to cardozo at all32 mcreynolds even absented himself from the memorial ceremonies held at the supreme court in honor of cardozo394142 he did not attend felix frankfurters swearingin exclaiming my god another jew on the court43 in 1922 taft proposed that members of the court accompany him to philadelphia on a ceremonial occasion but mcreynolds refused to go writing as you know i am not always to be found when there is a hebrew abroad therefore my inability to attend must not surprise you44 mcreynolds refused to sit next to brandeis where he belonged on the basis of seniority for the court photograph in 1924 the difficulty is with me and me alone mcreynolds wrote taft i have absolutely refused to go through the bore of picturetaking again until there is a change in the court and maybe not even then45 taft capitulated and no photograph was taken that year1646 once when another colleague harlan fiske stone remarked to him of an attorneys brief that was the dullest argument i ever heard in my life mcreynolds replied the only duller thing i can think of is to hear you read one of your opinions33 mcreynoldss rudeness was not confined to colleagues on the court once when called before the chairman of the golf committee at the chevy chase club after complaints were filed against him mcreynolds said ive been a member of this club a good many years and no one around here has ever shown me any courtesy so i dont intend to show any to anyone else the indignant chairman replied mr justice you wouldnt be a member of this club if it wasnt for your official position the members of this club have put up with your discourtesy for years merely because you are a member of the supreme court but im telling you now that the next time there is a complaint against you youll be suspended from the privileges of the golf course47 justices pierce butler and willis van devanter transferred from the chevy chase club to burning tree because mcreynolds got disagreeable even beyond their endurance48 when a female lawyer appeared in the courtroom mcreynolds would reportedly mutter i see the female is here again he would often leave the bench when a woman lawyer rose to present a case34 he thought the wearing of wrist watches by men to be effeminate and the use of red fingernail polish by women to be vulgar33 he forbade smoking in his presence he is said to have been responsible for the no smoking signs in the supreme court building inaugurated during his tenure49 he would announce to any justice who attempted to smoke in conference that tobacco smoke is personally objectionable to me any who tried were stopped at the threshold50 mcreynoldss longsuffering domestic help – black and subject to the justices views on race relations – gave him a nickname they called him pussywillow51 however he was reportedly extremely charitable to the pages who worked at the court50 and had a great love of children2 for example he gave very generous assistance and adopted thirtythree children who were victims of the german bombing of london in 1940 and left a sizable fortune to charity3334 when oliver wendell holmess wife died mcreynolds broke down and wept at her funeral47 holmes wrote in 1926 poor mcreynolds is i think a man of feeling and of more secret kindliness than he would get credit for33 he would often entertain at his apartment and even passed cigarettes to his guests on occasion50 he often invited people for brunch on sunday mornings according to william o douglas on these informal occasions in his own home he was the essence of hospitality and a very delightful companion52 once when riding to his office on a street car a drunk got on board and fell out in the aisle mcreynolds picked him up helped him back to his seat and sat beside him until they reached the top of capitol hill leaving him only after giving explicit instructions to the conductor53 and when due to absence of more senior justices it fell on him to preside in court he was the soul of courtesy graciously greeting and raptly listening to the arguments by lawyers of both sexes34 the public justice mcreynolds was noted for his hospitality he entertained frequently at the willard hotel with guest lists of 150 people including his fellow justices and at an annual eggnog party which was one of the social highlights of the christmas season alice roosevelt one of many friends requested the services of his cook mrs parker for her wedding breakfast to nicholas longworth54 retirement and deathedit after a substantial hearing loss in 1925 he strongly intended to resign from the court and was only dissuaded by requests from many friends to continue pronouncing him one of the few who have courageously stood for the rights of property and of the citizen55 he assumed senior status on january 31 1941 effectively resigning from the court he lived at the rochambeau apartment complex in washington dc from 1915 until roosevelt requisitioned the beaux arts building in 1935 for his new deal requirements mcreynolds found a new apartment at 2400 sixteenth street where he lived until his death on august 24 1946 mcreynolds never married216 which places him in the company of four other justices in the courts historye legacyedit mcreynolds was buried in the elkton cemetery in elkton kentucky56 elkton residents fondly remember justice mcreynolds pointing out both his home and office with great pride and respect57 knox wrote in 1946 he mcreynolds died a very lonely death in a hospital – without a single friend or relative at his bedside he was buried in kentucky but no member of the court attended his funeral though one employee of the court traveled to kentucky for the services in contrast as the clerk noted when mcreynoldss aged africanamerican messenger harry parker died in 1953 his funeral was attended by five or six justices including the chief justice mcreynolds brother robert had visited him in the hospital shortly before his death in his will mcreynolds requested let there be no service in washington however the us marshal for the supreme court traveled to elkton for the funeral the christian science monitor hailed mcreynolds in tribute as the last and lone champion on the supreme bench battling the steady encroachment of federal powers on state and individual rights standing these later years at the pass of thermopylae58 mcreynolds bequeathed his entire estate to charity23334 among these bequests were additional funds to childrens hospital in washington which he had supported for years adding a new elevator 10000 and the residue of his estate his books and opinions were left to the library of congress and 10000 and his judicial robe to vanderbilt university where he had served for 30 years on the board of trust59 papersedit mcreynolds papers are held at many libraries around the country namely mainly at the university of
