paley made wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company67 the renamed company made columbia its flagship label and okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing arcs other labels this allowed arcs leased labels brunswick records and vocalion records to revert to their former owner warner bros which sold them to decca records columbia kept the brunswick catalogue recorded from december 1931
