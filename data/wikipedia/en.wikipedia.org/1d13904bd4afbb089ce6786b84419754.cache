or region2 the term homeless may also include people whose primary nighttime residence is in a homeless shelter a domestic violence shelter longterm residence in a motel a vehicle squatting cardboard boxes a tent city tarpaulins shanty town structures made of discarded building materials or other ad hoc housing situations according to the uk homelessness charity crisis a home is not just a physical space it also provides roots identity security a sense of belonging and a place of emotional wellbeing3 american government homeless enumeration studies45 also include people who sleep in a public or private place not designed for use as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings67 there are a number of organizations who provide help for the homeless in 2005 an estimated 100 million 1 in 65 at the time people worldwide were homeless and as many as 1 billion people live as squatters refugees or in temporary shelter all lacking adequate housing8910 in western countries the large majority of homeless are men 75–80 with single males particularly overrepresented111213 most countries provide a variety of services to assist homeless people these services often provide food shelter beds and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations often with the help of volunteers or by government departments or agencies these programs may be supported by the government charities churches and individual donors many cities also have street newspapers which are publications designed to provide employment opportunity to homeless people while some homeless have jobs some must seek other methods to make a living begging or panhandling is one option but is becoming increasingly illegal in many cities people who are homeless may have additional conditions such as physical or mental health issues or substance addiction these issues make resolving homelessness a challenging policy issue homeless people and homeless organizations are sometimes accused or convicted of fraudulent behaviour criminals are also known to exploit homeless people ranging from identity theft to tax and welfare scams141516 these incidents often leads to negative connotations on

2004 the united nations department of economic and social affairs defined a homeless household as those households without a shelter that would fall within the scope of living quarters they carry their few possessions with them sleeping in the streets in doorways or on piers or in another space on a more or less random basis19 in 2009 at the united nations economic commission for europe conference of european statisticians ces held in geneva switzerland the group of experts on population and housing censuses defined homelessness as20 in its recommendations for the censuses of population and housing the ces identifies homeless people under two broad groups a primary homelessness or rooflessness this category includes persons living in the streets without a shelter that would fall within the scope of living quarters b secondary homelessness this category may include persons with no place of usual residence who move frequently between various types of accommodations including dwellings shelters and institutions for the homeless or other living quarters this category includes persons living in private dwellings but reporting no usual address on their census form the ces acknowledges that the above approach does not provide a full definition of the homeless article 25 of the universal declaration of human rights adopted 10 december 1948 by the un general assembly contains this text regarding housing and quality of living everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and of his family including food clothing housing and medical care and necessary social services and the right to security in the event of unemployment sickness disability widowhood old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control21 european typologyedit homelessness is perceived and addressed differently according to country the european typology of homelessness and housing exclusion ethos22 was developed as a means of improving understanding and measurement of homelessness in europe and to provide a common language for transnational exchanges on homelessness the ethos approach confirms that homelessness is a process rather than a static phenomenon that affects many vulnerable households at different points in their lives the typology was launched in 2005 and is used for different purposes as a framework for debate23 for data collection purposes for policy purposes monitoring purposes and in the media this typology is an open exercise which makes abstraction of existing legal definitions in the eu member states it exists in 25 language versions the translations being provided mainly by volunteer translators other termsedit the terms unsheltered and unhoused refer to that segment of a homeless community who do not have ordinary lawful access to buildings in which to sleep the latter term is defined by the united states department of housing and urban development hud as describing persons occupying place not designed for sleeping accommodation for human beings such persons frequently prefer the term houseless to the term homeless recent homeless enumeration survey documentation utilizes the term unsheltered homeless the common colloquial term street people does not fully encompass all unsheltered people in that many such persons do not spend their time in urban street environments many shun such locales because homeless people in urban environments may face the risk of being robbed or beaten up some people convert unoccupied or abandoned buildings squatting or inhabit mountainous areas or more often lowland meadows creek banks and beaches24 many jurisdictions have developed programs to provide shortterm emergency shelter during particularly cold spells often in churches or other institutional properties these are referred to as warming centers and are credited by their advocates as lifesaving25 hud requires jurisdictions which participate in continuum of care grant programs to count their homeless every two years these counts have led to a variety of creative measures to avoid undercounting thus teams of counters often numbering in the hundreds in logistically complex volunteer efforts seek out the unsheltered in various nooks and crannies26 these counts include people sleeping in official shelters and people sleeping in parks alleys and other outdoor locations a portion of the homeless population are generally in transit but there is no generally accepted terminology to describe them some nomenclature is frequently associated with derogatory connotations and thus the professional and vernacular lingo to describe these persons is both evolving and not lacking in controversy much of the concern stems from the european situation where homeless persons of roma sinti and other ethnic descent have rejected the term gypsy which they view as a racial slur other terms which some use regarding intransit persons are transient vagabond tramp or drifter occasionally these terms are interchanged with terms not necessarily implying that the person is a traveler eg hobo the pejorative term bum is used for persons who are alleged to be lacking a work ethic the term transient is frequently used in police reports without any precise definitions across jurisdictions historyedit this section possibly contains

in the 1800s german illustration of a homeless mother and her children in the street before 1883 a homeless man lives in a sewer vienna austria c 1900 homeless memorial in toronto following the peasants revolt english constables were authorised under 1383 english poor laws statute to collar vagabonds and force them to show support if they could not the penalty was gaol27 vagabonds could be sentenced to the stocks for three days and nights in 1530 whipping was added the presumption was that vagabonds were unlicensed beggars27 in 1547 a bill was passed that subjected vagrants to some of the more extreme provisions of the criminal law namely two years servitude and branding with a v as the penalty for the first offense and death for the second large numbers of vagabonds were among the convicts transported to the american colonies in the 18th century28 during the 16th century in england the state first tried to give housing to vagrants instead of punishing them by introducing bridewells to take vagrants and train them for a profession in the 17th and 18th centuries these were replaced by workhouses but these were intended to discourage too much reliance on state help the growing movement toward social concern sparked the development of rescue missions such as americas first rescue mission the new york city rescue mission founded in 1872 by jerry and maria mcauley2930 in smaller towns there were hobos who temporarily lived near train tracks and hopped onto trains to various destinations especially following the american civil war a large number of homeless men formed part of a counterculture known as hobohemia all over america this phenomenon resurged in the 1930s during and after the great depression3132 modernedit food line at the yonge street mission 381 yonge street toronto ontario canada in the 1930s how the other half lives and jack londons the people of the abyss 1903 discussed homelessness and raised public awareness which caused some changes in building codes and some social conditions in england dormitory housing called spikes was provided by local boroughs by the 1930s in england there were 30000 people living in these facilities in 1933 george orwell wrote about poverty in london and paris in his book down and out in paris and london in general in most countries many towns and cities had an area which contained the poor transients and afflicted such as a skid row in new york city for example there was an area known as the bowery traditionally where alcoholics were to be found sleeping on the streets bottle in hand the great depression of the 1930s caused a devastating epidemic of poverty hunger and homelessness there were two million homeless people migrating across the united states33 many lived in shantytowns they called hoovervilles in the 1960s the nature and growing problem of homelessness changed in england as public concern grew the number of people living rough in the streets had increased dramatically however beginning with the conservative administrations rough sleeper initiative the number of people sleeping rough in london fell dramatically this initiative was supported further by the incoming labour administration from 2009 onwards with the publication of the coming in from the cold strategy published by the rough sleepers unit which proposed and delivered a massive increase in the number of hostel bed spaces in the capital and an increase in funding for street outreach teams who work with rough sleepers to enable them to access services34 modern homelessness started as a result of economic stresses in society and reductions in the availability of affordable housing such as single room occupancies sros for poorer peoplecitation needed in the united states in the 1970s the deinstitutionalisation of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor that seeded the homeless population especially in large cities like new york city35 this theory is vigorously disputed by clinical psychologist seth farber who points out that the emptying of the state mental hospitals took place almost entirely in the 1960s and 1970s a decade or more before the steep rise in homelessness which began in the late 1980s36 some feel that ronald reagans signing as governor of california in 1967 of the lanterman–petris–short act greatly exacerbated homelessness among the mentally ill this law lowered the standards for involuntary commitment in civil courtrooms and was followed by significant defunding of 1700 hospitals caring for mental patientscitation needed unclear why lowering standards would cause less committals the community mental health act of 1963 was a predisposing factor in setting the stage for homelessness in the united states37 long term psychiatric patients were released from state hospitals into sros and supposed to be sent to community mental health centers for treatment and followup it never quite worked out properly the community mental health centers mostly did not materialize and this population largely was found living in the streets soon thereafter with no sustainable support system3839 also as real estate prices and neighborhood pressure increased to move these people out of their areas the sros diminished in number putting most of their residents in the streets other populations were mixed in later such as people losing their homes for economic reasons and those with addictions the elderly and others trends in homelessness are closely tied to neighborhood conditions according to a report by the edna mcconnell clark foundation in 199040 in 2002 research showed that children and families were the largest growing segment of the homeless population in the united states4142 and this has presented new challenges especially in services to agencies some trends involving the plight of homeless people have provoked some thought reflection and debate one such phenomenon is paid physical advertising colloquially known as sandwich board men4344 another trend is the sideeffect of unpaid free advertising of companies and organizations on shirts clothing and bags to be worn by homeless and poor people given out and donated by companies to homeless shelters and charitable organizations for otherwise altruistic purposes these trends are reminiscent of the sandwich board signs carried by poor people in the time of charles dickens in the victorian 19th century in england45 and later during the great depression in the united states in the 1930s in the us the government asked many major cities to come up with a tenyear plan to end homelessness one of the results of this was a housing first solution rather than to have a homeless person remain in an emergency homeless shelter it was thought to be better to quickly get the person permanent housing of some sort and the necessary support services to sustain a new home but there are many complications of this kind of program and these must be dealt with to make such an initiative work successfully in the middle to long term4647 some formerly homeless people who were finally able to obtain housing and other assets which helped to return to a normal lifestyle have donated money and volunteer services to the organizations that provided aid to them during their homelessness48 alternatively some social service entities that help homeless people now employ formerly homeless individuals to assist in the care process homeless children in the united states49 the number of homeless children reached record highs in 201150 201251 and 201352 at about three times their number in 198351 homelessness has migrated toward rural and suburban areas the number of homeless people has not changed dramatically but the number of homeless families has increased according to a report of hud53 the united states congress appropriated 25 million in the mckinneyvento homeless assistance grants for 2008 to show the effectiveness of rapid rehousing programs in reducing family homelessness545556 in february 2009 president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 part of which addressed homelessness prevention allocating 15 billion for a homeless prevention fund emergency shelter grant esg programs name was changed to emergency solution grant esg program and funds were reallocated to assist with homeless prevention and rapid rehousing for families and individuals57 on 20 may 2009 president obama signed the homeless emergency assistance and rapid transition to housing hearth act into public law public law 11122 or pl 11122 reauthorizing huds homeless assistance programs it was part of the helping families save their homes act of 2009 the hearth act allows for the prevention of homelessness rapid rehousing consolidation of housing programs and new homeless categories in the eighteen months after the bills signing hud must make regulations implementing this new mckinney program5859 the hearth act also codifies in law the continuum of care planning process long a part of huds application process to assist homeless persons by providing greater coordination in responding to their needs this final rule integrates the regulation of the definition of homeless and the corresponding recordkeeping requirements for the shelter plus care program and the supportive housing program this final rule also establishes the regulation for the definition developmental disability and the definition and recordkeeping requirements for homeless individual with a disability for the shelter plus care program and the supportive housing program60 in late 2009 some homeless advocacy organizations such as the national coalition for the homeless reported and published perceived problems with the hearth act of 2009 as an hud mckinneyvento reauthorization bill especially with regard to privacy definitional ineligibility community roles and restrictions on eligible activities61 social scienceedit causesedit major reasons and causes for homelessness as documented by many reports and studies include6263646566 abuse by government officials police or by other people with power domestic violence forced eviction – in many countries people lose their homes by government orders to make way for newer upscale high rise buildings roadways and other governmental needs67 the compensation may be minimal in which case the former occupants cannot find appropriate new housing and become homeless foreclosures on landlords often lead to eviction of their tenants the sarasota florida herald tribune noted that by some estimates more than 311000 tenants nationwide have been evicted from homes this year after lenders took over the properties6869 gentrification the process where a neighborhood becomes popular with wealthier people and the poor residents are priced out lack of accessible healthcare lack of affordable housing living with a disability especially where disability services are nonexistent or poorly performing70 living with a mental disorder where mental health services are unavailable or difficult to access71 a united states federal survey done in 2005 indicated that at least onethird of homeless men and women have serious psychiatric disorders or problems autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia are the top two common mental disabilities among the us homeless personality disorders are also very prevalent especially cluster a 7273 migration either domestic or foreign to the country where the number of migrants outstrips the supply of affordable housing mortgage foreclosures where mortgage holders see the best solution to a loan default is to take and sell the house to pay off the debt the popular press made an issue of this in 200874 natural disasters including but not limited to earthquakes and hurricanes75 poverty caused by many factors including unemployment and underemployment prison release and reentry into society relationship breakdown particularly in relation to young people and their parents such as disownment76 social exclusion because of sexual orientation eg glbtq and gender identity77 substance abuse or addiction such as alcoholism or drug addiction homeless veteran in new york traumatic brain injury a condition which according to a canadian survey is widespread among homeless people and for around 70 of respondents can be attributed to a time before the onset of homelessness78 war or armed conflict which can create refugees fleeing the violence a substantial percentage of the us homeless population are individuals who are chronically unemployed or have difficulty managing their lives effectively due to prolonged and severe drug andor alcohol abuse79 substance abuse can cause homelessness from behavioral patterns associated with addiction that alienate an addicted individuals family and friends who could otherwise provide support during difficult economic times increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions in the housing market that push rent burdens higher making housing unaffordable80 dr paul koegel of rand corporation a seminal researcher in first generation homelessness studies and beyond divided the causes of homelessness into structural aspects and then individual vulnerabilities66 challengesedit main article discrimination against the homeless the basic problem of homelessness is the need for personal shelter warmth and safety other difficulties include cleaning and drying of clothes hostility from the public and laws against urban vagrancy hygiene and sanitary facilities keeping contact with friends family and government services without a permanent location or mailing address medical problems including issues caused by an individuals homeless state eg hypothermia or frostbite from sleeping outside in cold weather or issues which are exacerbated by homelessness due to lack of access to treatment eg mental health issues which are exacerbated by the individual not having privacy quiet and a safe place to store prescription drugs for conditions such as schizophrenia obtaining preparing and storing food personal security quiet and privacy especially for sleeping bathing and other hygiene activities safekeeping of bedding clothing and possessions which may have to be carried at all times homeless people face many problems beyond the lack of a safe and suitable home they are often faced with many social disadvantages also reduced access to private and public services gaps in their personal infrastructures and reduced access to vital necessities81 general rejection or discrimination from other people increased risk of suffering from violence and abuse limited access to education loss of usual relationships with the mainstream not being seen as suitable for employment reduced access to banking services reduced access to communications technology reduced access to health care and dental services targeting by municipalities to exclude from public space82 there is sometimes corruption and theft by the employees of a shelter as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by fox 25 tv in boston wherein a number of boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food over a period of time from the shelters kitchen for their private use and catering8384 the homeless are often obliged to adopt various strategies of selfpresentation in order to maintain a sense of dignity which constrains their interaction with passersby and leads to suspicion and stigmatization by the mainstream public85 homelessness is also a risk factor for depression caused by prejudice ie deprejudice when someone is prejudiced against people who are homeless and then becomes homeless themselves their antihomelessness prejudice turns inward causing depression mental disorders physical disability homelessness and having a sexually transmitted infection are all stigmatized statuses someone can gain despite having negative stereotypes about those groups 86 difficulties can compound exponentially for example a homeless man in new jersey found that he could not get food from some volunteer organizations if he did not have a legallyrecognized address after being mugged he lost valuable identification documents and contact information so he could not contact his daughter since his hips and knee had been broken because of the attack it was harder for him after recovering in the hospital to walk to those places which did offer free food in numerous instances problems seemed to exacerbate other problems in a downward cycle87 a study found that in the city of hong kong over half of the homeless population in the city 56 suffered from some degree of mental illness only 13 of the 56 were receiving treatment for their condition leaving a huge portion of homeless untreated for their mental illness88 victimization by violent crimesedit the homeless are often the victims of violent crime a 2007 study found that the rate of violent crimes against the homeless in the united states is increasing8990 in the united states in 2013 there were 109 reported attacks on homeless people an increase of 24 per cent on the previous year according to the national coalition for the homeless eighteen of those attacked died as a result in july 2014 three boys 15 16 and 18 were arrested and charged with beating to death two homeless men with bricks and a metal pole in albuquerque91 the 18yearold was subsequently found guilty of seconddegree murder and other felony charges and sentenced to 67 years in prison92 the 16year old was sentenced to 26 years in prison93 rent controledit rent controlled apartments contribute to shelter and street populations around 04 apartments that are rent controlled encourage people to not move out or pass apartments along between families this leads to the price of apartments being higher for new renters and consequently it is harder for people to afford their rents about 10 of housing in the united states is under the control of price control laws most laws were enacted to deal with the high inflation rates experienced during the 1970s and 80s94 these laws can motivate apartment owners to convert the property to a more profitable enterprise which can reduce the amount of housing available to potential tenants a black market can also develop with tenants leasing rent controlled premises at prices above the legal maximum this can price out low income individuals and families stigma attached to the termedit prior to 1983 the term homeless implied that economic conditions caused homelessness however after 1983 more associations were made with the term95 alcoholism and mental illness became associated with the term in the media claims were often backed up with testimony made by highranking officials for example ronald reagan stated that one problem that we’ve had even in the best of times is the people who are sleeping on the grates the homeless who are homeless by choicecitation neededthis claim made the homelessness problem one of personal choice and mental condition not of the neoliberal reforms sweeping through the economic system this made homelessness something that would exist even under the best economic conditions and therefore economic reforms would be unnecessary assistance and resourcesedit most countries provide a variety of services to assist homeless people they often provide food shelter and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations often with the help of volunteers or by government departments these programs may be supported by a government charities churches and individual donors in 1998 a study by koegel and schoeni of a homeless population in los angeles california reported that a significant number of homeless do not participate in government assistance programs and the authors reported being puzzled as to why that was with the only possible suggestion from the evidence being that transaction costs were perhaps too high96 the united states department of housing and urban development and veterans administration have a special section 8 housing voucher program called vash veterans administration supported housing or hudvash which gives out a certain number of section 8 subsidized housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable us armed forces veterans97 the hudvash program has shown success in housing many homeless veterans98 nongovernmental organizations such as the center for american homeless veterans also

another100 providing each other various types of support101 people who are not homeless also may provide them friendship food relational care and other forms of assistance such social supports may be done through a formal process such as under the auspices of a nongovernmental organization religious organization or homeless ministry or may be done on an individual basis in los angeles a collaboration between the ostrow school of dentistry of the university of southern california and the union rescue mission shelter offer homeless people in the skid row area free dental services102 income sourcesedit many nonprofit organizations such as goodwill industries provide skill development and work opportunities to people with barriers to employment though most of these organizations are not primarily geared toward homeless individuals many cities also have street newspapers or magazines publications designed to provide employment opportunity to homeless people or others in need by street sale while some homeless have paying jobs some must seek other methods to make money begging or panhandling is one option but is becoming increasingly illegal in many cities despite the stereotype not all homeless people panhandle and not all panhandlers are homeless103104 another option is busking performing tricks playing music drawing on the sidewalk or offering some other form of entertainment in exchange for donations in cities where plasmapheresis blood donation centers still exist homeless people may generate income through visits to these centers homeless people can also provide waste management services to earn money some homeless people find returnable bottles and cans and bring them to recycling centres to earn money for example they can sort out organic trash from other trash andor separate out trash made of the same material for example different types of plastics and different types of metal especially in brazil many people are already engaged in such activities105 in addition rather than sorting waste at landfills they can also collect litter found onbeside the road to earn an income106 homeless people have been known to commit crimes just to be sent to jail or prison for food and shelter in police slang this is called three hots and a cot referring to the three daily meals and a mattress to sleep on which are given to prisonerscitation needed invented in 2005 in seattle bumvertising an informal system of hiring homeless people to advertise by a young entrepreneur is providing food money and bottles of water to signholding homeless

pejorative107108 in october 2009 the boston globe carried a story on socalled cyberbegging or internet begging which was reported to be a new trend worldwide109 employmentedit the united states department of labor has sought to address one of the main causes of homelessness a lack of meaningful and sustainable employment through targeted training programs and an increase in access to employment opportunities that can help homeless people to develop sustainable lifestyles110 this has included the development of the united states interagency council on homelessness which addresses homelessness on the federal level in addition to connecting homelesss individuals to resources at the state level111 all individuals who are in need of assistance are able in theory to access employment and training services under the workforce investment act wia although this is contingent upon funding and program support by the government with veterans also being able to use the veterans workforce investment program110 under the department of labor the veterans employment and training service vets offers a variety of programs targeted at ending homelessness among veterans110 the homeless veterans reintegration program hvrp is the only national program that is exclusively focused on assisting veterans as they reenter the workforce110 in addition the vets program also has an incarcerated veterans transition program as well as services that are unique to female veterans110 mainstream programs initiated by the department of labor have included the workforce investment act

newspaper was created called street news which put some homeless to work some writing producing and mostly selling the paper on streets and trains113 street news is written pro bono by a combination of homeless celebrities and established writers in 1991 in england a street newspaper following the new york model was established called the big issue and is published weekly114 its circulation has grown to 300000 chicago has streetwise which has the second largest circulation of its kind in the united states 30000 boston has a spare change news newspaper founded in 1992 by a small group of

cities in america116 sacramento california has homeward street journal published bimonthly with a circulation of about 11000 per issue117118 housingedit community organization housing initiativeedit many housing initiatives involve homeless people in the process of building and maintaining affordable shared housing this process works as a double impact by not only providing housing but also giving homeless people employment income and work experience one example of this type of initiative is the nonprofit organization living solutions which is located in downtown san diego ca this community initiative provides the homeless population with a source of housing as well as giving them jobs building affordable homes the initiative also builds community empowerment by asking formerly homeless residents to help to maintain and repair these homes residents are responsible for all household duties including menu planning budgeting shopping cooking cleaning yard work and home maintenance the environment of responsibility over a living space fosters a sense of ownership as well as involvement in all parts of the decisionmaking process119 photo of housing initiative for the homeless organizing in homeless sheltersedit homeless shelters can become grounds for community organization and the recruitment of homeless individuals into social movements for their own cause cooperation between the shelter and an elected representative from the homeless community at each shelter can serve as the backbone of this form of initiative the representative presents and forwards problems raises concerns and provides new ideas to the director and staff of the shelters a few examples of possible problems are ways to deal with drug and alcohol use by certain shelter users and resolve interpersonal conflicts sand the danish national organization for homeless people is one example of an organization that uses this empowerment approach120 issues reported at the homeless shelters are then addressed by sand at the regional or national level to open further dialogue sand organizes regional discussion forums where staff and leaders from the shelters homeless representatives and local authorities meet to discuss issues and good practices at the shelters121 political action votingedit voting for elected officials is important for the homeless population to have a voice in the democratic process121 equal access to the right to vote is a crucial part of maintaining a democracy however in some jurisdictions it may be hard for homeless people to vote if they do not have identification a fixed address or a place to receive mail voting enables homeless people to play a part in deciding the direction of their communities by voicing their opinions on local regional and national issues that are important and relevant to their lives with each election low income and homeless individuals vote at a lower rate than people with higher incomes despite the fact that many policy decisions directly impact people who are economically disadvantaged currently issues such as raising the minimum wage and funding certain social welfare and housing programs are being debated in the us congress and in communities around the country in order for the government to represent the people citizens must vote—especially those who are economically disadvantaged122 an example of how to overcome these obstacles and encourage greater voter participation among low income and homeless citizens was done by the national coalition for the homeless and other national advocacy and grassroots social movement groups these groups collaborated to create a manual that promotes voting access for low income and homeless persons to ensure that those who are economically disadvantaged maintain an active role and voice in shaping their futures the manual is designed to provide ideas to help overcome the many obstacles that prevent people experiencing homelessness from becoming registered active voters123 by working together with homeless persons lowincome individuals and advocates around the country grassroots social movement organizations can work alongside homeless and lowincome persons to make their voices heard on election day legislation and legal pro bono effortsedit in 1979 a new york city lawyer robert hayes brought a class action suit before the courts callahan v carey against the city and state arguing for a persons state constitutional right to shelter it was settled as a consent decree in august 1981 the city and state agreed to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards by 1983 this right was extended to homeless women by the mid1980s there was also a dramatic increase in family homelessness tied into this was an increasing number of impoverished and runaway children teenagers and young adults which created a new substratum of the homeless population street children or street youth124125126 also in the 1980s in the united states some federal legislation was introduced on homelessness as a result of the work of congressman stewart b mckinney in 1987 the mckinneyvento homeless assistance act was enacted servicesedit main article homelessness services further information list of homelessness organizations there are many community organizations and social movements around the world which are taking action to reduce homelessness they have sought to counteract the causes and reduce the consequences by starting initiatives that help homeless people to transition to selfsufficiency social movements and initiatives tend to follow a grassroots communitybased model of organization this form of movement is generally characterized by a loose informal and decentralized structure with an emphasis on radical protest politics an interest group gives more of an emphasis on influencing government policies and relies on more of a formal organization structure121 these different groups share a common element they are both made up of and run by a mix of allies of the homeless population and former or current members of the homeless population both grassroots groups and interest groups aim to break stereotyped images of the homeless as being weak criminals drug addicts and excluded and to ensure that the voice of homeless people and their representatives is clearly heard by policymakers housingedit homeless shelter in poznan poland urban homeless sheltersedit homeless shelters which generally are night shelters make people leave in the morning to whatever they could manage and return in the evening when the beds in the shelters opened up again for sleeping there are some daytime shelters where people could go instead of being stranded on the streets and they could be helped get counseling avail themselves of resources meals and otherwise spend their day until returning to their overnight sleeping arrangements an example of such a day center shelter model is saint francis house in boston massachusetts founded in the early 1980s which opens for homeless people all year long during the daytime hours and was originally based on the settlement house model127 many homeless people keep all their possessions with them because they have no access to storage there was also the reality of the bag people the shopping cart people and the soda can collectors known as binners or dumpster divers who sort through garbage to find items to sell trade and eat these people carry around all of their possessions with them all the time because they have no place to store them if they had no access to or capability to get to a shelter and possible bathing or access to toilets and laundry facilities their hygiene was lacking this again creates social tensions in public placescitation needed these conditions created an upsurge in tuberculosis and other diseases in urban areas128129130 in 1974 kip tiernan founded rosies place in boston the first dropin and emergency shelter for women in the united states in response to the increasing numbers of needy women throughout the country refuges and alternative accommodationedit there are many places where a homeless person might seek refuge 24hour internet cafes are now used by over 5000 japanese net cafe refugees an estimated 75 of japans 3200 allnight internet cafes cater to regular overnight guests who in some cases have become their main source of income131 24hour mcdonalds restaurants are used by mcrefugees in japan china and hong kong there are about 250 mcrefugees in hong kong132 derelict structures abandoned or condemned buildings friends or family temporarily sleeping in dwellings of friends or family members couch surfing couch surfers may be harder to recognize than street homeless people133 homeless shelters such as emergency coldweather shelters opened by churches or community agencies which may consist of cots in a heated warehouse or temporary christmas shelters more elaborate homeless shelters such as pinellas hope in florida provide their residents with a recreation tent a dining tent laundry facilities outdoor tents casitas and shuttle services that help inhabitants get to their jobs every day134 inexpensive boarding houses also called flophouses they offer cheap lowquality temporary lodging inexpensive motels also offer cheap lowquality temporary lodging however some who can afford housing live in a motel by choice for example david and jean davidson spent 22 years at a uk travelodge135 isbn 1556521901ref outdoors on the ground or in a sleeping bag tent or improvised shelter such as a large cardboard box dumpster in a park or vacant lot public places parks bus or train stations public libraries airports public transportation vehicles by continual riding where unlimited passes are available hospital lobbies or waiting areas college campuses and 24hour businesses such as coffee shops many public places use security guards or police to prevent people from loitering or sleeping at these locations for a variety of reasons including image safety and comfort136137 residential hotels where a bed as opposed to an entire room can be rented cheaply in a dormlike environment shantytowns ad hoc dwelling sites of improvised shelters and shacks usually near rail yards interstates and high transportation veins some shanty towns have interstitial tenting areas but the predominant feature consists of the hard structures each pad of site tends to accumulate roofing sheathing plywood and nailed two by fours squatting in an unoccupied structure where a homeless person may live without payment and without the owners knowledge or permission tent cities ad hoc campsites of tents and improvised shelters consisting of tarpaulins and blankets often near industrial and institutionally zoned real estate such as rail yards highways and high transportation veins a few more elaborate tent cities such as dignity village are actually hybrids of tent cities and shantytowns tent cities frequently consist only of tents and fabric improvised structures with no semipermanent wood structures at all underground tunnels such as abandoned subway maintenance or train tunnels are popular among the permanent homeless138139 vehicles cars or trucks are used as a temporary or sometimes longterm living refuge for example by those recently evicted from a home some people live in recreational vehicles rvs school buses vans sport utility vehicles covered pickup trucks station wagons sedans or hatchbacks the vehicular homeless according to homeless advocates and researchers make up the fastestgrowing segment of the homeless population140 many cities now have safe parking programs in which lawful sites are permitted at churches or in out of the way places for example because it is illegal to park on the streets in santa barbara the new beginnings counseling center worked with the city to make parking lots available to accommodate homeless people134 the inhabitants of such refuges are called in some places like new york city mole people natural caves beneath urban centers allow for places where people can congregate leaking water pipes electric wires and steam pipes allow for some of the essentials of living other housing optionsedit transitional housing transitional housing provides temporary housing for the certain segments of the homeless population including working homeless and is set up to transition their residents into permanent affordable housing its not in an emergency homeless shelter but usually a room or apartment in a residence with support services the transitional time can be short for example one or two years and in that time the person must file for and get permanent housing and usually some gainful employment or income even if social security or assistance sometimes the transitional housing residence program charges a room and board fee maybe 30 of an individuals income which is sometimes partially or fully refunded after the person procures a permanent place to live in in the usa federal funding for transitional housing programs was originally allocated in the mckinney–vento homeless assistance act of 1986141142143 supportive housing supportive housing is a combination of housing and services intended as a costeffective way to help people live more stable productive lives supportive housing works well for those who face the most complex challenges—individuals and families confronted with homelessness and who also have very low incomes andor serious persistent issues that may include substance abuse addiction or alcoholism mental illness hivaids or other serious challenges to a successful life pedestrian villages in 2007 urban designer and social theorist michael e arth proposed a controversial national solution for homelessness that would involve building nearly carfree pedestrian villages in place of what he terms the current bandaid approach to the problem144 a prototype tiger bay village was proposed for near daytona beach fl he claims that this would be superior for treating the psychological as well as psychiatric needs of both temporarily and permanently homeless adults and would cost less than the current approach it would also provide a lower cost alternative to jail and provide a halfway station for those getting out of prison work opportunities including construction and maintenance of the villages as well as the creation of work force agencies would help make the villages financially and socially viable145146147 government initiatives in south australia the state government of premier mike rann 2002 to 2011 committed substantial funding to a series of initiatives designed to combat homelessness advised by social inclusion commissioner david cappo and the founder of new yorks common ground program rosanne haggerty the rann government established common ground adelaide 148 building high quality inner city apartments combined with intensive support for rough sleeping homeless people the government also funded the street to home program and a hospital liaison service designed to assist homeless people who are admitted to the emergency departments of adelaides major public hospitals rather than being released back into homelessness patients identified as rough sleepers are found accommodation backed by professional support common ground and street to home now operate across australia in other states savings from housing homeless in the usedit in 2013 a central florida commission on homelessness study indicated that the region spends 31000 a year per homeless person to cover salaries of lawenforcement officers to arrest and transport homeless individuals — largely for nonviolent offenses such as trespassing public intoxication or sleeping in parks — as well as the cost of jail stays emergencyroom visits and hospitalization for medical and psychiatric issues this did not include money spent by nonprofit agencies to feed clothe and sometimes shelter these individuals in contrast the report estimated the cost of permanent supportive housing at 10051 per person per year and concluded that housing even half of the regions chronically homeless population would save taxpayers 149 million over the next decade — even allowing for 10 percent to end up back on the streets again this particular study followed 107 longtermhomeless residents living in orange osceola or seminole counties149 there are similar studies showing large financial savings in charlotte and southeastern colorado from focusing on simply housing the homeless150 health careedit health care for homeless people is a major public health challenge151 homeless people are more likely to suffer injuries and medical problems from their lifestyle on the street which includes poor nutrition152 exposure to the severe elements of weather and a higher exposure to violence robberies beatings and so on yet at the same time they have little access to public medical services or clinics153 in part because they often lack identification or registration for public health care services there are significant challenges in treating homeless people who have psychiatric disorders because clinical appointments may not be kept their continuing whereabouts are unknown their medicines may not be taken as prescribed and monitored medical and psychiatric histories are not accurate and for other reasons because many homeless people have mental illnesses this has presented a crisis in care71154155 homeless people often find it difficult to document their date of birth or their address because homeless people usually have no place to store possessions they often lose their belongings including their identification and other documents or find them destroyed by police or others without a photo id homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services including health care and clinic access they can be denied access to even the most basic assistance clothing closets food pantries certain public benefits and in some cases emergency shelters obtaining replacement identification is difficult without an address birth certificates cannot be mailed fees may be costprohibitive for impoverished persons and some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification creating a catch22156 this problem is far less acute in countries which provide freeatuse health care such as the uk where hospitals are openaccess day and night and make no charges for treatment in the us freecare clinics for homeless and other people do exist in major cities but they often attract more demand than they can meet157 the conditions affecting homeless people are somewhat specialized and have opened a new area of medicine tailored to this population skin conditions including scabies are common because homeless people are exposed to extreme cold in the winter and they have little access to bathing facilities they have problems caring for their feet158 and have more severe dental problems than the general population159 diabetes especially untreated is widespread in the homeless population160 specialized medical textbooks have been written to address this for providers161 there are many organizations providing free care to homeless people in countries which do not offer free medical treatment organized by the state but the services are in great demand given the limited number of medical practitioners for example it might take months to get a minimal dental appointment in a freecare clinic communicable diseases are of great concern especially tuberculosis which spreads more easily in crowded homeless shelters in highdensity urban settings162 there has been an ongoing concern and studies about the health and wellness of the older homeless population typically ages fifty to sixtyfour years of age and even older as to whether they are significantly more sickly than their younger counterparts and if they are underserved163164 in 1985 the boston health care for the homeless program was founded to assist the growing numbers of homeless living on the streets and in shelters in boston and who were suffering from lack of effective medical services165166 in 2004 boston health care for the homeless in conjunction with the national health care for the homeless council published a medical manual called the health care of homeless persons edited by james j oconnell md specifically for the treatment of the homeless population167 in june 2008 in boston massachusetts the jean yawkey place a fourstory 77653squarefoot 72142 m2 building was opened by the boston health care for the homeless program it is an entire fullservice building on the boston medical center campus dedicated to providing health care for homeless people it also contains a longterm care facility the barbara mcinnis house which expanded to 104 beds and is the first and largest medical respite program for homeless people in the united states168169170 a 2011 study led by dr rebecca t brown in boston massachusetts conducted by the institute for aging research an affiliate of harvard medical school beth israel deaconess medical center and the boston health care for the homeless program found the elderly homeless population had higher rates of geriatric syndromes including functional decline falls frailty and depression than seniors in the general population and that many of these conditions may be easily treated if detected the report was published in the journal of geriatric internal medicine171 there are government avenues which provide resources for the development of healthcare for the homeless in the united states the bureau of primary health care has a health care for the homeless program which provides grants to fund the delivery of healthcare to the homeless172 according to 2011 uds data community health centers were able to provide service to 1087431 homeless individuals173 furthermore there are many nonprofit and religious organizations which provide healthcare services to the homeless these organizations also contribute to the large need which exists for expanding healthcare for the homeless the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act in 2010 may also provide new healthcare options for the homeless in the united states particularly through the optional expansion of medicaid a 2013 yale study showed that a substantial proportion of the chronically homeless population in america will be able to obtain medicaid coverage if states expand medicaid under the affordable care act174 although efforts will be needed to help the homeless enroll in medicaid there has been a significant number of unsheltered persons dying of hypothermia adding impetus to the trend of establishing warming centers as well as extending the enumeration surveys with vulnerability indexes175176 effect on life expectancyedit in 1999 dr susan barrow of the columbia university center for homelessness prevention studies reported in a study that the ageadjusted death rates of homeless men and women were four times those of the general us population and two to three times those of the general population of new york city177 a report commissioned by homeless charity crisis in 2011 found that on average homeless people in the uk have a life expectancy of 47 years 30 years younger than the rest of the population178 global statisticsedit demographicsedit in western countries such as the united states the typical homeless person is male and single179 with the netherlands reporting 80 of homeless people aged 18–65 to be men some cities have particularly high percentages of males in homeless populations with men comprising eightyfive percent of the homeless in dublin180 nonwhite people are also overrepresented in homeless populations with such groups two and half times more likely to be homeless in the us the median age of homeless people is approximately thirtyfive181 statistics for developed countriesedit in 2005 an estimated 100 million people worldwide were homeless182 the following statistics indicate the approximate average number of homeless people at any one time each country has a different approach to counting homeless people and estimates of homelessness made by different organizations vary wildly so comparisons should be made with caution european union 3000000

assessment report to congress in a single night in january 2010 single point analysis reported to hud showed there were 649917 people experiencing homelessness this number has increased from january 2009s 643067 the unsheltered count increased by 28 percent while the sheltered count remained the same also hud reported the number of chronically homeless people persons with severe disabilities and long homeless histories decreased one percent between 2009 and 2010 from 110917 to 109812 since 2007 this number has decreased by eleven percent this is mostly due to the expansion of permanent supportive housing programs the change in the numbers has happened due to the prevalence of homelessness in local communities rather than other changes according to huds july 2010 homeless assessment report to congress more than 159 million people spent at least one night in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during 2010 reporting period this is a 22 percent increase from 2009 most users of homeless shelters used only emergency shelter while 17 percent used only transitional housing and less than 5 percent used both during the reporting period since 2007 the annual number of those using homeless shelters in cities has decreased from 122 million to 102 million that is a 17 percent decrease the number of those using homeless shelters in suburban and rural areas has increased 57 percent from 367000 to 576000186 in the usa the federal governments hud agency has required federally funded organizations to use a computer tracking system for homeless people and their statistics called hmis homeless management information system187188189 there has been some opposition to this kind of tracking by privacy advocacy groups such as epic190 however hud considers its reporting techniques to be reasonably accurate for homeless in shelters and programs in its annual homeless assessment report to congress191192 actually determining and counting the number of homeless is very difficult in general due to their lifestyle habits193194 there are socalled hidden homeless out of sight of the normal population and perhaps staying on private property195 various countries states and cities have come up with differing means and techniques to calculate an approximate count for example a one night homeless census count called a pointintime pit count usually held in the early winter for the year is a technique used by a number of american cities especially boston massachusetts196197198 los angeles california uses a mixed set of techniques for counting including the pit street count195199 in 2003 the united states department of housing and urban development hud had begun requiring a pit count in all continuum of care communities which required them to report the count of people housing status and geographic locations of individuals counted some communities will give subpopulation information to the pit such as information on veterans youth and elderly individuals as done in boston200 japan 20000–100000 some figures put it at 200000–400000201 reports show that homelessness is on the rise in japan since the mid1990s202 there are more homeless men than homeless women in japan because it is usually easier for women to get a job and they are less isolated than men also japanese families usually provide more support for women than they do for men203 developing and undeveloped countriesedit the number of homeless people worldwide has grown steadily in recent years204205 in some developing countries such as nigeria and south africa homelessness is rampant with millions of children living and working on the streets206207 homelessness has become a problem in the countries of china india thailand indonesia and the philippines despite their growing prosperity mainly due to migrant workers who have trouble finding permanent homes208 determining the true number of homeless people worldwide varies between 100 million and 1 billion people based on the exact definition used209 refugees asylumseekers and internally displaced persons itds can also be considered homeless in that they too experience marginalization minority status socioeconomic disadvantage poor physical health collapse of social supports psychological distress and difficulty adapting to host cultures like the domestic homeless210 in the past twenty years scholars like tipple and speak have begun to refer to homelessness as the antithesis or absence of home rather than rooflessness or the lack of physical shelter this complication in the homelessness debate further delineates the idea that home actually consists of an adequate shelter an experienced and dynamic place that serves as a base for nurturing human relationships and the free development of individuals and their identity211 thus the home is perceived to be an extension of ones self and identity in contrast the homeless experience according to moore constitutes more as a lack of belonging and a loss of identity that leads to individuals or communities feeling out of place once they can no longer call a place of their own home 212 this new perspective on homelessness sheds light on the plight of refugees a population of stateless people who are not normally included in the mainstream definition of homelessness it has also created problems for researchers because the nature of counting homeless people across the globe relies heavily on who is considered a homeless person homeless individuals and by extension refugees can be seen as lacking lack the crucible of our modern society and lacking a way of actively belonging to and engaging with their respective communities or cultures 213 as casavant demonstrates a spectrum of definitions for homelessness called the continuum of homelessness should refer to refugees as homeless individuals because they not only lose their home but they are also afflicted with a myriad of problems that parallel those affecting the domestic homeless such as a lack of stable safe and healthy housing an extremely low income adverse discrimination in access to services with problems of mental health alcohol and drug abuse or social disorganization 214 refugees like the domestic homeless lose their source of identity and way of connecting with their culture for an indefinite period of time thus the current definition of homelessness unfortunately allows people to simplistically assume that homeless people including refugees are merely without a place to live when that is not the case as numerous studies show forced migration and displacement brings with it another host of problems including socioeconomic instability increased stress isolation and new responsibilities in a completely new environment 215 for people in russia especially the youth alcoholism and substance abuse is a major cause and reason for becoming and continuing to be homeless216 the united nations united nations centre for human settlements unhabitat wrote in its global report on human settlements in 1995 homelessness is a problem in developed as well as in developing countries in london for example life expectancy among homeless people is more than 25 years lower than the national average poor urban housing conditions are a global problem but conditions are worst in developing countries habitat says that today 600 million people live in life and healththreatening homes in asia africa and latin america for example more than three in four young people had insufficient means of shelter and sanitation in some african countries like malawi217 the threat of mass homelessness is greatest in those regions because that is where population is growing fastest by 2015 the 10 largest cities in the world will be in

public obtain nearimmediate assistance for specific rough sleepers with the support of the government as housing is a devolved matter the service currently only extends to england currently the service does not operate on a statutory basis and the involvement of local authorities is merely due to political pressure from the government and charities with funding being provided by the

children in russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from world war i and the russian civil war246 this led to the creation of a large number of orphanages by the 1930s the ussr declared the abolition of homelessness and any citizen was obliged to have a propiska – a place of permanent residency nobody could be stripped of propiska without substitution or refuse it without a confirmed permission called order to register in another place if someone wanted to move to another city or expand their living area he had to find a partner who wanted to mutually exchange the flats the right for shelter was secured in the soviet constitution not having permanent residency was legally considered a crime after the breakup of the ussr the problem of homelessness sharpened dramatically partially because of the legal vacuum of the early 1990s with some laws contradicting each other and partially because of a high rate of frauds in the realty market in 1991 articles 198 and 209 of russian criminal code which instituted a criminal penalty for not having permanent residence were abolished in moscow the first overnight shelter for homeless was opened in 1992247 in the late 1990s certain amendments in law were implemented to reduce the rise in homelessness such as the prohibition of selling last flat with registered children nevertheless the state is still obliged to give permanent shelter for free to anybody who needs better living conditions or has no permanent registration because the right to shelter is still included in the constitution several projects of special cheap social flats for those who failed to repay mortgages were proposed to facilitate mortgage market248 popular cultureedit main article homelessness in popular culture homelessness in popular
