revision has an xbox logo to the left of the xbox 360 branding kinect codenamed project natal during development was a line of motion sensing input devices by microsoft for xbox 360 and xbox one video game consoles and microsoft windows pcs based around a webcamstyle addon peripheral it enables users to control and interact with their consolecomputer without the need for a game controller through a natural user interface using gestures and spoken commands11 the firstgeneration kinect was first introduced in november 2010 in an attempt to broaden xbox 360s audience beyond its typical gamer base12 a version for microsoft windows was released on february 1 20126 a newer version kinect 20 was released with the xbox one platform starting in 201313 microsoft released the first beta of the kinect software development kit for windows 7 on june 16 2011141516 this sdk was meant to allow developers to write kinecting apps in ccli c or visual basic net1718 ultimately the kinect for either xbox

2009 under the code name project natal19 three demos were shown to showcase kinect when it was revealed at microsofts e3 2009 media briefing ricochet paint party and milo kate20 a demo based on burnout paradise was also shown outside of microsofts media briefing21 the skeletal mapping technology shown at e3 2009 was capable of simultaneously tracking four people22232425 with a feature extraction of 48 skeletal points on a human body at 30 hz2625 it was rumored that the launch of project natal would be accompanied with the release of a new xbox 360 console as either a new retail configuration2728 a significant design revision29 andor a modest hardware upgrade30 microsoft dismissed the reports in public and repeatedly emphasized that project natal would be fully compatible with all xbox 360 consoles microsoft indicated that the company considers it to be a significant initiative as fundamental to xbox brand as xbox live31 and with a launch akin to that of a new xbox console platform32 kinect was even referred to as a new xbox by microsoft ceo steve ballmer at a speech for executives club of chicago3334 when asked if the introduction will extend the time before the nextgeneration console platform is launched historically about 5 years between platforms35 microsoft corporate vice president shane kim reaffirmed that the company believes that the life cycle of xbox 360 will last through 2015 10 years23 during kinects development project team members experimentally adapted numerous games to kinectbased control schemes to help evaluate usability among these games were beautiful katamari and space invaders extreme which were demonstrated at tokyo game show in september 200936 according to creative director kudo tsunoda adding kinectbased control to preexisting games would involve significant code alterations making it unlikely for kinect features to be added through software updates37 although the sensor unit was originally planned to contain a microprocessor that would perform operations such as the systems skeletal mapping it was revealed in january 2010 that the sensor would no longer feature a dedicated processor instead processing would be handled by one of the processor cores of xbox 360s xenon cpu38 according to alex kipman kinect system consumes about 1015 of xbox 360s computing resources39 however in november alex kipman made a statement that the new motion control tech now only uses a singledigit percentage of xbox 360s processing power down from the previously stated 10 to 15 percent40 a number of observers commented that the computational load required for kinect makes the addition of kinect functionality to preexisting games through software updates even less likely with concepts specific to kinect more likely to be the focus for developers using the platform38 the xbox 360 s and e models have dedicated ports for the kinect removing the need for an external power supply on march 25 2010 microsoft sent out a save the date flier for an event called the world premiere project natal for xbox 360 experience at e3 2010 the event took place on the evening of sunday june 13 2010 at galen center41 and featured a performance by cirque du soleil it was announced that the system would officially be called kinect a portmanteau of the words kinetic and connect which describe key aspects of the initiative42 microsoft also announced that the north american launch date for kinect will be november 4 201043 despite previous statements dismissing speculation of a new xbox 360 to accompany the launch of the new control system microsoft announced at e3 2010 that it was introducing a redesigned xbox 360 complete with a connector port ready for kinect in addition on july 20 2010 microsoft announced a kinect bundle with a redesigned xbox 360 to be available with kinect launch44 on june 16 2011 microsoft announced its official release of its sdk for noncommercial use45 on july 21 2011 microsoft announced that the first ever white kinect sensor would be available as part of xbox 360 limited edition kinect star wars bundle which also includes custom a star warsthemed console and controller and copies of kinect adventures and star wars kinect46 previously all kinect sensors had been glossy black on october 31 2011 microsoft announced launching of the commercial version of kinect for windows program with release of sdk to companies david dennis product manager at microsoft said there are hundreds of organizations we are working with to help them determine whats possible with the tech47 on february 1 2012 microsoft released the commercial version of kinect for windows sdk and told that more than 300 companies from over 25 countries are working on kinectready apps48 launch a january 2010 promotional banner indicating the expected release of kinect then project natal by holiday 2010 the tabloid the new york post claimed microsoft had a 500 million budget for advertising the launch of kinect49 while this claim was widely rereported505152 an examination of the 10q from microsoft reveals a 20 yearoveryear increase 85 million for sales and marketing the quarter kinect was launched for all of the entertainment and devices division making the total sales and marketing spend 425 million for the entire division53 the marketing campaign you are the controller aiming to reach new audiences included advertisements on kelloggs cereal boxes and pepsi bottles commercials during shows such as dancing with the stars and glee as well as print ads in various magazines such as people and instyle54 on october 19 microsoft advertised kinect on the oprah winfrey show by giving free xbox 360 consoles and kinect sensors to the people in the audience55 two weeks later kinect bundles with xbox 360 consoles were also given away to the audience of late night with jimmy fallon56 on october 23 microsoft held a prelaunch party for kinect in beverly hills the party was hosted by ashley tisdale and was attended by soccer star david beckham and his three sons cruz brooklyn and romeo guests were treated to sessions with dance central and kinect adventures followed by tisdale having a kinect voice chat with nick cannon57 between november 1 and 28 burger king gave away a free kinect bundle every 15 minutes58 a major event was organized on november 3 in times square where singer neyo performed with hundreds of dancers in anticipation of kinects midnight launch59 kinect was launched in north america on november 4 20102 in europe on november 10 20101 in australia new zealand and singapore on november 18 201046061 and in japan on november 20 201062 purchase options for the sensor peripheral include a bundle with the game kinect adventures and console bundles with either a 4 gb446364 or 250 gb65 xbox 360 console and kinect adventures44636465 technology kinect for xbox 360 2010 kinect v1 was a combination of microsoft built software and hardware kinect v1 hardware included a range chipset technology by israeli developer primesense which developed a system consisting of an infrared projector and camera and a special microchip that generates a grid from which the location of a nearby object in 3 dimensions can be ascertained666768 this 3d scanner system called light coding69 employs a variant of imagebased 3d reconstruction7071 the kinect sensor11 is a horizontal bar connected to a small base with a motorized pivot and is designed to be positioned lengthwise above or below the video display the device features an rgb camera depth sensor and multiarray microphone running proprietary software72 which provide fullbody 3d motion capture facial recognition and voice recognition capabilities at launch voice recognition was only made available in japan united kingdom canada and united states mainland europe received the feature later in spring 201173 currently voice recognition is supported in australia canada france germany ireland italy japan mexico new zealand united kingdom and united states kinect sensors microphone array enables xbox 360 to conduct acoustic source localization and ambient noise suppression allowing for things such as headsetfree party chat over xbox live11 the depth sensor consists of an infrared laser projector combined with a monochrome cmos sensor which captures video data in 3d under any ambient light conditions1122 the sensing range of the depth sensor is adjustable and kinect software is capable of automatically calibrating the sensor based on gameplay and the players physical environment accommodating for the presence of furniture or other obstacles26 described by microsoft personnel as the primary innovation of kinect237475 the software technology enables advanced gesture recognition facial recognition and voice recognition24 according to information supplied to retailers kinect is capable of simultaneously tracking up to six people including two active players for motion analysis with a feature extraction of 20 joints per player76 however primesense has stated that the number of people the device can see but not process as players is only limited by how many will fit in the fieldofview of the camera77 this infrared image shows the laser grid kinect uses to calculate depth the depth map is visualized here using color gradients from white near to blue far reverse engineering78 has determined that the kinects various sensors output video at a frame rate of ≈9 hz to 30 hz depending on resolution the default rgb video stream uses 8bit vga resolution 640 × 480 pixels with a bayer color filter but the hardware is capable of resolutions up to 1280x1024 at a lower frame rate and other colour formats such as uyvy the monochrome depth sensing video stream is in vga resolution 640 × 480 pixels with 11bit depth which provides 2048 levels of sensitivity the kinect can also stream the view from its ir camera directly ie before it has been converted into a depth map as 640x480 video or 1280x1024 at a lower frame rate the kinect sensor has a practical ranging limit of 12–35 m 39–115 ft distance when used with the xbox software the area required to play kinect is roughly 6 m2 although the sensor can maintain tracking through an extended range of approximately 07–6 m 23–197 ft the sensor has an angular field of view of 57° horizontally and 43° vertically while the motorized pivot is capable of tilting the sensor up to 27° either up or down the horizontal field of the kinect sensor at the minimum viewing distance of ≈08 m 26 ft is therefore ≈87 cm 34 in and the vertical field is ≈63 cm 25 in resulting in a resolution of just over 13 mm 0051 in per pixel the microphone array features four microphone capsules79 and operates with each channel processing 16bit audio at a sampling rate of 16 khz76 because the kinect sensors motorized tilt mechanism requires more power than the xbox 360s usb ports can supply80 the device makes use of a proprietary connector combining usb communication with additional power redesigned xbox 360 s models include a special aux port for accommodating the connector81 while older models require a special power supply cable included with the sensor79 that splits the connection into separate usb and power connections power is supplied from the mains by way of an ac adapter80 kinect for xbox one 20 2013 kinect 20 was released with xbox one on november 22 201382 the hardware included a timeofflight sensor developed by microsoft replacing the older technology from primesense83 xbox one consoles ship with an updated version of kinect the new kinect uses a wideangle timeofflight camera and processes 2 gigabits of data per second to read its environment the new kinect has greater accuracy with three times the fidelity over its predecessor and can track without visible light by using an active ir sensor it has a 60 wider field of vision that can detect a user up to 3 feet from the sensor compared to six feet for the original kinect and can track up to 6 skeletons at once it can also detect a players heart rate facial expression the position and orientation of 25 individual joints including thumbs the weight put on each limb speed of player movements and track gestures performed with a standard controller the color camera captures 1080p video that can be displayed in the same resolution as the viewing screen allowing for a broad range of scenarios in addition to improving video communications and video analytics applications this provides a stable input on which to build interactive applications kinects microphone is used to provide voice commands for actions such as navigation starting games and waking the console from sleep mode8485 all xbox one consoles were initially shipped with the kinect sensor included—a holdover from a previouslyannounced but retracted mandate requiring kinect to be plugged into the console at all times for it to function86 in june 2014 bundles without kinect were made available87 along with an updated xbox one sdk allowing game developers to explicitly disable kinect skeletal tracking freeing up system resources that were previously reserved for kinect even if it was disabled or unplugged8788 a standalone kinect for xbox one bundled with a digital copy of dance central spotlight was released on october 7 201489 kinect for microsoft windows on february 21 2011 microsoft announced that it would release a noncommercial kinect software development kit sdk for microsoft windows in spring 2011 and the first beta was released for windows 7 on june 16 2011141516 beta 2 was released on the 1 year anniversary of kinect for xbox 360 on november 3 201190 version 10 was released at the same time as the officially supported microsoft windows hardware on february 1 201291 the sdk includes windows 7 compatible pc drivers for kinect device it provides kinect capabilities to developers to build applications with c c or visual basic by using microsoft visual studio 2010 and includes following features raw sensor streams access to lowlevel streams from the depth sensor color camera sensor and fourelement microphone array skeletal tracking the capability to track the skeleton image of one or two people moving within kinects field of view for gesturedriven applications advanced audio capabilities audio processing capabilities include sophisticated acoustic noise suppression and echo cancellation beam formation to identify the current sound source and integration with windows speech recognition api sample code and documentation92 in march 2012 craig eisler the general manager of kinect for windows said that almost 350 companies are working with microsoft on custom kinect applications for microsoft windows93 version 15 in march 2012 microsoft announced that next version of kinect for windows sdk would be available in may 2012 kinect for windows 15 was released on may 21 2012 it adds new features support for many new languages and debut in 19 more countries9495 kinect for windows 15 sdk would include kinect studio a new app that allows developers to record playback and debug clips of users interacting with applications96 support for new seated or 10joint skeletal system that will let apps track the head neck and arms of a kinect user whether theyre sitting down or standing which would work in default and near mode support for four new languages for speech recognition – french spanish italian and japanese additionally it would add support for regional dialects of these languages along with english97 it would be available in hong kong south korea and taiwan in may and austria belgium brazil denmark finland india the netherlands norway portugal russia saudi arabia singapore south africa

including a new sensor was first released in 2014 software see also list of kinect games and list of xbox live arcade kinect games requiring at least 190 mb of available storage space102 kinect system software allows users to operate xbox 360 dashboard console user interface through voice commands and hand gestures techniques such as voice recognition and facial recognition are employed to automatically identify users among the applications for kinect is video kinect which enables voice chat or video chat with other xbox 360 users or users of windows live messenger the application can use kinects tracking functionality and kinect sensors motorized pivot to keep users in frame even as they move around other applications with kinect support include espn zune marketplace102 netflix hulu plus103 and lastfm104 microsoft later confirmed that all forthcoming applications would be required to have kinect functionality for certification105 xbox 360 games that require kinect are packaged in special purple cases as opposed to the green cases used by all other xbox 360 games and contain a prominent requires kinect sensor logo on their front cover games that include features utilizing kinect but do not require it for standard gameplay contain a better with kinect sensor branding on their front covers106 kinect launched on november 4 2010 with 17 titles107 thirdparty publishers of available and announced kinect games include among others ubisoft electronic arts lucasarts thq activision konami sega capcom namco bandai and mtv games along with retail games there are also select xbox live arcade titles which require the peripheral kinect fun labs at e3 2011 microsoft announced kinect fun labs a collection of various gadgets and minigames that are accessible from xbox 360 dashboard these gadgets includes build a buddy air band kinect googly eyes kinect me bobblehead kinect sparkler junk fu108 and avatar kinect109110111 open source drivers in november 2010 adafruit industries offered a bounty for an opensource driver for kinect microsoft initially voiced its disapproval of the bounty stating that it does not condone the modification of its products and that it had built in numerous hardware and software safeguards designed to reduce the chances of product tampering112 this reaction however was caused by a misunderstanding within microsoft113 and the company later clarified its position claiming that while it does not condone hacking of either the physical device or the console the usb connection was left open by design “ the first thing to talk about is kinect was not actually hacked hacking would mean that someone got to our algorithms that sit inside of the xbox and was able to actually use them which hasnt happened or it means that you put a device between the sensor and the xbox for means of cheating which also has not happened thats what we call hacking and thats what we have put a ton of work and effort to make sure doesnt actually occur what has happened is someone wrote an opensource driver for pcs that essentially opens the usb connection which we didnt protect by design and reads the inputs from the sensor the sensor again as i talked earlier has eyes and ears and thats a whole bunch of noise that someone needs to take and turn into signal ” — microsofts alex kipman speaking formally on nprs science friday114 on november 10 adafruit announced héctor martín as the winner115116 who had produced a linux driver that allows the use of both the rgb camera and depth sensitivity functions of the device117118 it was later revealed that johnny lee a core member of microsofts kinect development team had secretly approached adafruit with the idea of a driver development contest and had personally financed it119 in december 2010 primesense whose depth sensing chips were used in the kinect v1 hardware released their own open source drivers along with motion tracking middleware called nite120 primesense later announced that it had teamed up with asus to develop a pccompatible device similar to kinect for chinese markets called the wavi xtion the product was released in october 2011121122 openni is an opensource software framework that is able to read sensor data from kinect among other natural user interface sensors thirdparty development a demonstration of a thirdparty use of kinect at maker faire the visualization on the left provided through kinect is of a user with a jacket featuring wearable electronic controls for vjing numerous developers are researching possible applications of kinect that go beyond the systems intended purpose of playing games for example philipp robbel of mit combined kinect with irobot create to map a room in 3d and have the robot respond to human gestures123 while an mit media lab team is working on a javascript extension for google chrome called depthjs that allows users to control the browser with hand gestures124 other programmers including robot locomotion group at mit are using the drivers to develop a motioncontroller user interface similar to the one envisioned in minority report125 the developers of mrpt have integrated open source drivers into their libraries and provided examples of live 3d rendering and basic 3d visual slam126 another team has shown an application that allows kinect users to play a virtual piano by tapping their fingers on an empty desk127 oliver kreylos a researcher at university of california davis adopted the technology to improve live 3dimensional videoconferencing which nasa has shown interest in128 alexandre alahi from epfl presented a video surveillance system that combines multiple kinect devices to track groups of people even in complete darkness129 companies so touch and evoluce have developed presentation software for kinect that can be controlled by hand gestures among its features is a multitouch zoom mode130 in december 2010 the free public beta of htpc software kinemote was launched it allows navigation of boxee and xbmc menus using a kinect sensor131 soroush falahati wrote an application that can be used to create stereoscopic 3d images with a kinect sensor132 for a limited time in may 2011 a topshop store in moscow set up a kinect kiosk that could overlay a collection of dresses onto the live video feed of customers through automatic tracking position and rotation of the virtual dress were updated even as customers turned around to see the back of the outfitcitation needed kinect also shows compelling potential for use in medicine researchers at the university of minnesota have used kinect to measure a range of disorder symptoms in children creating new ways of objective evaluation to detect such conditions as autism attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder133 several groups have reported using kinect for intraoperative review of medical imaging allowing the surgeon to access the information without contamination134135 this technique is already in use at sunnybrook health sciences centre in toronto where doctors use it to guide imaging during cancer surgery136 at least one company gestsure technologies is pursuing the commercialization of such a system137 nasas jet propulsion laboratory jpl signed up for the kinect for windows developer program in november 2013 to use the new kinect to manipulate a robotic arm in combination with an oculus rift virtual reality headset creating the most immersive interface the unit had built to date138 another application of kinect is for multitouch displays a seattlebased company that graduated from microsofts kinect accelerator ubi interactive developed software for the kinect to work with projectors to allow touchscreenlike capabilities on various surfaces139 kinect is used with a number of ros robots via openni140 reception kinect for xbox 360 reception review scores publication score cvg 8810141 game informer 810142

opinions from reviewers and critics ign gave the device 75 out of 10 saying that kinect can be a tremendous amount of fun for casual players and the creative controllerfree concept is undeniably appealing though adding that for 14999 a motiontracking camera addon for xbox 360 is a tough sell especially considering that the entry level variation of xbox 360 itself is only 19999143 game informer rated kinect 8 out of 10 praising the technology but noting that the experience takes a while to get used to and that the spatial requirement may pose a barrier142 computer and video games called the device a technological gem and applauded the gesture and voice controls while criticizing the launch lineup and kinect hub141 cnets review pointed out how kinect keeps players active with its fullbody motion sensing but criticized the learning curve the additional power supply needed for older xbox 360 consoles and the space requirements144 engadget too listed the large space requirements as a negative along with kinects launch lineup and the slowness of the hand gesture ui the review praised the systems powerful technology and the potential of its yoga and dance games145 kotaku considered the device revolutionary upon first use but noted that games were sometimes unable to recognize gestures or had slow responses concluding that kinect is not mustown yet more like musteventually own152 techradar praised the voice control and saw a great deal of potential in the device whose lag and space requirements were identified as issues147 gizmodo also noted kinects potential and expressed curiosity in how more mainstream titles would utilize the technology153 ars technicas review expressed concern that the core feature of kinect its lack of a controller would hamper development of games beyond those that have either stationary players or control the players movement automatically154 the mainstream press also reviewed kinect usa today compared it to the futuristic control scheme seen in minority report stating that playing games feels great and giving the device 35 out of 4 stars146 david pogue from the new york times predicted players will feel a crazy magical omigosh rush the first time you try the kinect despite calling the motion tracking less precise than wiis implementation pogue concluded that kinect’s astonishing technology creates a completely new activity that’s social agespanning and even athletic155 the globe and mail titled kinect as setting a new standard for motion control the slight input lag between making a physical movement and kinect registering it was not considered a major issue with most games and the review called kinect a good and innovative product rating it 35 out of 4 stars156 kinect for xbox one although featuring improved performance over the original kinect its successor has been subject to mixed responses in its xbox one review engadget praised xbox ones kinect functionality such as face recognition login and improved motion tracking but that whilst magical every false positive or unrecognized voice command had us reaching for the controller157 the kinects inability to understand some accents in english was criticized158 writing for time matt peckham described the device as being chunky in appearance but that the facial recognition login feature was creepy but equally scififuture cool and that the new voice recognition system was a powerful addictive way to navigate the console and save for a few exceptions that seem to be smoothing out with use however its accuracy was found to be affected by background noise and peckham further noted that launching games using voice recognition required that the full title of the game be given rather than an abbreviated name that the console ought to semantically understand such as forza motorsport 5 rather than forza 5159 prior to xbox ones launch privacy concerns were raised over the new kinect critics showed concerns the device could be used for surveillance stemming from the originally announced requirements that xbox ones kinect be plugged in at all times plus the initial alwayson drm system that required the console to be connected to the internet to ensure continued functionality privacy advocates contended that the increased amount of data which could be collected with the new kinect such as a persons eye movements heart rate and mood could be used for targeted advertising reports also surfaced regarding recent microsoft patents involving kinect such as a drm system based on detecting the number of viewers in a room and tracking viewing habits by awarding achievements for watching television programs and advertising while microsoft stated that its privacy policy prohibits the collection storage or use of kinect data for the purpose of advertising critics did not rule out the possibility that these policies could be changed prior to the release of the console concerns were also raised that the device could also record conversations as its microphone remains active at all times in response to the criticism a microsoft spokesperson stated that users are in control of when kinect sensing is on off or paused will be provided with key privacy information and settings during the consoles initial setup and that usergenerated content such as photos and videos will not leave your xbox one without your explicit permission160161162163 microsoft ultimately decided to reverse its decision to require kinect usage on xbox one but the console still shipped with the device upon its launch in november 201386 sales 24 million units of kinect had been shipped by february 20139 having sold 8 million units in its first 60 days on the market kinect has claimed the guinness world record of being the fastest selling consumer electronics device164165166167 according to wedbush analyst michael pachter kinect bundles accounted for about half of all xbox 360 console sales in december 2010 and for more
