temporary income tax to pay war expenses the revenue act of 1862 was passed as an emergency and temporary wartime tax it copied a relatively new british system of income taxation instead of trade and property taxation the first income tax was passed in 1862 the initial rate was 3 on income over 800 which exempted most wageearners in 1862 the rate was 3 on income between 600 and 10000 and 5 on

taxes evolved but in 1894 the supreme court declared the income tax of 1894 unconstitutional in pollock v farmers loan trust co a decision that contradicted hylton v united states7 the federal government scrambled to raise money8 in 1906 with the election of president theodore roosevelt and later his successor william howard taft the united states saw a populist movement for tax reform this movement culminated during then candidate woodrow wilsons election of 1912 and in february 1913 the ratification of the sixteenth amendment to the united states constitution “ the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration ” this granted congress the specific power to impose an income tax without regard to apportionment among the states by population by february 1913 36 states had ratified the change to the constitution it was further ratified by six more states by march of the 48 states at the time 42 ratified it connecticut rhode island and utah rejected the amendment pennsylvania virginia and florida did not take up the issue9 people filing tax forms in 1920 in the first year after ratification of the sixteenth amendment no taxes were collected instead taxpayers simply completed the form and the irs checked the form for accuracy the irss workload jumped by tenfold triggering a massive restructuring professional tax collectors began to replace a system of patronage appointments the irs doubled its staff but was still processing 1917 returns in 191910 wars 19002000edit a constitutional amendment to allow the federal government to collect income taxes was proposed by president taft in 1909 but the 16th amendment was not ratified until 1913 just before the start of the first world war in 1913 the first edition of the 1040 form was introduced a copy of the very first irs 1040 form can be found at the irs website11 showing that only those with incomes of 3000 adjusted for inflation the equivalent of 74986 in 2017 or more were instructed to file income tax raised much of the money required to finance the war effort in 1918 a new revenue act established a top tax rate of 77 in 1919 the irs was tasked with enforcement of laws relating to prohibition of alcohol sales and manufacture this was transferred to the jurisdiction of the department of justice in 1930 after repeal in 1933 the irs resumed collection of taxes on beverage alcohol 12 the alcohol tobacco and firearms activities of the bureau were segregated into the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives in 1972 a new tax act was passed in 1942 as the united states entered the second world warthis act included a special wartime surcharge the number of american citizens who paid income tax increased from about 4 million in 1939 to over 42 million by 1945 13 in 1953 president trumans reform plan was carried out and the patronage system of appointments was ended the organizations name was formally changed from bureau of internal revenue to internal revenue service in 1954 the filing deadline was moved to april 15 the first electronic computers were put to work at the irs in 1961 by 1986 limited electronic filing of tax returns was possible the 1998 irs reform act changed the organization from geographically oriented to an organization based on four operating divisions presidential tax returns 1973edit from the 1950s through the 1970s the irs began using technology such as microfilm to keep and organize records access to this information proved controversial when president richard nixons tax returns were leaked to the public his tax advisor edward l morgan became the fourth lawenforcement official to be charged with a crime during watergate14 john requard jr accused of leaking the nixon tax returns collected delinquent taxes in the slums of washington in his words we went after people for nickels and dimes many of them poor and in many cases illiterate people who didnt know how to deal with a government agency requard admitted that he saw the returns but denied that he leaked them15 reporter jack white of the providence journal won the pulitzer prize for reporting about nixons tax returns nixon with a salary of 200000 paid 79281 in federal income tax in 1970 and 87803 in 1971 with deductions of 571000 for donating vicepresidential papers16 this was one of the reasons for his famous statement well im not a crook ive earned everything ive got so controversial was this leak that most later us presidents released their tax returns though sometimes only partially these returns can be found online at the tax history project17 computerization 1959–presentedit by the end of the second world war the irs was handling sixty million tax returns each year using a combination of mechanical desk calculators accounting machines and pencil and paper forms in 1948 punch card equipment was used the first trial of a computer system for income tax processing was in 1955 when an ibm 650 installed at kansas city processed 11 million returns the irs was authorized to proceed with computerization in 1959 and purchased ibm 1401 and ibm 7070 systems for local and regional data processing centers the social security number was used for taxpayer identification starting in 1965 by 1967 all returns were processed by computer and punched card data entry was phased out18 information processing in the irs systems of the late 1960s was in batch mode microfilm records were updated weekly and distributed to regional centers for handling tax inquiries a project to implement an interactive realtime system the tax administration system was launched that would provide thousands of local interactive terminals at irs offices however the general accounting office prepared a report critical of the lack of protection of privacy in tas and the project was abandoned in 197818 in 1995 the irs began to use the public internet for electronic filing since the introduction of efiling selfpaced online tax services have flourished augmenting the work of tax accountants who were sometimes replaced in 2003 the irs struck a deal with tax software vendors the irs would not develop online filing software and in return software vendors would provide free efiling to most americans19 in 2009 70 of filers qualified for free electronic filing of federal returns20 according to an inspector generals report released in november 2013 identity theft in the united states is blamed for us4 billion worth of fraudulent 2012 tax refunds by the irs fraudulent claims were made with the use of stolen taxpayer identification and social security numbers with returns sent to addresses both in the us and internationally following the release of the findings the irs stated that it resolved most of the identity theft cases of 2013 within 120 days while the average time to resolve cases from the 20112012 tax period was 312 days2122 in september 2014 irs commissioner john koskinen expressed concern over the organizations ability to handle obamacare and administer premium tax credits that help people pay for health plans from the health law’s insurance exchanges it will also enforce the law’s individual mandate which requires most americans to hold health insurance23 in january 2015 fox news obtained an email which predicted a messy tax season on several fronts the email was sent by irs commissioner koskinen to workers koskinen predicted the irs would shut down operations for two days later this year which would result in unpaid furloughs for employees and service cuts for taxpayers koskinen also said delays to it investments of more than 200 million may delay new taxpayer protections against identity theft22 also in january 2015 the editorial board of the new york times called the irs budget cuts pennywiseandpoundfoolish where for every dollar of cuts in the budget 6 were lost in tax revenue24 history of the irs nameedit irs and department of the treasury seal on lectern as early as the year 1918 the bureau of internal revenue began using the name internal revenue

irs for fiscal year 2009 the us congress appropriated spending of approximately 12624 billion of discretionary budget authority to operate the department of the treasury of which 11522 billion was allocated to the irs the projected estimate of the budget for the irs for fiscal year 2011 was 12633 billion40 by contrast during fiscal year fy 2006 the irs collected more than 22 trillion in tax net of refunds about 44 percent of which was attributable to the individual income tax this is partially due to the nature of the individual income tax category containing taxes collected from working class small business selfemployed and capital gains the top 5 of income earners pay 38284 of the federal tax collected4142 as of 2007 the agency estimates that the united states treasury is owed 354 billion more than the amount the irs collects43 in 2011 234 million tax returns were filed allowing the irs to collect 24 trillion out of which 384 billion were attributed to mistake or fraud44 outsourcing collection and taxassistanceedit in september 2006 the irs started to outsource the collection of taxpayers debts to private debt collection agencies opponents to this change note that the irs will be handing over personal information to these debt collection agencies who are being paid between 29 and 39 of the amount collected opponents are also worried about the agencies being paid on percent collected because it will encourage the collectors to use pressure tactics to collect the maximum amount irs spokesman terry lemons responds to these critics saying the new system is a sound balanced program that respects taxpayers rights and taxpayer privacy other state and local agencies also use private collection agencies45 in march 2009 the irs announced that it would no longer outsource the collection of taxpayers debts to private debt collection agencies the irs decided not to renew contracts to private debt collection agencies and began a hiring program at its call sites and processing centers across the country to bring on more personnel to process collections internally from taxpayers46 as of october 2009 the irs has ceased using private debt collection agencies in september 2009 after undercover exposé videos of questionable activities by staff of one of the irss volunteer taxassistance organizations were made public the irs removed acorn from its volunteer taxassistance program47 administrative functionsedit the irs publishes tax forms which taxpayers are required to choose from and use for calculating and reporting their federal tax obligations the irs also publishes a number of forms for its own internal operations such as forms 3471 and 4228 which are used during the initial processing of income tax returns in addition to collection of revenue and pursuing tax cheaters the irs issues administrative rulings such as revenue rulings and private letter rulings in addition the service publishes the internal revenue bulletin containing the various irs pronouncements48 the controlling authority of regulations and revenue rulings allows taxpayers to rely on them a private letter ruling is good for the taxpayer to whom it is issued and gives some explanation of the services position on a particular tax issue49 additionally a private letter ruling reasonably relied upon by a taxpayer allows for the waiver of penalties for underpayment of tax as is the case with all administrative pronouncements taxpayers sometimes litigate the validity of the pronouncements and courts sometimes determine a particular rule to be invalid where the agency has exceeded its grant of authority the irs also issues formal pronouncements called revenue procedures that among other things tell taxpayers how to correct prior tax errors the irss own internal operations manual is the internal revenue manual which describes the clerical procedures for processing and auditing tax returns in excruciating detail for example the internal revenue manual contains a special procedure for processing the tax returns of the president and vice president of the united states49 more formal rulemaking to give the services interpretation of a statute or when the statute itself directs that the secretary of the treasury shall provide irs undergoes the formal regulation process with a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm published in the federal register announcing the proposed regulation the date of the inperson hearing and the process for interested parties to have their views heard either in person at the hearing in washington dc or by mail following the statutory period provided in the administrative procedure act the service decides on the final regulations as is or as reflecting changes or sometimes withdraws the proposed regulations generally taxpayers may rely on proposed regulations until final regulations become effective for example human resource professionals are relying on the october 4 2005 proposed regulations50 citation 70 fr 579305798451 for the section 409a on deferred compensation the socalled enron rules on deferred compensation to add teeth to the old rules because regulations have not been finalized the irs oversaw the homebuyer credit and first time homebuyer credit programs instituted by the federal government from 20082010 those programs provided united states citizens with money toward the purchase of homes regardless of income tax filings52 controversiesedit see also political profiling at the internal revenue service activists at irs facility in mountainside new jersey on may 21 2013 protesting irs targeting of partisan groups the irs has been accused of abusive behavior on multiple occasions53545556 testimony was given before a senate subcommittee that focused on cases of overly aggressive irs collection tactics in considering a need for legislation to give taxpayers greater protection in disputes with the agency congress passed the taxpayer bill of rights iii on july 22 1998 which shifted the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the irs in certain limited situations the irs retains the legal authority to enforce liens and seize assets without obtaining judgment in court57 michael minns was the defense lawyer in a case against the irs on behalf of james and pamela moran after an initial indictment in what minns asserts was an irs smear campaign that virtually canvassed the taxpayers own hometown and surrounding area58 the original indictment was associated with the morans involvement with a tax shelter provider andersons ark associates the morans were eventually acquitted in the case59 minns also had previously asserted that the behavior of two irs attorneys at law kenneth mcwade and william a sims constituted legal misconduct and recommended them for disbarment following an investigation the law licenses of the irs attorneys were duly suspended for a twoyear period after a federal court ruling found that the two had indeed defrauded the courts in connection with 1300 tax shelter cases in 2003 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit concluded that the irs lawyers had corruptly agreed with certain taxpayers that no tax collection actions would be taken against them—in return for testimony against other taxpayers the court also asked why the irs had not punished the two60 in 2013 the irs became embroiled in a political scandal in which it was discovered that the agency subjected conservative or conservativesounding groups filing for taxexempt status to extra scrutiny61 on september 5 2014 16 months after the scandal first erupted a senate subcommittee released a report that confirmed that internal revenue service used inappropriate criteria to target tea party groups but found no evidence of political bias62 the chairman of the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations confirmed that while the actions were inappropriate intrusive and burdensome the democrats have often experienced similar treatment63 republicans noted that 83 of the groups being held up by the irs were rightleaning and the subcommittee minority staff which did not join the majority staff report filed a dissenting report entitled “irs targeting tea party groups”64 on may 25 2015 the agency announced that criminals had illegally accessed the private tax information of over 100000 taxpayers over a period of several months by providing social security numbers and other information obtained from prior computer crimes the criminals were able to use the irss online get transcript function to have the irs provide them with the tax returns and other private information of american tax filers65 on august 17 2015 irs disclosed that the breach had compromised an additional 220000 taxpayer records66 on
