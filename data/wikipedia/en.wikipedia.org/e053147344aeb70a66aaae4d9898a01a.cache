today cornish college of the arts2 contents 1 history 2 campus 3 library 4 notable alumni 5 references 6 external links historyedit cornish college of the arts was founded in 1914 as the cornish school of music by nellie cornish 1876–1956 a teacher of piano3 cornish would go on to serve as the schools director for its first 25 years until 1939 the cornish school of music began its operations in rented space in the boothe or booth4 building on broadway and pine street as cornish developed the idea of her school she initially turned to the montessoribased pedagogical method of evelyn fletchercopp5 but turned at last to the progressive musical pedagogy of calvin brainerd cady who had worked as musical director with john dewey as the latter set up his seminal progressive educational project what is now the university of chicago laboratory schools6 conceived by cornish as an elementary school of the arts — all the arts — with music as its major subject7 the school initially taught only children but it soon expanded to functioning also as a normal school a teachers college under cady within three years it had enrolled over 600 students expanded the age range of its students to college age and was the countrys largest music school west of chicago89 nellie cornish recruited opportunistically where she saw talent and the school soon offered classes as diverse as eurhythmics french language painting dance folk and ballet and theater1011 in 1915 the first full academic year eurythmics was added and the first studio arts classes taught dance with a ballet focus became a department in 1916 headed by chicagotrained mary ann wells that same year cornish became one of the first west coast schools of any type to offer a summer session12 after the closing of their influential chicago little theatre maurice browne and ellen van volkenburg were brought in to found the drama department in 1918 the department with its incorporation of scenic design music and dance in its productions became central to cornishs plans to ally the arts13 van volkenburg also began a marionette department the first such department in the country14 by 1923 opera and modern dance had been added to the curriculum as well15 in 1920 in recognition that music was no longer the schools central focus the schools name was simplified to the cornish school16 by this time too the school had expanded its age range and was offering classes and lessons from early childhood to the undergraduate level17 the school gathered a board of trustees from among seattles elite who funded the school through the hard economic times during and after world war i and raised money for a purposebuilt school building11 finished in 1921 the cornish school building now known as kerry hall opened for the 1921–22 academic year the cornish trio of the 1920s—peter meremblumcitation needed berthe poncy later berthe poncy jacobson18 and kola levienne—may have been the first resident chamber music group at an american school19 in 1935 cornish established the first but ultimately shortlived collegelevel school of radio broadcasting in the us20 through the 1920s the school was often on the edge of financial failure21 but was of a caliber that prompted anna pavlova to call it the kind of school other schools should follow22 although the mortgage was paid off and the building had been donated to the school in 192923 financial difficulties inevitably grew during the great depression24 ultimately convinced that finances would not allow the school to do more than tread water nellie cornish resigned her position as head of the school in 193925 while there were difficult years for the school after 1939 in the long run cornish did much more than tread water with support from local arts organizations and a core of dedicated faculty and staff the school ultimately reinvented itself many times and in 1977 earned full accreditation as a degree granting college from the northwest commission on colleges that was one year after the establishment of the theatre department as the fifth fully fledged academic department in 1982 the college received a large title iii grant which was instrumental in establishing the video art program in the art department and in the genesis of the performance production department which was granted full departmental status with the graduation of its first class in 1986 the bfa in performance production added concentrations in costume lighting scenic and sound design stage management and technical direction performance production was established as an independent department so that it would be able to provide support to major productions of the theatre dance and music departments and provide its students with experience in all three recognizing the vital importance of liberal arts studies as a part of the education of an artist cornish established its seventh department humanities and sciences some years later humanities and sciences had been an important part of the cornish education even before the accreditation process of the 70s but the important step of granting department status reaffirmed the commitment to whole person education miss aunt nellie the autobiography of nellie c cornish was published by the university of washington press in 1964 with the assistance of funds from the cornish school alumnae
