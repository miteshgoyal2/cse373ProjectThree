pronounced sɪʁk dzy sɔlɛj circus of the sun or sun circus is a canadian entertainment company it is the largest theatrical producer in the world3 based in montreal quebec canada and located in the innercity area of saintmichel it was founded in baiesaintpaul on 7 july 1984 by two former street performers guy laliberté and gilles stecroix4 initially named les échassiers lez‿eʃasje the waders they toured quebec in 1980 as a performing troupe their initial financial hardship was relieved in 1983 by a government grant from the canada council for the arts as part of the 450th anniversary celebrations of jacques cartiers voyage to canada5 le grand tour du cirque du soleil was a success in 1984 and after securing a second year of funding laliberté hired guy caron from the national circus school to recreate it as a proper circus its theatrical characterdriven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define cirque du soleil as the contemporary circus nouveau cirque that it remains today6 each show is a synthesis of circus styles from around the world with its own central theme and storyline shows employ continuous live music with performers rather than stagehands changing the props after financial successes and failures in the late 1980s nouvelle expérience was created – with the direction of franco dragone – which not only made cirque du soleil profitable by 1990 but allowed it to create new shows7 cirque du soleil expanded rapidly through the 1990s and 2000s going from one show to 19 shows in over 271 cities on every continent except antarctica the shows employ approximately 4000 people from over 40 countries and generate an estimated annual revenue exceeding us810 million89 the multiple permanent las vegas shows alone play to more than 9000 people a night 5 of the citys visitors adding to the 90 million people who have experienced cirque du soleils shows worldwide9 in 2000 laliberté bought out gauthier and with 95 ownership has continued to expand the brand10 in 2008 laliberté split 20 of his share equally between two investment groups istithmar world and nakheel of dubai in order to further finance the companys goals in partnership with these two groups cirque du soleil had planned to build a residency show in the united arab emirates in 2012 directed by guy caron dralion and michael curry11 but since dubais financial problems in 2010 caused by the 2008 recession it was stated by laliberté that the project has been put on ice12 for the time being and may be looking for another financial partner to bankroll the companys future plans even willing to give up another 10 of his share12 several more shows are in development around the world along with a television deal womens clothing line and the possible venture into other mediums such as spas restaurants and nightclubs13 cirque du soleil also produces a small number of private and corporate events each year past clients have been the royal family of dubai and the 2007 super bowl14 the companys creations have received numerous prizes and distinctions including a bambi award in 1997 a rose dor in 1989 three drama desk awards in 1991 1998 and 2013 three gemini awards four primetime emmy awards1516 and a star on the hollywood walk of fame17 in 2000 cirque du soleil was awarded the national arts centre award a companion award of the

laliberté quit college and left home he toured europe as a folk musician and busker by the time he returned home to canada in 1979 he had learned the art of fire breathing although he became employed at a hydroelectric power plant in james bay his job ended after only three days due to a labour strike he decided not to look for another job instead supporting himself on his unemployment insurance he helped organize a summer fair in baiesaintpaul with the help of a pair of friends named daniel gauthier and gilles stecroix710 gauthier and stecroix were managing a youth hostel for performing artists named le balcon vert at that time by the summer of 1979 stecroix had been developing the idea of turning the balcon vert and the talented performers who lived there into an organized performing troupe as part of a publicity stunt to convince the quebec government to help fund his production stecroix walked the 56 miles 90 km from baiesaintpaul to quebec city on stilts the ploy worked giving the three men the money to create les échassiers de baiesaintpaul employing many of the people who would later make up cirque du soleil les échassiers toured quebec during the summer of 19802223 although well received by audiences and critics alike les échassiers was a financial failure laliberté spent that winter in hawaii plying his trade while stecroix stayed in quebec to set up a nonprofit holding company named the highheeled club to mitigate the losses of the previous summer in 1981 they met with better results by that fall les échassiers de baiesaintpaul had broken even the success inspired laliberté and stecroix to organize a summer fair in their hometown of baiesaintpaul22 this touring festival called la fête foraine first took place in july 1982 la fête foraine featured workshops to teach the circus arts to the public after which those who participated could take part in a performance ironically the festival was barred from its own hosting town after complaints from local citizens24 laliberté managed and produced the fair over the next couple of years nurturing it into a moderate financial success but it was in 1983 that the government of quebec gave him a 15 million grant to host a production the following year as part of quebecs 450th anniversary celebration of the french explorer jacques cartiers discovery of canada laliberté named his creation le grand tour du cirque du soleil725 showsedit the duration of each touring show was traditionally split into two acts of an hour each separated by a 30minute interval however as of 2014 due to cost cutting issues the shows have now been reduced to a shorter 55minute first act followed by a 50minute second act still including a 30minute intervalcitation needed permanent shows are usually 90 minutes in length without any intermission this excludes joyà the permanent show in riviera maya mexico which is only 70 minutes in length typically touring shows as well as resident shows perform a standard 10 shows a week touring shows usually have one dark day with no performances while resident shows have two le grand tour du cirque du soleiledit on stage at the 1993 finale of nouvelle expérience originally intended to only be a oneyear project cirque du soleil was scheduled to perform in 11 towns in quebec over the course of 13 weeks running concurrent with the third la fête foraine the first shows were riddled with difficulty starting with the collapse of the big top after the increased weight of rainwater caused the central mast to snap working with a borrowed tent laliberté then had to contend with difficulties with the european performers they were so unhappy with the quebec circuss inexperience that they had at one point sent a letter to the media complaining about how they were being treated7 the problems were only transient however and by the time 1984 had come to a close le grand tour du cirque du soleil was a success having only 60000 left in the bank laliberté went back to the canadian government to secure funding for a second year while the canadian federal government was enthusiastic the quebec provincial government was resistant to the idea it was not until quebecs premier rené lévesque intervened on their behalf that the provincial government relented7 the original big top tent that was used during the 1984 le grand tour du cirque du soleil tour can now be seen at carnivàle lune bleue a 1930sstyle carnival that is home to the cirque maroc acrobats26 la magie continueedit after securing funding from the canadian government for a second year laliberté took steps to renovate cirque du soleil from a group of street performers into a proper circus to accomplish this he hired the head of the national circus school guy caron as cirque du soleils artistic director the influences that laliberté and caron had in reshaping their circus were extensive they wanted strong emotional music that was played from beginning to end by musicians they wanted to emulate the moscow circus method of having the acts tell a story performers rather than a technical crew move equipment and props on and off stage so that it did not disrupt the momentum of the storyline most importantly their vision was to create a circus with neither a ring nor animals the rationale was that the lack of both of these things draws the audience more into the performance727 to help design the next major show laliberté and caron hired franco dragone another instructor from the national circus school who had been working in belgium when he joined the troupe in 1985 he brought with him his experience in commedia dellarte techniques which he imparted to the performers although his experience would be limited in the next show due to budget restraints he would go on to direct every show up to but not including dralion7 by 1986 the company was once again in serious financial trouble during 1985 they had taken the show outside quebec to a lukewarm response in toronto they performed in front of a 25 capacity crowd after not having enough money to properly market the show gilles stecroix dressed in a monkey suit walked through downtown toronto as a desperate publicity stunt a later stop in niagara falls turned out to be equally problematic several factors prevented the company from going bankrupt that year the desjardins group which was cirque du soleils financial institution at the time covered about 200000 of bad checks also a financier named daniel lamarre who worked for one of the largest public relations firms in quebec represented the company for free knowing that they didnt have the money to pay his fee the quebec government itself also came through again granting laliberté enough money to stay solvent for another year7 le cirque réinventéedit in 1987 after laliberté reprivatized cirque du soleil it was invited to perform at the los angeles arts festival although they continued to be plagued by financial difficulties normand latourelle took the gamble and went to los angeles despite only having enough money to make a oneway trip had the show been a failure the company would not have had enough money to get their performers and equipment back to montreal728 the festival turned out to be a huge success both critically and financially the show attracted the attention of entertainment executives including columbia pictures which met with laliberté and gauthier under the pretense of wanting to make a movie about cirque du soleil laliberté was unhappy with the deal claiming that it gave too many rights to columbia which was attempting to secure all rights to the production laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could be concluded and that experience stands out as a key reason why cirque du soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years until guy laliberte announced in april 2015 that he was selling his majority stake to a group headed by a us private equity firm and its chinese partners2930 in 1988 guy caron left the company due to artistic differences over what to do with the money generated by cirque du soleils first financially successful tour laliberté wanted to use it to expand and start a second show while caron wanted the money to be saved with a portion going back to the national circus school an agreement was never met and caron along with a large number of artists loyal to him departed this stalled plans that year to start a new touring show7 laliberté sought out gilles stecroix as replacement for the artistic director position stecroix who had been away from the company since 1985 agreed to return the company went through more internal troubles including a failed attempt to add normand latourelle as a third man to the partnership this triumvirate lasted only six months before internal disagreements prompted gauthier and laliberté to buy out latourelle by the end of 1989 cirque du soleil was once again in a deficit7 fascinationedit with saltimbanco finished and touring in the united states and canada cirque du soleil toured japan in the summer of 1992 at the behest of the fuji television network taking acts from nouvelle expérience and cirque réinventé they created a show for this tour titled fascination although fascination was never seen outside japan it represented the first time that cirque du soleil had produced a show that took place in an arena rather than a big top it was also the first that cirque du soleil performed outside of north america7 knie presents cirque du soleiledit also in 1992 cirque du soleil made its first collaboration with switzerlands circus knie in a production named knie presents cirque du soleil that toured for nine months from 20 march to 29 november 1992 through 60 cities in switzerland opening in rapperswil and closing in bellinzona the production merged circus knies animal acts with cirque du soleils acrobatic acts the stage resembled that of cirque du soleils previous shows la magie continue and le cirque reinventé but was modified to accommodate circus knies animals the show also featured acts seen previously in le cirque reinventé including the prologue
