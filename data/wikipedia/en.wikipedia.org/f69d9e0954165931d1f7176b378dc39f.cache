intelligence mi is intelligence displayed by machines in contrast with the natural intelligence ni displayed by humans and other animals in computer science ai research is defined as the study of intelligent agents any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal1 colloquially the term artificial intelligence is applied when a machine mimics cognitive functions that humans associate with other human minds such as learning and problem solving2 the scope of ai is disputed as machines become increasingly capable tasks considered as requiring intelligence are often removed from the definition a phenomenon known as the ai effect leading to the quip ai is whatever hasnt been done yet3 for instance optical character recognition is frequently excluded from artificial intelligence having become a routine technology4 capabilities generally classified as ai as of 2017update include successfully understanding human speech5 competing at a high level in strategic game systems such as chess and go6 autonomous cars intelligent routing in content delivery networks military simulations and interpreting complex data including images and videos artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism78 followed by disappointment and the loss of funding known as an ai winter910 followed by new approaches success and renewed funding11 for most of its history ai research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other12 the traditional problems or goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge planning learning natural language processing perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects13 general intelligence is among the fields longterm goals14 approaches include statistical methods computational intelligence and traditional symbolic ai many tools are used in ai including versions of search and mathematical optimization neural networks and methods based on statistics probability and economics the ai field draws upon computer science mathematics psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience artificial psychology and many others the field was founded on the claim that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it15 this raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with humanlike intelligence issues which have been explored by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity16 some people also consider ai a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly17 in the twentyfirst century ai techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power large amounts of data and theoretical understanding and ai techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science18 contents

links historyedit main articles history of artificial intelligence and timeline of artificial intelligence while thoughtcapable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity19 the idea of actually trying to build a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with ramon llull c 1300 ce with his calculus ratiocinator gottfried leibniz extended the concept of the calculating machine wilhelm schickard engineered the first one around 1623 intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers20 since the 19th century artificial beings are common in fiction as in mary shelleys frankenstein or karel čapeks rur rossums universal robots21 the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of mathematical logic led directly to alan turings theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction this insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the church–turing thesis22page needed along with concurrent discoveries in neurology information theory and cybernetics this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain23 the first work that is now generally recognized as ai was mccullouch and pitts 1943 formal design for turingcomplete artificial neurons20 the field of ai research was born at a workshop at dartmouth college in 195624 attendees allen newell cmu herbert simon cmu john mccarthy mit marvin minsky mit and arthur samuel ibm became the founders and leaders of ai research25 they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing26 computers were winning at the game checkers solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english27 by the middle of the 1960s research in the us was heavily funded by the department of defense28 and laboratories had been established around the world29 ais founders were optimistic about the future herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do marvin minsky agreed writing within a generation  the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved7 they failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks progress slowed and in 1974 in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill30 and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects both the us and british governments cut off exploratory research in ai the next few years would later be called an ai winter9 a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult in the early 1980s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems31 a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by 1985 the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the us and british governments to restore funding for academic research8 however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987 ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longerlasting hiatus began10 in the late 1990s and early 21st century ai began to be used for logistics data mining medical diagnosis and other areas18 the success was due to increasing computational power see moores law greater emphasis on solving specific problems new ties between ai and other fields and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards32 deep blue became the first computer chessplaying system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov on 11 may 199733 advanced statistical techniques loosely known as deep learning access to large amounts of data and faster computers enabled advances in machine learning and perception34 by the mid 2010s machine learning applications were used throughout the world11 in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibms question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin35 the kinect which provides a 3d body–motion interface for the xbox 360 and the xbox one use algorithms that emerged from lengthy ai research36 as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones37 in march 2016 alphago won 4 out of 5 games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer goplaying system to beat a professional go player without handicaps638 in the 2017 future of go summit alphago won a threegame match with ke jie39 who at the time continuously held the world no 1 ranking for two years4041 this marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of artificial intelligence as go is an extremely complex game more so than chess according to bloombergs jack clark 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence with the number of software projects that use ai within google increased from a sporadic usage in 2012 to more than 2700 projects clark also presents factual data indicating that error rates in image processing tasks have fallen significantly since 201142 he attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets other cited examples include microsofts development of a skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and facebooks system that can describe images to blind people42 goalsedit the overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention13 erik sandwell emphasizes planning and learning that is relevant and applicable to the given situation43 reasoning problem solvingedit early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions44 by the late 1980s and 1990s ai research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics45 for difficult problems algorithms can require enormous computational resources—most experience a combinatorial explosion the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical for problems of a certain size the search for more efficient problemsolving algorithms is a high priority46 human beings ordinarily use fast intuitive judgments rather than stepbystep deduction that early ai research was able to model47 ai has progressed using subsymbolic problem solving embodied agent approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning neural net research attempts to simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise to this skill statistical approaches to ai mimic the human ability to guess knowledge representationedit an ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts main articles knowledge representation and commonsense knowledge knowledge representation48 and knowledge engineering49 are central to ai research many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world among the things that ai needs to represent are objects properties categories and relations between objects50 situations events states and time51 causes and effects52 knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know53 and many other less well researched domains a representation of what exists is an ontology the set of objects relations concepts and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them the semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts roles and individuals and typically implemented as classes properties and individuals in the web ontology language54 the most general ontologies are called upper ontologies which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge55 by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain field of interest or area of concern such formal knowledge representations are suitable for contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery via automated reasoning inferring new statements based on explicitly stated knowledge etc video events are often represented as swrl rules which can be used among others to automatically generate subtitles for constrained videos56 among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are default reasoning and the qualification problem many of the things people know take the form of working assumptions for example if a bird comes up in conversation people typically picture an animal that is fist sized sings and flies none of these things are true about all birds john mccarthy identified this problem in 196957 as the qualification problem for any commonsense rule that ai researchers care to represent there tend to be a huge number of exceptions almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires ai research has explored a number of solutions to this problem58 the breadth of commonsense knowledge the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge eg cyc require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering—they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time59 a major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet and thus be able to add to its own ontologycitation needed the subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally for example a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed60 or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake61 these are nonconscious and subsymbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain62 knowledge like this informs supports and provides a context for symbolic conscious knowledge as with the related problem of subsymbolic reasoning it is hoped that situated ai computational intelligence or statistical ai will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge62 planningedit a hierarchical control system is a form of control system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy main article automated planning and scheduling intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them63 they need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the utility or value of available choices64 in classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions65 however if the agent is not the only actor then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty this calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment66 multiagent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence67 learningedit main article machine learning machine learning a fundamental concept of ai research since the fields inception68 is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience6970 unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression classification is used to determine what category something belongs in after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change in reinforcement learning71 the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space these three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of decision theory using concepts like utility the mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory72 within developmental robotics developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous selfexploration social interaction with human teachers and the use of guidance mechanisms active learning maturation motor synergies etc73747576 natural language processingedit a parse tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some formal grammar main article natural language processing natural language processing77 gives machines the ability to read and understand human language a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from humanwritten sources such as newswire texts some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval text mining question answering78 and machine translation79 a common method of processing and extracting meaning from natural language is through semantic indexing although these indexes require a large volume of user input it is expected that increases in processor speeds and decreases in data storage costs will result in greater efficiency perceptionedit main articles machine perception computer vision and speech recognition machine perception80 is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones tactile sensors sonar and others to deduce aspects of the world computer vision81 is the ability to analyze visual input a few selected subproblems are speech recognition82 facial recognition and object recognition83 motion and manipulationedit main article robotics the field of robotics84 is closely related to ai intelligence is required for robots to handle tasks such as object manipulation85 and navigation with subproblems such as localization mapping and motion planning these systems require that an agent is able to be spatially cognizant of its surroundings learn from and build a map of its environment figure out how to get from one point in space to another and execute that movement which often involves compliant motion a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object8687 social intelligenceedit main article affective computing kismet a robot with rudimentary social skills88 affective computing is the study and development of systems that can recognize interpret process and simulate human affects8990 it is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences psychology and cognitive science91 while the origins of the field may be traced as far back as the early philosophical inquiries into emotion92 the more modern branch of computer science originated with rosalind picards 1995 paper93 on affective computing9495 a motivation for the research is the ability to simulate empathy where the machine would be able to interpret human emotions and adapts its behavior to give an appropriate response to those emotions emotion and social skills96 are important to an intelligent agent for two reasons first being able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states allow an agent to make better decisions concepts such as game theory decision theory necessitate that an agent be able to detect and model human emotions second in an effort to facilitate human–computer interaction an intelligent machine may want to display emotions even if it does not experience those emotions itself to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction creativityedit main article computational creativity a subfield of ai addresses creativity both theoretically the philosophical psychological perspective and practically the specific implementation of systems that generate novel and useful outputs general intelligenceedit main articles artificial general intelligence and aicomplete many researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence combining all the skills mentioned above and even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas1497 a few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain may be required for such a project9899 many of the problems above also require that general intelligence be solved for example even specific straightforward tasks like machine translation require that a machine read and write in both languages nlp follow the authors argument reason know what is being talked about knowledge and faithfully reproduce the authors original intent social intelligence a problem like machine translation is considered aicomplete but all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach humanlevel machine performance approachesedit there is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides ai research researchers disagree about many issues100 a few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurology or is human biology as irrelevant to ai research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering101 can intelligent behavior be described using simple elegant principles such as logic or optimization or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems102 can intelligence be reproduced using highlevel symbols similar to words and ideas or does it require subsymbolic processing103 john haugeland who coined the term gofai good oldfashioned artificial intelligence also proposed that ai should more properly be referred to as synthetic intelligence104 a term which has since been adopted by some nongofai researchers105106 stuart shapiro divides ai research into three approaches which he calls computational psychology computational philosophy and computer science computational psychology is used to make computer programs that mimic human behavior107 computational philosophy is used to develop an adaptive freeflowing computer mind107 implementing computer science serves the goal of creating computers that can perform tasks that only people could previously accomplish107 together the humanesque behavior mind and actions make up artificial intelligence cybernetics and brain simulationedit main articles cybernetics and computational neuroscience in the 1940s and 1950s a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology information theory and cybernetics some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence such as w grey walters turtles and the johns hopkins beast many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the teleological society at princeton university and the ratio club in england23 by 1960 this approach was largely abandoned although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s symbolicedit main article symbolic ai when access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s ai research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation the research was centered in three institutions carnegie mellon university stanford and mit and each one developed its own style of research john haugeland named these approaches to ai good old fashioned ai or gofai108 during the 1960s symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating highlevel thinking in small demonstration programs approaches based on cybernetics or neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background109 researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field cognitive simulationedit economist herbert simon and allen newell studied human problemsolving skills and attempted to formalize them and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence as well as cognitive science operations research and management science their research team used the results of psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems this tradition centered at carnegie mellon university would eventually culminate in the development of the soar architecture in the middle 1980s110111 logicbasededit unlike newell and simon john mccarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving regardless of whether people used the same algorithms101 his laboratory at stanford sail focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems including knowledge representation planning and learning112 logic was also the focus of the work at the university of edinburgh and elsewhere in europe which led to the development of the programming language prolog and the science of logic programming113 antilogic or scruffyedit researchers at mit such as marvin minsky and seymour papert114 found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required adhoc solutions – they argued that there was no simple and general principle like logic that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior roger schank described their antilogic approaches as scruffy as opposed to the neat paradigms at cmu and stanford102 commonsense knowledge bases such as doug lenats cyc are an example of scruffy ai since they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time115 knowledgebasededit when computers with large memories became available around 1970 researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into ai applications116 this knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of expert systems introduced by edward feigenbaum the first truly successful form of ai software31 the knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple ai applications subsymbolicedit by the 1980s progress in symbolic ai seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition a number of researchers began to look into subsymbolic approaches to specific ai problems103 subsymbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge embodied intelligenceedit this includes embodied situated behaviorbased and nouvelle ai researchers from the related field of robotics such as rodney brooks rejected symbolic ai and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive117 their work revived the nonsymbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of control theory in ai this coincided with the development of the embodied mind thesis in the related field of cognitive science the idea that aspects of the body such as movement perception and visualization are required for higher intelligence computational intelligence and soft computingedit interest in neural networks and connectionism was revived by david rumelhart and others in the middle of 1980s118 neural networks are an example of soft computing they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty and where an approximate solution is often sufficient other soft computing approaches to ai include fuzzy systems evolutionary computation and many statistical tools the application of soft computing to ai is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of computational intelligence119 statisticaledit in the 1990s ai researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems these tools are truly scientific in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable and they have been responsible for many of ais recent successes the shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields like mathematics economics or operations research stuart russell and peter norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats32 critics argue that these techniques with few exceptions120 are too focused on particular problems and have failed to address the longterm goal of general intelligence121 there is an ongoing debate about the relevance and validity of statistical approaches in ai exemplified in part by exchanges between peter norvig and noam chomsky122123 integrating the approachesedit intelligent agent paradigm an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success the simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems more complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings such as firms the paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful without agreeing on one single approach an agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works – some agents are symbolic and logical some are subsymbolic neural networks and others may use new approaches the paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as decision theory and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents the intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s1 agent architectures and cognitive architectures researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multiagent system124 a system with both symbolic and subsymbolic components is a hybrid intelligent system and the study of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration a hierarchical control system provides a bridge between subsymbolic ai at its lowest reactive levels and traditional symbolic ai at its highest levels where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling125 rodney brooks subsumption architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system126 toolsedit in the course of 60 years of research ai has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science a few of the most general of these methods are discussed below search and optimizationedit main articles search algorithm mathematical optimization and evolutionary computation many problems in ai can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions127 reasoning can be reduced to performing a search for example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions where each step is the application of an inference rule128 planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis129 robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space85 many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization simple exhaustive searches130 are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes the solution for many problems is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal called pruning the search tree heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies131 heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size86 a very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s based on the mathematical theory of optimization for many problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing we begin the search at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we reach the top other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing beam search and random optimization132 evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search for example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses forms of evolutionary computation include swarm intelligence algorithms such as ant colony or particle swarm optimization133 and evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms gene expression programming and genetic programming134 logicedit main articles logic programming and automated reasoning logic135 is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well for example the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning136 and inductive logic programming is a method for learning137 several different forms of logic are used in ai research propositional or sentential logic138 is the logic of statements which can be true or false firstorder logic139 also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and their relations with each other fuzzy logic140 is a version of firstorder logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1 rather than simply true 1 or false 0 fuzzy systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems subjective logic141 models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzylogic a given binomial opinion satisfies belief disbelief uncertainty 1 within a beta distribution by this method ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence default logics nonmonotonic logics and circumscription58 are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as description logics50 situation calculus event calculus and fluent calculus for representing events and time51 causal calculus52 belief calculus142 and modal logics53 probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoningedit main articles bayesian network hidden markov model kalman filter particle filter decision theory and utility theory many problems in ai in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics143 bayesian networks144 are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm145 learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm146 planning using decision networks147 and perception using dynamic bayesian networks148 probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters148 a key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis149 and information value theory64 these tools include models such as markov decision processes150 dynamic decision networks148 game theory and mechanism design151 classifiers and statistical learning methodsedit main articles classifier mathematics statistical classification and machine learning the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if shiny then pick up controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many ai systems classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match they can be tuned according to examples making them very attractive for use in ai these examples are known as observations or patterns in supervised learning each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class a class can be seen as a decision that has to be made all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience152 a classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and machine learning approaches the most widely used classifiers are the neural network153 kernel methods such as the support vector machine154 knearest neighbor algorithm155 gaussian mixture model156 naive bayes classifier157 and decision tree158 the performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified there is no single classifier that works best on all given problems this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science159 neural networksedit main articles artificial neural network and connectionism a neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain neural networks are modeled after the neurons in the human brain where a trained algorithm determines an output response for input signals160 the study of nonlearning artificial neural networks153 began in the decade before the field of ai research was founded in the work of walter pitts and warren mccullouch frank rosenblatt invented the perceptron a learning network with a single layer similar to the old concept of linear regression early pioneers also include alexey grigorevich ivakhnenko teuvo kohonen stephen grossberg kunihiko fukushima christoph von der malsburg david willshaw shunichi amari bernard widrow john hopfield eduardo r caianiello and others the main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks where the signal passes in only one direction and recurrent neural networks which allow feedback and shortterm memories of previous input events among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons multilayer perceptrons and radial basis networks161 neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control for robotics or learning using such techniques as hebbian learning gmdh or competitive learning162 today neural networks are often trained by the backpropagation algorithm which had been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by seppo linnainmaa163164 and was introduced to neural networks by paul werbos165166167 hierarchical temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex168 deep feedforward neural networksedit main article deep learning deep learning in artificial neural networks with many layers has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing and others169170171 according to a survey172 the expression deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by rina dechter in 1986173 and gained traction after igor aizenberg and colleagues introduced it to artificial neural networks in 2000174 the first functional deep learning networks were published by alexey grigorevich ivakhnenko and v g lapa in 1965175page needed these networks are trained one layer at a time ivakhnenkos 1971 paper176 describes the learning of a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers already much deeper than many later networks in 2006 a publication by geoffrey hinton and ruslan salakhutdinov introduced another way of pretraining manylayered feedforward neural networks fnns one layer at a time treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted boltzmann machine then using supervised backpropagation for finetuning177 similar to shallow artificial neural networks deep neural networks can model complex nonlinear relationships over the last few years advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units and a very large output layer178 deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks cnns whose origins can be traced back to the neocognitron introduced by kunihiko fukushima in 1980179 in 1989 yann lecun and colleagues applied backpropagation to such an architecture in the early 2000s in an industrial application cnns already processed an estimated 10 to 20 of all the checks written in the us180 since 2011 fast implementations of cnns on gpus have won many visual pattern recognition competitions171 deep feedforward neural networks were used in conjunction with reinforcement learning by alphago google deepminds program that was the first to beat a professional human go player181 deep recurrent neural networksedit main article recurrent neural networks early on deep learning was also applied to sequence learning with recurrent neural networks rnns182 which are general computers and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs the depth of an rnn is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence171 rnns can be trained by gradient descent183184185 but suffer from the vanishing gradient problem169186 in 1992 it was shown that unsupervised pretraining of a stack of recurrent neural networks can speed up subsequent supervised learning of deep sequential problems187 numerous researchers now use variants of a deep learning recurrent nn called the long shortterm memory lstm network published by hochreiter schmidhuber in 1997188 lstm is often trained by connectionist temporal classification ctc189 at google microsoft and baidu this approach has revolutionised speech recognition190191192 for example in 2015 googles speech recognition experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49 through ctctrained lstm which is now available through google voice to billions of smartphone users193 google also used lstm to improve machine translation194 language modeling195 and multilingual language processing196 lstm combined with cnns also improved automatic image captioning197 and a plethora of other applications control theoryedit main article intelligent control control theory the grandchild of cybernetics has many important applications especially in robotics198 languagesedit main article list of programming languages for artificial intelligence ai researchers have developed several specialized languages for ai research including lisp199 prolog200 python201 and c202 evaluating progressedit main article progress in artificial intelligence in 1950 alan turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the turing test this procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested however it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail203 artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry handwriting recognition and gameplaying such tests have been termed subject matter expert turing tests smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an everincreasing number of positive results204 for example performance at draughts ie checkers is optimal205 performance at chess is highhuman and nearing superhuman see computer chess computers versus human and performance at many everyday tasks such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something is subhuman a quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from kolmogorov complexity and data compression206 two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers a derivative of the turing test is the completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart captcha as the name implies this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human in contrast to the standard turing test captcha is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine a computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test computers are unable to solve the problem so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test a common type of captcha is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer207 applicationsedit an automated online assistant providing customer service on a web page – one of many very primitive applications of artificial intelligence main article applications of artificial intelligence ai is relevant to any intellectual task208 modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here frequently when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence this phenomenon is described as the ai effect209 highprofile examples of ai include autonomous vehicles such as drones and selfdriving cars medical diagnosis creating art such as poetry proving mathematical theorems playing games such as chess or go search engines such as google search online assistants such as siri image recognition in photographs spam filtering prediction of judicial decisions210 and targeting online advertisements208211212 with social media sites overtaking tv as a source for news for young people and news organisations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution213 major publishers now use artificial intelligence ai technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic214 competitions and prizesedit main article competitions and prizes in artificial intelligence there are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence the main areas promoted are general machine intelligence conversational behavior datamining robotic cars robot soccer and games healthcareedit a patient side surgical arm of da vinci surgical system 3 artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors according to bloomberg technology microsoft has developed ai to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer215  there is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer in detail there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer this negatively affects the doctors because there are too many options to choose from making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called hanover its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient one project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting myeloid leukemia a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers216 another study is using artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple highrisk patients and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions217 according to cnn there was a recent study by surgeons at the childrens national medical center in washington which successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot the team supervised the robot while it performed softtissue surgery stitching together a pigs bowel during open surgery and doing so better than a human surgeon the team claimed218 ibm has created its own artificial intelligence computer the ibm watson which has beaten human intelligence at some levels watson not only won at the game show jeopardy against former champions219 but was declared a hero after successfully diagnosing a women who was suffering from leukemia220 automotiveedit advancements in ai have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of selfdriving vehicles as of 2016 there are over 30 companies utilizing ai into the creation of driverless cars a few companies involved with ai include tesla google and apple221 many components contribute to the functioning of selfdriving cars these vehicles incorporate systems such as braking lane changing collision prevention navigation and mapping together these systems as well as high performance computers are integrated into one complex vehicle222 recent developments in autonomous automobiles have made the innovation of selfdriving trucks possible though the they are still in the testing phase the uk government has passed legislation to begin testing of selfdriving truck platoons in 2018223 selfdriving truck platoons are a fleet of selfdriving trucks following the lead of one nonselfdriving truck so the truck platoons arent entirely autonomous yet meanwhile the daimler a german automobile corporation is testing the freightliner inspiration which is a semiautonomous truck that will only be used on the highway224 one main factor that influences the ability for a driverless automobiles to function is mapping in general the vehicle would be preprogrammed with a map of the area being driven this map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings however google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for preprogrammed maps and instead creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings225 some selfdriving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brakes so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions226 finance and economicsedit financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm flagging these for human investigation the use of ai in banking can be traced back to 1987 when security pacific national bank in usa setup a fraud prevention task force to counter the unauthorised use of debit cards programs like kasisto and moneystream are using ai in financial services banks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations maintain bookkeeping invest in stocks and manage properties ai can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place227 in august 2001 robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition228 ai has also reduced fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies229 the deployment of ai machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories 230 for example ai based buying and selling platforms have changed the law of supply and demand in that it is now possible to easily estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus individualized pricing furthermore ai machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus making markets more efficient while reducing the volume of trades furthermore ai in the markets limits the consequences of behavior in the markets again making markets more efficient other theories where ai has had impact include in rational choice rational expectations game theory lewis turning point portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking video gamesedit main article artificial intelligence video games artificial intelligence is used to generate intelligent behaviors primarily in nonplayer characters npcs often simulating humanlike intelligence231 platformsedit a platform or computing platform is defined as some sort of hardware architecture or software framework including application frameworks that allows software to run as rodney brooks pointed out many years ago232 it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the ai features of the platform but rather the actual platform itself that affects the ai that results ie there needs to be work in ai problems on realworld platforms rather than in isolation a wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of ai to develop ranging from expert systems such as cyc to deeplearning frameworks to robot platforms such as the roomba with open interface233 recent advances in deep artificial neural networks and distributed computing have led to a proliferation of software libraries including deeplearning4j tensorflow theano and torch collective ai is a platform architecture that combines individual ai into a collective entity in order to achieve global results from individual behaviors234235 with its collective structure developers can crowdsource information and extend the functionality of existing ai domains on the platform for their own use as well as continue to create and share new domains and capabilities for the wider community and greater good236 as developers continue to contribute the overall platform grows more intelligent and is able to perform more requests providing a scalable model for greater communal benefit235 organizations like soundhound inc and the harvard john a paulson school of engineering and applied sciences have used this collaborative ai model237235 education in aiedit a mckinsey global institute study found a shortage of 15 million highly trained data and ai professionals and managers238 and a number of private bootcamps have developed programs to meet that demand including free programs like the data incubator or paid programs like general assembly239 partnership on aiedit amazon google facebook ibm and microsoft have established a nonprofit partnership to formulate best practices on artificial intelligence technologies advance the publics understanding and to serve as a platform about artificial intelligence240 they stated this partnership on ai will conduct research organize discussions provide thought leadership consult with relevant third parties respond to questions from the public and media and create educational material that advance the understanding of ai technologies including machine perception learning and automated reasoning240 apple joined other tech companies as a founding member of the partnership on ai in january 2017 the corporate members will make financial and research contributions to the group while engaging with the scientific community to bring academics onto the board241235 philosophy and ethicsedit main articles philosophy of artificial intelligence and ethics of artificial intelligence there are three philosophical questions related to ai is artificial general intelligence possible can a machine solve any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence or are there hard limits to what a machine can accomplish are intelligent machines dangerous how can we ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically can a machine have a mind consciousness and mental states in exactly the same sense that human beings do can a machine be sentient and thus deserve certain rights can a machine intentionally cause harm the limits of artificial general intelligenceedit main articles philosophy of ai turing test physical symbol systems hypothesis dreyfus critique of ai the emperors new mind and ai effect can a machine be intelligent can it think alan turings polite convention we need not decide if a machine can think we need only decide if a machine can act as intelligently as a human being this approach to the philosophical problems associated with artificial intelligence forms the basis of the turing test203 the dartmouth proposal every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it this conjecture was printed in the proposal for the dartmouth conference of 1956 and represents the position of most working ai researchers242 newell and simons physical symbol system hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action newell and simon argue that intelligence consists of formal operations on symbols243 hubert dreyfus argued that on the contrary human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge see dreyfus critique of ai244245 gödelian arguments gödel himself246 john lucas in 1961 and roger penrose in a more detailed argument from 1989 onwards made highly technical arguments that human mathematicians can consistently see the truth of their own gödel statements and therefore have computational abilities beyond that of mechanical turing machines247 however the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that these gödelian arguments fail248249250 the artificial brain argument the brain can be simulated by machines and because brains are intelligent simulated brains must also be intelligent thus machines can be intelligent hans moravec ray kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original99 the ai effect machines are already intelligent but observers have failed to recognize it when deep blue beat garry kasparov in chess the machine was acting intelligently however onlookers commonly discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not real intelligence after all thus real intelligence is whatever intelligent behavior people can do that machines still cannot this is known as the ai effect ai is whatever hasnt been done yet potential risks and moral reasoningedit widespread use of artificial intelligence could have unintended consequences that are dangerous or undesirable scientists from the future of life institute among others described some shortterm research goals to be how ai influences the economy the laws and ethics that are involved with ai and how to minimize ai security risks in the longterm the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies251 machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions research in this area includes machine ethics artificial moral agents and the study of malevolent vs friendly ai existential riskedit main article existential risk from artificial general intelligence the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race once humans develop artificial intelligence it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an everincreasing rate humans who are limited by slow biological evolution couldnt compete and would be superseded — stephen hawking252 a common concern about the development of artificial intelligence is the potential threat it could pose to humanity this concern has recently gained attention after mentions by celebrities including stephen hawking bill gates253 and elon musk254 a group of prominent tech titans including peter thiel amazon web services and musk have committed 1billion to openai a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible ai development255 the opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanlycapable ai256 in his book superintelligence nick bostrom provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to mankind he argues that sufficiently intelligent ai if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down if this ais goals do not reflect humanitys one example is an ai told to compute as many digits of pi as possible it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down ultimately to better achieve its goal for this danger to be realized the hypothetical ai would have to overpower or outthink all of humanity which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching257258 other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence259 concern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some highprofile donations and investments in january 2015 elon musk donated ten million dollars to the future of life institute to fund research on understanding ai decision making the goal of the institute is to grow wisdom with which we manage the growing power of technology musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as google deepmind and vicarious to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence260 i think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there261262 development of militarized artificial intelligence is a related concern currently 50 countries are researching battlefield robots including the united states china russia and the united kingdom many people concerned about risk from superintelligent ai also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers263 devaluation of humanityedit main article computer power and human reason joseph weizenbaum wrote that ai applications cannot by definition successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of ai technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy264 was deeply misguided weizenbaum was also bothered that ai researchers and some philosophers were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program a position now known as computationalism to weizenbaum these points suggest that ai research devalues human life265 decrease in demand for human laboredit martin ford author of the lights in the tunnel automation accelerating technology and the economy of the future266 and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs ford predicts that many knowledgebased occupations—and in particular entry level jobs—will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems machine learning267 and other aienhanced applications aibased applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of lowwage offshore workers making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work268page needed artificial moral agentsedit this raises the issue of how ethically the machine should behave towards both humans and other ai agents this issue was addressed by wendell wallach in his book titled moral machines in which he introduced the concept of artificial moral agents ama269 for wallach amas have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as does humanity want computers making moral decisions270 and can robots really be moral271 for wallach the question is not centered on the issue of whether machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the constraints which society may place on the development of amas272 machine ethicsedit main article machine ethics the field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making273 the field was delineated in the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines in all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy necessitate this in contrast to computer hacking software property issues privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence further investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories advancing our thinking about ethics274 machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality computational ethics or computational morality a variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition machine ethics273 that stems from the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics274 malevolent and friendly aiedit main article friendly ai political scientist charles t rubin believes that ai can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent275 he argues that any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality which has evolved along with our particular biology which ais would not share hyperintelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop this topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization humans and planet earth physicist stephen hawking microsoft founder bill gates and spacex founder elon musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that ai could evolve to the point that humans could not control it with hawking theorizing that this could spell the end of the human race276 one proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent ai is friendly ai and will then be able to control subsequently developed ais some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place leading ai researcher rodney brooks writes i think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent ai anytime in the next few hundred years i think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of ai and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence277 machine consciousness sentience and mindedit main article artificial consciousness if an ai system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence will that system also be sentient – will it have a mind which has conscious experiences this question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness generally referred to as the hard problem of consciousness consciousnessedit main articles hard problem of consciousness and theory of mind this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it march 2016 computationalism and functionalismedit main articles computationalism and functionalism philosophy of mind computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind or the human brain or both is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing278 computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam strong ai hypothesisedit main article chinese room the philosophical position that john searle has named strong ai states the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds279 searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be280 robot rightsedit main article robot rights mary shelleys frankenstein considers a key issue in the ethics of artificial intelligence if a machine can be created that has intelligence could it also feel if it can feel does it have the same rights as a human the idea also appears in modern science fiction such as the film ai artificial intelligence in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel emotions this issue now known as robot rights is currently being considered by for example californias institute for the future although many critics believe that the discussion is premature281 some critics of transhumanism argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights282 the subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film plug pray283 superintelligenceedit main article superintelligence are there limits to how intelligent machines – or humanmachine hybrids – can be a superintelligence hyperintelligence or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind ‘’superintelligence’’ may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent97 technological singularityedit main articles technological singularity and moores law if research into strong ai produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to recursive selfimprovement284 the new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans science fiction writer vernor vinge named this scenario singularity285 technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control thus radically changing or even ending civilization because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable28597 ray kurzweil has used moores law which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029 and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045285 transhumanismedit main article transhumanism you awake one morning to find your brain has another lobe functioning invisible this auxiliary lobe answers your questions with information beyond the realm of your own memory suggests plausible courses of action and asks questions that help bring out relevant facts you quickly come to rely on the new lobe so much that you stop wondering how it works you just use it this is the dream of artificial intelligence — byte april 1985286 robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either287 this idea called transhumanism which has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger has been illustrated in fiction as well for example in the manga ghost in the shell and the sciencefiction series dune in the 1980s artist hajime sorayamas sexy robots series were painted and published in japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later the gynoids book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including george lucas and other creatives sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butlers darwin among the machines 1863 and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in 1998288 in fictionedit main article artificial intelligence in fiction thoughtcapable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity19 the implications of a constructed machine exhibiting artificial intelligence have been a persistent theme in science fiction since the twentieth century early stories typically revolved around intelligent robots the word robot itself was coined by karel čapek in his 1921 play rur the title standing for rossums universal robots later the sf writer isaac asimov developed the three laws of robotics which he subsequently explored in a long series of robot stories asimovs laws are often brought up during layman discussions of machine ethics289 while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity290 the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick tells a science fiction story about androids and humans clashing in a futuristic world elements of artificial intelligence include the empathy box mood organ and the androids themselves throughout the novel dick portrays the idea that human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence291 nowadays ai is firmly rooted in popular culture intelligent robots appear in innumerable works hal the murderous computer in charge of the spaceship in 2001 a space odyssey 1968 is an example of the common robotic rampage archetype in science fiction movies the terminator 1984 and the matrix 1999 provide additional widely familiar examples in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still 1951 and bishop from aliens 1986 are less prominent in popular culture292 see alsoedit abductive reasoning casebased reasoning commonsense reasoning emergent algorithm evolutionary computing glossary of artificial
