caused heated tensions within the republican party hayes had moved away from party patronage by offering government jobs to southern democrats instead of northern republicans1 his actions drew heavy criticism from those inside his party such as roscoe conkling of new york and james g blaine of maine hayes had known since the dispute over the 1876 election that he was unlikely to win in 1880 and had announced at his 1877 inauguration that he would not run for a second term2 without an incumbent president in the race the rival factions within the republican party the stalwarts and the halfbreeds eagerly anticipated the 1880 presidential election3 ulysses s grantedit a photograph of president grant during the 1870s at the close of grants two terms as president in 1877 the republicancontrolled congress suggested that grant not return to the white house for a third term4 grant did not seem to mind and even told his wife julia i do not want to be here in the white house another four years i do not think i could stand it4 after grant left the white house he and his wife decided to use their us85000 of savings to travel around the world5 a biographer from the new york herald john russell young traveled with the grants and documented their journey to exotic places around the world in a book later published called around the world with general grant6 young saw that grants popularity was soaring as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in tokyo and peking china7 after hayes fallingout with the republican party and a perceived desire on the part of the united states electorate for a strong man in the white house grant returned to the united states ahead of schedule in hopes of seeking a third term in office8 with the backing of the stalwarts and calls for a man of iron to replace the man of straw in the white house9 grant was confident that he would receive the republican nomination for the presidency roscoe conkling the leader of the stalwart faction formed a triumvirate with j donald cameron of pennsylvania and john a logan of illinois to lead the campaign for grants return to the white house1011 with a grant victory conkling and other stalwarts would have great influence in the white house3 grant knew he could count on the stalwart leaders to solidify their respective states in order to guarantee a grant victory conkling was so confident in grants nomination that he said nothing but an act of god could prevent grants nomination12 an aide to the expresident adam badeau commented that grant had become extremely anxious to receive the nomination and did not think that there was any chance of failure13 however close friends of grant saw that his public support was slipping john russell young took grant aside and told him that he would lose the election and should withdraw to avoid embarrassment14 young argued that grant was being heavily attacked by opponents who were against the concept of a presidential third term young also criticized the handling of the campaign and told grant that if he won the election he would be indebted to the triumvirate grant felt that his stalwart friends had been of great assistance in his election bid and they deserved political patronage in his administration15 grant nonetheless listened to youngs advice and wrote a letter to j donald cameron authorizing his name to be withdrawn from the nomination contest after consultation with his other stalwart backers15 upon hearing of his letter julia grant was insistent that her husband should not withdraw his name from the contest she said if general grant were not nominated then let it be so but he must not withdraw his name – no never13 young delivered the letter to the triumvirate in chicago on may 31 but no action was taken to remove grants name16 james g blaineedit blaine during the 1870s the other main contender for the republican nomination was james g blaine blaine a senator from maine who had also served in the united states house of representatives including holding the speaker of the house position from 1869 to 1875 was in the competition to prevent grants nomination17 four years earlier blaine had campaigned for the partys nomination in the weeks prior to the 1876 convention he was accused of committing fraudulent activities involving railroad stocks the specifics of blaines involvement were detailed in the mulligan letters18 blaine pleaded his own defense on the floor of the house of representatives and he read aloud selected edited portions of the letter that were not incriminating despite his attempt to clear his name blaine was tarnished by the scandal throughout the rest of his political career19 on the sunday before balloting was to begin in cincinnati ohio blaine collapsed at the steps of washington congregational church he was unconscious for two days and as a result he lost supporters who were doubtful over his health and whether he was capable of handling the presidency blaine was also ridiculed by opponents who accused him of faking illness to gain sympathy the new york sun headlined blaine feigns a faint19 on the first ballot of the 1876 convention blaine received 285 votes while his political enemy roscoe conkling was in second place with only 99 votes18 blaine and conkling had a longstanding political feud that started at a debate on the floor of the house of representatives in 186620 after six more ballots resulted in no consensus conkling switched his support to rutherford b hayes who ultimately beat blaine for the nomination18 after blaines failure in 1876 his supporters believed that he needed to be nominated at the 1880 convention in chicago if he was ever going to be president reasoning that if he tried for the nomination twice and failed he could not count on another opportunity as his campaign manager william e chandler put it “ he must be nominated at chicago in june or else forever give up any idea of gaining the chief magistry of the nation i think he owes it to himself and to his friends all over the country who are ready to sacrifice everything for his success to do all that is in his power to win at chicago21 ” despite the mulligan letters scandal blaine had succeeded remarkably in his 1880 campaign attracting nationwide support for his candidacy he argued for the gold standard support for big business a tariff to protect american jobholders civil rights for freed blacks and irish independence21 john shermanedit a photograph of john sherman taken while he was the united states secretary of the treasury john sherman was a longtime senator from ohio who also served the state in the house of representatives in the late 1850s and early 1860s as a senator sherman led the planning of the national banking system he also oversaw the national policy for the postcivil war banking system and helped restore the nations finances after the panic of 187322 under president hayes sherman served as the secretary of the treasury advocating for the gold standard and building up the countrys gold reserves shermans colleagues did not have much confidence in their presidential bid sherman was known as the ohio icicle for his uncharismatic personality which made him unappealing to voters22 his colleagues commented that in public sherman was not eloquent though a graceful speaker confining himself almost entirely to statements of fact23 in private he was reserved selfcontained a personality that many americans were not comfortable with as president sherman intended to continue his support for the gold standard prior to the start of the convention papers had predicted sherman to receive 110 votes in the balloting sherman felt that he still had a chance at the nomination once the grant vote broke apart after five or six ballots24 james garfieldedit garfield as brigadier general during the civil war james garfield came into chicago as a senatorelect from ohio who had represented the state in the united states house since 1863 in 1859 as a republican garfield was elected to the ohio senate25 the following year he was admitted to the ohio bar he served as state senator until 1861 when he enlisted in the union army at the start of the civil war garfield was assigned to command the 42nd ohio volunteer infantry and had the task of driving confederate forces out of eastern kentucky26 garfield later led an attack with a number of infantry regiments against a confederate cavalry at jennys creek on january 6 1862 the confederates retreated and for leading his men to victory garfield was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in march 186227 garfield later served under major general don carlos buell at the battle of shiloh and under thomas j wood at the siege of corinth garfields health deteriorated and he was sent to serve on a commission to investigate the conduct of union general fitz john porter in the spring of 1863 garfield returned to the field as chief of staff for william s rosecrans commander of the army of the cumberland28 after the disastrous chickamauga campaign in september 1863 rosecrans was relieved of his command garfield saved his own reputation by fighting bravely during the battles and he was subsequently promoted to the rank of major general29 garfields fame spread and william dennison engineered garfields 1863 election to congress23 as whitelaw reid commented garfield was the most able and prominent of the young politicians who entered the army at the outbreak of the war23 garfield did not want to leave the army so he personally visited president abraham lincoln for advice on the matter lincoln told garfield that he had more generals than he could handle and what he needed was political support23 garfield succeeded in gaining reelection for his house seat every two years in 1872 garfield faced charges for receiving 329 in tainted money from the crédit mobilier of america corruption scandal garfield repeatedly denied the charges and even hired william e chandler to defend him in front of the congressional investigators30 there was not much evidence against garfield so his political career was not significantly affected four years later when james g blaine moved from the house to the united states senate garfield became the republican floor leader of the house that year garfield served as a member of the electoral commission that awarded 20 hotly contested electoral votes to rutherford b hayes in his contest for the presidency against samuel j tilden31 prior to the 1880 republican national convention garfield had expressed that he was a blaine supporter it was not until john sherman entered the race that garfield switched sides and offered his support for the ohio icicle23 preconvention politicsedit senator roscoe conkling of new york in january caucuses were held in local districts to pick delegates the state conventions would then select a number of these delegates to represent the state at the national convention prior to the convention there was a great deal of machine politics conducted by the candidates john sherman utilized treasury department employees who owed their jobs to him to meet up at local caucuses across the south to guarantee loyal state delegations statelevel bosses like roscoe conkling used the state conventions to pick delegates that were politically allied to a particular candidate in the state delegateselection convention at utica new york grants supporters carried only a 217–180 majority over blaine supporters but conkling passed a resolution declaring that the republicans of new york believe the reelection of ulysses s grant as presidential candidate of urgent importance and the delegates this day assembled are called upon and instructed to use their earnest and united efforts to secure his nomination32 conkling commanded delegates to follow the resolution and if they were to violate it he guaranteed they would be victims of political revenge and personal dishonor32 however in chicago there were a number of new york delegates who went against the resolution and publicly expressed their support for blaine j donald cameron used similar tactics to intimidate dissenters in the pennsylvania state convention the third member of the triumvirate john a logan literally locked out blaine supporters from the illinois state convention and replaced them with personally chosen grant supporters32 by may 29 four days before the opening of the convention trainloads upon trainloads of delegates lobbyists reporters and campaign followers had arrived at the union and dearborn railway stations in chicago33 candidate supporters channeled through the chicago streets with daily parades and rallies preconvention possible outcomes of the voting were published by a number of sources one from the albany evening journal predicted blaine with 277 votes grant with 317 sherman with 106 and 49 for the other candidates34 all of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of the 379 needed to win many in chicago knew that a victor most probably grant would only be determined if the unit rule which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for the candidate preferred by that states delegation was to be in effect if that was not the case then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to the other34 before any voting began the delegates had to vote on the important matter of the unit rule prior to the start of the convention james garfield noted i regard it the unit rule as being more important than even the choice of a candidate35 if the rule was supported by a majority of the delegates then state party bosses like the members of the triumvirate would be able to solidify grants nomination bid if conkling and the other stalwart bosses had their way the nearly sixty dissenters from the states represented by the triumvirate would be silenced36 unfortunately for halfbreeds j donald cameron was chairman of the republican national committee cameron planned to exercise his power to adopt new rules for the convention and also suppress any dissenters of the unit rule37 his plan was leaked and within days almost all the delegates in chicago knew about it supporters of the sherman and blaine campaigns knew that they had to prevent cameron from exercising his power blaines forces agreed that they could only prevent cameron from imposing the unit rule by removing him as the chair of the republican national committee38 an 1880 political cartoon depicts senator conkling over a presidential puzzle consisting of some of the potential republican and democratic nominees as pieces of a sliding puzzle at 700 pm on may 31 j donald cameron convened the republican national committees last meeting before the opening of the convention of the fortysix men at the meeting cameron counted only sixteen allies the rest of the men were antigrant delegates who had decided to gang up on cameron39 colorado senator jerome b chaffee was the first to bring up the unit rule at the meeting chaffee handed cameron a handwritten motion that was orchestrated by william e chandler cameron expected this and knew he had to find some fault in chaffees motion40 cameron called chaffees motion out of order upon being questioned by chaffee cameron explained that the committee could only appoint a temporary chairman to the convention and could not vote on the unit rule issue which he said belonged to the rules committee cameron then used george cornelius gorham a california stalwart delegate who as secretary of the united states senate had become an expert on parliamentary procedure to justify his ruling40 one by one antigrant delegates unsuccessfully tried to appeal camerons motion gorham proclaimed that as committee chairman cameron could do as he saw fit41 marshall jewell a connecticut delegate and national committee member who had served in grants administration as postmaster general spoke up against camerons rulings cameron did not comment and then called for a brief recess after the recess he acknowledged a motion from william e chandler to elect george frisbie hoar a neutral senator and delegate from massachusetts as the conventions temporary chairman42 the committee voted 29–17 in favor of electing hoar as temporary chairman of the convention42 at midnight the committee was adjourned and the members agreed to continue the meeting the following morning news of camerons behavior had spread throughout town overnight his hardliner strategy had failed and conkling and other grant managers sought to control the situation before it became any worse43 the next morning conkling asked his trusted colleague chester a arthur to solve the problem arthur assessed the situation and drew up a compromise he met chandler and the rest of the antigrant cabal at the entrance of the committees suite arthur acknowledged that the grant men had rejected senator hoar as the temporary convention chairman the day before but said that the grant men might perhaps reconsider44 he proposed that the delegates decide on the unit rule in a free vote and in return don cameron would be restored as the chairman of the national committee45 after discussing for a number of minutes the two men came to an agreement arthur was confident that since chandler the leader of blaines campaign had accepted the deal then it would be agreed by the grant men45 chandler then discussed the compromise deal with the thirty antigrant committee members and also james garfield who had previously expressed his opposition to the unit rule 23 out of 30 antigrant men agreed to the terms and garfield commented that the proposition must be accepted in spirit of reconciliation45 the committee reconvened again on the afternoon of june 1 with j donald cameron sitting as the committee chairman arthur made a number of motions indicating that the grant men from new york and pennsylvania would support senator hoars appointment as the temporary chairman of the convention46 no one objected and the motions were accepted the meeting was then adjourned a reporter from the new york tribune later remarked that the grant followers had been saved from utter ruin by the excellent management of general arthur45 the conventionedit a view inside the interstate exposition building known as the glass palace during the convention james abram garfield center right is on the podium waiting to speak at noon on wednesday june 2 j donald cameron banged his gavel to commence the beginning of the seventh republican national convention as instructed cameron placed the nomination for senator hoar as the temporary convention chairman the nomination was passed unanimously later delegates john h roberts of illinois and christopher l magee of pennsylvania were made temporary convention secretaries senator eugene hale of maine submitted a resolution for a roll call in which the chairman of each delegation would announce the people from their delegation serving on the conventions three committees the committees were formed and the convention was adjourned at five minutes past three in the afternoon47 the convention reconvened at 1100 am on june 3 roscoe conkling submitted a motion for a recess but the motion was rejected another new york delegate henry r pierson from the committee on permanent organization submitted a proposal to make the temporary convention assignments permanent the motion was adopted and the convention took a fourhour recess until 500 pm after the recess a motion was made for the committee on rules to be directed to report but a substitute motion from george h sharpe of new york called for the committee on credentials to report the substitute motion was rejected by a vote of 406 to 318 and the original resolution was laid on the table at 730 pm the convention was adjourned until 1000 am the following morning47 the next morning conkling then submitted a resolution that bound every delegate in the hall to support the partys nominee conkling said that no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree48 a voice vote was called and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support however about a dozen or so delegates answered no conkling was shocked he asked who at a republican convention would vote no on such a resolution48 he then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the glass palace only three delegates all from west virginia voted no to the resolution and were showered with a storm of hisses49 conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three west virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention the west virginians revolted against conklings resolution and heavily criticized him for his motion49 james garfield who was sitting at the ohio delegation stood up and tried to settle the matter he stated that the convention would be making a big mistake if they approved conklings motion and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case garfield argued that the three west virginians should not be disenfranchised because they thought it was not the time to make such an expression about a candidate50 he stated that there never can be a conventionthat shall bind my vote against my will on any question whatever50 garfield had won the crowd over with his speech conkling did not particularly enjoy the situation he scribbled a note to garfield which read new york requests that ohios real candidate and dark horse come forwardrc51 afterwards the fight over credentials erupted into a freeforall after john a logan had barred antigrant delegates from the state convention earlier in the year they had decided to file credential reports39 at the meeting between arthur and chandler both men had agreed that the credentials issue could be discussed at the convention a chicago lawyer who supported grant emery storrs interrupted the legal argument over credentials by mocking the blaine campaigners51 his remarks set off a barrage of comments from both the blaine and grant sides the convention went out of control as people started shouting and jumping throughout the convention hall as garfield commented the convention seemed as if it could not be in america but in the sections of paris in the ecstasy of the revolution52 the fracas continued until 200 am when acting chairman green b raum the united states commissioner of internal revenue banged the gavel to end the demonstration52 presenting the nomineesedit on saturday night the alphabetical roll call of the states to present nominees was conducted the first candidate for the republican nomination emerged when the michigan delegation was in roll call james f joy the seventyyearold president of the michigan central railroad gave the speech nominating blaine joy was not a practiced public speaker and he stumbled and rushed through his nomination speech because we are all now impatient for the voting53 joy ended his speech by nominating james s blaine for the republican ticket promptly a number of delegates yelled back g g blaine you fool54 the delegates from the next state in the roll call minnesota nominated senator william windom as their favorite son candidate nine states later roscoe conkling of new york stepped up to the podium to present his nomination for ulysses s grant and when asked what state he hail from our sole reply shall be he hails from appomattox and its famous apple tree54a the crowd of 15000 responded by erupting in cheers conkling built up the crowds energy with his speech and then introduced his candidate by proclaiming new york is for ulysses s grant never defeated–never defeated in peace or in war his name is the most illustrious borne by living men55 he later spoke of grants loyalty to the american people and then scolded grants enemies who had brought up the third term issue conkling tried to show that grant was an honest person who had won the delegates without patronage and without emissaries without committees and without bureaus after conkling finished his speech boos and hisses came from blaine and sherman backers while applause was heard from stalwart supporters of grant after north carolinas roll call the ohio delegation brought out james garfield to give the nomination speech for john sherman56 garfield had not actually written a speech and was nervous about speaking in front of such a large crowd before heading to chicago sherman told garfield that garfields speech should stress shermans courageous persistence in any course he had adopted57 garfield started his speech by emphasizing his overwhelming pride for his role in the convention garfield then listed the qualities that a president should possess and stressed the importance of party unity it wasnt until near his conclusion that he mentioned sherman by name58 many reports of garfields speech describe it as enthusiastic eloquent and well received some accounts indicate that it was so wellreceived that it caused delegates to begin thinking of garfield as a contender for the presidential nomination59 on the other hand some members of the sherman campaign were disappointed by garfields speech one telegram from a sherman backer sent to sherman himself claimed that garfield has been of no service to youhe was extremely lukewarm in his support59 rumors began to spread that ohio governor charles foster and garfield who were in adjoining suites at the grand pacific hotel were conspiring to bring garfield out as a candidate60 news of the fingerpointing within the sherman camp had carried into newspapers across the country the albany evening journal reported that there is a general belief that the ohio delegation is ready to desert sherman and go over to blaine in a body60 although he had become popular with the delegates after his speech garfield was upset over the accusations of those inside the sherman group and he worried how they would affect him in the future60 his close colleagues felt he was becoming too popular too quickly friends like lorenzo coffin felt that his time is not yet61 garfield heeded the advice of his friends to lower his profile at the convention but he had already made a deep impression on the delegates late sunday night on june 6 indiana senator benjamin harrison grandson of former president william henry harrison came to garfields hotel suite and asked him under what conditions he would accept the nomination61 garfield replied that he had come to the convention for the sole purpose of supporting john sherman and told harrison that garfields name must not be used in the nomination62 ballotingedit at ten oclock on monday morning convention chairman hoar banged his gavel to open the convention eugene hale moved to immediately proceed to the presidential nominee balloting and roscoe conkling seconded the motion newspapers had predicted the results of the balloting and the delegates knew that it would take a number of ballots before a victor could be found the first surprise during the balloting roll call came when john a logan of illinois announced that of his states fortytwo delegates only twentyfour were in support of grant this was not as solid as logan had previously advertised to the rest of the grant backers63 new york faced a similar situation of its seventy delegates fiftyone supported grant seventeen were for blaine and the remaining two supported sherman64 pennsylvania fared even worse as only thirtytwo of the states fiftyeight delegates put in their support for grant after all the states were polled the results were tabulated grant received 304 votes blaine had 284 sherman had 93 vermont senator george f edmunds received 34 elihu b washburne who had served as the united states ambassador to france under president grant had 30 and minnesota senator william windom received 10 of the states represented by the triumvirate sixty delegates did not support grant none of the candidates were close to the 379 needed to secure the nomination so the balloting continued throughout the day64 in washington dc both blaine and sherman were disappointed by their firstballot vote totals blaine had been told that he should expect around 300 firstballot votes but his actual total fell sixteen short and it was also one vote fewer than the total he received on the first ballot at the 1876 convention65 sherman was told to expect 110 votes which was significantly lower than the expected totals for blaine and grant however sherman felt his chance would come later when the grant vote split apart after sherman heard his firstballot vote totals he grew visibly angry that some of them the votes were taken away from him before the ballot began65 he was upset that nine ohio delegates bolted from sherman and voted instead for his opponent james g blaine sherman blamed blaine for causing the delegates to bolt from ohio by methods of falsehood ridicule and treachery65 in galena illinois grant did not express any emotions after being told about the firstballot vote totals as one newsman reported the silent soldier was smoking his cigar with all his usual serenity66 grants wife julia expected a deadlock and suggested to her husband that he surprise the delegates in chicago with a visit grant thought this was unwise because it gave an appearance of bad luck and bad manners despite his wifes attempts to change his mind grant remained adamant66 meanwhile the delegates at the convention continued to cast ballots until a victor could be determined on the second ballot of the day a pennsylvania delegate named w a grier cast a vote for james garfield67 however the garfield support remained with that one delegates vote for most of the day the delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner after dinner they came back and cast ten more ballots68 still no candidate was close to the 379 votes needed to win after twelve hours of balloting massachusetts delegate william lovering moved to adjourn for the night a few grant delegates objected but the motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 30869 after twentyeight ballots grant had 307 votes blaine had 279 and sherman had 91 and the rest of the votes were split between favorite son candidates like william windom and george f edmunds67 suggestions for introducing a dark horse candidate began to take place members backing each candidate were equally determined to win the nomination but some felt that the deadlock could not be broken if new candidates were not introduced into the balloting70 backers for sherman and blaine met after the convention was adjourned chandler laid down his terms blaine had nearly 300 votes and could not simply withdraw as chandler explained even if mr blaine permits his column to be broken then iowa nebraska kansas nevada california oregon twelve votes in the territories will go to grantas would mr blaines southern votes70 both sides argued until two or three in the morning but no decision had been reached grant leaders had also met that night in roscoe conklings suite in the grand pacific hotel they discussed the imposing dangers of grants nomination bid such as the thirdterm resistors many speculated that grant was not going to receive the nomination the grant backers discussed the other two chief candidates and found them both to be unacceptable71 some of the men called for conkling himself as a substitute for grant they argued that with grant out of the race conkling would face little resistance for the republican nomination however conkling refused to accept the idea of being nominated for president he said even if i were to receive every other vote in the convention my own would still be lacking and that i would not give i am here as the agent of new york to support general grant to the end any man who would forsake him under such conditions does not deserve to be elected and could not be elected71 the first ballot on tuesday morning june 8 saw two major breaks in the voting massachusetts switched their twentyone votes from senator george edmunds to john sherman spiking his total to 116 the highest thus far72 william chandler also convinced three minnesota delegates to switch their support from their favorite son candidate william windom to james g blaine by the thirtysecond ballot blaine had dropped six votes from the night before and grant had increased his total to 309 despite the relatively small changes in votes totals roscoe conkling confidently claimed that the members of the ny delegation assert that grant will be nominated before one oclock72 on the thirtythird ballot nine wisconsin delegates shifted their support from grant to elihu washburne on the next ballot sixteen of twenty wisconsin delegates changed their vote to james garfield73 garfield immediately called to chairman hoar to raise a question of order garfield challenged the correctness of the announcement claiming that without his consent he should not be receiving votes hoar dismissed garfields question claiming later that he denied garfield because he did not want to see a presidency be undone by a simple point of order meaning he did not want garfield to stop the momentum for his own candidacy74 after the ballot the vote totals for the major candidates stood at 312 for grant 275 for blaine 107 for sherman and 17 for garfield in the thirtyfifth ballot benjamin harrison of indiana announced that his state would shift all twentyseven of its votes mostly coming from the blaine column to garfield four maryland delegates and one delegate each from mississippi and north carolina also switched their vote to garfield bringing his total to 5074 blaine saw that his chances for winning the nomination were slipping commenting to a visitor trying to keep blaine in the race that it was not necessary to have wasted a card upon a falling market meaning that his guest had presented a calling card in order to see blaine for a meeting that would not be productive blaine felt that the most suitable candidate was james garfield garfield was a close friend and he felt that by supporting garfield he could defeat grant and conkling and possibly receive an appointment in garfields administration likewise sherman listened to advice from his colleagues and decided to shift all his support to garfield to save the republican party both candidates told their supporters to support garfields nomination75 on the thirtysixth ballot garfield won the republican nomination after receiving 399 votes 93 higher than grants total blaine finished with 42 washburne had 5 john sherman had 3 and the remaining were split amongst other minor candidates76 garfield was so overwhelmed with emotion after winning the nomination that an inter ocean reporter noted that he looked pale as death and seemed to be halfunconsciously to receive the congratulations of his friends77 the convention was in a mad frenzy as thousands of people chanted for garfield and later joined in the singing of the battle cry of freedom the grant followers like roscoe conkling looked on with glum faces and made no effort to conceal their disappointment78 conkling took great pride in the 306 delegates who had supported grant throughout the entire balloting with the grant supporters conkling formed a three hundred and six guard society the society held annual dinners and even drew up a commemorative coin with the
