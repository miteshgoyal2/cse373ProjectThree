personal life2 he was born in cleveland to parents of czech irish and german descent3 his mother mary vithous was born in cleveland to czech immigrants frank vithous františek vitous or vitouš and marie zakova marie žáková4 his father walter j widlar came from prominent german and irish american families whose ancestors settled in cleveland in the middle of the 19th century3 a selftaught radio engineer walter widlar worked for the wgar 1220 am radio station and designed pioneering ultra high frequency transmitters5 robert was born november 30 1937 the world of electronics surrounded him since birth one of his brothers became the first baby monitored by wireless radio3 guided by his father bob developed a strong interest in electronics in early childhood3 widlar graduated from saint ignatius high school in cleveland and enrolled at the university of colorado at boulder6 in february 1958 widlar joined the united states air force he instructed servicemen in electronic equipment and devices and authored his first book introduction to semiconductor devices 1960 a textbook that demonstrated his ability to simplify complex problems7 his liberal mind was a poor match for the military environment and in 1961 widlar left the service8 he joined the ball brothers research corporation in boulder to develop analog and digital equipment for nasa8 he simultaneously continued studies at the university of colorado and graduated with high grades in the summer of 19638 achievementsedit widlar invented the basic building blocks of linear ics including the widlar current source the widlar bandgap voltage reference9 and the widlar output stage10 from 1964 to 1970 widlar together with david talbert created the first massproduced operational amplifier ics μa702 μa709 the first integrated voltage regulator ics µa723 in fairchild launched in 1967not in citation given later lm100 for nationalnot in citation given the first operational amplifiers employing single capacitor frequency compensation lm101 an improved lm101 with fet internal current control lm101a and superbeta transistors lm10811 each of widlars circuits had at least one feature which was far ahead of the crowd2 and became a product champion in its class12 they made his employers fairchild semiconductor and national semiconductor the leaders in linear integrated circuits1314 already a legendary chip designer15 at the age of 33 widlar voluntarily retired into a hideout in mexico and became the valleys most celebrated dropout15 four years later he returned to national semiconductor as a contractor 16 and produced a series of advanced linear ics including the first ultralowvoltage operational amplifier with precision 200mv voltage reference lm101718 widlars eccentric and outspoken personality and his bohemian lifestyle made him the enfant terrible of silicon valley he is remembered in legends myths and anecdotes that are largely true1219 according to bo lojek author of history of semiconductor engineering he was more artist than an engineer in the environment where human relations departments define what engineers can and cannot comment about it is very unlikely that we will see his kind again2 arrival at fairchildedit further information history of the transistor traitorous eight and fairchild semiconductor work at ball research brought widlar in contact with jean hoerni and sheldon roberts the creators of radiation hardened transistors and cofounders of fairchild semiconductor8 widlar decided to move to a semiconductor manufacturing company and in 1963 jerry sanders a fairchild semiconductor salesman provided him the opportunity20 according to thomas lee fairchild also wanted to have widlar on board and breached professional ethics by recruiting a key employee of their customer21 in september 1963 widlar was invited for an interview with fairchild research and development rd manager heinz ruegg widlar arrived at the interview intoxicated22 and frankly told ruegg what he thought about fairchilds analog circuits what they are doing is bullshit23 widlar was sent to another interview with the companys applications engineering division which was based in mountain view california the division head john hulme hired widlar despite objections from the first round interviewers24 widlars first assignment at fairchild targeted ic reliability through adjustments in fabrication processes25 this early work directed by process engineer26 david talbert reduced the price of planar process and made possible development of monolithic fully integrated linear ics25 widlar who formally reported to john barrett proved himself capable of quickly improving barretts own designs and very soon squeezed his nominal boss out of the company27 in 1963 fairchilds analog ic lineup designed to military specifications consisted of three amplifier circuitsnote 1 fairchild engineers before widlar designed analog ics like conventional circuits built with discrete devices they had already realized the severe limitations of early planar process which made this approach impractical but had not proposed working alternatives active loads and active current sources had yet to be invented when the original schematic required resistor values that were too low or too high for planar processnote 2 the designers employed external nichrome thin film resistors the resulting hybrid ics performed poorly and were prohibitively expensive23 fairchilds rd chief gordon moore directed the company to favor digital integrated circuits which were relatively robust and promised high production volumes29 widlar opposed this strategy and held digital electronics in low esteem every idiot can count to one29 talbert shared widlars belief and became his closest ally in the company28 widlar was a hard person to work with but the few men and women who could like talbert and jack gifford30note 3 joined his inner circle for life32 widlar and talbert closely guarded their trade secrets and kept unwanted coworkers out of the loop27 gifford one of those accepted by widlar and talbert said that widlar would almost talk to nobody and he would only talk to me on you know if i could get him in the right mood and he was still secretive as hell26 talbert pushed widlars experimental orders through his plant at top speed saving his partner four weeks on every batch at the expense of other ordersnote 4 fairchild executive don valentine said in 2004 this was a phenomenal duo of highly eccentric — or whatever the word is beyond eccentric — individuals33 former fairchild photographer richard steinheimer said in 1995 talbert handling the fabrication and widlar handling the design they ruled the world and led the world in linear integrated circuits for a couple of decades34 μa702 and μa709edit further information operational amplifier widlar current source original drawing from the 1967 us patent widlar soon grasped the benefits and drawbacks of planar process it permitted matched performance of all components at all temperatures but these components possessed parasitic capacitance not present in discrete parts and the process ruled out the use of largevalue resistors and capacitors35 he summarised these design rules in a maxim do not attempt to match discrete components in integrated circuits design36 armed with this strategy and hungchang lins theory of compensated devices he designed the industrys first true linear integrated circuit36 and the first monolithic operational amplifier37 the μa702 widlar disposed with hybrid technology and used only diffused resistors formed within the silicon die38 each of the nine npn transistors was sized and shaped according to its function contrary to an earlier practice of employing standard minimalarea patterns39 widlar introduced three innovations interfacing a longtail with a singleended stage without losing half of the gain shifting the dc level using only npn transistors and optional frequency compensation with an external capacitor38 compensation increased bandwidth of the device to 2530 mhz an unprecedented breakthrough for monolithic amplifiers at that time40 widlar did not consider the μa702 prototype good enough for production but fairchild decided otherwise13 and rushed the chip into production in october 196430 the device set the direction for the industry for decades despite poor commonmode rejection ratio weak output drive capabilities and a price of 30041 according to jack gifford the top management of fairchild noticed the novelty and learned of widlars existence only after receiving enthusiastic feedback from the market26 the μa709 which followed the compromised μa702 became a technical and commercial success42 widlar increased the μa709s voltage gain tenfold over that of the μa702 70000 vs 7000 and improved output performance with a pushpull output stage although the output lacked protection against short circuit42 the input stage was governed by a widlar current source which allowed operation at low currents43 the transistors were equipped with betacompensation resistors to level the inevitable mismatch in their performance43 fairchild rd staff spoke against widlars decision to employ lateral pnp transistorsnote 5 widlar locked himself up for 170 hours of continuous experimental work and came out with a robust design that blended two resistive diffusion areas into a lateral pnp device44 the μa709 was introduced in november 196544 and became fairchilds revolutionary13 flagship product for a few years fairchild was the leader in the field of linear ics13 demand for its products exceeded its production capacity by a factor of ten fairchilds circuits were sold out for two years in advance44note 6 gifford one of the few men who fully understood widlar and his work contributed to the market boom by introducing a dual inline package31 according to don valentine at one point in time widlar and talbert were responsible — one designed them and one made them — for more than eighty percent of the linear circuits made and sold in the world33 none of fairchilds competitors came close to matching its status in the market44 fairchild patented widlars innovations but never licensed them and never enforced their rights in court47 competitors created clones of μa709 but only philco succeeded in producing one that fully matched the original47 national semiconductoredit further information national semiconductor widlar and talbert realized that the founders of fairchild did not intend to share their windfall profits with the designers in november 1965 the two engineers accepted peter spragues offer to join national semiconductors molectro facility in santa claranote 7 widlar received an immediate stock option of 20000 shares each valued at five dollars then49 he refused to fill an exit interview form for fairchild and wrote only one line exact quote i want to be rich 50 he told hulme that the only thing that could keep him with fairchild was one million tax free by whatever way you choose51 for unknown reasons robert noyce one of fairchilds founders continued to pay widlar his salary until april 1966 according to widlar maybe they did not believe that i was actually leaving some people are really a little slow51 gifford said that widlar and talbert were actually the founders of national semiconductor and that sporck joined them later26 the duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at santa clara once the technology was in place widlar concentrated on voltage regulators and by the end of 1966 produced the industrys first integrated linear regulator the lm100 a revolutionary new circuit52 became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity52 in 1967 widlar designed the lm101 an operational amplifier with improved gain decreased input current and protection against short circuit the lm101 featured another unorthodox input stage employing npn input transistors emitter coupled to pnp transistors in a common base arrangement52 the high reverse breakdown voltage of the pnp transistors allowed the lm101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 v its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μa70953 it was followed by lm101a a functionally identical ic that pioneered the use of a fieldeffect transistor to control internal current sources54 widlars solution minimized die area and current drain and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages54 later he devised another new device the superbeta transistor it was created in silicon by talbert and integrated in the lm108 precision operational amplifier which was released in 196955 these highgain verylowvoltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditionsnote 8 the items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly very useful and very profitable33 in the late 1960s widlar experimented with the band gap phenomenon and converted his basic current source block into a bandgap voltage reference57 widlars leap58 resulted in a robust and stable reference that was crucial for highcurrent heatintensive applications its low voltage of typically 125v also allowed more flexibility in discrete and integrated circuit design widlar created another industry first by combining a power transistor and a precise voltage reference on the same die59 this device the lm109 voltage regulator was released in 1969 and at first went unnoticed9 in 1971 national semiconductor released widlars lm113 the first dedicated twoterminal voltage reference ic9note 9 widlar and talbert were instrumental in the takeover of national semiconductor by former fairchild managers charles sporck and pierre lamond in february 1967 sporck and lamond turned national into a leading producer of electronic circuits and fairchild slipped into an irreversible decline61note 10 widlars popularity in the industry soared advertised as the man who designed more than half of the worlds linear circuits63 he frequently gave lectures to fellow engineers and on may 23 1970 spoke to an audience at madison square garden64note 11 regis mckenna former national semiconductor executive said in 1995 that most of the linear devices that were probably built and marketed for the period of the sixties and seventies were based on widlar and talberts technology i mean they created in many ways this industry they were the steve jobs and the bill gates and whatever fame you want to give to anybody they were famous people of those days and the journals you couldnt find a journal without their picture in it66 personalityedit national semiconductor advertising made according to widlars idea widlar lived the life of an alcoholicnote 12note 13 genius68 who went on allnightlong bar binges69 according to jack gifford widlar liked to harass and fight others when drunk but regularly overestimated his own abilities in such confrontations on one occasion he was absolutely clocked by the offended mike scott a future ceo of apple inc26 charles sporck retold another incident during a european roadshow widlar got drunk and publicly refused to speak to the audience unless he got more gin sporck said that we had no choice we had to get his glass filled up and then he went on with the lecture and he you know he got plastered but the interesting part of it is he was just so damn smart you know even drunk he could just wow these people70 according to fellow analog circuit designer bob pease widlar cut down on his drinking shortly before death19 gifford said in 2002 he stopped drinking but i think the damage was probably done you know in the first twenty years26 according to bo lojek as he was older he was for the first time able to keep relationship with one woman71 widlars eccentric behavior is remembered in legends and anecdotes which according to bob pease are largely true he did practice widlarizing – methodically destroying a faulty component or a flawed prototype with a sledgehammer19 at the same time he eradicated all unwanted sounds from his lab by fighting noise with noise he installed hassler devices that emitted highpitched sounds whenever someone talked too loud and even blew up an annoying public address speaker with firecrackers19 jim williams recalled an incident when after tracing external electromagnetic interference to the control tower of the san jose airport widlar telephoned the airport and demanded they shut down the transmitter72 however the story about widlar bringing a goat to trim the lawn in front of his office retold by the new york times after his death14 was incorrect19 it was a sheep not a goat73 widlar brought her in his mercedesbenz convertible for just one day which included a photo op for the local journalists19 according to pease widlar abandoned her in the nearest bar19 according to lojek the sheep was mysteriously stolen73 retirement and returnedit on december 21 1970 widlar and talbert resigned from national semiconductor when national semiconductor refused to reward them adequately73note 14 widlar cashed in his stock option for 1 million and retired to puerto vallarta mexico at the age of 337375 for four years he provided consultancy to the industry but had not been formally employed anywhere for more than three years76 his proud statement i dont work caused him frequent troubles when crossing the mexican border and eventually widlar created a set of fake business cards presenting him as a road agent for morgan associates76 in november 1974 widlar returned to national semiconductor as a consultant76 robert swanson chairman of linear technology77 said in 2006 i remember saying oh god i dont want to deal with this guy and i remember sporck saying ′ah youre a young guy you can do it you know you—you got enough energy to do it′ so basically he worked for the analog group sort of he—he worked with bob dobkin who was his original protégé and on a consulting basis he turned out you know some very nice chips for national but he was a consultant he wasnt an employee — robert swanson 78 richard hodgson said in 1995 widlar lived up in the hills behind the campus i think someplace for a while when he was working for national and did the outback designs for them and hed come back out of his cabin and whatever and go to work for charlie sporck for a while and then disappear back again either there or down in mexico as far i knew… — richard hodgson 79 some of widlars designs mentioned by swanson and hodgson like the lm12 power amplifier and the lm10 ultralowvoltage amplifier introduced in 1978 remain in production in the 21st century80 lm10 is capable of operating with a 11 volt power supply thus instead of a conventional bandgap reference it employs widlars subbandgap circuit locked at 200 mv81 and the lowvoltage widlar output stage10 for 10 years no one else in the industry was able to produce a circuit that matched the lm1082 the last decadeedit in 1981 swanson dobkin and widlar cofounded linear technology1468 swanson steered the company into producing secondsource parts for other companies68 three years later the relationships fell apart in a patent right dispute widlar claimed rights over linears lt1 to lt20 chips and in may 1984 walked away leaving the case to his lawyers in october 1984 swanson fired widlar after stealing his designs and invoked the mandatory share repurchase provision that was in widlars contract68 according to bo lojek widlars notebooks contain sufficient evidence to prove that many of the disputed patents were created by widlar before linear was formed68 widlar returned to national semiconductor for the remainder of his life14 he and dobkin never talked to each other after the breakup68 dobkin said in 2006 that bob was one of the few people i considered to be a genius he was also paranoid very hard to get along with and drank incessantly72 on february 27 1991 widlar died of a heart attack at the age of 53 in puerto vallarta14 david liddle said in 2009 that the untimely early death of robert widlar is a whole story in itself83 early reports incorrectly said that widlar died while jogging on a beach14 later sources corrected the mistake he was running up a hill84 bob pease wrote more precisely apparently he had been jogging on a sidewalk in a steep hilly section of puerta vallarta bob was in recent years pretty much into fitness and he worked hard at his running im no doctor but he did not die drunk which may have amazed a number of his colleagues19 jack gifford concurred he didnt die as a derelict he wasnt i mean he was fine he was coherent probably leading the most he was down in mexico living in mexico but he was sober and leading a reasonable life for him at that point when he died26 in 2002 electronic design inducted widlar in its hall of fame along with alan turing and nikola tesla85 in 2009 widlar was inducted in the national inventors hall of fame86 a sculpture dedicated to widlar and jean hoerni initially stood in front of the maxim integrated products building in sunnyvale california87 and was relocated in 2012 to maxims new headquarters in san jose california88 see alsoedit jack gifford — electronics engineer

squareshaped resistor formed in silicon by diffusion has a resistance of 100 to 200 ohm larger values require proportional increase in relative resistor length lower values require increase in resistor width thus large or lowvalue resistors invariably take up more space with a proportional increase in parasitic capacitance the practical resistor values available in 1963 were limited to the range of 300 to 1000 ohms resistors outside of this range carried a hefty price penalty lojek pp 264265 two people at fairchild semiconductor were teamed up with 26yearold widlar david talbert and jack gifford the 24yearold product manager he was one of the few people who understood widlar 31 the cycle time at mountain view line was approximately six weeks talbert pushed widlars lot in two weeks32 see steps of semiconductor fabrication for an overview of the production cycle early planar process allowed fabrication of npn transistors only thus ua702 and its peers employed only npn devices lowgain lateral transistors a byproduct of the same process were discarded by the designers as unstable the bulk of fairchilds μa709 output was purchased by bendix corporation45 fairchild produced early op amps on 15inch wafers and fabrication capacity was limited by 5000 devices a week46 molectro a formerly independent company established in 1962 as molecular science corporation had around 30 employees it produced sensors for the jet propulsion laboratory and pioneered the concept of applicationspecific integrated circuits in july 1965 molectro filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and was bought out by national48 input currents of lm108 were on par with contemporary jfet amps but the latter could not cope with full range of military temperatures56 national semiconductor calls lm113 a reference diode referring to its twoterminal packaging reference diode datasheet60 soon afterwards noyce and moore left fairchild to start intel corporation this triggered mass desertion of lowerranking personnel62 it was a series of public seminars organized by e floyd kvamme and don valentine of national semiconductors in new york city los angeles and paris65 george russell of commentary magazine called widlar an alcoholic genius while he was still alive67 jack gifford said in 2002 that both widlar and talbert were heavy drinkers26 two months earlier the company was listed on the american stock exchange and its share prices rose above 50 sporck and lamond exercised their stock options too but stayed with the company74 referencesedit bob widlar “widelar” lee 2007 see
