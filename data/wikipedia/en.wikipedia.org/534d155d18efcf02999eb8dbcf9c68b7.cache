prohibition party · independent american party im a bit mystified by the choice of entries the core principles seem to focus on social issues but have nothing about low taxes or support of businesses versus labor why jerry falwell and george w bush but not fulton sheen or eisenhower why include insignificant parties like america first party 2002 but not the better known america first party 1944 what criteria was used to select these entries   will beback  talk  2219 14 september 2011 utc core principles people were culled from conservatism in the united states parties was copied from 1 the template by no means a finished product why cant we use the eagle – lionel talk 0457 15 september 2011 utc it seems like a bunch of random links im guessing that the list of parties is supposed to represent active parties but since the rest of the template includes historical figures i think itd make more sense to include important past parties and leave off the current insignificant ones but i cant see any logic to the list of principles or people i dont see what informative purpose a blurry cartoon of an eagles head serves i dont think any particular image is associated with conservatism so lets just avoid complicating things   will beback  talk  0557 15 september 2011 utc also the timeline of conservatism does not seem to be focused on conservatism in the us if anyone ever does a special us version then thatd be relevant but i suggest removing the international timeline   will beback  talk  0714 15 september 2011 utc so again why do we have these particular people on the list the implication is that these are the most important figures in the history of conservatism in the united states are all republican presidents major figures otoh democrat woodrow wilson may have been more conservative in some respects than republican richard nixon has irving babbitt had more influence than rush limbaugh i think this list needs careful consideration id be inclined to stub it down to something much shorter pending a sensible list the alternative is to delete it   will beback  talk  0029 20 september 2011 utc reasoning behind selection of individuals quotes taken from conservatism in us article daniel webster giants of american conservatism calvin coolidge high tide of american conservatism irving babbitt conservative writing of the period includes democracy and leadership dwight eisenhower  russell kirk 2 sections in article barry goldwater conservatives united behind the unsuccessful 1964 presidential campaign irving kristol major founders of the movement jerry falwell preached traditional moral and religious social values ronald reagan solidified conservative republican strength george w bush brought a new generation of conservative activists to power in washington – lionel talk 0500 20 september 2011 utc the issue isnt whether these people have some connection to conservatism the issue is there are perhaps hundreds of people who have as much of a claim to importance as the listed ones are you really prepared to say that jerry falwell is one of the 12 most important figures in the history of american conservatism   will beback  talk  0616 20 september 2011 utc it might be easier to put together a solid template if we refocused on modern conservatism recent events from the time of coolidge on perhaps the minor local parties should really all go as linking to the prohibition party article the early 20th century party the bulk of that article refers to was hardly conservative nevard talk 1136 20 september 2011 utc consistent with that ill remove daniel webster ill also add the republican presidents since coolidge then we should consider which parties and principles to add   will beback  talk  0142 23 september 2011 utc elephant symboledit i have to question the use of the elephant symbol in this template its a partisan symbol the republican party which of course tends to be the more conservative major party especially recently but conservatism is not the same as being a republican there are conservative democrats there are liberal republicans and there are conservative independents and members of third parties many conservatives have serious disagreements with the gop this template links to 4 other political parties besides the republicans if an image is necessary in the template a assemblage of american conservative intellectuals such as russell kirk and william f buckley jr would be better —d monack talk 0149 16 march 2016 utc agreed the elephant has never been a general symbol of conservatism it is specifically a symbol of the republican party which does not embody all conservativism in the us ive removed it from the template kaldari talk 1754 17 october 2016 utc trump is not a conservativeedit donald trump is not considered a conservative by many mainstream pundits both whom are conservative and those who are not he may need to be removed 16118515151 talk 1927 15 may 2017 utc retrieved from
