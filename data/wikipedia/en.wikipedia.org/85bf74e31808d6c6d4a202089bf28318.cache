and builtin social networking services in the online space introduces a challenge of definition1 furthermore the idea that these services are defined by their ability to bring people together provides too broad a definition such a broad definition would suggest that the telegraph and telephone were social networking services – not the internet technologies scholars are intending to describe8 the terminology is also unclear with some referring to social networking services as social media3 attempting definitionedit a recent attempt1 at providing a clear definition reviewed the prominent literature in the area and identified four commonalities unique to current social networking services 1 social networking services are interactive web 20 internetbased applications12 2 usergenerated content ugc such as usersubmitted digital photos text posts tagging online comments and diarystyle web logs blogs is the lifeblood of the sns organism12 3 users create servicespecific profiles for the

tripodcom 1995 many of these early communities focused on bringing people together to interact with each other through chat rooms and encouraged users to share personal information and ideas via personal webpages by providing easytouse publishing tools and free or inexpensive webspace some communities – such as classmatescom – took a different approach by simply having people link to each other via email addresses planetall started in 1996 in the late 1990s user profiles became a central feature of social networking sites allowing users to compile lists of friends and search for other users with similar interests new social networking methods were developed by the end of the 1990s and many sites began to develop more advanced features for users to find and manage friends13 this newer generation of social networking sites began to flourish with the emergence of sixdegreescom in 199714 followed by makeoutclub in 20001516 hub culture and friendster in 200217 and soon became part of the internet mainstream however thanks to the nations high internet penetration rate the first mass social networking site was the south korean service cyworld launched as a blogbased site in

tools are increasingly the aim scholarly research scholars in many fields have begun to investigate the impact of social networking sites investigating how such sites may play into issues of identity privacy31 social capital youth culture and education32 research has also suggested that individuals add offline friends on facebook to maintain contact and often this blurs the lines between work and home lives33 according to a study in 2015 63 of the users of facebook or twitter in the usa consider these networks to be their main source of news with entertainment news being the most seen in the times of breaking news twitter users are more likely to stay invested in the story in some cases when the news story is more political users may be more likely to voice their opinion on a linked facebook story with a comment or like while twitter users will just follow the sites feed and or retweet the article34 a 2015 study shows that 85 of people aged 18 to 34 use social networking sites for their purchase decision making while over 65 of people aged 55 and over rely on word of mouth35 several websites are beginning to tap into the power of the social networking model for philanthropy such models provide a means for connecting otherwise fragmented industries and small organizations without the resources to reach a broader audience with interested users36 social networks are providing a different way for individuals to communicate digitally these communities of hypertexts allow for the sharing of information and ideas an old concept placed in a digital environment in 2011

feelings of loneliness in either a negative or positive way some companies with mobile workers have encouraged their workers to use social networking to feel connected educators are using it to keep connected with their students and individuals are benefiting from social networking to keep connect with already close relationships that theyve developed under circumstances that would otherwise make it difficult to do so39 each social networking user is able to create a community that centers around a personal identity they choose to create online40 in his book digital identities creating and

people complexifying the identity process for younger people and creating new forms of anxiety41 in 2016 news reports stated that excessive usage of sns sites may be associated with an increase in the rates of depression to almost triple the rate for nonsns users experts worldwidewhich have said that 2030 people who use sns more have higher levels of depression than those who use sns less42 featuresedit typical featuresedit according to boyd and ellisons 2007 article why youth heart social network sites the role of networked publics in teenage social life social networking sites share a variety of technical features that allow individuals to construct a publicsemipublic profile articulate a list of other users that they share a connection with and view their list of connections within the system the most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of friends who are also users of the site in an article entitled social network sites definition history and scholarship boyd and ellison adopt sundens 2003 description of profiles as unique pages where one can type oneself into being3 a profile is generated from answers to questions such as age location interests etc some sites allow users to upload pictures add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile others eg facebook allow users to enhance their profile by adding modules or applications3 many sites allow users to post blog entries search for others with similar interests and compile and share lists of contacts user profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users to protect user privacy social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their profile contact them add them to their list of contacts and so on additional featuresedit there is a trend towards more interoperability between social networks led by technologies such as openid and opensocial in most mobile communities mobile phone users can now create their own profiles make friends participate in chat rooms create chat rooms hold private conversations share photos and videos and share blogs by using their mobile phone some companies provide wireless services that allow their customers to build their own mobile community and brand it one of the most popular wireless services for social networking in north america and nepal is facebook mobile emerging trendsedit “ the things you share are things that make you look good things which you are happy to tie into your identity ” — hilary mason chief data scientist bitly venturebeat 201243 while the popularity of social networking consistently rises44 new uses for the technology are frequently being observed at the forefront of emerging trends in social networking sites is the concept of realtime web and locationbased realtime allows users to contribute contents which is then broadcast as it is being uploaded—the concept is analogous to live radio and television broadcasts twitter set the trend for realtime services wherein users can broadcast to the world what they are doing or what is on their minds within a 140character limit facebook followed suit with their live feed where users activities are streamed as soon as it happens while twitter focuses on words clixtr another realtime service focuses on group photo sharing wherein users can update their photo streams with photos while at an event facebook however remains the largest photo sharing site—facebook application and photo aggregator pixable estimates that facebook will have 100 billion photos by summer 201245 in april 2012 the imagebased social media network pinterest had become the third largest social network in the united states46 companies have begun to merge business technologies and solutions such as cloud computing with social networking concepts instead of connecting individuals based on social interest companies are developing interactive communities that connect individuals based on shared business needs or experiences many provide specialized networking tools and applications that can be accessed via their websites such as linkedin others companies such as monstercom have been steadily developing a more socialized feel to their career center sites to harness some of the power of social networking sites these more business related sites have their own nomenclature for the most part but the most common naming conventions are vocational networking sites or vocational media networks with the former more closely tied to individual networking relationships based on social networking principles foursquare gained popularity as it allowed for users to check into places that they are frequenting at that moment gowalla is another such service that functions in much the same way that foursquare does leveraging the gps in phones to create a locationbased user experience clixtr though in the realtime space is also a locationbased social networking site since events created by users are automatically geotagged and users can view events occurring nearby through the clixtr iphone app recently yelp announced its entrance into the locationbased social networking space through checkins with their mobile app whether or not this becomes detrimental to foursquare or gowalla is yet to be seen as it is still considered a new space in the internet technology industry47 one popular use for this new technology is social networking between businesses companies have found that social networking sites such as facebook and twitter are great ways to build their brand image according to jody nimetz author of marketing jive48 there are five major uses for businesses and social media to create brand awareness as an online reputation management tool for recruiting to learn about new technologies and competitors and as a lead generation tool to intercept potential prospects48 these companies are able to drive traffic to their own online sites while encouraging their consumers and clients to have discussions on how to improve or change products or services as of september 2013 71 of online adults use facebook 17 use instagram 21 use pinterest and 22 use linkedin49 niche networksedit in 2012 it was reported that in the past few years the niche social network has steadily grown in popularity thanks to better levels of user interaction and engagement in 2012 a survey by reuters and research firm ipsos50 found that one in three users were getting bored with facebook and in 2014 the globalwebindex found that this figured had risen to almost 50 the niche social network offers a specialized space thats designed to appeal to a very specific market with a clearly defined set of needs where once the streams of social minutia on networks such as facebook and twitter were the ultimate in online voyeurism now users are looking for connections community and shared experiences social networks that tap directly into specific activities hobbies tastes and lifestyles are seeing a consistent rise in popularity niche social networks such as fishbrain for fishing and strava for cycling these social platforms offer brands a rich space in which to engage with their target market and build awareness scienceedit one other use that is being discussed is the use of social networks in the science communities julia porter liebeskind et al have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge51 they state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another they are able to increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not be possible within a selfcontained hierarchical organization social networking is allowing scientific groups to expand their knowledge base and share ideas and without these new means of communicating their theories might become isolated and irrelevant researchers use social networks frequently to maintain and develop professional relationships52 they are interested in consolidating social ties and professional contact keeping in touch with friends and colleagues and seeing what their own contacts are doing this can be related to their need to keep updated on the activities and events of their friends and colleagues in order to establish collaborations on common fields of interest and knowledge sharing53 social networks are used also to communicate scientists research results54 and as a public communication tool and to connect people who share the same professional interests their benefits can vary according to the discipline55 the most interesting aspects of social networks for professional purposes are their potentialities in terms of dissemination of information and the ability to reach and multiply professional contacts exponentially social networks like academiaedu linkedin facebook and researchgate give the possibility to join professional groups and pages to share papers and results publicize events to discuss issues and create debates53 academiaedu is extensively used by researchers where they follow a combination of social networking and scholarly norms56 researchgate is also widely used by researchers especially to disseminate and discuss their publications57 where it seems to attract an audience that it wider than just other scientists58 educationedit the european southern observatory uses social networks to engage people in astronomical observations59 the advent of social networking platforms may also be impacting the ways in which learners engage with technology in general for a number of years prenskys 2001 dichotomy between digital natives and digital immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of the ease with which people of a certain age range—in particular those born before and after 1980—use technology prenskys theory has been largely disproved however and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as white and le cornus visitors and residents 2011 are greater currency the use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researchers according to livingstone and brake 2010 social networking sites like much else on the internet represent a moving target for researchers and policy makers60 pew research center project called pew internet did a usawide survey in 2009 and in 2010 february published that 47 of american adults use a social networking website61 same survey found that 73 of online teenagers use sns which is an increase from 65 in 2008 55 in 200661 recent studies have shown that social network services provide opportunities within professional education curriculum education and learning however there are constraints in this area researches especially in africa have disclosed that the use of social networks among students have been known to negatively affect their academic life this is buttressed by the fact that their use constitutes distractions as well as that the students tend to invest a good deal of time in the use of such technologies albayrak and yildirim 2015 examined the educational use of social networking sites they investigated students involvement in facebook as a course management system cms and the findings of their study support that facebook as a cms has the potential to increase student involvement in discussions and outofclass communication among instructors and students62 professional useedit professional use of social networking services refers to the employment of a network site to connect with other professionals within a given field of interest snss like linkedin a social networking website geared towards companies and industry professionals looking to make new business contacts or keep in touch with previous coworkers affiliates and clients not only does linkedin provide a professional social use but it also encourages people to inject their personality into their profile–making it more personal than a resume63 other network sites are now being used in this manner twitter has become a mainstay for professional development as well as promotion64 and online snss support both the maintenance of existing social ties and the formation of new connections much of the early research on online communities assume that individuals using these systems would be connecting with others outside their preexisting social group or location liberating them to form communities around shared interests as opposed to shared geography65 other researchers have suggested that the professional use of network sites produce social capital for individuals social capital allows a person to draw on resources from other members of the networks to which he or she belongs66 these resources can take the form of useful information personal relationships or the capacity to organize groups as well networks within these services also can be established or built by joining special interest groups that others have made or creating one and asking others to join67 curriculum useedit according to doering beach and obrien a future english curriculum needs to recognize a major shift in how adolescents are communicating with each other68 curriculum uses of social networking services also can include sharing curriculumrelated resources educators tap into usergenerated content to find and discuss curriculumrelated content for students responding to the popularity of social networking services among many students teachers are increasingly using social networks to supplement teaching and learning in traditional classroom environments as they can provide new opportunities for enriching existing curriculum through creative authentic and flexible nonlinear learning experiences69 some social networks such as english baby and livemocha are explicitly educationfocused and couple instructional content with an educational peer environment70 the new web 20 technologies built into most social networking services promote conferencing interaction creation research on a global scale enabling educators to share remix and repurpose curriculum resources in short social networking services can become research networks as well as learning networks71 learning useedit educators and advocates of new digital literacies are confident that social networking encourages the development of transferable technical and social skills of value in formal and informal learning60 in a formal learning environment goals or objectives are determined by an outside department or agency tweeting instant messaging or blogging enhances student involvement students who would not normally participate in class are more apt to partake through social network services networking allows participants the opportunity for justintime learning and higher levels of engagement72 the use of snss allow educators to enhance the prescribed curriculum when learning experiences are infused into a website students utilize everyday for fun students realize that learning can and should be a part of everyday lifecitation needed it does not have to be separate and unattached73 informal learning consists of the learner setting the goals and objectives it has been claimed that media no longer just influence human culture they are human culture74 with such a high number of users between the ages of 13–18 a number of skills are developed participants hone technical skills in choosing to navigate through social networking services this includes elementary items such as sending an instant message or updating a status the development of new media skills are paramount in helping youth navigate the digital world with confidence social networking services foster learning through what jenkins 2006 describes as a participatory culture75 a participatory culture consists of a space that allows engagement sharing mentoring and an opportunity for social interaction participants of social network services avail of this opportunity informal learning in the forms of participatory and social learning online is an excellent tool for teachers to sneak in material and ideas that students will identify with and therefore in a secondary manner students will learn skills that would normally be taught in a formal setting in the more interesting and engaging environment of social learning76 sites like twitter provide students with the opportunity to converse and collaborate with others in real time social networking services provide a virtual space for learners james gee 2004 suggests that affinity spaces instantiate participation collaboration distribution dispersion of expertise and relatedness77 registered users share and search for knowledge which contributes to informal learning constraintsedit in the past social networking services were viewed as a distraction and offered no educational benefit blocking these social networks was a form of protection for students against wasting time bullying and invasions of privacy in an educational setting facebook for example is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous timewasting distraction from schoolwork and it is not uncommon to be banned in junior high or high school computer labs73 cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with social networking services according to the uk children go online survey of 9 to 19yearolds it was found that a third have received bullying comments online78 to avoid this problem many school districtsboards have blocked access to social networking services such as facebook myspace and twitter within the school environment social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft schools have taken action to protect students from this it is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services opens the door to sexual predators cyberbullying and cyberstalking79 in contrast however 70 of social media using teens and 85 of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites61 recent research suggests that there has been a shift in blocking the use of social networking services in many cases the opposite is occurring as the potential of online networking services is being realized it has been suggested that if schools block them social networking services theyre preventing students from learning the skills they need80 banning social networking … is not only inappropriate but also borderline irresponsible when it comes to providing the best educational experiences for students81 schools and school districts have the option of educating safe media usage as well as incorporating digital media into the classroom experience thus preparing students for the literacy they will encounter in the future positive correlatesedit a cyberpsychology research study conducted by australian researchers demonstrated that a number of positive psychological outcomes are related to facebook use8283 these researchers established that people can derive a sense of social connectedness and belongingness in the online environment importantly this online social connectedness was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety and greater levels of subjective wellbeing these findings suggest that the nature of online social networking determines the outcomes of online social network use grassroots organizingedit social networks are being used by activists as a means of lowcost grassroots organizing extensive use of an array of social networking sites enabled organizers of the 2009 national equality march to mobilize an estimated 200000 participants to march on washington with a cost savings of up to 85 per participant over previous methods84 the august 2011 england riots were similarly considered to have escalated and been fuelled by this type of grassroots organization employmentedit a rise in social network use is being driven by college students using the services to network with professionals for internship and job opportunities many studies have been done on the effectiveness of networking online in a college setting and one notable one is by phipps arabie and yoram wind published in advances in social network analysis85 many schools have implemented online alumni directories which serve as makeshift social networks that current and former students can turn to for career advice however these alumni directories tend to suffer from an oversupply of adviceseekers and an undersupply of advice providers one new social networking service askapeer aims to solve this problem by enabling advice seekers to offer modest compensation to advisers for their time linkedin is also another great resource it helps alumni students and unemployed individuals look for work they are also able to connect with others professionally and network with companies in addition employers have been found to use social network sites to screen job candidates86 hosting serviceedit a social network hosting service is a web hosting service that specifically hosts the user creation of webbased social networking services alongside related applications trading networksedit a social trade network is a service that allows traders of financial derivatives such as contracts for difference or foreign exchange contracts to share their trading activity via trading profiles online there services are created by financial brokers business modeledit few social networks charge money for membership in part this may be because social networking is a relatively new service and the value of using them has not been firmly established in customers minds companies such as myspace and facebook sell online advertising on their site their business model is based upon large membership count and charging for membership would be counterproductive87 some believe that the deeper information that the sites have on each user will allow much better targeted advertising than any other site can currently provide88 in recent times apple has been critical of the google and facebook model in which users are defined as product and a commodity and their data being sold for marketing revenue89 social networks operate under an autonomous business model in which a social networks members serve dual roles as both the suppliers and the consumers of content this is in contrast to a traditional business model where the suppliers and consumers are distinct agents revenue is typically gained in the autonomous business model via advertisements but subscriptionbased revenue is possible when membership and content levels are sufficiently high90 social interactionedit people use social networking sites for meeting new friends finding old friends or locating people who have the same problems or interests they have called niche networking more and more relationships and friendships are being formed online and then carried to an offline setting psychologist and university of hamburg professor erich h witte says that relationships which start online are much more likely to succeed in this regard there are studies which predict tie strength among the friends91 on social networking websites witte has said that in less than 10 years online dating will be the predominant way for people to start a relationship92 one online dating site claims that 2 of all marriages begin at its site the equivalent of 236 marriages a day other sites claim one in five relationships begin online users do not necessarily share with others the content which is of most interest to them but rather that which projects a good impression of themselves43 while everyone agrees that social networking has had a significant impact on social interaction there remains a substantial disagreement as to whether the nature of this impact is completely positive a number of scholars have done research on the negative effects of internet communication as well these researchers have contended that this form of communication is an impoverished version of conventional facetoface social interactions and therefore produce negative outcomes such as loneliness and depression for users who rely on social networking entirely by engaging solely in online communication interactions between communities families and other social groups are weakened93 issuesedit spammingedit spamming on online social networks is quite prevalent a primary motivation to spam arises from the fact that a user advertising a brand would like others to see them and they typically publicize their brand over the social network detecting such spamming activity has been well studied by developing a semiautomated model to detect spams94 for instance text mining techniques are leveraged95 to detect regular activity of spamming which reduces the viewership and brings down the reputation or credibility of a public pages96 maintained over facebook in some online social networks like twitter users have evolved mechanisms to report spammers97 which has been studied and analyzed privacyedit privacy concerns with social networking services have been raised growing concerns among users on the dangers of giving out too much personal information and the threat of sexual predators users of these services also need to be aware of data theft or viruses however large services such as myspace and netlog often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidentscitation needed in addition there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies allowing a profile to be produced on an individuals behavior on which decisions detrimental to an individual may be taken furthermore there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may in fact be retained and passed to third parties this danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site quechup harvested email addresses from users email accounts for use in a spamming operation98 in medical and scientific research asking subjects for information about their behaviors is normally strictly scrutinized by institutional review boards for example to ensure that adolescents and their parents have informed consent it is not clear whether the same rules apply to researchers who collect data from social networking sites these sites often contain a great deal of data that is hard to obtain via traditional means even though the data are public republishing it in a research paper might be considered invasion of privacy99 privacy on social networking sites can be undermined by many factors for example users may disclose personal information sites may not take adequate steps to protect user privacy and third parties frequently use information posted on social networks for a variety of purposes for the net generation social networking sites have become the preferred forum for social interactions from posturing and role playing to simply sounding off however because such forums are relatively easy to access posted content can be reviewed by anyone with an interest in the users personal information100101102103104 the uk government has plans to monitor traffic on social networks105 as well schemes similar to email jamming have been proposed for networks such as twitter and facebook these would involve friending and following large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysis privacy concerns have been found to differ between users according to gender and personality women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them personality measures openness extraversion and conscientiousness were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data while neuroticism decreases the willingness to disclose personal information106 data miningedit through data mining companies are able to improve their sales and profitability with this data companies create customer profiles that contain customer demographics and online behavior a recent strategy has been the purchase and production of network analysis software this software is able to sort out through the influx of social networking data for any specific company107 facebook has been especially important to marketing strategists facebooks controversial social ads program gives companies access to the millions of profiles in order to tailor their ads to a facebook users own interests and hobbies however rather than sell actual user information facebook sells tracked social actions that is they track the websites a user uses outside of facebook through a program called facebook beacon108 notificationsedit there has been a trend for social networking sites to send out only positive notifications to users for example sites such as bebo facebook and myspace will not send notifications to users when they are removed from a persons friends list likewise bebo will send out a notification if a user is moved to the top of another users friends list but no notification is sent if they are moved down the list this allows users to purge undesirables from their list extremely easily and often without confrontation since a user will rarely notice if one person disappears from their friends list it also enforces the general positive atmosphere of the website without drawing attention to unpleasant happenings such as friends falling out rejection and failed relationships access to informationedit see also unauthorized access in online social networks many social networking services such as facebook provide the user with a choice of who can view their profile this is supposed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing their information109 parents who want to access their childs myspace or facebook account have become a big problem for teenagers who do not want their profile seen by their parents by making their profile private teens can select who may see their page allowing only people added as friends to view

whether or not companies should have the right to look at employees social network profiles in march 2012 facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employees profiles through their passwords118 according to facebook chief privacy officer for policy erin egan the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their

individuals depicted in the videos such actions are often referred to as trolling confrontations in the real world can also be transferred to the online worldcitation needed trolling can occur in many different forms such as but not limited to defacement of deceased persons tribute pages namecalling playing online pranks on individuals and making controversial or inflammatory comments with the intention to cause anger and cause arguments individuals troll for many reasons the psychology behind why people troll according to psychology today is due to anonymity perceived obscurity and a perceived lack of consequences for online misbehavior trolls may also do their activities due to a perceived majority status social identity salience and due to a sense by the troll that she or he is surrounded by online friends trolls may also engage in harmful acts due to desensitization or negative personality traits fox 2014138 as these eight reasons behind the thought processes of trolls suggest individuals thrive behind being able to create a false identity or pseudonym to hide behind and the premise that they have friends on social networks that agree with their outlook on certain topics thus join in on trolling the idea behind the perceived lack of consequences is because they believe they have created an identity in which they can not be seen as a real life human and more of a personaavatar that they have created which leads them to feel that they will not face the consequences of being an online troll trolling is a prominent issue in the 2010s an as the internet and

wanders williams 2012140 this highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals and they have to be aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions online bullyingedit online bullying also called cyberbullying is a relatively common occurrence and it can often result in emotional trauma for the victim depending on the networking outlet up to 39 of users admit to being cyberbullied141 in her article why youth heart social network sites danah boyd published in december 2007 a researcher of social networks quotes a teenager the teenager expresses frustration towards networking sites like myspace because it causes drama and too much emotional stress142 there are not many limitations as to what individuals can post when online individuals are given the power to post offensive remarks or pictures that could potentially cause a great amount of emotional pain for another individual interpersonal communicationedit words phrases and topics most highly distinguishing englishspeaking females and males in social media in 2013 journalsplosorg interpersonal communication has been a growing issue as more and more people have turned to social networking as a means of communication benniger 1987 describes how mass media has gradually replaced interpersonal communication as a socializing force further social networking sites have become popular sites for youth culture to explore themselves relationships and share cultural artifacts143 many teens and social networking users may be harming their interpersonal communication by using sites such as facebook and myspace stated by baroness greenfield an oxford university neuroscientist my fear is that these technologies are infantilizing the brain into the state of small children who are attracted by buzzing noises and bright lights who have a small attention span and who live for the moment144 the convenience that social network sites give users to communicate with one another can also damage their interpersonal communication sherry turkle the founder and director of the mit initiative on technology and self stated networked we are together but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we feel utterly alone and there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessedand only for the parts we find useful comforting or amusing145 furthermore social network sites can create insincere friendships turkle also noted they nurture friendships on socialnetworking sites and then wonder if they are among friends they become confused about companionship146 psychological effects of social networkingedit as social networking sites have risen in popularity over the past years people have been spending an excessive amount of time on the internet in general and social networking sites in specific this has led researchers to debate the establishment of internet addiction as an actual clinical disorder147 social networking can also affect the extent to which a person feels lonely in a newsweek article johannah cornblatt explains socialnetworking sites like facebook and myspace may provide people with a false sense of connection that ultimately increases loneliness in people who feel alone john t cacioppo a neuroscientist at the university of chicago claims that social networking can foster feelings of sensitivity to disconnection which can lead to loneliness148 fabio sabatini and francesco sarracino found that if an individual tends to a trust people and b have a significant number of facetoface interactions the individual is likely to assess their own wellbeing as relatively high the researchers found that online social networking plays a positive role in subjective wellbeing when the networking is used to facilitate physical interactions but networking activities that do not facilitate facetoface interactions tend to erode trust and this erosion can then negatively affect subjective wellbeing independent of the online social interaction itself sabatini and sarracino conclude that the overall effect of networking on individual welfare is significantly negative149 however some scholars have expressed that concerns about social networking are often exaggerated and poorly researched150 patentsedit number of us social network patent applications published per year and patents issued per year there has been rapid growth in the number of us patent applications that cover new technologies related to social networking the number of published applications has been growing rapidly since 2003 there are nowwhen over 3500 published applications as many as 7000 applications may be currently on file including those that havent been published yet151 only about 400 of these applications have issued as patents152 however due largely to the multiyear backlog in examination of business method patents and the difficulty in getting these patent applications allowed153 it has been reported that social networking patents are important for the establishment of new startup companies154 it has also been reported however that social networking patents inhibit innovation155 on june 15 2010 the united states patent and trademark office awarded amazoncom a patent for a social networking system based on its ownership of planetall156 the patent describes a social networking system as a networked computer system provides various services for assisting users in locating and establishing contact relationships with other users for example in one embodiment users can identify other users based on their affiliations with particular schools or other organizations the system also provides a mechanism for a user to selectively establish contact relationships or connections with other users and to grant permissions for such other users to view personal information of the user the system may also include features for enabling users to identify contacts of their respective contacts in addition the system may automatically notify users of personal information updates made by their respective contacts157 the patent has garnered attention due to its similarity to the popular social networking site facebook158 workers rightsedit what types of speech workers are protected from being fired for on social networking websites has been an issue for american companies with over 100 complaints as of 2011 on this topic having been made to the national labor relations board nlrb159 the national labor relations act protects workers from being fired for protected concerted activity which prevents workers from being fired for collective action while allowing companies the right to fire workers for individual actions they take against the company159 companies are concerned with the potential damage comments online can do to public image due to their visibility and accessibility but despite over 100 cases being presented thus far to nlrb only one has led to a formal ruling leaving uncertainty as to the boundaries of what types of speech the nlrb will ultimately protect or condemn159 decentralized architectureedit most of the existing sns sites use one or multiple dedicated data centers to serve all its users such infrastructurebased systems faces overprovisioning during nonpeak hours while may encounter service outage during peak hours due to the highly dynamic of sns users activities there are several proposals leveraging a decentralized architecture to ensure the scalability of sns sites with low infrastructure cost these proposals include fethr160 uaosn161 and cuckoo162 virtual identity suicideedit there is a growing number of social network users who decide to quit their user account by committing a socalled virtual identity suicide or web 20 suicide a 2013 study in the journal cyberpsychology behavior and social networking investigated this phenomenon from the perspective of facebook users the number one reason for these users was privacy concerns 48 being followed by a general dissatisfaction with the social networking website 14 negative aspects regarding social network friends 13 and the feeling of getting addicted to the social networking website 6 facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy more addicted to the internet and more conscientious163 breaking upedit sites such as facebook are becoming increasingly popular tools for methods of ending relationships and friendships proving that although new media is being used as a tool for connecting with individuals it is now creating new problems associated with disconnecting from others164 instead of the traditional phone call or facetoface interaction between individuals people are now starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status knowing full well that their significant other will see it shortly the problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship165 in a 2010 study conducted online nearly onequarter of the 1000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on facebook166 new media websites have made our private lives much more public especially when it comes to breaking up since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally for example having friends comment on your newly changed single relationship status and having to explain what happened can be distressing this creates further problems as it is even more crucial to save face after ones relationship has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies erving goffman argues that all social life boils down to facetoface interactions these interpersonal interactions are mediated by what goffman terms as facework which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with ones face and to uphold the expressive order of social situations individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others and in order to do so they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way167 such facework can also be seen in new technologies especially social media websites such as facebook if someone breaks up with you you can actively choose what face you want to present to your friends including your ex you can choose to either post sad updates which is the most natural thing you would want to do or you can save face by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world and from your ex by manipulating your profile new media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves enabling them to save face in difficult situations nearly 35 of respondents in a study admitted to using their facebook status to make someone think that they had plans even if they did not166 many people find that the only way to really move on from a past relationship is to cut the person out of their life completely social media has made this process much more complicated and difficult in a 2012 study 48 of the participants stated they had remained friends with their ex on facebook and of these people 88 stated they creeped their ex after the breakup many digital social networking sites leave behind a trail of a users interactions168 so deleting content may be an arduous process more difficult than simply burning or throwing away an entire box of letters photos and mementos169 additionally this content can still remain online social overloadedit the increasing number of messages and social relationships embedded in sns also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from sns users consequently sns users perceive they are giving too much social support to other sns friends this dark side of sns usage is called social overload170 it is caused by the extent of usage number of friends subjective social support norms and type of relationship onlineonly vs offline friends while age has only an indirect effect the psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of sns exhaustion low user satisfaction and high intentions to reduce or stop using sns170 social anxietyedit smart phones and social networking services enable us to stay connected continuously with people around us or far away from us which however is sometimes the root of our anxiety in social life the eager to know what everyone was saying and the tendency to see if anyone shared new things are typical symptoms of this anxiety called fomo there is a study that examined possible connections between fomo and social media engagement indicating that fomo was associated with lower need satisfaction mood and life satisfaction171 another type of social anxiety is the fobm fear of being missed172 it comes from the situation that we cant produce sharecontent for people to consume the fobm is a counterpart of fomo however compared to fomo it may have a more serious impact since the exclusion from the conversation can result in continuous exclusion later173 effects on personal relationships and social capitaledit the number of contacts on a social platform is sometimes considered an indicator of social capital however studies174175 show it is rather an indicator of low selfesteem and of a form of social compensation indeed people tend to add friends to compensate low selfesteem and there is a high correlation between the number of friends on social media platforms and feeling social anxiety leading to symptoms of major depression and dysthymia if we consider this aspect with regards to the relationships maintained through social media platforms we can easily point out a change in our understanding of friendship as a matter of fact online platforms and social media services altered the old definition of friendship indeed friendship redoubleth joys and cutteth griefs in halves as stated by francis bacon176 however nowadays we see that facebook friends for instance encourage negative feelings such as envy revenge and sadness when it comes to friendship we can wonder whether friendship on online platforms is a real form of friendship or it is just a sort of metaphor to compensate for social communication problems actually a lot of changes can be spotted in its old definition compared to the one in the era of social media friendship used to relate to the public sphere as explained in nicomachean ethics however nowadays friendship is rather exposed publicly on different social media platforms moreover a study177 shows that facebook users only know a bit more than two thirds of theirs friends on the platform meaning that they didnt know one third of the individuals in their friendlists this raises security and privacy issues and the project researchers alerted participants that they would better unfriend people they didnt recognize investigationsedit main article use of social network websites in investigations social networking services are increasingly being used in legal and criminal investigations information posted on sites such as myspace and facebook has been used by police forensic profiling probation and university officials to prosecute users of said sites in some situations content posted on myspace

destination for college students allows users to create profile pages with personal details these pages can be viewed by other registered users from the same school which often include resident assistants and campus police who have signed up for the service179 one uk police force has sifted pictures from facebook and arrested some people who had been photographed in a public place holding a weapon such as a knife having a weapon in a public place is illegal180 application domainsedit government applicationsedit banner in bangkok observed on the 30th of june 2014 during the 2014 thai coup détat informing the thai public that like or share activity on social media could land them in prison social networking is more recently being used by various government agencies social networking tools serve as a quick and easy way for the government to get the opinion of the public and to keep the public updated on their activity however this comes with a significant risk of abuse for example to cultivate a culture of fear such as that outlined in nineteen eightyfour or thx1138 the centers for disease control demonstrated the importance of vaccinations on the popular childrens site whyville and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has a virtual island on second life where people can explore underground caves or explore the effects of global warming181 likewise

service many social networks provide an online environment for people to communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes intentions can vary from looking for a one time date shortterm relationships and longterm relationships184 most of these social networks just like online dating services require users to give out certain pieces of information this usually includes a users age gender location interests and perhaps a picture releasing very personal information is usually discouraged for safety reasons185 this allows other users to search or be searched by some sort of criteria but at the same time people can maintain a degree of anonymity similar to most online dating services online dating sites are similar to social networks in the sense that users create profiles to meet and communicate with others but their activities on such sites are for the sole purpose of finding a person of interest to date social networks do not necessarily have to be for dating many users simply use it for keeping in touch with friends and colleagues186 however an important difference between social networks and online dating services is the fact that online dating sites usually require a fee where social networks are free187 this difference is one of the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead many popular online dating services such as matchcom yahoo personals and eharmonycom are seeing a decrease in users where social networks like myspace and facebook are experiencing an increase in users188 the number of internet users in the united states that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21 in 2003 to 10 in 2006189 whether it is the cost of the services the variety of users with different intentions or any other reason it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online educational applicationsedit the national school boards association reports that almost 60 of students who use social networking talk about education topics online and more than 50 talk specifically about schoolwork yet the vast majority of school districts have stringent rules against nearly all forms of social networking during the school day—even though students and parents report few problem

sparkpeople offers community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss fitocracy and quentiq are focused on exercise enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users social and political applicationsedit social networking sites have recently showed a value in social and political movements197 in the egyptian revolution facebook and twitter both played an allegedly pivotal role in keeping people connected to the revolt egyptian activists have credited social networking sites with providing a platform for planning protest and sharing news from tahrir square in real time by presenting a platform for thousands of people to instantaneously share videos of mainly events featuring brutality social networking can be a vital tool in revolutions198 on the flip side social networks enable government authorities to easily identify and repress protestors and dissidentscitation needed another thing that social media helps with in political applications is getting the younger generations involved in politics and ongoing political issues199 perhaps the most significant political application of social media is barack obamas election campaign in 2008 it was the first of its kind as it successfully incorporated social media into its campaign winning strategy evolving the way of political campaigns forever more in the everchanging technological world we find ourselves in today his campaign won by engaging everyday people and empowering volunteers donors and advocates through social networks text messaging email messaging and online videos200 obamas social media campaign was vast with his campaign boasting 5 million friends on over 15 social networking sites with over 3 million friends just on facebook201 another significant success of the campaign was online videos with nearly 2000 youtube videos being put online receiving over 80 million views201 in 2007 when obama first announced his candidacy there was no such thing as an iphone or twitter however a year later obama was sending out voting reminders to thousands of people through twitter showing just how fast social media moves obamas campaign was current and needed to be successful incorporating social media as social media acts best and is most effective in real time building up to the 2012 presidential election it was interesting to see how strong the influence of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns where obamas winning campaign had been social mediaheavy whereas mccains campaign did not really grasp social media jfk was the first president who really understood television and similarly obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media202 obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media to the advantage of presidential election campaigns in which obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space other political campaigns have followed on from obamas successful social media campaigns recognizing the power of social media and incorporating it as a key factor embedded within their political campaigns for example donald trumps presidential electoral campaign 2016 dan pfeiffer obamas former digital and social media guru commented that donald trump is way better at the internet than anyone else in the gop which is partly why he is winning203 research has shown that 66 of social media users actively engage in political activity online and like many other behaviors online activities translate into offline ones202 with research from the macarthur research network on youth and participatory politics stating that young people who are politically active online are double as likely to vote than those who are not politically active online202 therefore political applications of social networking sites are crucial particularly to engage with the youth who perhaps are the least educated in politics and the most in social networking sites social media is therefore a very effective way in which politicians can connect with a younger audience through their political campaigns crowdsourcing
