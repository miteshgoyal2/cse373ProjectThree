during the 19th century from the lower columbia river first to other areas in modern oregon and washington then british columbia and as far as alaska and yukon territory sometimes taking on characteristics of a creole language3 it is related to but not the same as the aboriginal language of the chinook people upon which much of its vocabulary is based4 many words from chinook jargon remain in common use in the western united states british columbia and the yukon in indigenous languages as well as regional english usage5 to the point where most people are unaware the word was originally from the jargoncitation needed the total number of jargon words in published lexicons numbered only in the hundreds and so it was easy to learn6 it has its own grammatical system but a very

overview and historyedit cover gills dictionary of the chinook jargon 13th edition 1891 photographed at log house museum seattle washington the jargon was originally constructed from a great variety of amerind words of the pacific northwest arising as an intraindigenous contact language in a region marked by divisive geography and intense linguistic diversity the participating peoples came from a number of very distinct language families speaking dozens of individual languages7 it peaked in usage from approximately 1858 to 1900 and declined as a result of the spanish flu world war i and residential schools8 after european contact the jargon also acquired english and french loans as well as words brought by other europeancitation needed asiancitation needed and polynesiancitation needed groups some individuals from all these groups soon adopted the jargon as a highly efficient and accessible form of communication this use continued in some business sectors well into the 20th century910 and some of its words continue to feature in company and organization names as well as in the regional toponymy in the diocese of kamloops british columbia hundreds of speakers also learned to read and write the jargon using duployan shorthand via the publication kamloops wawa as a result the jargon also had the beginnings of its own literature mostly translated scripture and classical works and some local and episcopal news community gossip and events and diaries7 novelist and early native american activist marah ellis ryan 18601934 used chinook words and phrases in her writing11 in oregon chinook jargon was widely used by natives trappers traders employees of the hudsons bay company missionaries and pioneers who came across the oregon trail from the 1830s1870s in portland’s first half century 1840s1890s there were frequent trade interactions between pioneers and native americans after about 1900 when such daily interactions were less frequent jargon was spoken among pioneer families to prove how early they arrived out west many oregonians used jargon in casual conversationto add humor whimsy or emphasis and to exhibit deep knowledge of oregon’s history though traditions of speaking jargon faded away among the nonnative population some of oregons tribal groups continued speaking chinook jargon though usage was diminished however a strong revival occurred with the confederated tribes of the grand ronde community of oregons 2012 chinuk wawa dictionary12 according to nard jones chinook jargon was still in use in seattle until roughly the eve of world war ii especially among the members of the arctic club making seattle the last city where the language was widely used writing in 1972 he remarked that at that later date only a few can speak it fully men of ninety or a hundred years old like henry broderick the realtor and joshua green the banker13 jones estimates that in pioneer timeswhen there were about 100000 speakers of chinook jargon14 nameedit most books written in english still use the term chinook jargon but some linguists working with the preservation of a creolized form of the language used in grand ronde oregon prefer the term chinuk wawa with the spelling chinuk instead of chinook historical speakers did not use the name chinook wawa however but rather the wawa or lelang from fr la langue the language or tonguecitation needed nb wawa also means speech or words – have a wawa means hold a parley even in idiomatic english today10 and lelang also means the physical bodypart the tongue15 the name for the jargon varied throughout the territory in which it was used for example skokum hiyu in the boston barlytton area of the fraser canyon or in many areas simply just the old trade language origins and evolutionedit this article

help settlers interact with the first nations people living there the old settler families heirs in the pacific northwest sent communiques to each other stylishly composed entirely in the chinook many residents of the british columbia city of vancouver spoke chinook jargon as their first language even using it at home in preference to english among the first europeans to use chinook jargon were traders trappers voyageurs coureurs des bois and catholic missionaries hawaiians and chinese in the region made much use of it as well in some places kanakas married into the first nations and nonnative families and their particular mode of the jargon is believed to have contained hawaiian words or hawaiian styles of pronunciation similarly the jargon as spoken by a chinese person or a norwegian or a scot will have been influenced by those individuals nativespeaker terms and accents in some areas the adoption of further nonaboriginal words has been observed the chinook jargon naturally became the first language in multiracial households and in multiethnic work environments such as canneries and lumberyards and ranches where it remained the language of the workplace well into the middle of the 20th century during the gold rush chinook jargon was used in british columbia by gold prospectors and royal engineers as industry developed chinook jargon was often used by cannery workers and hop pickers of diverse ethnic background loggers fishermen and ranchers incorporated it in their jargon a heavily creolized form of chinook jargon chinuk wawa is still spoken as a first language by some residents of oregon much as the métis language michif is spoken in canada hence chinuk wawa as it is known in oregon is now a creole language distinct from the widespread and widely varied pronunciation of the chinook jargon as it spread beyond the chinookan homeland there is evidence that in some communities eg around fort vancouver the jargon had become creolized by the early 19th century and that would have been among the mixed frenchmétis algonkian scots and hawaiian population there as well as among the natives around the fort at grand ronde the resettlement of tribes from all over oregon in a multitribal agency led to the use of chinuk wawa as a common tongue among the linguistically diverse population these circumstances led to the creolization of chinuk wawa at grand ronde16 there is also evidence that creolization occurred at the confederated tribes of siletz reservation paralleling grand ronde17 although due to language revitalization efforts being focused on the tolowa language chinuk fell out of use no studies of british columbia versions of the jargon have demonstrated creolization the range of varying usages and vocabulary in different regions suggests that localization did occur — although not on the pattern of grand ronde where wasco klickitat and other peoples adopted and added to the version of the jargon that developed there firstlanguage speakers of the chinook jargon were common in bc native and nonnative until the mid20th century it is a truism that while after 1850 the wawa was mostly a native language in the united states portion of the chinookspeaking world it remained in wide use among nonnatives north of the border for another century especially in wilderness areas and work environments10 local creolizations probably did occur in british columbia but recorded materials have not been studied as they were made due to the focus on the traditional aboriginal languagescitation needed manywho believe that something similar to the jargon existed before european contact — without european words in its vocabulary18 there is some evidence for a chinookannuuchahnulth lingua franca in the writings of john jewitt and in what is known as the barclay sound wordlist from the area of ucluelet and alberni otherswho believe that the jargon was formed in the great cultural cauldron of the time of contact and cannot be discussed separately from that context with an appreciation for the full range of the jargonspeaking community and its history7 current scholarly opinionwho holds that a trade language probably existed before european contact which began morphing into the more familiar chinook jargon in the late 1790s notably at a dinner party at nootka sound where capts vancouver and bodega y quadra were entertained by chief maquinna and his brother callicum performing a theatrical using mock english and mock spanish words and mimicry of european dress and mannerisms there evidently was a jargon in use in the queen charlotte but this haida jargon is not known to have shared anything in common with chinook jargon or with the nooktanchinookan protojargon which is its main foundation

chinook jargon were found in nearly every piece of historical source material before 1900 chinook jargon is relatively unknown to the rest of the population perhaps due to the great influx of newcomers into the influential urban areas however the memory of this language is not likely to fade entirely many words are still used and enjoyed throughout oregon washington british columbia and alaska oldtimers still dimly remember it although in their youth speaking this language was discouraged as slang nonetheless it was the working language in many towns and workplaces notably in

of the grand ronde community of oregon during termination of aboriginal peoples by the united states government speaking of the language was forbidden and as a result developed a decline of speakers
