and in japan three months later following the events of sonic the hedgehog 2 dr robotniks spaceship the death egg crashlands on a mysterious floating island there sonic and tails must once more retrieve the chaos emeralds to stop death egg from relaunching while making rounds with the islands guardian knuckles the echidna development of sonic 3 began shortly after the release of sonic 2 in late 1992 it was developed simultaneously with sonic knuckles the games were originally developed as a single title until time constraints and cartridge costs later forced the developers to split them in two projects the sonic knuckles cartridge features lockon technology that allows it to be physically attached to the sonic 3 cartridge creating a combined game sonic 3 knuckles a portion of the sonic 3 soundtrack was composed by american pop musician michael jackson who left the project before completion and went uncredited as with its two predecessors sonic 3 was a critical and commercial success with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments it sold over one million copies in the united states though this makes it one of the bestselling genesis games its predecessors bundled with the genesis in some regions had sold a combined 21Â million the game has been rereleased in compilations and download releases for various platforms including sonic mega collection for the gamecube and sonics ultimate genesis collection for the playstation 3 and xbox 360 contents 1 gameplay 11 sonic 3 knuckles 2 plot 3 development 31 michael jacksons involvement 4 alternate versions and ports 5 reception 6 legacy 7 notes 8 references 9 external links gameplayedit sonic and tails exploring the underwater portion of hydrocity the second zone sonic 3 is a 2d sidescrolling platformer at the start players can select sonic tails or both in the latter choice players control sonic while tails runs along beside him a second player can join in at any time and control tails separately1 sonic 3 adds the ability for tails to fly for a short time by spinning his twin tails like a propeller1 when he gets too tired he falls unlike sonic tails can also swim underwater2 the game takes place over six zones3 each divided into two acts levels are populated with robotniks robots called badniks sonic and tails can defeat badniks by jumping on them or using the spin dash attack which also gives the character a speed boost2 the levels include obstacles and other features such as vertical loops corkscrews breakable walls spikes water that the player can drown in and bottomless pits4 there is a miniboss fight with one of robotniks large powerful robots at the end of the first act of each level and a full boss fight with robotnik at the end of the second5 reaching a new level saves the game to one of six save slots6 as with previous sonic games sonic 3 uses rings scattered throughout the levels as a health system when the player is attacked without rings is crushed falls offscreen drowns or exceeds the acts tenminute limit they lose a life and return to the most recently passed checkpoint dying with zero lives gives the player a game over the levels also include powerups in television monitors that when hit grant the character an extra life temporary invincibility to most hazards a number of rings7 a shield that allows them to breathe underwater a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles or a shield that attracts nearby rings8 tails in one of the special stages in which the player can earn chaos emeralds a diagram of how rings are generated by walking the perimeter of a group of blue spheres the game contains two types of special stages when the player collects at least 50 rings and passes a checkpoint they can warp to the first type9 which involves bouncing up a gumball machinelike corridor to earn powerups by hitting a switch both sides of the corridor are lined with flippers which disappear when the character bounces on them and the switch drops when both flippers supporting it are removed the corridors floor contains a bounce pad which also disappears after one use falling afterwards causes the player to leave the stage with the most recent powerup collected10 the second type triggered by entering giant rings found in secret passages involves running around a 3d map and passing through all of a number of blue spheres arranged in patterns passing through a blue sphere turns it red and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a chaos emerald if sonic not tails collects all seven he can become super sonic at will which makes him invincible to most obstacles811 failing to collect the seven chaos emeralds triggers a postcredits scene in which robotnik and knuckles taunt the player12 sonic 3 includes a competitive mode two players controlling sonic tails or knuckles the echidna race through one or all of five stages that do not appear in the main game in these same stages a single player can compete against the clock in time attacks13 sonic 3 knucklesedit main article sonic knuckles sonic 3 and sonic knuckles were intended to be a single game but were released separately due to time and financial constraints1 the sonic knuckles cartridge features a lockon adapter that allows it to be physically attached to other genesis cartridges connecting the sonic 3 cartridge creates a combined game sonic 3 knuckles the lockon function is available in some digital releases of the games such as the virtual console service for the wii9 sonic 3 knuckles allows the player to play sonic 3 levels as knuckles or sonic knuckles levels as tails or both sonic and tails14 other new features are the ability to collect super emeralds unlocking new hyper forms for sonic and knuckles and a super form for tails improved save options access to new areas that sonic or tails couldnt previously access altered boss forms and an additional ending that shows sonic returning the master emerald to angel island15 plotedit dr robotniks space station the death egg crashlands on a mystical floating landmass called angel island after sonic and tails defeat him at the end of sonic the hedgehog 2 as robotnik begins to repair the damaged station he meets knuckles the echidna the last surviving member of an ancient echidna civilization that once inhabited the island as well as the guardian of the master emerald which grants the island its levitation powers16 realizing sonic and tails will try to track him down robotnik dupes knuckles into believing sonic is trying to steal the master emerald turning the two against each other while robotnik tries to repair his space station17 meanwhile sonic and tails approach angel island in their biplane the tornado sonic jumps off the plane and using the chaos emeralds turns into super sonic and zooms towards the island when they arrive knuckles ambushes sonic from underground steals the emeralds and disappears inland16 as sonic and tails travel through the island they frequently encounter knuckles and robotnik who hinder their progress with various traps18 sonic and tails eventually arrive at the launch base where the destroyed death egg is being repaired they fight with knuckles but the death egg launches back into the sky leaving him behind they fight robotnik one last time on a platform attached to the underside of the death egg they defeat him and the resulting explosion drops sonic and tails away from the death egg which crashlands farther off on angel island again the story continues in sonic knuckles192021 developmentedit as with its predecessors sonic 3 was developed by sonic team and published by sega yuji naka and hirokazu yasuhara were the primary creators of the sonic 3 design document and project schedule22 sonic 3 began as a topdown isometric game similar to what would become sonic 3d blast 1996 but the concept was abandoned early as the team did not want to change the sonic formula too radically for a sequel23 according to sonic producer and programmer yuji naka the team felt that they needed a deeper story to expand the world of sonic which made the project huge thus they introduced sonics rival knuckles the echidna and made the levels triple the size of those found in sonic 224 sonic 3 and sonic knuckles were originally planned as a single game however time was limited and the manufacturing costs of a 34megabit cartridge25 with nvram would have been prohibitively expensive sonic team split the game in half giving the developers more time to finish the second part and splitting the cost between two cartridges26 the cartridge has a small amount of nonvolatile ram built into it which allows the player to save game progress to the game cartridge27 sega planned to release a single cartridge version of both games titled sonic the hedgehog 3 limited edition though it was eventually cancelled for unknown reasons28 a prototype rom image of this version was leaked in 200829 sonic 3 was released on february 2 1994 in north america30 and february 24 in europe to help promote the games european release the british band right said fred adapted the song wonderman to include references to sonic31 the song was used in the games advertisements and was also released as a single which charted in the uk at number 5532 michael jacksons involvementedit see also michael jacksonrelated games in 2005 former sega technical institute director roger hector stated that sega brought in american pop musician michael jackson to compose music for sonic 3 but following the allegations of sexual abuse against jackson his involvement was terminated and the music reworked33 the website of musician cirocco jones who contributed music to sonic 3 and is credited ingame as scirocco credits himself along with jackson and jacksons tour keyboardist and songwriting collaborator brad buxer for musical cues for levels 2 3 of sonic the hedgehog34 however senior sega staff later stated that any involvement of jackson was arranged without their knowledge and no contracts nor formal agreements were ever made3536 in a 2009 interview with french magazine black white buxer stated that jackson was involved with some sonic 3 compositions but chose to remain uncredited because he was unhappy with the sound capabilities of the genesis he also said that the sonic 3 credits music later became the basis for jacksons 1996 single stranger in moscow3637 in 2013 it was discovered that the musical theme for icecap zone closely resembles a previously unreleased 1982 track hard times by the jetzons for which buxer was the keyboardist and cosongwriter38 in october 2013 gametrailers dedicated an episode of its pop fiction series to examining jacksons involvement with the game roger hector who previously stated that jacksons involvement in the game was dropped due to the sexual abuse allegations stated that any similarities to jacksons music in sonic 3 was not intentional on segas part however an anonymous source involved in the games development reaffirmed buxers statements and said jackson was involved before the scandals came to light in august 1993 and that his contributions remained in the game with jackson choosing to remain uncredited the source specified that the musical theme for carnival night zone was one of the pieces jackson contributed to39 alternate versions and portsedit main article list of sonic the hedgehog compilations sonic 3 is included in the compilations sonic jam 1997 for the sega saturn40 sonic knuckles collection 1997

have been estimated at 15 million66 and sonic 2s at 6 million67 sonic 3 unlike these two was not bundled with the genesis console itself however sonic 3 is still one of the bestselling genesis games of all time68 like its predecessors sonic 3 received critical acclaim it holds a score of 89 percent at review aggregator gamerankings based on five reviews53 critics generally felt sonic 3 was the best game in the series so far andrew humphreys of hyper who declared himself not a sonic fan said it was undoubtedly the best of the series including the acclaimed but obscure sonic cd though he admitted having preferred sonic 2s special stages by a small margin59 sega magazine however stated that sonic 3 has better special stages and was not only superior to sonic 2 as a whole but would be a serious contender for the best platform game ever award62 sega power wrote that despite their skepticism they found it excellent and easily the most explorable and playable in the series63 electronic gaming monthly also compared sonic 3 favorably to sonic 1 2 and cd and awarded it their game of the month award57 they later ranked it number 1 in the egm hot 50 indicating that it received the highest average score of any game theyd reviewed in the past year69 lucas m thomas of ign stated that sonic 3 completed the trilogy as the best of them all1 dan whitehead of eurogamer however considered sonic knuckles superior58 lionel vilner of gÃ©nÃ©ration 4 believed sonic 3 offered a much harder challenge than its predecessors64 some critics felt that sonic 3 had innovated too little from previous sonic games humphreys of hyper saw only a few new features59 while sega power thought it was not all that different63 and nintendo life writer damien mcferran said that theres not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank60 frank provo of gamespot stated that the games most significant addition was its save system27 however he and electronic gaming monthly also both enjoyed the new powerups5727 many aspects of the games level design were praised electronic gaming monthly and sega power enjoyed the games expansive stages secret areas much less linear level design and difficulty5763 mean machines agreed describing the game as a rollercoater ride from start to finish and listing carnival night as their favorite level which they described as probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in megadrive history61 humphreys and mean machines felt that the game was too short but they and sega magazine felt that its twoplayer mode and the emerald collecting would significantly extend the titles replay value596162 on the other hand whitehead said that the stages large sizes would keep players sufficiently engrossed58 sega magazine also enjoyed having the ability to play as knuckles in the twoplayer mode62 the visuals were very well received humphreys described sonic 3 as one of the most beautiful games around and full of flashy new visual tricks highlighting sonics ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive59 sega magazine exclaimed that its graphics were brilliant even for a sonic title62 while provo praised the elaborate backgrounds27 mean machines thought similarly giving special praise to the cameras quick scrolling the diversity of the level themes and the chunkier more detailed overall aesthetic61 thomas and provo especially enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect the zones127 mcferran however felt that the visuals had been downgraded particularly sonics dumpier sprite and the infamous dotty textures60 the sound effects and music were also well received though somewhat less so than the visuals sega magazine described them as brilliant and far superior to sonic 2s62 mean machines stated that every level had great tunes and sound effects and particularly praised the games ending music61 however humphreys described the sound as sonicky with the emphasis on the icky he also found it strikingly similar to the first two sonic games soundtracks59 thomas thought the music was impressive but not quite on par with sonic 2s1 reviews of later ports have been slightly less positive its xbox 360 release has scores of 78 and 79 at gamerankings and metacritic respectively5455 some critics such as adam ghiggino of palgn felt the game had been insufficiently upgraded for its rereleases8 whitehead of eurogamer wished online coop had been implemented58 provo of gamespot and thomas of ign wished sega had rereleased the game and its successor together as sonic 3 knuckles instead127 mega ranked it the fifth best genesis game ever in november 199470 in 2014 gamesradar ranked sonic 3 knuckles as the seventh best genesis game71 jeremy parish of us gamer ranked the combined title eighth on a similar list in 201372 legacyedit the game served as the first appearance of knuckles the echidna who would be featured prominently in future sonic
