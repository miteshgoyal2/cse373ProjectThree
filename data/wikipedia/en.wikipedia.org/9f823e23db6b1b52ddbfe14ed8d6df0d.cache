depression varied across nations in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until 19411 it was the longest deepest and most widespread depression of the 20th century2 in the 21st century the great depression is commonly used as an example of how far the worlds economy can decline3 the depression started in the united states after a major fall in stock prices that began around september 4 1929 and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of october 29 1929 known as black tuesday between 1929 and 1932 worldwide gross domestic product gdp fell by an estimated 15 by comparison worldwide gdp fell by less than 1 from 2008 to 2009 during the great recession4 some economies started to recover by the mid1930s however in many countries the negative effects of the great depression lasted until the beginning of world war ii5 the great depression had devastating effects in countries both rich and poor personal income tax revenue profits and prices dropped while international trade plunged by more than 50 unemployment in the us rose to 25 and in some countries rose as high as 336 cities all around the world were hit hard especially those dependent on heavy industry construction was virtually halted in many countries farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about 60789 facing plummeting demand with few alternative sources of jobs areas

however11 some dispute this conclusion and see the stock crash as a symptom rather than a cause of the great depression612 even after the wall street crash of 1929 optimism persisted for some time john d rockefeller said these are days when many are discouraged in the 93 years of my life depressions have come and gone prosperity has always returned and will again13 the stock market turned

automobile sales had declined to below the levels of 1928 prices in general began to decline although wages held steady in 1930 then a deflationary spiral started in 1931 conditions were worse in farming areas where commodity prices plunged and in mining and logging areas where unemployment was high and there were few other jobscitation needed the decline in the us economy was the factor that pulled down most other countries at first then internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better frantic attempts to shore up the economies of individual nations through protectionist policies such as the 1930 us smoot–hawley tariff act and retaliatory tariffs in other countries exacerbated the collapse in global trade17 by late 1930 a steady decline in the world

black tuesday and the bank holiday in march 1933 when there were massive bank runs across the united states crowd gathering at the intersection of wall street and broad street after the 1929 crash us industrial production 1928–39 the two classical competing theories of the great depression are the keynesian demanddriven and the monetarist explanation there are also various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the keynesians and monetarists the consensus among demanddriven theories is that a largescale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending once panic and deflation set in many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods exacerbating the drop in demand monetarists believe that the great depression started as an ordinary recession but the shrinking of the money supply greatly exacerbated the economic situation causing a recession to descend into the great depression economists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the great depression is right or the traditional keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending particularly investment is the primary explanation for the onset of the great depression19 today the controversy is of lesser importance since there is mainstream support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of milton friedman and anna schwartz add nonmonetary explanations there is consensus that the federal reserve system should have cut short the process of monetary deflation and banking collapse if the fed had done that the economic downturn would have been far less severe and much shorter20 mainstream explanations keynesian british economist john maynard keynes argued in the general theory of employment interest and money that lower aggregate expenditures in the economy contributed to a massive decline in income and to employment that was well below the average in such a situation the economy reached equilibrium at low levels of economic activity and high unemployment keynes basic idea was simple to keep people fully employed governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending andor cutting taxes as the depression wore on franklin d roosevelt tried public works farm subsidies and other devices to restart the us economy but never completely gave up trying to balance the budget according to the keynesians this improved the economy but roosevelt never spent enough to bring the economy out of recession until the start of world war ii21 monetarist the great depression in the us from a monetary view real gross domestic product in 1996dollar blue price index red money supply m2 green and number of banks grey all data adjusted to 1929 100 crowd at new yorks american union bank during a bank run early in the great depression monetarists follow the explanation given by milton friedman and anna j schwartz they argue that the great depression was caused by the banking crisis that caused onethird of all banks to vanish a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly monetary contraction by 35 this caused a price drop by 33 deflation22 by not lowering interest rates by not increasing the monetary base and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling the federal reserve passively watched the transforming of a normal recession into the great depression friedman argued that the downward turn in the economy starting with the stock market crash would merely have been an ordinary recession if the federal reserve had taken aggressive action232425 the federal reserve allowed some large public bank failures – particularly that of the new york bank of united states – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks and the federal reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed he claimed that if the fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks or simply bought government bonds on the open market to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did26 with significantly less money to go around businessmen could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed forcing many to stop investing this interpretation blames the federal reserve for inaction especially the new york branch27 one reason why the federal reserve did not act to limit the decline of the money supply was the gold standard at that time the amount of credit the federal reserve could issue was limited by the federal reserve act which required 40 gold backing of federal reserve notes issued by the late 1920s the federal reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession this credit was in the form of federal reserve demand notes28 a promise of gold is not as good as gold in the hand particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40 of the federal reserve notes outstanding during the bank panics a portion of those demand notes were redeemed for federal reserve gold since the federal reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit on april 5 1933 president roosevelt signed executive order 6102 making the private ownership of gold certificates coins and bullion illegal reducing the pressure on federal reserve gold28 common position from the point of view of todays mainstream schools of economic thought government should strive to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates money supply andor aggregate demand on a stable growth path when threatened by the forecast of a depression central banks should pour liquidity into the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to keep the nominal money stock and total nominal demand from collapsing29 at the beginning of the great depression most economists believed in says law and the selfequilibrating powers of the market and failed to explain the severity of the depression outright leaveitalone liquidationism was a position mainly held by the austrian school30 the liquidationist position was that a depression is good medicine the idea was the benefit of a depression was to liquidate failed investments and businesses that have been made obsolete by technological development in order to release factors of production capital and labor from unproductive uses so that these could be redeployed in other sectors of the technologically dynamic economy they argued that even if selfadjustment of the economy took mass bankruptcies then so be it30 an increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of some federal reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis led to disastrous consequences31 regarding the policies of president hoover economists like barry eichengreen and j bradford delong point out that president hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until 1932 when he lost confidence in his secretary of the treasury andrew mellon and replaced him303132 despite liquidationist expectations a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed but vanished during the first years of the great depression according to a study by olivier blanchard and lawrence summers the recession caused a drop of net capital accumulation to pre1924 levels by 193333 milton friedman called the leaveitalone liquidationism dangerous nonsense29 he wrote “ i think the austrian businesscycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm if you go back to the 1930s which is a key point here you had the austrians sitting in london hayek and lionel robbins and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world youve just got to let it cure itself you cant do anything about it you will only make it worse … i think by encouraging that kind of donothing policy both in britain and in the united states they did harm31 ” additional modern nonmonetary explanations the monetary explanation has two weaknesses first it is not able to explain why the demand for money was falling more rapidly than the supply during the initial downturn in 1930–3119 second it is not able to explain why in march 1933 a recovery took place although short term interest rates remained close to zero and the money supply was still falling these questions are addressed by modern explanations that build on the monetary explanation of milton friedman and anna schwartz but add nonmonetary explanations debt deflation crowds outside the bank of united states in new york after its failure in 1931 irving fisher argued that the predominant factor leading to the great depression was a vicious circle of deflation and growing overindebtedness34 he outlined nine factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust the chain of events proceeded as follows debt liquidation and distress selling contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off a fall in the level of asset prices a still greater fall in the net worth of businesses precipitating bankruptcies a fall in profits a reduction in output in trade and in employment pessimism and loss of confidence hoarding of money a fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates34 during the crash of 1929 preceding the great depression margin requirements were only 1035 brokerage firms in other words would lend 9 for every 1 an investor had deposited when the market fell brokers called in these loans which could not be paid back36 banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse triggering multiple bank runs government guarantees and federal reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets36 outstanding debts became heavier because prices and incomes fell by 20–50 but the debts remained at the same dollar amount after the panic of 1929 and during the first 10 months of 1930 744 us banks failed in all 9000 banks failed during the 1930s by april 1933 around 7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the march bank holiday37 bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay with future profits looking poor capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased in the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending36 banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans which intensified deflationary pressures a vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated the liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices which it caused the mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed relative to the value of declining asset holdings the very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it paradoxically the more the debtors paid the more they owed34 this selfaggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression fishers debtdeflation theory initially lacked mainstream influence because of the counterargument that debtdeflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group debtors to another creditors pure redistributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects building on both the monetary hypothesis of milton friedman and anna schwartz as well as the debt deflation hypothesis of irving fisher ben bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output he builds on fishers argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered aggregate demand a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral according to bernanke a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy but when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets banks will react by tightening their credit conditions that in turn leads to a credit crunch which does serious harm to the economy a credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral383940 expectations hypothesis since economic mainstream turned to the new neoclassical synthesis expectations are a central element of macroeconomic models according to peter temin barry wigmore gauti b eggertsson and christina romer the key to recovery and to ending the great depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations the thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive in march 1933 when franklin d roosevelt took office consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation industrial production bottomed out in march 1933 and investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in march 1933 there were no monetary forces to explain that turn around money supply was still falling and short term interest rates remained close to zero before march 1933 people expected further deflation and a recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment but when roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion with these positive expectations interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do roosevelts fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible the expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments the analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937 if the regime change had not happened and the hoover policy had continued the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933 and output would have been 30 lower in 1937 than in 1933414243 the recession of 1937–38 which slowed down economic recovery from the great depression is explained by fears of the population that the moderate tightening of the monetary and fiscal policy in 1937 would be first steps to a restoration of the premarch 1933 policy regime44 heterodox theories austrian school theorists of the austrian school who wrote about the depression include austrian economist friedrich hayek and american economist murray rothbard who wrote americas great depression 1963 in their view and like the monetarists the federal reserve which was created in 1913 shoulders much of the blame but in opposition to the monetarists they argue that the key cause of the depression was the expansion of the money supply in the 1920s that led to an unsustainable creditdriven boom45 in the austrian view it was this inflation of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices stocks and bonds and capital goods by the time the fed belatedly tightened in 1928 it was far too late and in the austrian view a significant economic contraction was inevitable45 in february 1929 hayek published a paper predicting the federal reserves actions would lead to a crisis starting in the stock and credit markets46 according to rothbard government support for failed enterprises and keeping wages above their market values actually prolonged the depression47 hayek unlike rothbard believed since the 1970s along with the monetarists that the federal reserve further contributed to the problems of the depression by permitting the money supply to shrink during the earliest years of the depression48 however in 1932 and 1934 hayek had criticised the fed and the bank of england for not taking a more contractionary stance49 hans sennholz argued that most boom and busts that plagued the american economy in 1819–20 1839–43 1857–60 1873–78 1893–97 and 1920–21 were generated by government creating a boom through easy money and credit which was soon followed by the inevitable bust the spectacular crash of 1929 followed five years of reckless credit expansion by the federal reserve system under the coolidge administration the passing of the sixteenth amendment the passage of the federal reserve act rising government deficits the passage of the hawleysmoot tariff act and the revenue act of 1932 exacerbated the crisis prolonging it50 ludwig von mises wrote in the 1930s credit expansion cannot increase the supply of real goods it merely brings about a rearrangement it diverts capital investment away from the course prescribed by the state of economic wealth and market conditions it causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods as a result the upswing lacks a solid base it is not a real prosperity it is illusory prosperity it did not develop from an increase in economic wealth ie the accumulation of savings made available for productive investment rather it arose because the credit expansion created the illusion of such an increase sooner or later it must become apparent that this economic situation is built on sand5152 marxist karl marx saw recession and depression as unavoidable under freemarket capitalism as there are no restrictions on accumulations of capital other than the market itself in the marxist view capitalism tends to create unbalanced accumulations of wealth leading to overaccumulations of capital which inevitably lead to a crisis this especially sharp bust is a regular feature of the boom and bust pattern of what marxists term chaotic capitalist development it is a tenet of many marxist groupings that such crises are inevitable and will be increasingly severe until the contradictions inherent in the mismatch between the mode of production and the development of productive forces reach the final point of failure at which point the crisis period encourages intensified class conflict and forces societal change53 inequality power farming displaces tenants from the land in the western dry cotton area childress county texas 1938 two economists of the 1920s waddill catchings and william trufant foster popularized a theory that influenced many policy makers including herbert hoover henry a wallace paul douglas and marriner eccles it held the economy produced more than it consumed because the consumers did not have enough income thus the unequal distribution of wealth throughout the 1920s caused the great depression5455 according to this view the root cause of the great depression was a global overinvestment in heavy industry capacity compared to wages and earnings from independent businesses such as farms the proposed solution was for the government to pump money into the consumers pockets that is it must redistribute purchasing power maintaining the industrial base and reinflating prices and wages to force as much of the inflationary increase in purchasing power into consumer spending the economy was overbuilt and new factories were not needed foster and catchings recommended56 federal and state governments to start large construction projects a program followed by hoover and roosevelt productivity shock it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the productivity output and employment trends we are describing are longtime trends and were thoroughly evident prior to 1929 these trends are in nowise the result of the present depression nor are they the result of the world war on the contrary the present depression is a collapse resulting from these longterm trends 57 — m king hubbert the first three decades of the 20th century saw economic output surge with electrification mass production and motorized farm machinery and because of the rapid growth in productivity there was a lot of excess production capacity and the work week was being reducedcitation

did not face bank failures and a monetary contraction first hand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher interest rates in countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with lower interest rates under the gold standards price–specie flow mechanism countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline deflation5960 there is also consensus that protectionist policies such as the smoothawley tariff act helped to worsen the depression61 gold standard the depression in international perspective62 some economic studies have indicated that just as the downturn was spread worldwide by the rigidities of the gold standard it was suspending gold convertibility or devaluing the currency in gold terms that did the most to make recovery possible63 every major currency left the gold standard during the great depression great britain was the first to do so facing speculative attacks on the pound and depleting gold reserves in september 1931 the bank of england ceased exchanging pound notes for gold and the pound was floated on foreign exchange markets great britain japan and the scandinavian countries left the gold standard in 1931 other countries such as italy and the us remained on the gold standard into 1932 or 1933 while a few countries in the socalled gold bloc led by france and including poland belgium and switzerland stayed on the standard until 1935–36 according to later analysis the earliness with which a country left the gold standard reliably predicted its economic recovery for example great britain and scandinavia which left the gold standard in 1931 recovered much earlier than france and belgium which remained on gold much longer countries such as china which had a silver standard almost avoided the depression entirely the connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that countrys severity of its depression and the length of time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries including developing countries this partly explains why the experience and length of the depression differed between national economies64 breakdown of international trade many economists have argued that the sharp decline in international trade after 1930 helped to worsen the depression especially for countries significantly dependent on foreign trade in a 1995 survey of american economic historians twothirds agreed that the smoothawley tariff act at least worsened the great depression65 most historians and economists partly blame the american smoothawley tariff act enacted june 17 1930 for worsening the depression by seriously reducing international trade and causing retaliatory tariffs in other countries while foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity in the us and was concentrated in a few businesses like farming it was a much larger factor in many other countries66 the average ad valorem rate of duties on dutiable imports for 1921–25 was 259 but under the new tariff it jumped to 50 during 1931–35 in dollar terms american exports declined over the next four 4 years from about 52 billion in 1929 to 17 billion in 1933 so not only did the physical volume of exports fall but also the prices fell by about 13 as written hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat cotton tobacco and lumber governments around the world took various steps into spending less money on foreign goods such as “imposing tariffs import quotas and exchange controls” these restrictions formed a lot of tension between trade nations causing a major deduction during the depression not all countries enforced the same measures of protectionism some countries raised tariffs drastically and enforced severe restrictions on foreign exchange transactions while other countries condensed “trade and exchange restrictions only marginally”67 “countries that remained on the gold standard keeping currencies fixed were more likely to restrict foreign trade” these countries “resorted to protectionist policies to strengthen the balance of payments and limit gold losses” they hoped that these restrictions and depletions would hold the economic decline67 countries that abandoned the gold standard allowed their currencies to depreciate which caused their balance of payments to strengthen it also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could lower interest rates and act as lenders of last resort they possessed the best policy instruments to fight the depression and did not need protectionism67 “the length and depth of a country’s economic downturn and the timing and vigor of its recovery is related to how long it remained on the gold standard countries abandoning the gold standard relatively early experienced relatively mild recessions and early recoveries in contrast countries remaining on the gold standard experienced prolonged slumps”67 effect of tariffs see also smoot–hawley tariff act many economist think that the tariff act was not a major contribution to the great depression economist paul krugman argues against the notion that protectionism caused the great depressionwhere protectionism really mattered was in preventing a recovery in trade when production recovered he cites a report by barry eichengreen and douglas irwin figure 1 in that report shows trade and production dropping together from 1929 to 1932 but production increasing faster than trade from 1932 to 1937 the authors argue that adherence to the gold standard forced many countries to resort to tariffs when instead they should have devalued their currencies68 milton friedman also said that smoothawley tariff of 1930 didnt cause the great depression douglas a irwin writes  most economists both liberal and conservative doubt that smoot hawley played much of a role in the subsequent contraction69 peter temin an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology explains a tariff is an expansionary policy like a devaluation as it diverts demand from foreign to home producers he notes that exports were 7 percent of gnp in 1929 they fell by 15 percent of 1929 gnp in the next two years and the fall was offset by the increase in domestic demand from tariff he concludes that contrary the popular argument contractionary effect of the tariff was small70 william bernstein writes most economic historians now believe that only a minuscule part of that huge loss of both world gdp and the united states’ gdp can be ascribed to the tariff warsbecause trade was only nine percent of global output not enough to account for the seventeen percent drop in gdp following the crash he thinks the damage done could not possibly have exceeded 2 percent of world gdp and tariff didnt even significantly deepen the great depressiona splendid exchange how trade shaped the world nobel laureate maurice allais thinks that tariff was rather helpful in the face of deregulation of competition in the global labor market and excessively loose credit prior to the crash which according to him caused the crisis financial and banking sectors he notes higher trade barriers were partly a means to protect domestic demand from deflation and external disturbances he obserses domestic production in the major industrialized countries fell faster than international trade contracted if contraction of foreign trade had been the cause of the depression he argues the opposite should have occurred so the decline in trade between 1929 and 1933 was a consequence of the depression not a cause most of the trade contraction took place between january 1930 and july 1932 before the introduction of the majority of protectionist measures excepting limited american measures applied in the summer of 1930 it was the collapse of international liquidity that caused of the contraction of trade71 german banking crisis of 1931 and british crisis it has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled european banking crisis of 1931 discuss september 2017 the financial crisis escalated out of control in mid1931 starting with the collapse of the credit anstalt in vienna in may7273 this put heavy pressure on germany which was already in political turmoil with the rise in violence of nazi and communist movements as well as investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies74 investors withdrew their shortterm money from germany as confidence spiraled downward the reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of june 540 million in the second and 150 million in two days june 19–20 collapse was at hand us president herbert hoover called for a moratorium on payment of war reparations this angered paris which depended on a steady flow of german payments but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium was agreed to in july 1931 international conference in london later in july produced no agreements but on august 19 a standstill agreement froze germanys foreign liabilities for six months germany received emergency funding from private banks in new york as well as the bank of international settlements and the bank of england the funding only slowed the process its nothing industrial failures began in germany a major bank closed in july and a twoday holiday for all german banks was declared business failures more frequent in july and spread to romania and hungary the crisis continued to get worse in germany bringing political upheaval that finally led to the coming to power through free elections of hitlers nazi regime in january 193375 the world financial crisis now began to overwhelm britain investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from london at the rate of £2½ millions a day76 credits of £25 millions each from the bank of france and the federal reserve bank of new york and an issue of £15 millions fiduciary note slowed but did not reverse the british crisis the financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in britain in august 1931 with deficits mounting the bankers demanded a balanced budget the divided cabinet of prime minister ramsay macdonalds labour government agreed it proposed to raise taxes cut spending and most controversially to cut unemployment benefits 20 the attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the labour movement macdonald wanted to resign but king george v insisted he remain and form an allparty coalition national government the conservative and liberals parties signed on along with a small cadre of labour but the vast majority of labour leaders denounced macdonald as a traitor for leading the new government britain went off the gold standard and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the great depression in the 1931 british election the labour party was virtually destroyed leaving macdonald as prime minister for a largely conservative coalition7778 turning point

to 1929 gnp for over a decade and still had an unemployment rate of about 15 in 1940 albeit down from the high of 25 in 1933 the measurement of the unemployment rate in this time period was unsophisticated and complicated by the presence of massive underemployment in which employers and workers engaged in rationing of jobscitation needed there is no consensus among economists regarding the motive force for the us economic expansion that continued through most of the roosevelt years and the 1937 recession that interrupted it the common view among most economists is that roosevelts new deal policies either caused or accelerated the recovery although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of reflation and rising nominal interest rates that roosevelts words and actions portended8081 it was the rollback of those same reflationary policies that led to the interrupting recession of 19378283 one contributing policy that reversed reflation was the banking act of 1935 which effectively raised reserve requirements causing a monetary contraction that helped to thwart the recovery84 gdp returned to its upward trend in 1938citation needed according to christina romer the money supply growth caused by huge international gold inflows was a crucial source of the recovery of the united states economy and that the economy showed little sign of selfcorrection the gold inflows were partly due to devaluation of the us dollar and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in europe85 in their book a monetary history of the united states milton friedman and anna j schwartz also attributed the recovery to monetary factors and contended that it was much slowed by poor management of money by the federal reserve system former chairman of the federal reserve ben bernanke agreed that monetary factors played important roles both in the worldwide economic decline and eventual recovery86 bernanke also saw a strong role for institutional factors particularly the rebuilding and restructuring of the financial system87 and pointed out that the depression should be examined in an international perspective88 role of women and household economics womens primary role were as housewives without a steady flow of family income their work became much harder in dealing with food and clothing and medical care birthrates fell everywhere as children were postponed until families could financially support them the average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12 from 193 births per thousand population in 1930 to 170 in 193589 in canada half of roman catholic women defied church teachings and used contraception to postpone births90 among the few women in the labor force layoffs were less common in the whitecollar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work however there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed919293 across britain there was a tendency for married women to join the labor force competing for parttime jobs especially94 in rural and smalltown areas women expanded their operation of vegetable gardens to include as much food production as possible in the united states agricultural organizations sponsored programs to teach housewives how to optimize their gardens and to raise poultry for meat and eggs95 in american cities african american women quiltmakers enlarged their activities promoted collaboration and trained neophytes quilts were created for practical use from various inexpensive materials and increased social interaction for women and promoted camaraderie and personal fulfillment96 oral history provides evidence for how housewives in a modern industrial city handled shortages of money and resources often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families cheap foods were used such as soups beans and noodles they purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the sunday roast into sandwiches and soups they sewed and patched clothing traded with their neighbors for outgrown items and made do with colder homes new furniture and appliances were postponed until better days many women also worked outside the home or took boarders did laundry for trade or cash and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer extended families used mutual aid—extra food spare rooms repairwork cash loans—to help cousins and inlaws97 in japan official government policy was deflationary and the opposite of keynesian spending consequently the government launched a nationwide campaign to induce households to reduce their consumption focusing attention on spending by housewives98 in germany the government tried to reshape private household consumption under the fouryear plan of 1936 to achieve german economic selfsufficiency the nazi womens organizations other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic selfsufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war the organizations propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living however these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives99 world war ii and recovery a female factory worker in 1942 fort worth texas women entered the workforce as men were drafted into the armed forces the common view among economic historians is that the great depression ended with the advent of world war ii many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the great depression though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery it did help in reducing unemployment11100101102 the rearmament policies leading up to world war ii helped stimulate the economies of europe in 1937–39 by 1937 unemployment in britain had fallen to 15 million the mobilization of manpower following the outbreak of war in 1939 ended unemployment103 when the united states entered into the war in 1941 it finally eliminated the last effects from the great depression and brought the us unemployment rate down below 10104 in the us massive war spending doubled economic growth rates either masking the effects of the depression or essentially ending the depression businessmen ignored the mounting national debt and heavy new taxes redoubling their efforts for greater output to take advantage of generous government contractscitation needed effects this section needs additional citations for

voluntarily australia main article great depression in australia australias dependence on agricultural and industrial exports meant it was one of the hardesthit developed countries105 falling export demand and commodity prices placed massive downward pressures on wages unemployment reached a record high of 29 in 1932106 with incidents of civil unrest becoming common after 1932 an increase in wool

dust bowl canadian industrial production had fallen to only 58 of the 1929 level by 1932 the second lowest level in the world after the united states and well behind nations such as britain which fell to only 83 of the 1929 level total national income fell to 56 of the 1929 level again worse than any nation apart from the united states unemployment reached 27 at the depth of the depression in 1933108 chile further information great depression in chile the league of nations labeled chile the country hardest hit by the great depression because 80 of government revenue came from exports of copper and nitrates which were in low demand chile initially felt the impact of the great depression in 1930 when gdp dropped 14 mining income declined 27 and export earnings fell 28 by 1932 gdp had shrunk to less than half of what it had been in 1929 exacting a terrible toll in unemployment and business failures influenced profoundly by the great depression many national leaders promoted the development of local industry in an effort to insulate the economy from future external shocks after six years of government austerity measures which succeeded in reestablishing chiles creditworthiness chileans elected to office during the 1938–58 period a succession of center and leftofcenter governments interested in promoting economic growth by means of government intervention prompted in part by the devastating 1939 chillán earthquake the popular front government of pedro aguirre cerda created the production development corporation corporación de fomento de la producción corfo to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of import substitution industrialization consequently as in other latin american countries protectionism became an entrenched aspect of the chilean economy china main article nanjing decade china was largely unaffected by the depression mainly by having stuck to the silver standard however the us silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on chinas silver coins and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in 1935 in favor of the four chinese national banks legal note issues china and the british colony of hong kong which followed suit in this regard in september 1935 would be the last to abandon the silver standard in addition the nationalist government also acted energetically to modernize the legal and penal systems stabilize prices amortize debts reform the banking and currency systems build railroads and highways improve public health facilities legislate against traffic in narcotics and augment industrial and agricultural production on november 3 1935 the government instituted the fiat currency fapi reform immediately stabilizing prices and also

strong rate of 443 per year the 1930s rate fell to only 063110 the depression was relatively mild unemployment peaked under 5 the fall in production was at most 20 below the 1929 output there was no banking crisis111 however the depression had drastic effects on the local economy and partly explains the february 6 1934 riots and even more the formation of the popular front led by sfio socialist leader léon blum which won the elections in 1936 ultranationalist groups also saw increased popularity although democracy prevailed into world war ii frances relatively high degree of selfsufficiency meant the damage was considerably less than in nations like germany germany main article weimar republic adolf hitler speaking in 1935 the great depression hit germany hard the impact of the wall street crash forced american banks to end the new loans that had been funding the repayments under the dawes plan and the young plan the financial crisis escalated out of control and mid1931 starting with the collapse of the credit anstalt in vienna in may73 this put heavy pressure on germany which was already in political turmoil with the rise in violence of nazi and communist movements as well as investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies74 investors withdrew their shortterm money from germany as confidence spiraled downward the reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of june 540 million in the second and 150 million in two days june 19–20 collapse was at hand us president herbert hoover called for a moratorium on payment of war reparations this angered paris which depended on a steady flow of german payments but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium was agreed to in july 1931 international conference in london later in july produced no agreements but on august 19 a standstill agreement froze germanys foreign liabilities for six months germany received emergency funding from private banks in new york as well as the bank of international settlements and the bank of england the funding only slowed the process its nothing industrial failures began in germany a major bank closed in july and a twoday holiday for all german banks was declared business failures more frequent in july and spread to romania and hungary75 in 1932 90 of german reparation payments were cancelled in the 1950s germany repaid all its missed reparations debts widespread unemployment reached 25 as every sector was hurt the government did not increase government spending to deal with germanys growing crisis as they were afraid that a highspending policy could lead to a return of the hyperinflation that had affected germany in 1923 germanys weimar republic was hit hard by the depression as american loans to help rebuild the german economy now stopped112 the unemployment rate reached nearly 30 in 1932 bolstering support for the nazi nsdap and communist kpd parties causing the collapse of the politically centrist social democratic party hitler ran for the presidency in 1932 and while he lost to the incumbent hindenburg in the election it marked a point during which both nazi party and the communist parties rose in the years following the crash to altogether possess a reichstag majority following the general election in july 1932113114 hitler followed an autarky economic policy creating a network of client states and economic allies in central europe and latin america by cutting wages and taking control of labor unions plus public works spending unemployment fell significantly by 1935 large scale military spending played a major role in the recovery115 greece main article economic history of greece and the greek world the reverberations of the great depression hit greece in 1932 the bank of greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries but these largely failed for a brief period the drachma was pegged to the us dollar but this was unsustainable given the countrys large trade deficit and the only longterm effects of this were greeces foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932 remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in march 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in april 1931 this was especially harmful to greece as the country relied on imports from the uk france and the middle east for many necessities greece went off the gold standard in april 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments the country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas which a number of european countries did during the time period protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma stifling imports allowed greek industry to expand during the great depression in 1939 greek industrial output was 179 that of 1928 these industries were for the most part built on sand as one report of the bank of greece put it as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive despite the global depression greece managed to suffer comparatively little averaging an average growth rate of 35 from 1932 to 1939 the dictatorial regime of ioannis metaxas took over the greek government in 1936 and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the second world war iceland icelandic postworld war i prosperity came to an end with the outbreak of the great depression the depression hit iceland hard as the value of exports plummeted the total value of icelandic exports fell from 74 million kronur in 1929 to 48 million in 1932 and was not to rise again to the pre1930 level until after 1939116 government interference in the economy increased imports were regulated trade with foreign currency was monopolized by stateowned banks and loan capital was largely distributed by stateregulated funds116 due to the outbreak of the spanish civil war which cut icelands exports of saltfish by half the depression lasted in iceland until the outbreak of world war ii when prices for fish exports soared116 ireland main article economic history of the republic of ireland frank barry and mary e daly have argued that  ireland was a largely agrarian economy trading almost exclusively with the uk at the time of the great depression beef and dairy products comprised the bulk of exports and ireland fared well relative to many other commodity producers particularly in the early years of the depression117118119120 italy main article economic history of italy the great depression hit italy very hard121 as industries came close to failure they were bought out by the banks in a largely illusionary bailout—the assets used to fund the purchases were largely worthless this led to a financial crisis peaking in 1932 and major government intervention the industrial reconstruction institute iri was formed in january 1933 and took control of the bankowned companies suddenly giving italy the largest stateowned industrial sector in europe excluding the ussr iri did rather well with its new responsibilities—restructuring modernising and rationalising as much as it could it was a significant factor in post1945 development but it took the italian economy until 1935 to recover the manufacturing levels of 1930—a position that was only 60 better than that of 1913122123 japan the great depression did not strongly affect japan the japanese economy shrank by 8 during 1929–31 japans finance minister takahashi korekiyo was the first to implement what have come to be identified as keynesian economic policies first by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending and second by devaluing the currency takahashi used the bank of japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective124 the devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect japanese textiles began to displace british textiles in export markets the deficit spending proved to be most profound and went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces by 1933 japan was already out of the depression by 1934 takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating and to avoid inflation moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions this resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists especially those in the army culminating in his assassination in the course of the february 26 incident this had a chilling effect on all civilian bureaucrats in the japanese government from 1934 the militarys dominance of the government continued to grow instead of reducing deficit spending the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced but did not eliminate inflation which remained a problem until the end of world war ii the deficit spending had a transformative effect on japan japans industrial production doubled during the 1930s further in 1929 the list of the largest firms in japan was dominated by light industries especially textile companies many of japans automakers such as toyota have their roots in the textile industry by 1940 light industry had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the japanese economy125 latin america main article great depression in latin america because of high levels of us investment in latin american economies they were severely damaged by the depression within the region chile bolivia and peru were particularly badly affected126 before the 1929 crisis links between the world economy and latin american economies had been established through american and british investment in latin american exports to the world as a result latin americans export industries felt the depression quickly world prices for commodities such as wheat coffee and copper plunged exports from all of latin america to the us fell in value from 12 billion in 1929 to 335 million in 1933 rising to 660 million in 1940 but on the other hand the depression led the area governments to develop new local industries and expand consumption and production following the example of the new deal governments in the area approved regulations and created or improved welfare institutions that helped millions of new industrial workers to achieve a better standard of living netherlands main article great depression in the netherlands from roughly 1931 to 1937 the netherlands suffered a deep and exceptionally long depression this depression was partly caused by the aftereffects of the stock market crash of 1929 in the us and partly by internal factors in the netherlands government policy especially the very late dropping of the gold standard played a role in prolonging the depression the great depression in the netherlands led to some political instability and riots and can be linked to the rise of the dutch nationalsocialist party nsb the depression in the netherlands eased off somewhat at the end of 1936 when the government finally dropped the gold standard but real economic stability did not return until after world war ii127 new zealand main article history of new zealand § great depression new zealand was especially vulnerable to worldwide depression as it relied almost totally on agricultural exports to the united kingdom for its economy the drop in exports led to a lack of disposable income from the farmers who were the mainstay of the local economy jobs disappeared and wages plummeted leaving people desperate and charities unable to cope work relief schemes were the only government support available to the unemployed the rate of which by the early 1930s was officially around 15 but unofficially nearly twice that level official figures excluded māori and women in 1932 riots occurred among the unemployed in three of the countrys main cities auckland dunedin and wellington many were arrested or injured through the tough official handling of these riots by police and volunteer special constables128 portugal main article economic history of portugal already under the rule of a dictatorial junta the ditadura nacional portugal suffered no turbulent political effects of the depression although antónio de oliveira salazar already appointed minister of finance in 1928 greatly expanded his powers and in 1932 rose to prime minister of portugal to found the estado novo an authoritarian corporatist dictatorship with the budget balanced in 1929 the effects of the depression were relaxed through harsh measures towards budget balance and autarky causing social discontent but stability and eventually an impressive economic growth129 puerto rico in the years immediately preceding the depression negative developments in the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many puerto rican workers the 1920s brought a dramatic drop in puerto rico’s two primary exports raw sugar and coffee due to a devastating hurricane in 1928 and the plummeting demand from global markets in the latter half of the decade 1930 unemployment on the island was roughly 36 and by 1933 puerto rico’s per capita income dropped 30 by comparison unemployment in the united states in 1930 was approximately 8 reaching a height of 25 in 1933130131 to provide relief and economic reform the united states government and puerto rican politicians such as carlos chardon and luis munoz marin created and administered first the puerto rico emergency relief administration prera 1933 and then in 1935 the puerto rico reconstruction administration prra132 south africa main article great depression in south africa as world trade slumped demand for south african agricultural and mineral exports fell drastically the carnegie commission on poor whites had concluded in 1931 that nearly one third of afrikaners lived as paupers the social discomfort caused by the depression was a contributing factor in the 1933 split between the gesuiwerde purified and smelter fusionist factions within the national party and the national partys subsequent fusion with the south african party133134 soviet union the soviet union was the worlds sole communist state with very little international trade its economy was not tied to the rest of the world and was only slightly affected by the great depression135 its forced transformation from a rural to an industrial society succeeded in building up heavy industry at the cost of millions of lives in rural russia and ukraine136 at the time of the depression the soviet economy was growing steadily fuelled by intensive investment in heavy industry the apparent economic success of the soviet union at a time when the capitalist world was in crisis led many western intellectuals to view the soviet system favorably jennifer burns wrote as the great depression ground on and unemployment soared intellectuals began unfavorably comparing their faltering capitalist economy to russian communism more than ten years after the revolution communism was finally reaching full flower according to new york times reporter walter duranty a stalin fan who vigorously debunked accounts of the ukraine famine a manmade disaster that would leave millions dead137 despite all of this the great depression caused mass immigration to the soviet union mostly from finland and germany soviet russia was at first happy to help these immigrants settle because they believed they were victims of capitalism who had come to help the soviet cause however when the soviet union entered the war in 1941 most of these germans and finns were arrested and sent to siberia while their russianborn children were placed in orphanages their fate is unknown138 spain main article economic history of spain spain had a relatively isolated economy with high protective tariffs and was not one of the main countries affected by the depression the banking system held up well as did agriculture139 by far the most serious negative impact came after 1936 from the heavy destruction of infrastructure and manpower by the civil war 1936–39 many talented workers were forced into permanent exile by staying neutral in the second world war and selling to both sides the economy avoided further disasters140 sweden main article economy of sweden by the 1930s sweden had what americas life magazine called in 1938 the worlds highest standard of living sweden was also the first country worldwide to recover completely from the great depression taking place in the midst of a shortlived government and a lessthanadecade old swedish democracy events such as those surrounding ivar kreuger who eventually committed suicide remain infamous in swedish history eventually the social democrats under per albin hansson would form their first longlived government in 1932 based on strong interventionist and welfare state policies monopolizing the office of prime minister until 1976 with the sole and shortlived exception of axel pehrssonbramstorps summer cabinet in 1936 during forty years of hegemony it was the most successful political party in the history of western liberal democracy141 thailand in thailand then known as the kingdom of siam the great depression contributed to the end of the absolute monarchy of king rama vii in the siamese revolution of 1932 united kingdom main articles great depression in the united kingdom and interwar britain unemployed people in front of a workhouse in london 1930 the world depression broke at a time when the united kingdom was still far from having recovered from the effects of the first world war more than a decade earlier the country was driven off the gold standard in 1931 the world financial crisis began to overwhelm britain in 1931 investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from london at the rate of £2½ millions a day76 credits of £25 millions each from the bank of france and the federal reserve bank of new york and an issue of £15 millions fiduciary note slowed but did not reverse the british crisis the financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in britain in august 1931 with deficits mounting the bankers demanded a balanced budget the divided cabinet of prime minister ramsay macdonalds labour government agreed it proposed to raise taxes cut spending and most controversially to cut unemployment benefits 20 the attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the labour movement macdonald wanted to resign but king george v insisted he remain and form an allparty coalition national government the conservative and liberals parties signed on along with a small cadre of labour but the vast majority of labour leaders denounced macdonald as a traitor for leading the new government britain went off the gold standard and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the grade depression in the 1931 british election the labour party was virtually destroyed leaving macdonald as prime minister for a largely conservative coalition14278 the effects on the northern industrial areas of britain were immediate and devastating as demand for traditional industrial products collapsed by the end of 1930 unemployment had more than doubled from 1 million to 25 million 20 of the insured workforce and exports had fallen in value by 50 in 1933 30 of glaswegians were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry in some towns and cities in the north east unemployment reached as high as 70 as shipbuilding fell 90143 the national hunger march of september–october 1932 was the largest144 of a series of hunger marches in britain in the 1920s and 1930s about 200000 unemployed men were sent to the work camps which continued in operation until 1939145 in the less industrial midlands and southern england the effects were shortlived and the later 1930s were a prosperous time growth in modern manufacture of electrical goods and a boom in the motor car industry was helped by a growing southern population and an expanding middle class agriculture also saw a boom during this period146 united states main articles great depression in the united states and new deal unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen in chicago 1931 hoovers first measures to combat the depression were based on voluntarism by businesses not to reduce their workforce or cut wages but businesses had little choice and wages were reduced workers were laid off and investments postponed147148 in june 1930 congress approved the smoot–hawley tariff act which raised tariffs on thousands of imported items the intent of the act was to encourage the purchase of americanmade products by increasing the cost of imported goods while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers other nations increased tariffs on americanmade goods in retaliation reducing international trade and worsening the depression149 in 1931 hoover urged bankers to set up the national credit corporation150 so that big banks could help failing banks survive but bankers were reluctant to invest in failing banks and the national credit corporation did almost nothing to address the problem151 shacks on the anacostia flats washington dc put up by the bonus army world war i veterans burning after the battle with the 1000 soldiers accompanied by tanks and machine guns 1932152 by 1932 unemployment had reached 236 peaking in early 1933 at 25153 drought persisted in the agricultural heartland businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans and more than 5000 banks had failed154 hundreds of thousands of americans found themselves homeless and began congregating in shanty towns – dubbed hoovervilles – that began to appear across the country155 in response president hoover and congress approved the federal home loan bank act to spur new home construction and reduce foreclosures the final attempt of the hoover administration to stimulate the economy was the passage of the emergency relief and construction act era which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the reconstruction finance corporation rfc in 1932 the reconstruction finance corporation was a federal agency with the authority to lend up to 2 billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions but 2 billion was not enough to save all the banks and bank runs and bank failures continued147 quarter by quarter the economy went downhill as prices profits and employment fell leading to the political realignment in 1932 that brought to power franklin delano roosevelt it is important to note however that after volunteerism failed hoover developed ideas that laid the framework for parts of the new deal buried machinery in a barn lot south dakota may 1936 the dust bowl on the great plains coincided with the great depression156 shortly after president franklin delano roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933 drought and erosion combined to cause the dust bowl shifting hundreds of thousands of displaced persons off their farms in the midwest from his inauguration onward roosevelt argued that restructuring of the economy would be needed to prevent another depression or avoid prolonging the current one new deal programs sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending and the institution of financial reforms during a bank holiday that lasted five days the emergency banking act was signed into law it provided for a system of reopening sound banks under treasury supervision with federal loans available if needed the securities act of 1933 comprehensively regulated the securities industry this was followed by the securities exchange act of 1934 which created the securities and exchange commission though amended key provisions of both acts are still in force federal insurance of bank deposits was provided by the fdic and the glass–steagall act the agricultural adjustment act provided incentives to cut farm production in order to raise farming prices the national recovery administration nra made a number of sweeping changes to the american economy it forced businesses to work with government to set price codes through the nra to fight deflationary cutthroat competition by the setting of minimum prices and wages labor standards and competitive conditions in all industries it encouraged unions that would raise wages to increase the purchasing power of the working class the nra was deemed unconstitutional by the supreme court of the united states in 1935 ccc workers constructing road 1933 over 3 million unemployed young men were taken out of the cities and placed into 2600 work camps managed by the ccc157 these reforms together with several other relief and recovery measures are called the first new deal economic stimulus was attempted through a new alphabet soup of agencies set up in 1933 and 1934 and previously extant agencies such as the reconstruction finance corporation by 1935 the second new deal added social security which was later considerably extended through the fair deal a jobs program for the unemployed the works progress administration wpa and through the national labor relations board a strong stimulus to the growth of labor unions in 1929 federal expenditures constituted only 3 of the gdp the national debt as a proportion of gnp rose under hoover from 20 to 40 roosevelt kept it at 40 until the war began when it soared to 128 by 1936 the main economic indicators had regained the levels of the late 1920s except for unemployment which remained high at 11 although this was considerably lower than the 25 unemployment rate seen in 1933 in the spring of 1937 american industrial production exceeded that of 1929 and remained level until june 1937 in june 1937 the roosevelt administration cut spending and increased taxation in an attempt to balance the federal budget158 the american economy then took a sharp downturn lasting for 13 months through most of 1938 industrial production fell almost 30 per cent within a few months and production of durable goods fell even faster unemployment jumped from 143 in 1937 to 190 in 1938 rising from 5 million to more than 12 million in early 1938159 manufacturing output fell by 37 from the 1937 peak and was back to 1934 levels160 wpa employed 2–3 million at unskilled labor producers reduced their expenditures on durable goods and inventories declined but personal income was only 15 lower than it had been at the peak in 1937 as unemployment rose consumers expenditures declined leading to further cutbacks in production by may 1938 retail sales began to increase employment improved and industrial production turned up after june 1938161 after the recovery from the recession of 1937–38 conservatives were able to form a bipartisan conservative coalition to stop further expansion of the new deal and when unemployment dropped to 2 in the early 1940s they abolished wpa ccc and the pwa relief programs social security remained in place between 1933 and 1939 federal expenditure tripled and roosevelts critics charged that he was turning america into a socialist state162 the great depression was a main factor in the implementation of social democracy and planned economies in european countries after world war ii see marshall plan keynesianism generally remained the most influential economic school in the united states and in parts of europe until the periods between the 1970s and the 1980s when milton friedman and other neoliberal economists formulated and propagated the newly created theories of neoliberalism and incorporated them into the chicago school of economics as an alternative approach to the study of economics neoliberalism went on to challenge the dominance of the keynesian school of economics in the mainstream academia and policymaking in the united states having reached its peak in popularity in the election of the presidency of ronald reagan in the united states and margaret thatcher in the united kingdom163 literature and the great owners who must lose their land in an upheaval the great owners with access to history with eyes to read history and to know the great fact when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away and that companion fact when a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need and the little screaming fact that sounds through all history repression works only to strengthen and knit the repressed –john steinbeck the grapes of wrath 164 the great depression has been the subject of much writing as authors have sought to evaluate an era that caused both financial and emotional trauma perhaps the most noteworthy and famous novel written on the subject is the grapes of wrath published in 1939 and written by john steinbeck who was awarded both the nobel prize for literature and the pulitzer prize for the work the novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers who are forced from their home as drought economic hardship and changes in the agricultural industry occur during the great depression steinbecks of mice and men is another important novella about a journey during the great depression additionally harper lees to kill a mockingbird is set during the great depression margaret atwoods booker prizewinning the blind assassin is likewise set in the great depression centering on a privileged socialites love affair with a marxist revolutionary the era spurred the resurgence of social realism practiced by many who started their writing careers on relief programs especially the federal writers project in the us165166167168 a number of works for younger audiences are also set during the great depression among them the kit kittredge series of american girl books written by valerie tripp and illustrated by walter rane released to tie in with the dolls and playsets sold by the company the stories which take place during the early to mid 1930s in cincinnati focuses on the changes brought by the depression to the titular characters family and how the kittredges dealt with it169 a theatrical adaptation of the series entitled kit kittredge an american girl was later released in 2008 to positive reviews170171 similarly christmas after all part of the dear america series of books for older girls take place in 1930s indianapolis while kit kittredge is told in a thirdperson viewpoint christmas after all is in the form of a fictional journal as told by the protagonist minnie swift as she recounts her experiences during the era especially when her family takes in an orphan cousin from texas172 naming further information depression economics the term the great depression is most frequently attributed to british economist lionel robbins whose 1934 book the great depression is credited with formalizing the phrase173 though hoover is widely credited with popularizing the term173174 informally referring to the downturn as a depression with such uses as economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement december 1930 message to congress and i need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression 1931 black friday 9 may 1873 vienna stock exchange the panic of 1873 and long depression followed the term depression to refer to an economic downturn dates to the 19th century when it was used by varied americans and british politicians and economists indeed the first major american economic crisis the panic of 1819 was described by thenpresident james monroe as a depression173 and the most recent economic crisis the depression of 1920–21 had been referred to as a depression by thenpresident calvin coolidge financial crises were traditionally referred to as panics most recently the major panic of 1907 and the minor panic of 1910–11 though the 1929 crisis was called the crash and the term panic has since fallen out of use at the time of the great depression the term the great depression was already used to referred to the period 1873–96 in the united kingdom or more narrowly 1873–79 in the united states which has retroactively been renamed the long depression175 other great depressions other economic downturns have been called a great depression but none had been as widespread or lasted for so long various nations have experienced brief or extended periods of economic downturns which were referred to as depressions but none have had such a widespread global impactcitation needed the collapse of the soviet union and the breakdown of economic ties which followed led to a severe economic crisis and catastrophic fall in the standards of living in the 1990s in postsoviet states and the former eastern bloc176 which was even worse than the great depression177178 even before russias financial crisis of 1998 russias gdp was half of what it had been in the early 1990s178 and some populations are still poorer as of 2009update than they were in

and the great depression some journalists and economists have taken to calling the late2000s recession the great recession in allusion to the great depression179180181182 the causes of the great recession seem similar to the great depression but significant differences exist the previous chairman of the federal reserve ben bernanke had extensively studied the great depression as part of his doctoral work at mit and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s bernankes policies will undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come as economists debate the wisdom of his choices generally speaking the recovery of the worlds financial systems tended to be quicker during the great depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late2000s recession if we contrast the 1930s with the crash of 2008 where gold went through the roof it is clear that the us dollar on the gold standard was a completely different animal in comparison to the fiat freefloating us dollar currency we have today both currencies in 1929 and 2008 were the us dollar but in an analogous way it is as if one was a sabertoothed tiger and the other is a bengal tiger they are two completely different animals where we have experienced inflation since the crash of 2008 the situation was much different in the 1930s when deflation set in unlike the deflation of the early 1930s the us economy currently appears to be in a liquidity trap or a situation where monetary policy is unable to stimulate an economy back to health in terms of the stock market nearly three years after the 1929 crash the djia dropped 84 on august 12 1932 where we have experienced great volatility with large intraday swings in the past two months in 2011 we have not experienced any recordshattering daily percentage drops to the tune of the 1930s where many of us may have that 30s feeling in light of the djia the cpi and the national unemployment rate we are simply not living in the 30s some individuals may feel as if we are living in a depression but for many others the current global financial crisis simply does not feel like a depression akin to the 1930s183 1928 and 1929 were the times in the 20th century that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes184 half the unemployed had been out of work for over six months something that was not repeated until the late2000s recession 2007 and 2008 eventually saw the world reach new levels of wealth gap inequality that rivalled the years of 1928 and 1929 see also book great depression 1930s
