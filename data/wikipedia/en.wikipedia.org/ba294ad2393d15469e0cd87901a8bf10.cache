however razr2 sales were only half of the original in the same period43 because motorola relied so long upon the razr and its derivatives4445 and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for featurerich touchscreen and 3g phones46 the razr appeal declined while rival offerings like the lg chocolate blackberry and iphone captured leading motorola to eventually drop behind samsung and lg in market share for mobile phones47 motorolas strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of lowcost razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division4548 motorola capitalized on the razr too long and it was also slow adopting 3g while nokia managed to retain its lead of the worldwide cellular market motorola was surpassed first by samsung and then lg electronics4950 by 2007 without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer motorola sold tens of millions of razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices causing margins to collapse in
