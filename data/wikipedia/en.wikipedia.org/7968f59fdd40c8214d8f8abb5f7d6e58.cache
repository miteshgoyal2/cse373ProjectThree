candidates donald trump and ted cruz stating that trumps proposal to shut down mosques in the us was a threat to religious liberty and that cruzs proposal to impose a religious test for refugees would penalize innocent women and children who are fleeing from murderous barbarians simply because theyre not christians4 in 2016 moore became a leading trump critic saying that in a presidential election between trump and hillary clinton christians should vote for a conservative independent or thirdparty candidate6 moore stated that he could not support the former because he stirs up racial animosity

culture without losing the gospel was awarded the beautiful orthodoxy book of the year award from christianity today9 theological viewsedit moore writes from the perspective of a theologically conservative baptist christian who affirms the inerrancy of scripture10 and a complementarian position on gender roles as well as a belief in a literal hell and an exclusivist calvinist view of salvation11 he works extensively in the area of christian eschatology highlighting the kingdom of god as the center of theology and ethics12 moore believes in an inaugurated eschatology in which the kingdom of god is already and not yet13 consistent with this position he sees jesus christ as the full inheritor of gods promises to israel and that the church receives the benefits of this as it is in christ14 moore emphasizes the kingdom as a spiritual warfare uprooting the demonic powers an emphasis that shows up not only in his works on the kingdom and on temptation but also in his writings on for example orphan care15 moore is especially interested in issues of ethics and religious liberty in his early work he argued for the early baptist commitment to religious liberty represented by such figures as isaac backus john leland and jeremiah moore as consistently conservative over against those who would articulate a more secularist understanding of the separation of church and state16 in ethics moore stands within the conservative christian democratic stream of communitarianism calling for a christian demonstration of ethical transformation within the church as the initial manifestation of the kingdom17 heavily influenced by the dutch neocalvinist theologian abraham kuyper and the early american neoevangelical theologian carl f h henry moore articulates a conservative evangelical call for justice for the vulnerable including care for widows orphans the unborn the disabled the elderly and the undocumented18 he has also called on evangelicals especially southern baptist christians to repudiate their racist legacy by working for churches that are multiracial venues of reconciliation as a witness to the coming kingdom19 other viewsedit in 2014 moore commented on reparative therapy saying the utopian idea if you come to christ and if you go through our program youre going to be immediately set free from attraction or anything youre struggling with i dont think thats a christian idea faithfulness to christ means obedience to christ it does not necessarily mean that someones attractions are going to change20 he added the bible doesnt promise us freedom from temptation the bible promises us the power of the spirit to walk through temptation20 moore also said at that time that the southern baptists ethics and religious liberty commission was working with parents of those who are gay and lesbian adding the response is not shunning putting them out on the street the answer is loving your child20 select bibliographyedit books authorededit moore
