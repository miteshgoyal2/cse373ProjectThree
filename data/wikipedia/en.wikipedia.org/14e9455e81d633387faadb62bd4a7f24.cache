the company’s manufacturing process under eli’s supervision the design for building 22 a new 5floor plant that opened in indianapolis in 1926 implemented the straightline concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs3334 one historian noted it was probably the most sophisticated production system in the american pharmaceutical industry34 this more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell lillys regular workforce produced lesscostly medicines in offpeak times using the same manufacturing facilities23 during the 1920s the introduction of new products also brought the company financial success19 in 1919 josiah hired biochemist
