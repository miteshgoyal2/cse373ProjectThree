brothers have been plagued with over the years i could never understand how these girls could say they were carrying someones child when it wasnt true —michael jackson moonwalk 19881 jackson stated several times that billie jean was based on the groupies he and his brothers encountered while part of the jackson 5123 billie jean is kind of anonymous it represents a lot of girls they used to call them groupies in the 60s he added they would hang around backstage doors and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with and i think i wrote this out of experience with my brothers when i was little there were a lot of billie jeans out there every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers4 the reason for this was due to the fame of the jackson 5 and wanting to have their money in order to have a way of living jacksons biographer j randy taraborrelli promoted the theory that billie jean was derived from a real life experience the singer faced in 1981 the magic the madness documents how a young woman wrote jackson a letter which informed the singer that he was the father of one of her twins56 jackson who regularly received letters of this kind had never met the woman in question and ignored it the woman however continued to send jackson more letters which stated that she loved him and wanted to be with him she wrote of how happy they would be if they raised the child together she pondered how jackson could ignore his own flesh and blood the letters disturbed the singer to the extent that he suffered nightmares5 following the letters jackson received a parcel containing a photograph of the fan as well as a letter and a gun jackson was horrified the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time the fan would do the same once she had killed their baby she wrote that if they could not be together in this life then they would be in the next to his mothers dismay jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home afterwards the jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital5 productionedit michael jackson wrote billie jean with his female fans in mind and later stated that when he wrote the song he knew it would be a success a musician knows hit material everything has to feel in place it fulfills you and it makes you feel good thats how i felt about billie jean i knew it was going to be big when i was writing it17 the singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that in one instance he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him jackson noted the kid probably saved our lives17 jackson faced numerous disagreements with the songs coproducer it has been reported that quincy jones did not want the song to appear on thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak to be part of the collection but jones has stated this is a false rumor589 the producer disliked the demo and did not care for the songs bassline10 jones wanted to cut jacksons 29second introduction711 the entertainer however insisted that it be kept i said michael weve got to cut that intro jones later recalled he said but thats the jelly thats what makes me want to dance and when michael jackson tells you thats what makes me want to dance well the rest of us just have to shut up712 jones also wanted to change the tracks title to not my lover as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player billie jean king1314 jackson refused to change the title and asked jones to give him coproducing credits for the track as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo in addition jackson wanted extra royalties jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days510 having resolved their differences jones had jackson sing his vocal overdubs through a sixfootlong cardboard tube7 jacksons entire lead vocal was performed in one take he had received vocal training every morning throughout the production of the song2 jazz saxophonist tom scott played the lyricon bass guitarist louis johnson was then brought in and he played his part on every guitar he owned before jackson finally settled for a yamaha bass7 greg phillinganes was also drafted in and he played the keyboard7 he later said of the song billie jean is hot on every level its hot rhythmically moving action got michael excited its hot sonically because the instrumentation is so minimal you can really hear everything its hot melodically lyrically and vocally it affects you physically emotionally even spiritually7 the song was mixed by bruce swedien times—unusual for swedien who usually mixed a song just once10 jones had told swedien to create a drum sound that no one had ever heard before the audio engineer was also told to add a different element sonic personality what i ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hihat swedien later wrote the bottom line is that there arent many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums and immediately tell what the piece of music is he concluded but i think that is the case with billie jean—and that i attribute to sonic personality710 compositionedit billie jean blends sounds of postdisco151617 rhythm and blues21618 funk1920 and dancepop2 the song opens with a standard drum beat along with a standard hihat and it contains hardly any reverberation after two more bars a repetitive bassline enters each time it passes through the tonic the note is doubled by a distorted synth bass this accompaniment is followed by a repetitive threenote synth played staccato with a deep reverb the defining chord progression is then established jacksons quiet vocals enter accompanied by a fingersnap which comes and goes during the verses as the rhythm and chord progression repeats2 according to daryl hall when jackson was recording we are the world jackson approached him and admitted to lifting the bassline for billie jean from a hall oates song apparently referring to halls i cant go for that no can do from the 1981 album private eyes michael jackson once said directly to me that he hoped i didnt mind that he copied that groove hall says he told jackson that he had lifted the bassline remarking its something we all do2122 jon anderson has recalled how the 1981 album the friends of mr cairo which he produced with composer vangelis inspired thriller and specifically billie jean they took the riff and made it funky for billie jean quincy said hed been recording our song state of independence with donna summer and i said he had an incredible guy singing backing vocals he said that guy was michael – we were both digging your album so thats kinda cool that crosspollination in music 23 according to inside the hits the lyrics refer to the commotion created by billie jean on a dance floor she entices the crowd with a seductive comeon before luring jackson to her bedroom through the fragrance of her perfume jacksons vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range however in the verses of billie jean the singers vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto a four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and during the last line jackson peaks at a full octave2 the song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute and is in the key of f♯ minor following the first chorus a cellolike synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third and later the fourth verses upon the announcement that the babys eyes resemble jacksons a voice laments oh no this is met with jacksons signature falsetto hee hee2 the bridge debuts the strings and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus violins are then played followed by a fournote minor guitar solo during the solo vocal shouts screams and laughs are added throughout this the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with jacksons vocal hiccups all the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus in the fade jackson repeats the denial of fathering billie jeans child2 release and receptionedit on december 1 1982 thriller was released to critical and commercial success24 a month later on january 2 1983 billie jean was released as the albums second single it

connelly described billie jean as a lean insistent funk number whose message couldnt be more blunt she says i am the onebut the kid is not my son he added that the track was a sad almost mournful song but a thumping resolve underlies jacksons feelings19 blender stated that the song was one of the most sonically eccentric psychologically fraught downright bizarre things ever to land on top 40 radio they added that it was frighteningly stark with a pulsing catontheprowl bass figure whipcrack downbeat and eerie multitracked vocals ricocheting in the vast spaces between keyboards and strings overall the magazine described the track as a fiveminutelong nervous breakdown set to a beat7 stylus said of the song its one of the best representations of film noir in pop music ending with no

tile in the music video for billie jean the short film for billie jean is considered the video that brought mtv until then a fairly new and unknown music channel into mainstream attention it was one of the first videos by a black artist to be aired regularly by the channel as the networks executives felt black music wasnt rock enough37 directed by steve barron the video shows a photographer who follows jackson the paparazzo never catches the singer and when photographed jackson fails to materialize on the developed picture the entertainer dances his way to billie jeans hotel room and as he walks along a sidewalk each tile lights up at his touch3738 after he performs a quick spin jackson jumps and lands freeze framed on his toes upon arrival at the hotel jackson climbs the staircase to

billie jeans bed trailed by the police the paparazzo is then arrested for spying on billie jean37 jackson sported a new look for the video jacksons clothes a black leather suit with a pink shirt and a red bow tie were copied by children around the us37 imitation became so severe that despite pupil protests bound brook high school banned students from wearing a single white glove like jackson had on

victory tour where he held his hat up and threw it afterwards since the victory tour the performance has evolved in terms of dance moves and overall song length from victory tour bad tour and dangerous world tour the song was sung live and from history world tour the song was lipsynced victory tour – performance just over six minutes in length only about 30–45 seconds in the spotlight dance ending bad tour – flashing lights and sounds transition beat it to billie jean the first and second leg performances are considerably different as the first leg was more like the victory tour and jackson did more dance moves in the second leg and the ending was therefore longer in the second leg around seven minutes in length in the dangerous world tour an illusion was made for jackson to appear on the upper floor the moment thriller ended through the use of a masked dancer posing as jackson who he had switched with in the middle of the song jackson performed the song at a slightly slower speed than the victory and bad tours but still faster than the studio version 1993 super bowl – jackson performed a part of billie jean consisting of only the first refrain second chorus and

you wanna trip on me were added in the solo in addition to the billie jean bassline royal brunei concert 1996 – similar tempo and instrumentation to the history tour and the snare sample from why you wanna trip on me is repeatedly played throughout the spotlight ending along with the main drumbeat but there is no bassline history world tour – performances of the song were usually eight minutes with some up to nine minutes always preceded by the two or threeminute suitcase intro in which jackson pulls his jacket glove and hat out from a suitcase similar tempo and arrangement to the studio version madison square garden – very similar to the history tour in instrumentation and vocal mixing but some verses before the moonwalk are sung live and switches back and forth with playback the suitcase intro is seen here as well this is it – one of these rehearsals was filmed completely and shown in the film this is it here the song is approximately 6 minutes in length performances of the
