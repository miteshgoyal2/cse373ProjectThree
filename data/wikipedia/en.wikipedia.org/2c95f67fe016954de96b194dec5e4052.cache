overlapping legal categories including murder manslaughter justifiable homicide killing in war euthanasia and capital punishment depending on the circumstances of the death these different types of homicides are often treated very differently in human societies some are considered crimes while others are permitted or even ordered by the legal system contents 1 criminal homicide 11 murder 12 manslaughter 13 defenses to homicide 14 defense strategy 2 statesanctioned homicide 3 global statistics 4 references and footnotes 5 external links criminal homicideedit criminal homicide takes many forms including accidental or purposeful murder criminal homicide is divided into two broad categories murder and manslaughter based upon the state of mind and intent of the person who commits the homicide2 murderedit murder is the most serious crime that can be charged following a homicide3 in many jurisdictions homicide may be punished by life in prison or even capital punishment4 although categories of murder can vary by jurisdiction murder charges fall under two broad categories first degree murder the premeditated unlawful intentional killing of another person and second degree murder the intentional unlawful killing of another person but without any premeditation in some jurisdictions a homicide that occurs during the commission of a dangerous crime may constitute murder regardless of the actors intent to commit homicide in the united states this is known as the felony murder rule5 in simple terms under the felony murder rule a person who commits a felony may be guilty of murder if someone dies as a result of the commission of the crime including the victim of the felony a bystander or a cofelon regardless their intent—or lack thereof—to kill and even when the death results from the actions of a codefendant or third party who is reacting to the crime3 manslaughteredit manslaughter is a form of homicide in which the person who commits the homicide either does not intend to kill the victim or kills the victim as the result of circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to become emotionally or mentally disturbed to the point of potentially losing control of their actions6 the penalty for manslaughter is normally less than the penalty for murder the two broad categories of manslaughter are63 voluntary manslaughter the intentional unpremeditated killing of another person but without premeditation and as the result of a disturbed state of mind or heat of passion involuntary manslaughter the unintentional killing of another person through an act of recklessness that shows indifference to the lives and safety of others or an act of negligence that could reasonably be foreseen to result in death the act that results in death may be intentional such as pushing somebody in anger but their death such as by their subsequently falling striking their head and suffering a lethal head injury is not another form of manslaughter in some jurisdictions is constructive manslaughter which may be charged in the event that a person causes a death without intention but as the result of violating an important safety law or regulation7 defenses to homicideedit not all homicides are crimes or subject to criminal prosecution8 some are legally privileged meaning that they are not criminal acts at all others may occur under circumstances that provide the defendant with a full or partial defense to criminal prosecution common defenses include selfdefense while most homicides by civilians are criminally prosecutable a right of selfdefense often including the right to defend others9 is widely recognized including in dire circumstances the use of deadly force10 mental incapacity a defendant may attempt to prove that he or she is not criminally responsible for a homicide due to a mental disorder if the defendant in a capital case is sufficiently mentally disabled in the united states they cannot be executed instead the individual is placed under the category of “insane” justifiable homicide or privilege due to the circumstances although a homicide occurs the act of killing is not unlawful for example a killing on the battlefield during war is normally lawful or a police officer may shoot a dangerous suspect in order to protect the officers own life or the lives and safety of others this privilege also extends itself to pattern or practicepredetermined actions or events committed by individuals in gangs hate groups or domestic terrorist organizations that federal court has already proven are targeting individuals because of their ancestral origin religious beliefs nationality race color creed sexual orientation age disability political beliefs or ethnic groupcitation needed defense strategyedit the defense in a homicide case may attempt to present evidence of the defendants character to try to prove that the defendant had a history of violence or of making threats of violence that suggest a violent character1112 the goal of presenting character evidence about the victim may be to make more plausible a claim of selfdefense11 or in the hope of accomplishing jury nullification in which a jury acquits a guilty defendant despite its belief that the defendant committed a criminal act13 statesanctioned homicideedit main article justifiable homicide homicides may also be noncriminal when conducted with the sanction of the state the most obvious examples are capital punishment in which the state punishes a criminal with death homicides committed in action during war are usually not subject to criminal prosecution either under certain circumstances law enforcement officers are authorized to use deadly force global statisticsedit main article list of countries by intentional homicide rate a 2011 study by the united nations office on drugs and crime brought together a wide variety of data sources to create a worldwide picture of trends and developments14 sources included multiple agencies and field offices of the united nations the world health organization and national and international sources from 207 countries the report estimated that in 2010 the total number of homicides globally was 468000 more than a third 36 occurred in africa 31 in the americas 27 in asia 5 in europe and 1 in oceania since 1995 the homicide rate has been falling in europe north america and asia but has risen to a near “crisis point” in central america and the caribbean of all homicides worldwide 82 of the victims were men and 18 were women15 on a percapita scaled level the homicide rate in africa and the americas at 17 and 16 per 100000 population respectively is more than double the global average 69 per 100000 whereas in asia europe and oceania between 3 and 4 per 100000 it is roughly half15 unodc in its 2013 global report estimated the total number of homicides worldwide dropped to 437000 in 2012 americas accounted for 36 of all homicides globally africa 21 asia 38 europe 5 and oceania 0316 the worlds average homicide rate stood at 62 per 100000 population in 2012 but southern africa region and central america have intentional homicide rates four times higher than the world average they are the most violent regions globally outside of regions experiencing wars and religious or sociopolitical terrorism16 asia exclusive of west asia and central asia western europe northern europe as well as oceania had the lowest homicide rates in the world about 41 of the homicides worldwide occurred in 2012 with the use of guns 24 with sharp objects such as knife and 35 by other means such as poison the global conviction rate for the crime of intentional homicide in 2012 was 4317 where homicide rates are high and firearms and organized crime in the form of drug trafficking play a substantial role 1 in 50 men aged 20 will be murdered before they reach the age of 31 at the other the probability of such an occurrence is up to 400 times lower homicide is much more common in countries with low levels of human development high levels of income inequality and weak rule of law than in more equitable societies where socioeconomic stability seems to be something of an antidote to homicide women murdered by their past or present male partner make up the vast majority of female victims14 a comparison of homicide rates per 100000 population for some countries terror and warrelated deaths are not included chinese homicide data is not available references and footnotesedit homicide definition cornell
