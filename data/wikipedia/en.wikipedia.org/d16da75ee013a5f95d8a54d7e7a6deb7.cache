in a joyous life after death he believed that most cemeteries were unsightly depressing stoneyards and pledged to create one that would reflect his optimistic beliefs and be as unlike other cemeteries as sunshine is unlike darkness he envisioned forest lawn to be a great park devoid of misshapen monuments and other signs of earthly death but filled with towering trees sweeping lawns splashing fountains beautiful statuary and memorial architecture2 before it was a cemetery forest lawn was a filming location used by directors such as carl laemmle and cecil b demille the climactic battle scenes for d w griffiths the birth of a nation were filmed there the alternate names of the filming site are providencia flats nestor ranch oak ranch oak crest ranch universal ranchuniversal city lasky ranch and paramount ranch until november 1927 when eaton selfproclaimed as the builder made known his desire to open a second forest lawn location in the hollywood hills the local residents protested vehemently to circumvent the protesters mr eaton sent his staff to the county morgue to claim 6 john does and buried them at the corners of the property in the dark of night in the morning the protesters had no power because by law the property was now a cemetery california health and safety code section 7003 “cemetery” means either of the following aany of the following that is used or
