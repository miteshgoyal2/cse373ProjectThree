of prince william county frederick who was then 32 years old was the fifth party chairman in five years on april 4 2009 frederick was removed from the position by rpvs state central committee in a move backed by most of the senior gop establishment34 many argued that fredericks election and later removal was a war within the party between insiders and outsiders5 or grassroots versus establishment republicans6 after his removal frederick considered seeking the chairman job again at the partys may 2009 convention but decided against it78 pat mullins who was then the chairman of the louisa county party unit and formerly the chairman of the fairfax county party unit was selected on may 2 2009 to serve in the interim before a special election at state party convention later that month9 mullins won the special election at the may 30 2009 convention defeating bill stanley the franklin county chairman10 mullins was reelected at the partys june 2012 convention11 mullins announced his retirement on november 5 2014 a day after the virginia gop had a strong showing in the 2014 elections1213 10th district republican committee chairman john whitbeck was elected on january 24 2015 by the partys state central committee to serve out the remainder of mullinss term1415 whitbeck faced a challenge for the chairmanship for the 2016 election at the partys state convention from vince haley who unsuccessfully ran for the republican nomination for state senate in the 12th state senate district in 201516 haley withdrew his candidacy in early 2016 then tried to reenter before the convention at the convention the party nominations committee ruled that haley did not qualify to seek the office and whitbeck was reelected unopposed to a full fouryear term1718 organization and candidate selectionedit the state party plan19 specifies the organization of the state party and how candidates will be selected the 79member state central committee sets the policy and plans for the party between larger state conventions which gather at least once every four years candidates for elective office can be selected by 1 mass meetings 2 party canvasses 3 conventions or 4 primaries a mass meeting consists of a meeting where any participants must remain until votes are taken at the end a party canvass or firehouse primary allows participants to arrive anytime during announced polling hours cast a secret ballot and then leave a convention includes a process for selecting delegates and then only the delegates may vote mass meetings party canvasses and conventions are conducted by party officials and volunteers primaries are administered by the state board of elections at all established polling places because virginia does not have party registrations participation in primaries are open to any register voter regardless of party however on june 15 2006 the plan was amended to redefine a primary primary is as defined in and subject to the election laws of the commonwealth of virginia except to the extent that any provisions of such laws conflict with this plan infringe the right to freedom of association or are otherwise invalid at the same time the plan was amended to require participants in any of the candidate selection methods to express in open meeting either orally or in writing as may be required their intent to support all republican nominees for public office in the ensuing election the candidate selection process has been criticized as favoring party insiders and disfavoring moderate candidates for example both jim gilmore and the more moderate thomas m davis were seeking the 2008 republican candidate for us senate however two weeks following the decision that the candidate will be selected at a convention instead of a primary20 davis announced that he would not seek the nomination open primary litigationedit virginia does not provide for voters to register by party virginia law requires open primaries that are not restricted based on party registration all persons qualified to vote may vote at the primary no person shall vote for the candidates of more than one party21 in 2004 the republican party amended the state party plan to attempt to restrict participation in primaries to exclude voters who had voted in a democratic primary after march 1 2004 or in the last five years whichever is more recent in august 2004 stephen martin an incumbent state senator designated that the republican candidate for his seat in the november 2007 election should be selected by primary the republicans then sued the state board of elections demanding a closed primary be held with taxpayer funding of a mechanism to exclude voters who had participated in past democratic primaries22 the federal district court dismissed the suit on standing and ripeness grounds the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed and sent the case back for a trial on its merits the district court then ruled that the rule forcing a party to accept the choice of its incumbent office holder of an open primary was unconstitutional the state could continue to hold open primaries if a party opted for a primary instead of a mass meeting party canvass or convention to choose its nominees23 on october 1 2007 the fourth circuit affirmed this holding which largely left virginias primary system intact striking down only the rule allowing an incumbent officeholder to choose an open primary over the objection of his or her party24 the republican state central committee dropped plans to require voters to sign a loyalty oath before voting in the february 2008 presidential primary the party had proposed to require each voter to sign a pledge stating i the undersigned pledge that i intend to support the nominee of the republican party for president however there was no way to enforce the pledge and the proposal caused vocal public opposition25 at a march 20 2014 mass meeting john ferguson defeated leslie williams to become chair of the campbell county republican committee williams unsuccessfully challenged the meeting before the county committee and the fifth congressional district republican committee however the state central committee overturned the vote on the grounds that school teachers and public employees participated in the meeting and that they must have been democrats in response ferguson and the other party officials that were elected filed a lawsuit to block a new mass meeting to fill the seats26 richard d obenshain centeredit the party headquarters building is named the richard d obenshain center in memory of richard d obenshain 1936–1978 the state party chairman who beginning in 1972 helped lead the partys renaissance in virginia following 95 years of

partys nomination to run for the us senate to replace retiring senator william scott when the 42yearold candidate and two others were killed in an airplane crash of a twin engine aircraft on august 2
