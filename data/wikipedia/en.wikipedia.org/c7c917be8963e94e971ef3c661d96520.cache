rider is texas tech universitys oldest mascot the tradition began in 1936 when ghost riders were dared to circle the field prior to home football games the masked rider became an official mascot in 1954 when joe kirk fulton led the team onto the field at the gator bowl according to reports from those present at the game the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched fulton and his horse blackie rush onto the football field followed by the team after a few moments the silent crowd burst into cheers ed danforth a writer for the atlanta journal who witnessed the event later wrote no team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance181182 in 2000 the masked rider tradition was commemorated with the unveiling of a statue outside of the universitys frazier alumni pavilion the sculpture created by artist grant speed is 25 larger than life183 the masked rider logo today the masked rider with guns up leads the team onto the field for all home games this mascot adorned in a distinctive gaucho hat like the ones worn by members of the marching band is one of the most visible figures at texas tech texas techs other mascot raider red is a more recent creation beginning with the 1971 football season the southwest conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented for situations where the host school did not want to allow the masked riders horse an alternate mascot was needed jim gaspard a member of the saddle tramps student spirit organization created the original design for the raider red costume basing it on a character created by cartoonist dirk west a texas tech alumnus and former lubbock mayor184 though the masked riders identity is public knowledge it has always been tradition that raider reds student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure185 the student serving as raider red is a member of the saddle tramps or high riders traditionsedit main article texas tech university traditions carol of lightsedit carol of lights the carol of lights is an annual event sponsored by the residence halls association traditionally held the first friday in december to celebrate the holiday season the event begins with a carillon concert from the 43 bells in the west tower of the administration building followed a torchlight processional by the saddle tramps and high riders spirit organizations the texas tech trombone choir and combined choirs lead the crowd in singing carols and the illumination ceremony culminates with a soloist performance of o holy night in the science quadrangle this is followed by the lighting ceremony where 13 buildings within the texas technological college historic district are illuminated with the over 25000 red white and orange lights186 the lights remain on the campus buildings until the first week when students come back from the holiday break187 in 1959 texas tech university board of directors member harold hinn planned and provided the funding to cover the science quadrangle and administration building with 5000 lights however students were away on christmas break and did not see the display the following year the residence hall association sponsored the event under the name christmas sing in 1961 the event was renamed carol of lights and the display increased to 16000 lights188 the tradition has since grown to include decorations like the 38foot lighted christmas tree 3000 luminaries lining the sidewalks of memorial circle and a 21foot fresh pine wreath hung on the physicsgeosciences building187 double tedit main article double t double t the most readily identified symbol of texas tech is the double t the logo generally attributed to texas techs first football coach e y freeland was first used as decoration on the sweaters for the football players189 the double t existed in its original form as an official logo from 1963 to 1999 and was updated in 2000 the new logo maintains the original premise but incorporates threedimensional beveling effects coupled with white trim to recognize the importance of the double t to texas tech the class of 1931 donated the double t bench by tradition freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench which is currently located in the courtyard of the administration building the logo is further embodied in the double t neon sign donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of jones att stadium at the time of its purchase this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence190 will rogers and soapsudsedit main article riding into the sunset will rogers and soapsuds one of the most wellknown landmarks on campus is the statue of will rogers on his horse soapsuds the statue entitled riding into the sunset has resided at the center of the campus since it was dedicated on february 16 1950 by rogers longtime friend amon g carter191 carter claimed that texas tech was the ideal setting for the statue and that it would be an appropriate addition to the traditions and scenery of west texas192 the statue estimated to cost 25000 239000 in 2013 dollars when it was dedicated stands 9 feet 11 inches 302 m and weighs 3200 pounds 1500 kg193 the inscription on the plaque at the base of the statue reads lovable old will rogers on his favorite horse soapsuds riding into the western sunset194 the statue continues to be a part of school tradition before every home football game the saddle tramps wrap it with red crêpe paper a tradition dating back to 1969 and a loss to texas am after which the statue was found covered in maroon paint in an apparent prank in times of national tragedies the statue has also been wrapped in black crêpe paper194 according to one campus legend taught to students during freshman orientation the statue was originally to be positioned with will rogers facing due west so it would appear he was riding into the sunset however that position would cause soapsuds posterior end to face due east a dubious greeting to visitors entering by the main eastern campus entrance where the statue is placed the horses rear would also be facing downtown lubbock potentially insulting the lubbock business community the legend holds that this problem was solved by techs civil engineering department who calculated that a 23° turn of soapsuds head to the north would line up soapsuds rear end directly toward college station texas home of the rival texas am aggies194195 modern surveys and satellite imagery have determined the statues posterior end actually points roughly equidistantly between college station and austin home of another rival team the texas longhorns196197 texas tech ringedit while the class ring had occasionally used a universal design by the late 20th century various styles were available in 1999 the university reverted to a single ring design for the universitys graduates the new official texas tech alumni association class ring symbolically captures the essence of texas tech with the prominent double t logo surrounded by the school’s full name and date of foundation by tradition undergraduates wear the ring with the double t logo facing themselves upon graduation the ring is turned so the logo faces outward one shoulder of the ring displays an image of the administration building with the bells which represent victory the other shoulder contains the university seal an american eagle perched above a book representing the church a star representing the state of texas a key representing home and a lamp representing knowledge these elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls one each for lubbock and its nine surrounding cottonproducing counties198 notable peopleedit colonel rick husband main articles list of texas tech university alumni list of
