8 references 9 external links early life and musical careeredit brooks was raised in seattles queen anne neighborhood his father was a professor and mother an artist and his upbringing has been described as being liberal12 after high school brooks pursued a career as a professional french hornist serving from 1983 to 1989 with the annapolis brass quintet in baltimore from 1989 to 1992 as the associate principal french hornist with the city orchestra of barcelona in spain and teaching from 1992 to 1995 at the harid conservatory music division3 academiaedit arthur brooks at the 2017 conservative political action conference toward the end of his professional music career brooks began pursuing his higher education with a bachelors degree in economics in 1994 from thomas edison state college in new jersey a public university that offers distance and nontraditional education programs to working adults he received a masters degree in economics from florida atlantic university in 1995 before pursuing a doctorate at the frederick s pardee rand graduate school a public policy program located at the rand corporation4 after receiving his phd in policy analysis in 1998 brooks continued to be affiliated with rand for which he produced a number of studies mostly on arts funding and orchestra operations he eventually began to study the junction of culture politics and economics that would come to be his trademark he kept his head down during the early years of his academic career publishing the usual economics fare on philanthropy—such as how tax rates and government spending affect giving writes ben gose brooks himself said i made my academic career doing that stuff but the whole time i knew i was missing something1 after a stint at georgia state university brooks landed at syracuse university in 2001 in 2005 he became a full professor and held the louis a bantle chair in business and government policy from 2007 to 2008 at syracuse brooks held joint appointments in the public affairs and management schools rise to prominenceedit in the early 2000s brooks began to look deeper into behavioral economics often using the general social survey during his time at syracuse brooks continued his academic work on philanthropy and nonprofits authoring several articles and textbooks who really caresedit brookss first book was published in 2006 with who really cares the surprising truth about compassionate conservatism5 originating in his research on philanthropy and drawing on survey data he articulates a charity gap between the 75 of americans who donate to charitable causes and the rest who do not brooks argues that there are three cultural values that best predict charitable giving religious participation political views and family structure 91 of people who identify themselves as religious are likely to give to charity but only 66 of people who do not the religious giving sector is just as likely to give to secular programs as it is to religious causes brooke claims that those who think government should do more to redistribute income are less likely to give to charitable causes and those who believe the government has less of a role to play in income redistribution tend to give more finally he argues that people who couple and raise children are more likely to give philanthropically than those who do not the more children there are in a family the more likely that a family will donate to charity one of brookss most controversial findings was that political conservatives give more despite having incomes that are on average 6 lower than liberals brooks adopts what he calls a polemic1 tone when offering recommendations urging that philanthropic giving not be crowded out by government programs and that giving must be cultivated in families and communities he admits being surprised by his conclusion these are not the sort of conclusions i ever thought i would reach when i started looking at charitable giving in graduate school 10 years ago i have to admit i probably would have hated what i have to say in this book5 who really cares was widely reviewed and critiqued many commentators thought that brooks played up the role of religion too much and argued that a charity gap is largely erased when religious giving is not considered however brooks raises some arguments to this objection in the book mainly by saying that giving to houses of worship should be counted as charity jim lindgren writes although the liberal v conservative split is the hook for the book the data are not nearly as stark as the hype surrounding the book might indicate6 in february 2007 after the release of who really cares brooks briefed president george w bush and first lady laura bush on his findings7 later that year brooks joined the american enterprise institute as a visiting scholar gross national happinessedit in april 2008 brooks published a survey and analysis of us happiness research entitled gross national happiness why happiness matters for america—and how we can get more of it8 drawing his title from the bhutanese measurement of national wellbeing brooks argues that despite the fact that the us is one of the few countries in the world to enshrine happiness in its credo happiness tends to get discounted in public policy in favor of other priorities brooks reviews survey data to understand the contours of how happy individual americans are and how individual happiness translates into nationwide satisfaction brookss findings were controversial conservatives he writes are twice as likely to call themselves very happy than liberals those with extreme political beliefs right or left tend to be happier than moderates but their provocations lower happiness for the rest of society devout people of all religions are much happier than secularists parents are happier than the childless even though their children often upset them but childrearing brooks writes offers meaning to life a sort of deep happiness that aristotle called eudaimonia balancing freedom and order also brings optimal happiness brooks writes because too many moral choices leave us insecure and searching unable to distinguish right from wrong and thus miserable the second section of the book is dedicated to the economic dimensions of happiness opportunity breeds happiness brooks writes and efforts to diminish economic inequality—without creating economic opportunity—will actually lower americas gross national happiness not raise it opportunity allows for good jobs and job satisfaction actually increases life happiness brooks argues that work makes people happy because they are creating value a theme he explored in a textbook also released in 2008 on social value creation9 to the extent that happiness can be bought it is with charity giving of effort time and money makes people much happier says brooks and it correlates with many other characteristics of the happy brooks identifying himself as a libertarian writes that the government does a poor job of making us happy but that the government can help us pursue happiness gross national happiness was widely reviewed and featured in many news outlets especially on talk radio in addition to his media for gross national happiness brooks has blogged for the new york timess freakonomics blog and written dozens of opeds for the wall street journal and several other major papers the economist devoted an entire lexington column to brookss findings in gross national happiness referring to it as a subtle and engaging distillation of oceans of data10 richard land wrote that he found arthur brooks slaying of pop culture myths to be stimulating and informative11 will wilkinson criticizes gross national happiness for downplaying european statistics on happiness brooks argues that happiness is highly correlated with religiosity but wilkinson points out that some of the worlds happiest places such as some scandinavian countries have very low religious participation rates brooks just doesnt bring it up writes wilkinson he seemed to me to encourage the idea that the relationship between religiosity and happiness is deep perhaps universal but it just isnt he continues it would be a simple error to infer that gross national happiness would be damaged were the culture to become less conservative or religious12unreliable source the battle how the fight between free enterprise and big government will shape americas futureedit in april 2010 brooks published the battle how the fight between free enterprise and big government will shape americas future in which he lays out a moral vision for the resurgence of the ideals of individual liberty equal opportunity entrepreneurship and selfreliance that have formed the american identity he asks the reason why if america is a 7030 nation favoring free enterprise are the 30 percent who want to change that culture in charge he submits that while the numbers appear to favor a traditional free enterprise culture the 30 percent coalition has a tremendous amount of influence in key places such as academia and entertainment and has effectively influenced a large number of young americans brooks believes the financial crisis of 2008–2009 was an opportunity for the statists to attack the free enterprise system as too risky for america to allow to continue in its current form but ignore the role of government policy and focus instead on greed and stupidity in the private sector according to brooks the battle is a peaceful culture war and its outcome will determine whether america continues to exist as a traditional free enterprise system or transforms into a redistributionist europeanstyle social democracy1314 this book was named world magazines 2010 book of the year in june 201015 the road to freedom how to win the fight for free enterpriseedit brooks released his first new york times bestseller the road to freedom how to win the fight for free enterprise basic books on may 8 2012 he attempts to explain the paradox discussed in his previous book the battle which stated that even though most americans claim to support a free enterprise system based on limited government the size and scope of federal and state governments has steadily increased over the past century brooks argues that advocates of limited government often rely on complex datadriven arguments bur progressives wrap their arguments in moral language appealing to americans hearts rather than their heads in making that claim brooks relies heavily on the work of psychology professor jonathan haidt which shows that humans process moral judgments more quickly than rational ones the answer then according to brooks is for the right to defend free enterprise on its moral foundations part one of the book lays out a moral case for the free enterprise system in three parts brooks argues that only free enterprise encourages true happiness based on earned success he drew a great deal from his work on happiness from gross national happiness and the battle next brooks claims that only free enterprise creates true fairness by rewarding merit then brooks states that only free enterprise lifts up the poor and vulnerable for this last section brooks cites many statistics regarding world poverty reduction from increased trade and globalization as well as statistics concerning limited government breeding charity the second half of the road to freedom outlines what brooks describes as americas statist quo and provides an alternate vision for the proper role of government drawing heavily from the work of austrian economist friedrich hayek brooks claims the only legitimate state functions are the provision of a limited social safety net and the correction of market failures when the state can act effectively and efficiently combatting what he believes to be unfair criticism of the right brooks says that most believe that it is appropriate for the government to provide some safety net for its citizens… in my view it is unacceptable for someone in americas wealthy society to go without access to basic medical care sufficient food and basic shelter he continues but the safety net is not a means to increase material equality a way to take any but the most grievous risks out of life a way to pass out rewards to groups based on demographics or political clout or a source of benefits to the middle class16 the road to freedom was widely reviewed by supporters and critics representative paul ryan r wisc provided a statement for the book cover arthur brooks knows as americas founders knew that free enterprise underpins the moral case for human freedom economic freedom produces unimaginable material prosperity but its also the only economic form that encourages individuals to freely pursue their destinies develop the character of selfresponsibility and strengthen communities brooks eloquently confronts the growing threat to economic freedom and human fulfillment and describes the fundamental choices americans must make to get back on the right road however several critics felt that brooks’s arguments oversimplified the moral arguments for the free enterprise system by avoiding tough questions or using hyperbolic comparisons for example in the atlantic clive crook took issue with brooks’s answer to whether or not america is an opportunity society saying the question is not whether america is an opportunity society but to what degree brooks argues that america is a land of opportunity because children of poor parents move up and children of rich parents move down thats true but the evidence is pretty clear that the us does not perform very well on this measure of mobility compared with other countries17 brooks might disagree with those findings but its a serious weakness of the book that he doesnt even address them18 in another example noah kristulagreen wrote for the daily beast that this is a book about us domestic policy not the benefits of adopting capitalism as opposed to communism arguments like this feel strangely anachronistic especially since brooks writes as if genuine communism was an option some were agitating for this in country these sorts of global comparisons mean that brooks can avoid confronting the inequality that actually exists in america why would you want to avoid discussing that topic you avoid discussing inequality if you dont have to answer some very uncomfortable questions19 the conservative heart how to build a fairer happier and more prosperous americaedit brooks with jim demint senator from south carolina in july 2015 brooks published a new book the conservative heart which lays out his vision for a new conservative movement focused on reducing poverty and expanding opportunity particularly for vulnerable people greg mankiw a prominent economist who reviewed the book for the new york times summarized brookss main thesis he wants conservatives to speak more in moral terms to be seen fighting for people rather than against policies to spend more time engaging with moderates and liberals and to embrace the persona of a happy warrior20 the wideranging book includes brookss policy analysis of shortcomings in the war on poverty his research on the sources of human happiness and the components of a fulfilling life interviews with social entrepreneurs and the formerlyhomeless people who were helped to rebuild their lives and communications tips for conservative leaders to more effectively defend their positions in statements published on the books cover conservative columnist george will describes the conservative heart as a thinking persons primer for a conservative politics of human flourishing and senator mike lee wrote that it should be required reading for every american who wants to transcend our broken status quo the book appeared on the new york times bestseller list immediately after publication21 a month after it was published a writer for the new york observer described brooks as the most cited contemporary author by the 2016 gop field22 culture waredit brooks believes america is locked in a culture war in which either america will continue to be an exceptional nation organized around the principles of free enterprise limited government a reliance on entrepreneurship and rewards determined by market forces or america will move toward europeanstyle statism grounded in expanding bureaucracies a managed economy and largescale income redistribution brooks states that while some have tried to dismiss the tea party demonstrations and the town hall protests as the work of extremists ignorant backwoodsmen or agents of the healthcare industry the movement reveals much about the culture war that is underway and it is not at all clear the side that will prevail brooks fears that rejecting the founding principles for redistributionist statism will permanently lessen the wealth of the us however the greatest danger is the abandonment of the pursuit of happiness because only free enterprise brings happiness as a result of earned success23 brooks has created several short videos for the conservative educational website prager university focusing on economics and government welfare24 presidency of american enterprise instituteedit this section contains too many or
