early history 1853–1900edit washington university was conceived by 17 st louis business political and religious leaders concerned by the lack of institutions of higher learning in the midwest missouri state senator wayman crow and unitarian minister william greenleaf eliot grandfather of the poet ts eliot led the effort the universitys first chancellor was joseph gibson hoyt crow secured the university charter from the missouri general assembly in 1853 and eliot was named president of the board of trustees early on eliot solicited support from members of the local business community including john ofallon but eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment washington university is unusual among major american universities in not having had a prior financial endowment the institution had no backing of a religious organization single wealthy patron or earmarked government support william greenleaf eliot first president of the board of trustees during the three years following its inception the university bore three different names the board first approved eliot seminary but william eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith he favored a nonsectarian university13 in 1854 the board of trustees changed the name to washington institute in honor of george washington naming the university after the nations first president only seven years before the american civil war and during a time of bitter national division was no coincidence during this time of conflict americans universally admired george washington as the father of the united states and a symbol of national unity the board of trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided missouri in 1856 the university amended its name to washington university the university amended its name once more in 1976 when the board of trustees voted to add the suffix in st louis to distinguish the university from the nearly two dozen other universities bearing washingtons name12 robert s brookings although chartered as a university for many years washington university functioned primarily as a night school located on 17th street and washington avenue in the heart of downtown st louis owing to limited financial resources washington university initially used public buildings classes began on october 22 1854 at the benton school building at first the university paid for the evening classes but as their popularity grew their funding was transferred to the st louis public schools14 eventually the board secured funds for the construction of academic hall and a half dozen other buildings later the university divided into three departments the manual training school smith academy and the mary institute in 1867 the university opened the first private nonsectarian law school west of the mississippi river by 1882 washington university had expanded to numerous departments which were housed in various buildings across st louis medical classes were first held at washington university in 1891 after the st louis medical college decided to affiliate with the university establishing the school of medicine during the 1890s robert sommers brookings the president of the board of trustees undertook the tasks of reorganizing the universitys finances putting them onto a sound foundation and buying land for a new campus modern era 1900–1955edit the washington university crest at the entrance to francis field washington university spent its first half century in downtown st louis bounded by washington ave lucas place and locust street by the 1890s owing to the dramatic expansion of the manual school and a new benefactor in robert brookings the university began to move west the university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm olmsted olmsted eliot of boston a committee of robert s brookings henry ware eliot and william huse found a site of 103 acres 417 ha just beyond forest park located west of the city limits in st louis county the elevation of the land was thought to resemble the acropolis and inspired the nickname of hilltop campus renamed the danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor william h danforth in 1899 the university opened a national design contest for the new campus the renowned philadelphia firm cope stewardson won unanimously with its plan for a row of collegiate gothic quadrangles inspired by oxford and cambridge universities15 the cornerstone of the first building busch hall was laid on october 20 1900 the construction of brookings hall ridgley and cupples began shortly thereafter the school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the 1904 worlds fair and olympics the delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned this original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the danforth campus cope stewardson’s original plan and its choice of building materials have with few exceptions guided the construction and expansion of the danforth campus to the present day15 brookings hall quad by 1915 construction of a new medical complex was completed on kingshighway in what is now st louis’s central west end three years later washington university admitted its first women medical students16 in 1922 a young physics professor arthur holly compton conducted a series of experiments in the basement of eads hall that demonstrated the

cyclotron at washington university was used to produce small quantities of the newly discovered element plutonium via neutron bombardment of uranium nitrate hexahydrate the plutonium produced there in 1942 was shipped to the metallurgical laboratory compton had established at the university of chicago where glenn seaborgs team used it for extraction purification and characterization studies of the exotic substance after working for many years at the university of chicago arthur holly compton returned to st louis in 1946 to serve as washington universitys ninth chancellor compton reestablished the washington university football team making the declaration that athletics were to be henceforth played on a strictly amateur basis with no athletic scholarships under compton’s leadership
