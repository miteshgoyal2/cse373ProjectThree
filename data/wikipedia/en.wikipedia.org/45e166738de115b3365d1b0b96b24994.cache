okrand and deliberately designed to sound alien it has a number of typologically uncommon features the languages basic sound along with a few words was first devised by actor james doohan scotty and producer jon povill for star trek the motion picture that film marked the first time the language had been heard on screen in all previous appearances klingons spoke in english klingon was subsequently developed by okrand into a fullfledged language klingon is sometimes referred to as klingonese most notably in the star trek the original series episode the trouble with tribbles where it was actually pronounced by a klingon character as klingonee ˈklɪŋɡɒni but among the klingonspeaking community this is often understood to refer to another klingon language called klingonaase that was introduced in john m fords 1984 star trek novel the final reflection and appears in other star trek novels by ford a shorthand version of what had previously been termed klingonaase and later adopted under the same name by tlhingan hol itself is called battle language or clipped klingoncitation needed the play a klingon christmas carol is the first production that is primarily in klingon only the

the actor who spoke the lines mark lenard james doohan recorded the lines he had written on a tape and lenard transcribed the recorded lines in a way he found useful in learning them2 for star trek iii the search for spock 1984 director leonard nimoy and writerproducer harve bennett wanted the klingons to speak a structured language instead of random gibberish and so commissioned a full language based on the phrases doohan had originated from marc okrand who had earlier constructed four lines of vulcan dialogue for star trek ii the wrath of khan23 okrand enlarged the lexicon and developed a grammar based on doohans original dozen words the language appeared intermittently in later films featuring the original cast for example in star trek v the final frontier 1989 and in star trek vi the undiscovered country 1991 where translation difficulties served as a plot devicecitation needed two noncanon dialects of klingon are hinted at in the novelization of star trek iii the search for spock as saavik speaks in klingon to the only klingon officer aboard cpt kruges starship after his death as the survivors of the enterprises selfdestruction transport up from the crumbling genesis planet to the klingon ship the surviving officer maltz states that he speaks the rumaiy dialect while saavik is speaking to him in the kumburan dialect of klingon per maltzs spoken reply to her4 with the advent of the series star trek the next generation 1987—in which one of the main characters worf was a klingon—and successors the language and various cultural aspects for the fictional species were expanded in the star trek the next generation episode a matter of honor several members of a klingon ships crew speak a language that is not translated for the benefit of the viewer even commander riker enjoying the benefits of a universal translator is unable to understand until one klingon orders the others to speak their ie human language no inuniverse explanation for this discrepancy has ever been provided but since it seems unlikely that any noticeable percentage of the klingon population much less the entire crew of a combat vessel would be proficient in human languages the implication seems to be that klingons regularly employ at least two languages one used in dialogue with other races ie their language which can thus be translated by the universal translator and one exclusively for use among klingons which is for whatever reason immune to such translationcitation needed a small number of nonklingon characters were later depicted in star trek as having learned to speak klingon notably jeanluc picard and jadzia daxcitation needed worf would later reappear among the regular characters in star trek deep space nine 19935 and belanna torres a klingonhuman hybrid would become a main character on star trek voyager 19956 languageedit hobbyists around the world have studied the klingon language four klingon translations of works of world literature have been published ghilghames the epic of gilgamesh hamlet hamlet paghmo’ tin mis much ado about nothing and pin’a’ qan paqdi’norgh tao te ching the shakespearean choices were inspired by a remark from high chancellor gorkon in star trek vi the undiscovered country who said you have not experienced shakespeare until you have read him in the original klingon in the bonus material on the dvd screenwriter nicholas meyer and actor william shatner both explain that this was an allusion to the german myth that shakespeare was in fact german the klingon language institute exists to promote the language7 cbs television studios owns the copyright on the official dictionary and other canonical descriptions of the language while constructed languages conlangs are viewed as creations with copyright protectioncitation needed natural languages are not protected excluding dictionaries andor other works created with them mizuki miyashita and laura moll note copyrights on dictionaries are unusual because the entries in the dictionary are not copyrightable as the words themselves are facts and facts can not be copyrighted however the formatting example sentences and instructions for dictionary use are created by the author so they are copyrightable8 okrand had studied some native american and southeast asian languages910 and phonological and grammatical features of these languages worked their way into klingon but for the most part not by design2 okrand himself has stated that a design principle of the klingon language was dissimilarity to existing natural languages in general and english in particular he therefore avoided patterns that are typologically common and deliberately chose features that occur relatively infrequently in human languages this includes above all the highly asymmetric consonant inventory and the basic word order11 speakersedit a small number of people are capable of conversing in klingon arika okrent guessed in her book in the land of invented languages that there might be 20–30 fluent speakers12 its vocabulary heavily centered on star trek–klingon concepts such as spacecraft or warfare can sometimes make it cumbersome for everyday use for instance while words for transporter ionizer unit jolvoy’ or bridge of a ship meh have been known since close to the languages inception the word for bridge in the sense of a crossing over water qi was unknown until august 201213 nonetheless mundane conversations are common among skilled speakers14 one klingon speaker darmond speers raised his son alec to speak klingon as a first language whilst the boys mother communicated with him in english15 alec rarely responded to his father in klingon although when he did his pronunciation was excellent after alecs fifth birthday speers reported that his son eventually stopped responding to him when spoken to in klingon as he clearly did not enjoy it so speers switched to english1617 in 2007 a report surfaced that multnomah county oregon was hiring klingon translators for its mental health program in case patients came into a psychiatric hospital speaking nothing but18 most circulations of the report seemingly implied that this was a problem that health officials faced before however the original report indicated that this was just a precaution for a hypothetical and that said translator would only be paid on an as needed basis18 after the report was misinterpreted the county issued another release noting that releasing the original report was a mistake18 in may 2009 simon schuster in collaboration with ultralingua inc a developer of electronic dictionary applications announced the release of a suite of electronic klingon language software for most computer platforms including a dictionary a phrasebook and an audio learning tool19citation needed in september 2011 eurotalk released the learn klingon course in its talk now series the language is displayed in both latin and piqad fonts making this the first language course written in piqad and approved by cbs and marc okrand it was translated by jonathan brown and okrand and uses the holpiqad truetype fontcitation needed in august 2016 a company in the united kingdom bidvine began offering klingon lessons as one of their services20 there are klingon language meetings2122 and linguists or students are interested in researching this topic even writing essays about the language or its users in the media music literature and television klingon is also used frequently as a reference to star trekcitation needed other mediaedit previous wikipedia logo

washington shakespeare company now known as wsc avant bard performed selections from hamlet and much ado about nothing in the klingon language in arlington virginia the performance was proposed by okrand in his capacity as chairman of the groups board24 this performance was reprised on february 27 2011 featuring stephen fry as the klingon osric and was filmed by the bbc as part of a 5part

online series of lessons to its members the first few lessons are free to sample canonedit an important concept to spoken and written klingon is canonicity only words and grammatical forms introduced by marc okrand are considered canonical klingon by the kli and most klingonists however as the growing number of speakers employ different strategies to express themselves it is often unclear as to what level of neologism is permissible37 new vocabulary has been collected in a list maintained by the kli until 200538 and has since then been followed up by klingon expert lieven litaer39 internal historyedit within the fictional universe of star trek klingon is derived from the original language spoken by the messianic figure kahless the unforgettable who united the klingon homeworld of qo’nos under one empire more than 1500 years ago40 many dialects exist but the standardized dialect of prestige is almost invariably that of the sitting emperor sourcesedit the klingon language institute regards the following works as canon klingon they serve as sources of klingon vocabulary and grammar for all other works41 books the klingon dictionary tkd the klingon way tkw klingon for the galactic traveler kgt sarek a novel which includes some tlhingan hol federation travel guide a pamphlet from pocketbooks paq’batlh the klingon epic isbn 9789081709125 ed floris schönfeld et al trans marc

has been developed with a phonology that while based on human natural languages is intended to sound alien to human ears when initially developed paramount pictures owners of the star trek franchise wanted the klingon language to be guttural and harsh and okrand wanted it to be unusual so he selected sounds that combined in ways not generally found in other languages the effect is mainly achieved by the use of a number of retroflex and uvular consonants in the languages inventorycitation needed klingon has twentyone consonants and five vowels klingon is normally written in a variant of the latin alphabet in this orthography upper and lower case letters are not interchangeable uppercase letters mostly represent sounds different from those expected by english speakers in the discussion below standard klingon orthography appears in ⟨angle brackets⟩ and the phonemic transcription in the international phonetic alphabet is written between slashes consonantsedit the inventory of consonants in klingon is spread over a number of places of articulation in spite of this the inventory has many gaps klingon has no velar plosives and only one sibilant fricative deliberately this arrangement is very different from that of most human languages the combination of an aspirated voiceless alveolar plosive tʰ and a voiced retroflex plosive ɖ is particularly unusual labial coronal postalveolar palatal dorsal glottal central lateral plosive voiceless p pʰ t tʰ q qʰ ’ ʔ voiced b b d ɖ affricate voiceless   tlh t͡ɬ ch t͡ʃ q q͡χ voiced j d͡ʒ fricative voiceless s ʂ h χ voiced v v gh ʁ nasal m m n n ng ŋ trill r r ɹ approximant w w l l y j there are a few dialectal pronunciation differences42 it is not known if the aforementioned noncanon kumburan or rumaiy dialects of tlhingan hol hinted at in the third trek movie might differ in the krotmag dialect b is replaced by m ɖ is replaced by ɳ in the takev dialect b becomes mb ɖ becomes ɳɖ in the morskan dialect t͡ɬ is replaced by t͡s x is replaced by h at the beginning of syllables or is dropped at the end of syllables q͡χ is replaced by x vowelsedit in contrast to its consonants klingons inventory of vowels is simple and similar to those of many human languages such as spanish or japanese due to also having a simple phonology there are five vowels spaced more or less evenly around the vowel space with two back rounded vowels one back unrounded vowel and two front or nearfront unrounded vowels the vowel inventory is asymmetrical in that the back rounded vowels are tense and the front vowels are lax the two front vowels ⟨e⟩ and ⟨i⟩ represent sounds that are found in english but are more open and lax than a typical english speaker might assume when reading klingon text written in the latin alphabet thus causing the consonants of a word to be more prominent this enhances the sense that klingon is a clipped and harshsounding language vowels ⟨a⟩ – ɑ – open back unrounded vowel in english spa ⟨e⟩ – ɛ – openmid front unrounded vowel in english bed ⟨i⟩ – ɪ – nearclose nearfront unrounded vowel in english bit ⟨o⟩ – o – closemid back rounded vowel in french eau ⟨u⟩ – u – close back rounded vowel in spanish tu diphthongs can be analyzed phonetically as the combination of the five vowels plus one of the two semivowels w and j represented by ⟨w⟩ and ⟨y⟩ respectively thus the combinations ⟨ay⟩ ⟨ey⟩ ⟨iy⟩ ⟨oy⟩ ⟨uy⟩ ⟨aw⟩ ⟨ew⟩ and ⟨iw⟩ are possible there are no words in the klingon language that contain ⟨ow⟩ or ⟨uw⟩ syllable structureedit klingon follows a strict syllable structure a syllable must start with a consonant which includes the glottal stop followed by one vowel in prefixes and other rare syllables this is enough more commonly this consonantvowel pair is followed by one consonant or one of three biconsonantal codas w’ y’ rgh thus ta record tar poison and targh targ a type of animal are all legal syllable forms but tard and ar are not despite this one suffix takes the shape vowelconsonant the endearment suffix oy stressedit in verbs the stressed syllable is usually the verbal stem itself as opposed to a prefix or any suffixes except when a suffix ending with ⟨’⟩ is separated from the verb by at least one other suffix in which case the suffix ending in ⟨’⟩ is also stressed in addition stress may shift to a suffix that is meant to be emphasized in nouns the final syllable of the stem the noun itself excluding any affixes is stressed if any syllables ending in ⟨’⟩ are present the stress shifts to those syllables the stress in other words seems to be variable but this is not a serious issue because most of these words are only one syllable in length there are some words which should fall under the rules above but do not although using the standard rules would still be acceptable grammaredit main article klingon grammar klingon is an agglutinative language using mainly affixes in order to alter the function or meaning of words some nouns have inherently plural forms such as jengva’ plate vs ngop plates but most nouns require a suffix to express plurality explicitly depending on the type of noun body part being capable of using language or neither the suffix changes for beings capable of using language the suffix is pu’ as in tlhinganpu’ meaning klingons or jaghpu’ meaning enemies for body parts the plural suffix is du’ as in mindu’ eyes for items that are neither body parts nor capable of speech the suffix is mey such as in hovmey stars or targhmey targs for a klingon animal somewhat resembling a boar however a plural suffix is never obligatory to say the stars are beautiful ’ih hovmey and ’ih hov are equally grammatical although the second can also mean the star is beautiful the words lod and be’ which on their own mean man and woman respectively can be used in compound words to refer to the referents sex for example from puq child this process derives puqlod son and puqbe’ daughter klingon nouns take suffixes to indicate grammatical number there are three noun classes two levels of deixis and a possession and syntactic function in all twentynine noun suffixes from five classes may be employed jupoypu’na’wi’vad for my beloved true friends a word may carry no more than one suffix from each class and the classes have a specific order of appearance verbs in klingon take a prefix indicating the number and person of the subject and object whereas suffixes are taken from nine ordered classes and a special suffix class called rovers each of the four known rovers has a unique rule controlling its position among the suffixes in the verb verbs are marked for aspect certainty predisposition and volition dynamic causative mood negation and honorific the klingon verb has two moods indicative and imperative the most common word order in klingon is object–verb–subject and in most cases the word order is the exact reverse of english for an equivalent sentence dah mojaqmeyvam divusnisbe’ ’e’ vihar now suffixpldem 1pla3plplimitneedneg that 1sga3sgpbelieve i believe that we do not need to limit these suffixes now hyphens are used in the above only to illustrate the use of affixes hyphens are not used in klingon an important aspect of klingon grammar is its ungrammaticality as with for example japanese shortening of communicative statements is common and is called clipped klingon tlhingan hol pod or more simply hol pod and ritualized speechclarification needed clipped klingon is especially useful in situations where speed is a decisive factor grammar is abbreviated and sentence parts deemed to be superfluous are dropped intentional ungrammaticality is widespread and it takes many forms it is exemplified by the practice of pabha’ which marc okrand translates as to misfollow the rules or to follow the rules wrongly43 writing systemsedit qapla’ success main article klingon writing systems when written in the latin alphabet klingon is unusual in being casesensitive with some letters written in capitals and others in lowercase in one contrast q and q there is an actual casesensitive pair representing two different consonants capitals are generally reserved for uvular or retroflex consonants pronounced further back in the mouth or throat than is normal for the corresponding english sounds as with d q and s however h pronounced like the ⟨ch⟩ in german ach or scottish loch is further forward in the throat than english h one phoneme the vowel i as in i is written capital to look more like the ipa symbol for the sound ɪ and can pose problems when writing klingon in sansserif fonts such as arial as it looks almost the same as the consonant l as in l abraham lincoln was born in illinois this has led some klingon enthusiasts to write it lowercase like the other vowels i to prevent confusion but this use is noncanonical instead a serif font that clearly distinguishes i and l such as courier or courier new has traditionally been employed for writing klingon in the latin alphabet the apostrophe denoting the glottal stop is considered a letter not a punctuation mark a b ch d e gh h i j l m n ng o p q q r s t tlh u v w y ’ klingon is often written inuniverse transliterated to the latin alphabet as used above but on the television series the klingons use their own alien writing system in the klingon dictionary this alphabet is named as piqad but no information is given about it when klingon symbols are used in star trek productions they are merely decorative graphic elements designed to emulate real writing and create an appropriate atmosphere enthusiasts have settled on the name piqad for this writing system the astra image corporation designed the symbols currently used to write klingon for star trek the motion picture although these symbols are often incorrectly attributed to michael okuda44 they based the letters on the klingon battlecruiser hull markings three letters first created by matt jefferies and on tibetan writing because the script has sharp letter forms—used as a testament to the klingons love for knives and blades for april fools day in 2013 nokia and typography company dalton maag claimed to have used communication devices to farflung star systems45 to assist them in localising the nokia pure font to the klingon writing system though the explanation was of course humorous in nature as part of the practical joke a series of real fonts based upon the most commonly used piqad character mapping were in fact developed and have been made available for free download45 vocabularyedit a design principle of the klingon language is the great degree of lexicalcultural correlation in the vocabulary for example there are several words meaning to fight or to clash against each having a different degree of intensity there is an abundance of words relating to warfare and weaponry and also a great variety of curses cursing is considered a fine art in klingon culture this helps lend a particular character to the language there are many injokes built into the language46 for example the word for pair is chang’eng a reference to the original siamese twins chang and eng a guitar is a lespal ie les paul3 the word for ritualized torture by women is be’joy be means woman hangover is ’uh3 and the word for fish is ghoti’47 sources for the vocabulary include english albeit heavily disguised and also yiddish sa’hut for buttocks from תּחת tuches spelled backwards3 and ’oy’ for ache pain sore cf oy vey48 many english words do not have direct translations
