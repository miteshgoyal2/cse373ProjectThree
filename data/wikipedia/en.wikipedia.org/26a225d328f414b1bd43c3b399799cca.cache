industrialist from new bern north carolina he coined the name pepsicola in 1898 as the cola developed in popularity he created the pepsicola company in 1902 and registered a patent for his recipe in 19035 the pepsicola company was first incorporated in the state of delaware in 19196 the company went bankrupt in 1931 and on june 8 of that year the trademark and syrup recipe were purchased by charles guth who owned a syrup manufacturing business in baltimore guth was also the president of loft incorporated a leading candy manufacturer and he used the companys labs and chemists to reformulate the syrup he further contracted to stock the soda in lofts large chain of candy shops and restaurants which were known for their soda fountains used loft resources to promote pepsi and moved the soda company to a location close by lofts own facilities in new york city in 1935 the shareholders of loft sued guth for his 91 stake of pepsicola company in the landmark case guth v loft inc loft won the suit and on may 29 1941 formally absorbed pepsi into loft which was then rebranded as pepsicola company that same year loft restaurants and candy stores were spun off at this time in

chevys fresh mex california pizza kitchen15 stolichnaya16 via licensed agreement wilson sporting goods17 and north american van lines18 the divestments concluding in 1997 were followed by multiple

market share in carbonated soft drink sales within the us29 in the same year pepsico maintained a higher share of the us refreshment beverage market however reflecting the differences in product lines

that it is committed to delivering sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for people and our planet3174 which it has defined in its mission statement since 2006 as performance with purpose75 according to news and magazine coverage on the subject in 2010 the objective of this initiative is to increase the number and variety of healthier food and beverage products made available to its customers76 employ a reduction in the companys environmental impact77 and to facilitate diversity and healthy lifestyles within its employee basecitation needed its activities in regards to the pursuit of its goals—namely environmental impacts of production and the nutritional composition of its products—have been the subject of recognition from health and environmental advocates and organizations and at times have raised concerns among its critics as the result of a more recent focus on such efforts critics consider pepsico to be perhaps the most proactive and progressive of the food companies according to former new york times food industry writer melanie warner in 201078 environmental recordedit rainforests and palm oiledit pepsico palm oil commitments79 published in may 2014 were welcomed by media as a positive step towards ensuring that the companys palm oil purchases will not contribute to deforestation and human rights abuses in the palm oil industry ngos warned 80 that the commitments did not go far enough and in light of the deforestation crisis in southeast asia have called on the company to close the gaps in its policies immediately genetically modified food ingredientsedit pepsico has contributed 1716300 to oppose the passage of california proposition 37 which would mandate the disclosure of genetically modified crops used in the production of california food products818283 pepsico believes that geneticallymodified products can play a role in generating positive economic social and environmental contributions to societies around the world particularly in times of food shortages84 water usage india us ukedit pepsicos usage of water was the subject of controversy in india in the early and mid2000s in part because of the companys alleged impact on water usage in a country where water shortages are a perennial issue in this setting pepsico was perceived by indiabased environmental organizations as a company that diverted water to manufacture a discretionary product making it a target for critics at the time85 as a result in 2003 pepsico launched a countrywide program to achieve a positive water balance in india by 200986 in 2007 pepsicos ceo indra nooyi made a trip to india to address water usage practices in the country prompting prior critic sunita narain director of the centre for science environment cse to note that pepsico seems to be doing something serious about water now85 according to the companys 2009 corporate citizenship report74 as well as media reports at the time78 the company in 2009 replenished nearly six billion liters of water within india exceeding the aggregate water intake of approximately five billion liters by pepsicos india manufacturing facilities74 water usage concerns have arisen at times in other countries where pepsico operates in the us water shortages in certain regions resulted in increased scrutiny on the companys production facilities which were cited in media reports as being among the largest water users in cities facing drought—such as atlanta georgia8788 in response the company formed partnerships with nonprofit organizations such as the earth institute and waterorg and in 2009 began cleaning new gatorade bottles with purified air instead of rinsing with water among other water conservation practices89 in the united kingdom also in response to regional drought conditions pepsico snacks brand walkers reduced water usage at its largest potato chip facility by 45 percent between the years 2001 and 2008 in doing so the factory used machinery that captured water naturally contained in potatoes and used it to offset the need for outside water9091 as a result of water reduction practices and efficiency improvements pepsico in 2009 saved more than 12 billion liters of water worldwide92 compared to its 2006 water usage environmental advocacy organizations including the natural resources defense council and individual critics such as rocky anderson mayor of salt lake city utah voiced concerns in 2009 noting that the company could conserve additional water by refraining from the production of discretionary products such as aquafina93 the company maintained its positioning of bottled water as healthy and convenient while also beginning to partially offset environmental impacts of such products through alternate means including packaging weight reduction93 pesticide regulation indiaedit pepsicos india operations were met with substantial resistance in 2003 and again in 2006 when an environmental organization in new delhi made the claim that based on its research it believed that the levels of pesticides in pepsico along with those from rival the cocacola company exceeded a set of proposed safety standards on soft drink ingredients that had been developed by the bureau of indian standards94 pepsico denied the allegations and indias health ministry has also dismissed the allegations—both questioning the accuracy of the data compiled by the cse as it was tested by its own internal laboratories without being verified by outside peer review9596 the ensuing dispute prompted a shortlived ban on the sale of pepsico and the cocacola company soft drinks within indias southwestern state of kerala in 200697 however this ban was reversed by the kerala high court one month later98 in november 2010 the supreme court of india invalidated a criminal complaint filed against pepsico india by the kerala government on the basis that the beverages did meet local standards at the time of the allegations the court ruling stated that the percentage of pesticides found in the tested beverages was within the tolerance limits subsequently prescribed in respect of such product since at the time of testing there was no provision governing pesticide adulteration in cold drinks99100 in 2010 pepsico was among the 12 multinational companies that displayed the most impressive corporate social responsibility credentials in emerging markets as determined by the us department of state101 pepsicos india unit received recognition on the basis of its water conservation and safety practices and corresponding results102 packaging and recyclingedit environmental advocates have raised concern over the environmental impacts surrounding the disposal of pepsicos bottled beverage products in particular as bottle recycling rates for the companys products in 2009 averaged 34 percent within the us103 the company has employed efforts to minimize these environmental impacts via packaging developments combined with recycling initiatives in 2010 pepsico announced a goal to create partnerships that prompt an increase in the beverage container recycling rate in the us to 50 percent by 2018104 one strategy enacted to reach this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called dream machines in supermarkets convenience stores and gas stations with the intent of increasing access to recycling receptacles105106 the use of resin to manufacture its plastic bottles has resulted in reduced packaging weight which in turn reduces the volume of fossil fuels required to transport certain pepsico products the weight of aquafina bottles was reduced nearly 40 percent to 15 grams with a packaging redesign in 2009 also in that year pepsico brand naked juice began production and distribution of the first 100 percent postconsumer recycled plastic bottle107 on march 15 2011 pepsico unveiled the worlds first plantbased pet bottle the bottle is made from plantbased materials such as switch grass corn husks and pine bark and is 100 recyclable pepsico plans to use more byproducts of their manufacturing processes such as orange peels and oat hulls in the bottles pepsico has identified methods to create a molecular structure that is the same as normal petroleumbased pet—which will make the new bottle technology dubbed green bottle feel the same as normal pet pepsico will pilot production in 2012 and upon successful completion of the pilot intends moving to fullscale commercialization108 energy usage and carbon footprintedit pepsico along with other manufacturers in its industry has drawn criticism from environmental advocacy groups for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging which consumed an additional 15 billion us gallons 5700000 m3 of petrochemicals in 2008 these critics have also expressed apprehension over the production volume of plastic packaging which results in the emission of carbon dioxide109 beginning largely in 2006 pepsico began development of more efficient means of producing and distributing its products using less energy110 while also placing a focus on emissions reduction109 in a comparison of 2009 energy usage with recorded usage in 2006 the companys perunit use of energy was reduced by 16 percent in its beverage plants and 7 percent in snack plants74 in 2009 tropicana owned by pepsico was the first brand in the us to determine the carbon footprint of its orange juice product as certified by the carbon trust an outside auditor of carbon emissions111 also in 2009 pepsico began the test deployment of socalled green vending machines which reduce energy usage by 15 percent in comparison to average models in use it developed these machines in coordination with greenpeace which described the initiative as transforming the industry in a way that is going to be more climatefriendly to a great degree111 product nutritionedit product diversityedit from its founding in 1965 until the early 1990s the majority of pepsicos product line consisted of carbonated soft drinks and convenience snacks pepsico broadened its product line substantially throughout the 1990s and 2000s with the acquisition and development of what its ceo deemed as goodforyou products including quaker oats naked juice and tropicana orange juice112 sales of such healthieroriented pepsico brands totaled 10 billion in 2009 representing 18 percent of the companys total revenue in that year this movement into a broader healthier product range has been moderately well received by nutrition advocates though commentators in this field have also suggested that pepsico market its healthier items as aggressively as lesshealthy core products113 in response to shifting consumer preferences and in part due to increasing governmental regulation pepsico in 2010 indicated its intention to grow this segment of its business forecasting that sales of fruit vegetable whole grain and fiberbased products will amount to 30 billion by 2020114115 to meet this intended target the company has said that it plans to acquire additional healthoriented brands while also making changes to the composition of existing products that it sells115 ingredient changes in pepsiedit public health advocates have suggested that there may be a link between the ingredient makeup of pepsicos core snack and carbonated soft drink products and rising rates of health conditions such as obesity and diabetes the company aligns with personal responsibility advocates who assert that food and beverages with higher proportions of sugar or salt content are fit for consumption in moderation by individuals who also exercise on a regular basis116 changes to the composition of its products with nutrition in mind have involved reducing fat content moving away from transfats and producing products in caloriespecific serving sizes to discourage overconsumption among other changes76 one of the earlier ingredient changes involved sugar and caloric reduction with the introduction of diet pepsi in 1964 and pepsi max in 1993—both of which are variants of their fullcalorie counterpart pepsi more recent changes have consisted of saturated fat reduction which fritolay reduced by 50 in lays and ruffles potato chips in the us between 2006 and 2009116 also in 2009 pepsicos tropicana brand introduced a new variation of orange juice trop50 sweetened in part by the plant stevia which reduced calories by half116 since 2007 the company also made available lowercalorie variants of gatorade which it calls g2117 on may 5 2014 pepsico announced that the company would remove the flame retardant chemical known as brominated vegetable oil from many of its products but ra timeframe was not discusse118 distribution to childrenedit as public perception placed additional scrutiny on the marketing and distribution of carbonated soft drinks to children pepsico announced in 2010 that by 2012 it will remove beverages with higher sugar content from primary and secondary schools worldwide119 it also under voluntary guidelines adopted in 2006 replaced fullcalorie beverages in us schools with lowercalorie alternatives leading to a 95 percent reduction in the 2009 sales of fullcalorie variants in these schools in comparison to the sales recorded in 2004120 in 2008 in accordance with guidelines adopted by the international council of beverages associations pepsico eliminated the advertising and marketing of products that do not meet its nutrition standards to children under the age of 12121122 in 2010 first lady michelle obama initiated a campaign to end childhood obesity titled lets move in which she sought to encourage healthier food options in public schools improved food nutrition labeling and increased physical activity for children in response to this initiative pepsico along with food manufacturers campbell soup cocacola general mills and others in an alliance referred to as the healthy weight commitment foundation announced in 2010 that the companies will collectively cut one trillion calories from their products sold by the end of 2012 and 15 trillion calories by the end of 2015123 see alsoedit cola wars joan crawford list
