january 31 1993 at the rose bowl in pasadena california the seventh and most recent super bowl until 2022 when los angeles hosts again that the greater los angeles area has hosted the bills advanced to their third consecutive super bowl after posting an 11–5 regular season record but entered the playoffs as a wild card after losing tiebreakers the cowboys were making their sixth super bowl appearance after posting a 13–3 regular season record it was the first time that the two franchises had played each other since 1984 dallas forced a super bowl record nine turnovers—four interceptions and five lost fumbles—en route to their win over buffalo thirtyfive of the cowboys points came off those turnovers including three first half touchdowns bills backup quarterback frank reich who replaced injured starter jim kelly in the second quarter threw a 40yard touchdown on the final play of the third quarter to cut the lead to 31–17 but dallas scored three more touchdowns in the fourth quarter another cowboys touchdown could have been scored on defensive lineman leon letts fumble return but he was stripped of the ball by buffalo wide receiver don beebe before crossing the buffalo goal line and the football rolled into the buffalo end zone and out of bounds for a touchback cowboys quarterback troy aikman was named super bowl mvp completing 22 of 30 passes for 273 yards and four touchdowns for a passer rating of 1406 while also rushing for 28 yards michael jackson performed during the entire halftime show jacksons performance started the nfls trend of signing top acts to

super bowl xxvii was originally scheduled to be played at sun devil stadium in tempe arizona the home of the phoenix cardinals6 in 1983 us president ronald reagan signed a bill creating martin luther king jr day a national holiday honoring africanamerican civil rights leader martin luther king jr in 1986 the first year that the holiday was observed arizona governor bruce babbitt a democrat had issued an executive order creating the holiday after the state legislature voted against it babbitts successor republican evan mecham rescinded the order on the grounds that babbitt did not have the authority to issue such an order and arizona ceased to observe mlk day for the time being mecham also made his displeasure for the holiday widely known saying that king did not deserve a holiday and that black supporters of the law should have been more concerned about getting jobs7 in response dr kings widow coretta scott king and musician stevie wonder spearheaded a complete entertainment and convention boycott of arizona blacks across the nation supported the boycott in 1989 after mecham was impeached the state legislature approved the holiday however arizonas state constitution required new holidays to be approved via initiatives to be approved by popular vote89 on march 13 1990 the nfl had its annual meeting in orlando florida and one of the items on its agenda was to determine a host city for super bowl xxvii among the cities being considered was tempe and arizona civil rights activist art mobley was sent to the meeting to make sure that the arizona ballot initiative was a talking point at the discussion the vote was conducted and tempe was awarded the game but committee chairman and philadelphia eagles owner norman braman warned that if the mlk day ballot initiative went against adoption of the holiday the nfl would not hesitate to pull the game from arizona and move it somewhere else the fact that the majority of nfl players were africanamerican was a big factor into this threat as many of them felt uncomfortable of having the super bowl in a state that didnt recognize a national holiday honoring martin luther king jr polls showed that over 60 of the electorate approved of an mlk holiday in arizona however the issue was confused since there were two competing initiatives and it was not clear that voters could vote yes for both one initiative called for replacing presidents day with mlk day while the other called for a new holiday on mlks birthday both initiatives required a yesno vote and voters were confused if they could vote yes on both each initiative was defeated however a professor of statistics at arizona state university demonstrated that all the yesyes yesno and noyes votes totaled just over 60 of ballots cast which corresponded with every poll taken prior to and after the vote the nfl responded by making good on its threat to remove the super bowl from tempe and held another vote in kohala hawaii on march 19 1991 with pasadena chosen as the site for the first time since super bowl xxi was played there six years earlier arizona voters approved the mlk day holiday in the 1992 elections when voters were simply asked to vote yes or no on whether or not arizona should recognize an mlk day the nfl responded by awarding tempe super bowl xxx at their 1993 meeting buffalo billsedit main article 1992 buffalo bills season the bills entered super bowl xxvii trying to avoid becoming the first team to lose three consecutive super bowls once again the team was loaded with pro bowl players boasting 12 pro bowl selections during the regular season buffalos nohuddle offense ranked as the number two offense in the league 6114 yards and ranked as the number one rushing offense 2436 yards running back thurman thomas rushed for a careerhigh 1487 yards and 9 touchdowns during the regular season while also catching 58 passes for 626 yards and another 3 touchdowns running back kenneth davis rushed for 613 yards caught 15 passes for 80 yards and added another 251 yards returning kickoffs quarterback jim kelly had 269 out of 462 completions for 3457 yards 23 touchdowns and 19 interceptions wide receiver andre reed led the team with 65 receptions for 913 yards and 3 touchdowns receiver james lofton contributed 51 receptions for 786 yards and 6 touchdowns and wide receiver don beebe caught 33 passes for 554 and 2 touchdowns also tight end pete metzelaars recorded 30 receptions for 298 yards and 6 touchdowns the bills also had one of the best offensive lines in the nfl led by pro bowlers will wolford jim ritcher and howard ballard along with center kent hull on defense the line was anchored by end bruce smith 14 sacks and nose tackle jeff wright 6 sacks 1 fumble recovery who were both fully recovered after missing almost all of the previous season due to injuries the bills were once again led by their trio of linebackers darryl talley 77 tackles 4 sacks shane conlan 66 tackles 2 sacks 1 interception and pro bowler cornelius bennett 52 tackles 4 sacks 3 fumble recoveries the secondary was aided by the emergence of secondyear safety henry jones who tied for the nfl lead with 8 interceptions returning them for 263 yards and 2 touchdowns safety mark kelso recorded 7 interceptions while pro bowl cornerback nate odomes had 5 however the bills quest for a third consecutive super bowl suffered a major setback when they lost the final game of the season to the houston oilers the loss caused the bills to finish with an 11–5 record losing out on the afc east title to the miami dolphins based on tiebreaking rules and thus making them a wild card team for the playoffs thus even if they won their first playoff game they would have to win two on the road to make the super bowl to make matters worse kelly also suffered strained knee ligaments during the loss to the oilers and had to miss the first two playoff games furthermore their first opponent in the playoffs ended up being the oilers a headline on a buffalo newspaper stated the bills situation bills begin the longest road today dallas cowboysedit main article 1992 dallas cowboys season super bowl xxvii saw the resurrection of the dallas cowboys from 1966 to 1985 the team made the playoffs 18 out of 20 seasons under coach tom landry including five super bowl appearances and two super bowl wins but in the late 1980s the team suffered several losing seasons including a 3–13 regular season record in 1988 then jerry jones bought the team on february 25 1989 and in a controversial move promptly fired landry the only coach dallas had ever had in 29 years as an nfl franchise jones replaced landry with university of miami head coach jimmy johnson with johnson as head coach and jones as his own general manager people in the league thought they could take advantage of them both lacked nfl experience and instead of hiring coaching assistants with experience in the league they hired ones that worked with johnson in miami compounding this issue was the departure of the two men that brought previous success to dallas founding president tex schramm and famed personnel man gil brandt the cowboys 3–13 record in 1988 did have a silver lining it was the worst in the league and thus gave the cowboys the first pick in the 1989 nfl draft jones and johnson picked ucla quarterback troy aikman who would eventually go on to be selected to the pro bowl six times in his nfl career meanwhile jones and johnson immediately started to shuffle the teams depth chart to find players talented enough to build a winning team linebacker ken norton jr one of the few holdovers from landrys last losing seasons would later claim that he would often go into a player huddle and meet new teammates for the first time then jones and johnson made a move midway through the 1989 season that shocked many in the league they traded their only pro bowl player running back herschel walker to the minnesota vikings for five veteran players and eight draft choices although the cowboys finished the 1989 season with a 1–15 record their worst record since the teams inception the foundations for the cowboys return to glory had been set although dallas had the leagues worst record they traded away the first pick in the 1990 draft so they could get backup quarterback steve walsh in the supplemental draft then with the 17th pick they drafted running back emmitt smith and the trifecta of aikman smith and wide receiver michael irvin who was drafted by landry in 1988 was now set dallas also signed veteran tight end jay novacek away from phoenix who went on to make the pro bowl in five of his six years with the cowboys johnson also started to rebuild the team by drafting players who were fast quick and athletic the defense was designed to become aggressive while the offense was made to be a conservative one that did not make mistakes in 1990 the cowboys finished 7–9 but smith won the nfl rookie of the year award and johnson was selected as nfl coach of the year in 1991 the cowboys finished with an 11–5 record and made the playoffs for the first time in six years in 1992 the cowboys finished with a 13–3 regular season record the secondbest in the league although not a single one of their defensive players made the pro bowl dallas was ranked as the number one defense in the league allowing only 4278 yards fourth in fewest points allowed 243 and ranked as the number one defense against the run allowing only 1244 yards bringing back many fans memories of the doomsday defenses of old the defensive line was anchored by jim jeffcoat 105 sacks and tony tolbert 85 sacks along with future hall of fame pass rusher charles haley six sacks who had led the nfc in sacks in 1990 and had been acquired by dallas in a trade with san francisco while norton and defensive rookie of the year robert jones anchored the linebacking corps the teams solid secondary was led by defensive backs kenneth gant and james washington who both recorded 3 interceptions each and rookie cornerback kevin smith the last member of the secondary was defensive back issiac holt who had been acquired as part of the trade with the vikings for walker dallas offense finished second in the league in scoring with 409 points aikman had the best season of his career completing 302 out of 473 passes ranking second and fourth in the league for 3445 yards fourth in the league and 23 touchdowns third in the league while throwing only 14 interceptions producing a quarterback rating of 896 third best in the league smith led the nfl in rushing for the second year in a row with 1713 yards and scoring 18 rushing touchdowns while also catching 59 passes for 335 yards and a touchdown fullback daryl johnston was also an asset in the backfield providing smith with effective blocking and hauling in 32 receptions irvin the teams emotional lightning rod caught 78 passes for 1396 yards and 7 touchdowns other contributors on the offense included wide receiver alvin harper 35 receptions for 562 yards and 4 touchdowns and novacek 68 receptions for 630 yards and 6 touchdowns dallas dominant offensive line later dubbed the great wall of dallas was led by pro bowlers nate newton and mark stepnoski along with 10year veteran mark tuinei free agent acquisiton john gesek and the youngster erik williams with all this talent the cowboys would be considered by many to be one of the deepest and most talented teams to ever take to the gridiron playoffsedit see also 1992–93 nfl playoffs the cowboys easily defeated their first playoff opponent the philadelphia eagles 34–10 dallas defense held the eagles to only 178 offensive yards and sacked quarterback randall cunningham five times meanwhile the cowboys recorded 160 rushing yards and 185 passing yards aikman completed 15 of 25 passes and 2 touchdowns while smith ran for 114 yards and a touchdown dallas then defeated the san francisco 49ers 30–20 in the nfc championship game this was the first time that the two teams met in the nfc championship since the 49ers narrowly beat the cowboys in the 1981 nfc championship game on a late touchdown pass known as the catch the 49ers came into the game with the leagues best regular season record at 14–2 and led the league in scoring with 431 points but in this game the cowboys built a 24–13 lead going into the fourth quarter as aikman capped a nineminute drive with a 16yard touchdown pass to smith however 49ers quarterback steve youngs 5yard touchdown pass to jerry rice cut the lead to 24–20 with 422 left in the game but instead of trying to run out the clock with a running play aikman threw a 70yard completion to harper three plays later aikman threw a 6yard touchdown pass to wide receiver kelvin martin to clinch the victory the extra point was blocked aikman finished with 332 passing yards and 2 touchdowns with no interceptions the bills first defeated the houston oilers 41–38 in overtime overcoming a 32point deficit10 in what became known as the comeback nothing seemed to go right for the bills in the first half in addition to playing without kelly and bennett thomas was knocked out of the game with a hip injury the bills offense could only score a single field goal while their defense played even worse as oilers quarterback warren moon passed for 222 yards and 4 touchdowns and houston jumped to a 28–3 halftime lead then backup quarterback frank reichs first pass of the second half was intercepted by bubba mcdowell and returned 58 yards for a touchdown making the score 35–3 however the bills suddenly stormed back to score five unanswered touchdowns to overcome the seemingly insurmountable deficit first kenneth davis scored on a 1yard touchdown run then buffalo recovered an onside kick and immediately scored again on reichs 36yard touchdown pass to don beebe reich then threw touchdowns of 26 and 18 yards to andre reed in the fourth quarter reich hit reed with a 17yard score to give the bills a 38–35 lead the oilers kicked a field goal late in the game to send it into overtime but nate odomes interception in the extra period set up kicker steve christies gamewinning field goal to give the bills the biggest comeback win in nfl history11 buffalo then recorded a 24–3 win on the road against the pittsburgh steelers the afc central champions with the afcs best regular season record at 11–5 although jim kelly and thurman thomas had not recovered enough to play in this game reich threw for 160 yards 2 touchdowns and no interceptions while davis rushed for 104 yards and a touchdown meanwhile the defense redeemed themselves after giving up 38 points against the oilers by holding the steelers to only a field goal the bills then defeated the miami dolphins 29–10 in the afc championship game the dolphins were coming off a 31–0 blowout playoff win over the san diego chargers but buffalos defense dominated the dolphins offense intercepting quarterback dan marino twice recovering three fumbles and limiting miami to just 33 rushing yards although buffalos offense had trouble scoring touchdowns because kelly and thomas were rusty coming back from their injuries christie scored five field goals to make up for the difference kelly did connect with thomas on a screen pass for a 17yard touchdown and davis ran it in from two yards out for another score as a result the bills became the fourth wildcard team to advance to the super bowl this marked the first time since the afl–nfl merger that the two super bowl teams each won their conference championship on the road with dallas winning in san francisco and buffalo in miami the only time it happened prior to 1992 was in 1966 super bowl i when kansas city won at buffalo and green bay won at dallas this would happen again in 1997 with green bay winning in san francisco and denver in pittsburgh and in 2012 with san francisco winning in atlanta and baltimore in new england super bowl pregame news and notesedit even though the bills had more experienced players than the cowboys dallas was favored to win super bowl xxvii based on the recent dominance of nfc teams in the super bowl some writers and fans were starting to compare buffalo to the super bowl losers minnesota vikings and the denver broncos still many thought that the inexperienced cowboys might panic under the pressure of playing in their first super bowl and thus make a number of mistakes also some thought buffalos nohuddle offense could eventually wear down and dominate dallas young defense finally jimmy johnson was looking to become the first head coach to win a college football national championship university of miami in 1987 and a super bowl as of today johnson cowboys successor barry switzer and current seattle

summaryedit first quarteredit super bowl xxvii started out well for buffalo the cowboys were forced to a threeandout on their opening possession bills special teams expert steve tasker then blocked the ensuing punt knocking the ball out of bounds at the cowboys 16yard line four plays later thurman thomas scored on a 2yard touchdown run to give the bills the 7–0 early lead dallas then reached their own 40yard line on their next drive but an illegal formation penalty nullified running back emmitt smiths 12yard run troy aikman then threw two consecutive incompletions and the cowboys were forced to punt again the bills subsequently advanced to midfield with the aid of a 15yard roughing the passer penalty on cowboys defensive lineman leon lett and a 21yard reception by wide receiver andre reed then the wave of turnovers began on the next play a blitz by reserve defensive back kenneth gant forced a pass by jim kelly that dallas safety james washington intercepted and returned 13 yards to the bills 47yard line six plays later the cowboys tied the game on aikmans 23yard touchdown pass to tight end jay novacek the bills had to start at their own 10 following the ensuing kickoff due to an illegal block17 on the first play of the drive dallas defensive end charles haley sacked kelly and forced a fumble cowboys defensive tackle jimmie jones picked the ball out of the air at the 2yard line and dove into the end zone for a touchdown to give his team a 14–7 lead dallas had scored two touchdowns in a span of 15 seconds the shortest time between touchdowns in super bowl history second quarteredit early in the second quarter kellys 40yard completion to reed gave the bills a first down at the cowboys 4yard line but the bills failed to score on three rushing attempts on fourth down kellys pass was intercepted in the end zone by safety thomas everett on buffalos next drive linebacker ken norton jr hit kelly reinjuring the quarterbacks knee that he sprained earlier in the season and playoff star frank reich took kellys place reich started out well completing his first two passes including a 38yard completion to reed to advance the ball to the dallas 22yard line while running back kenneth davis was also a major contributor on the drive rushing five times for 28 yards however thomas was stopped for no gain on third down and 1 at the 4yard line rather than attempt another fourthdown play near the goal line the bills settled for steve christies 21yard field goal to cut their deficit to 14–10 with 324 left in the half the cowboys then stormed down the field on their next possession scoring in just five plays after a pair of completions by aikman for 17 yards smiths 38yard run gave the cowboys a first down inside the bills 20yard line as the half came to the 2minute warning aikman then finished the drive with a 19yard touchdown pass to wide receiver michael irvin increasing his teams lead to 21–10 on the first play of the bills ensuing drive thomas caught a swing pass but fumbled the ball while being tackled by lett and jones recovered it at the bills 18yard line aikman then threw his second touchdown pass to irvin to give the cowboys a 28–10 lead irvins two touchdown receptions made him the 7th player to do so in a super bowl irvin also became the second player after washington redskins wide receiver ricky sanders in super bowl xxii to catch two touchdowns in a single quarter furthermore irvins two catches occurred in a span of 18 seconds the fastest pair of touchdowns ever scored by a single player in super bowl history with a little over a minute left in the first half buffalo barely avoided another turnover when running back kenneth davis recovered a fumbled handoff from reich but two plays later defensive back larry brown intercepted reichs pass at the dallas 28yard line to preserve the cowboys 18point lead at halftime third quarteredit dallas then took the opening drive of the second half and advanced 77 yards in 11 plays featuring a 25yard reception by irvin however on third down and 2 aikmans pass to novacek in the end zone was overthrown forcing dallas to settle for lin elliotts 20yard field goal this increased their lead to 31–10 both teams were unable to score on each of their next possessions but on the last play of the quarter reich threw a 40yard touchdown pass to receiver don beebe despite cowboy complaints that the touchdown should have been nullified because reich while scrambling to avoid the cowboy rush crossed the 40yard line for what should have been ruled an illegal forward pass so despite five firsthalf turnovers buffalo was only trailing dallas 31–17 going into the 4th quarter and after their comeback from the 32point deficit to the houston oilers a 14point comeback seemed perfectly within their capabilities fourth quarteredit early in the 4th quarter aikman threw a 45yard touchdown pass to alvin harper then on the second play of the bills next possession everett intercepted a pass from reich and returned it 22 yards to buffalos 8yard line setting up another touchdown three plays later on smiths 10yard run after buffalo received the ensuing kickoff reich fumbled a high snap while in a shotgun formation norton recovered the loose ball and returned it 9 yards for a touchdown increasing the cowboys lead to 52–17 the 21 points by the cowboys is the most ever for a team in the 4th quarter the cowboys also became just the second team to score two nonoffensive touchdowns in a super bowl the raiders also did so in super bowl xviii with a blocked punt return and an interception return the most memorable moment of the game came well after the cowboys had built an insurmountable lead after both teams lost a fumble on their next possessions the bills managed to advance to the cowboys 31yard line but reich lost a fumble while being sacked by cowboys lineman jim jeffcoat lett picked up the ball with no one in front of him and appeared to be headed for a 64yard touchdown return as he started to showboat just before crossing the goal line beebe raced in from behind and knocked the ball out of letts arm and into the end zone the ball then rolled out of bounds for a touchback if lett had scored the touchdown the cowboys would have topped the previous super bowl record of 55 points scored in a game that the 49ers had set three years prior smith was the top rusher of the game rushing for 108 yards and a touchdown while also catching 6 passes for 27 yards irvin was the cowboys leading receiver with 6 receptions for 114 yards and 2 touchdowns novacek added 7 receptions for 72 yards and a touchdown lett recorded a sack a fumble recovery and 2 forced fumbles reich and kelly combined for 22 out of 38 completions for 276 yards and a touchdown but also threw 4 interceptions thomas who gained 2113 combined rushing and receiving yards during the season was held to just 29 combined rushing and receiving yards in the game reed was the bills top receiver with 8 receptions for 152 yards bills running back kenneth davis was their leading rusher with 86 yards davis also caught 3 passes for 16 yards and returned a kickoff for 21 yards giving him 123 total yards buffalo had seven possessions which ended in four plays or less because of turnovers and resulted in five dallas touchdowns17 irvin and bills receiver andre reed each had over 100 yards receiving making it the first time players from different teams had at least 100 yards receiving in a super bowl irvin had 114 yards while reed had 152 reeds total is the highest for a player on
