with the european space agency in darmstadt germany exploring virtual reality for controlling planetary rovers and satellites in orbit virtual reality vr is a computer technology that uses virtual reality headsets or multiprojected environments sometimes in combination with physical environments or props to generate realistic images sounds and other sensations that simulate a users physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment a person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world and with high quality vr move around in it and interact with virtual features or items the effect is commonly created by vr headsets consisting of headmounted goggles with a screen in front of the eyes but can also be created through specially designed spaces with multiple large screens vr systems that include transmission of vibrations and other sensations to the user through a game controller or other devices are known as haptic systems this tactile information is generally known as force feedback in medical video gaming and military training applications virtual reality also refers to remote communication environments which provide a virtual presence of users with through telepresence and telexistence or the use of a virtual artifact va the immersive environment can be similar to the real world in order to create a lifelike experience grounded in reality or scifi augmented reality systems may also be considered a form of vr that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a smartphone or tablet

external links etymology and terminologyedit paramount for the sensation of immersion into virtual reality are a high frame rate at least 95 fps as well as a low latency furthermore a pixel persistence lower than 3 ms is required because if not users will feel sick when moving their head aroundcitation needed in 1938 antonin artaud described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the theatre as la réalité virtuelle in a collection of essays le théâtre et son double the english translation of this book published in 1958 as the theater and its double1 is the earliest published use of the term virtual reality the term artificial reality coined by myron krueger has been in use since the 1970s the term virtual reality was used in the judas mandala a 1982 science fiction novel by damien broderick virtual reality industry research report is a meticulous investigation of current scenario of the market which covers several market dynamics the global market research report is a resource which provides current as well as upcoming technical and financial details of the industry virtual has had the meaning being something in essence or effect though not actually or in fact since the mid1400s probably via sense of capable of producing a certain effect early 1400s2 the term virtual has been used in the computer sense of not physically existing but made to appear by software since 19592 a cyberspace is a networked virtual reality3 virtual reality shares some elements with augmented reality or ar4 ar is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software the additional softwaregenerated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way some ar systems use a camera to capture the users surroundings or some type of display screen which the user looks at eg microsofts hololens magic leap technologyedit the virtual reality modelling language vrml first introduced in 1994 was intended for the development of virtual worlds without dependency on headsets5 the web3d consortium was subsequently founded in 1997 for the development of industry standards for webbased 3d graphics the consortium subsequently developed x3d from the vrml framework as an archival opensource standard for webbased distribution of vr content6 all modern vr displays are based on technology developed for smartphones including gyroscopes and motion sensors for tracking head hand and body positions small hd screens for stereoscopic displays and small lightweight and fast processors these components led to relative affordability for independent vr developers and lead to the 2012 oculus rift kickstarter offering the first independently developed vr headset7 independent production of vr images and video has increased by the development of omnidirectional cameras also known as 360degree cameras or vr cameras that have the ability to record in all directions although at lowresolutions or in highly compressed formats for online streaming8 in contrast photogrammetry is increasingly used to combine several highresolution photographs for the creation of detailed 3d objects and environments in vr applications910 historyedit before the 1950sedit the sensorama was released in the 1950s viewmaster a stereoscopic visual simulator was introduced in 1939 the exact origins of virtual reality are disputed partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence11 elements of virtual reality appeared as early as the 1860s french avantgarde playwright antonin artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality12 the first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from science fiction stanley g weinbaums 1935 short story pygmalions spectacles13 describes a gogglebased virtual reality system with holographic recording of fictional experiences including smell and touch 1950–1970edit morton heilig wrote in the 1950s of an experience theatre that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity he built a prototype of his vision dubbed the sensorama in 1962 along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses sight sound smell and touch predating digital computing the sensorama was a mechanical device heilig also developed what he referred to as the telesphere mask patented in 1960 the patent application described the device as a telescopic television apparatus for individual usethe spectator is given a complete sensation of reality ie moving three dimensional images which may be in colour with 100 peripheral vision binaural sound scents and air breezes14 around the same time douglas engelbart used computer screens both as input and output devices in 1968 ivan sutherland with the help of his student bob sproull created what was widely considered to be the first headmounted display hmd system for use in immersive simulation applications it was primitive both in terms of user interface and realism and the hmd to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling the graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple wireframe model rooms the formidable appearance of the device inspired its name the sword of damocles 1970–1990edit battlezone an arcade video game from 1980 used 3d vector graphics to immerse the player in a vr worldatari also notable among the earlier hypermedia and virtual reality systems was the aspen movie map which was created at mit in 1978 the program was a crude virtual simulation of aspen colorado in which users could wander the streets in one of the three modes summer winter and polygons the first two were based on photographs—the researchers actually photographed every possible movement through the citys street grid in both seasons—and the third was a basic 3d model of the city atari founded a research lab for virtual reality in 1982 but the lab was closed after two years due to atari shock north american video game crash of 1983 however its hired employees such as tom zimmerman scott fisher jaron lanier and brenda laurel kept their research and development on vrrelated technologies by the 1980s the term virtual reality was popularized by jaron lanier one of the modern pioneers of the field lanier had founded the company vpl research in 1985 vpl research has developed several vr devices like the data glove the eye phone and the audio sphere vpl licensed the data glove technology to mattel which used it to make an accessory known as the power glove while the power glove was hard to use and not popular at us75 it was an early affordable vr device the vr industry mainly provided vr devices for medical flight simulation automobile industry design and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990citation needed 1990–2000edit in 1991 carolina cruzneira daniel j sandin and thomas a defanti from the electronic visualization laboratory created the first cubic immersive room the cave developed as cruzneiras phd thesis it involved a multiprojected environment similar to the holodeck allowing people to see their own bodies in relation to others in the room1516 in 1992 researcher louis rosenberg created the virtual fixtures system at the us air force’s armstrong labs using a full upperbody exoskeleton enabling a physically realistic virtual reality in 3d the system enabled the overlay of physically real 3d virtual objects registered with a users direct view of the real world producing the first true augmented reality experience enabling sight sound and touch1718 a vpl research datasuit a fullbody outfit with sensors for measuring the movement of arms legs and trunk developed circa 1989 displayed at the nissho iwai showroom in tokyo the 1990s saw the first widespread commercial releases of consumer headsets in 1991 sega announced the sega vr headset for arcade games and the mega drive console it used lcd screens in the visor stereo headphones and inertial sensors that allowed the system to track and react to the movements of the users head19 in the same year virtuality launched and went on to become the first massproduced networked multiplayer vr entertainment system it was released in many countries including a dedicated vr arcade at embarcadero center in san francisco costing up to 73000 per multipod virtuality system they featured headsets and exoskeleton gloves that gave one of the first immersive vr experiences20 antonio medina a mit graduate and nasa scientist designed a virtual reality system to drive mars rovers from earth in apparent real time despite the substantial delay of marsearthmars signals21 in 1991 computer gaming world predicted affordable vr by 199422 by 1994 sega released the sega vr1 motion simulator arcade attraction2324 in segaworld amusement arcades it was able to track head movement and featured 3d polygon graphics in stereoscopic 3d powered by the sega model 1 arcade system board25 also in 1994 apple released quicktime vr which despite using the term vr was unable to represent virtual reality and instead displayed 360 photographic panoramas the virtual boy was created by nintendo and was released in japan on july 21 1995 and in north america on august 15 199526 also in 1995 a group in seattle created public demonstrations of a cavelike 270 degree immersive projection room called the virtual environment theater produced by entrepreneurs chet dagit and bob jacobson27 the same system was shown in 1996 in tradeshow exhibits sponsored by netscape communicationscitation needed forte released the vfx1 a pcpowered virtual reality headset in 1995 which was supported by games including descent star wars dark forces system shock and quake in 1999 entrepreneur philip rosedale formed linden lab with an initial focus on the development of vr hardware in its earliest form the company struggled to produce a commercial version of the rig which was realized in prototype form as a clunky steel contraption with several computer monitors that users could wear on their shoulders the concept was later adapted into the personal computerbased 3d virtual world second life28 a 2013 developer version of oculus rift from oculus vr the company facebook acquired in 2014 for 2 billion 2000–2015edit in 2001 sas3 or sas cube became the first pc based cubic room developed by za production maurice benayoun david nahon barco clarté installed in laval france in april 2001 the sas library gave birth to virtools vrpack by 2007 google introduced street view a service that shows panoramic views of an increasing number of worldwide positions such as roads indoor buildings and rural areas it also features a stereoscopic 3d mode introduced in 201029 in 2010 palmer luckey designed the first prototype of the oculus rift this prototype built on a shell of another virtual reality headset was only capable of rotational tracking however it boasted a 90degree field of vision that was previously unseen in the consumer market at the time this initial design would later serve as a basis from which the later designs came30 in 2013 valve discovered and freely shared the breakthrough of lowpersistence displays which make lagfree and smearfree display of vr content possible31 this was adopted by oculus and was used in all their future headsets in early 2014 valve showed off their steamsight prototype the precursor to both consumer headsets released in 2016 it shared major features with the consumer headsets including separate 1k displays per eye low persistence positional tracking over a large area and fresnel lenses3233 on march 25 2014 facebook purchased oculus vr for 2 billion34 this purchase occurred before any of the devices ordered through oculus 2012 kickstarter had shipped35 in that same month sony announced project morpheus its code name for playstation vr a virtual reality headset for the playstation 4 video game console36 google announces cardboard a doityourself stereoscopic viewer for smartphones the user places their smartphone in the cardboard holder which they wear on their head in 2015 the kickstarter campaign for gloveone a pair of gloves providing motion tracking and haptic feedback was successfully funded with over 150000 in contributions37 in february–march 2015 htc and valve corporation announced the virtual reality headset htc vive and controllers the set included tracking technology called lighthouse which utilized wallmounted base stations for positional tracking using infrared light38394041 2015–presentedit by 2016 there were at least 230 companies developing vrrelated products facebook has 400 employees focused on vr development google apple amazon microsoft sony and samsung all had dedicated ar and vr groups dynamic binaural audio was common to most headsets released that year however haptic interfaces were not well developed and most hardware packages incorporated buttonoperated handsets for touchbased interactivity visually displays were still of a lowenough resolution and framerate that images were still identifiable as virtual7 on april 5 2016 htc shipped its first units of the htc vive steamvr headset42 this marked the first major commercial release of sensorbased tracking allowing for free movement of users within a defined space43 in early 2017 a patent filed by sony showed they were developing a similar location tracking technology to the vive for playstation vr with the potential for the development of a wireless headset44 useedit this section contains content that is written like an advertisement please help improve it by removing promotional content and

videogames have been released guild softwares vendetta online was widely reported as the first mmorpg to support the oculus rift4748 making it potentially the first persistent online world with native support for a consumer virtual reality headset since 2013 there have been several virtual reality devices that seek to enter the market to complement oculus rift to enhance the game experience one virtuix omni is based on the ability to move in a three dimensional environment through an omnidirectional treadmill on april 27 2016 mojang announced that the popular sandbox video game minecraft was playable on the gear vr49 a separate version was released to the oculus store for use with the gear vr similar to the pocket edition of minecraft some companies are adapting vr for fitness by using gamification concepts to encourage exercise50 cinema and entertainmentedit films produced for vr permit the audience to view a 360 degree environment in every scene production companies such as fox searchlight pictures and skybound utilize vr cameras to produce films and series that are interactive in vr5152 pornographic studios such as naughty america badoinkvr and kink have applied vr into their products since late 2015 or early 2016 the clips and videos are shot from an angle that resembles povstyle porn5354 in september 2016 two announcements were made for broadcast of sporting events in vr agon announced that the upcoming world chess championship match between magnus carlsen and sergey karjakin scheduled for that november would be the first in any sport to be broadcast in 360degree virtual reality55 this title was taken by fox sports fox sports vr a series of virtual reality broadcasts consisting mainly of fox college football broadcasts the telecasts which use roughly 180 degrees of rotation were made available through smartphone apps and headmounted displays through a tv everywhere paywall the first vr telecast which featured oklahoma hosting ohio state took place september 175657 since 2015 virtual reality has been installed onto a number of roller coasters and theme parks including galactica at alton towers the new revolution at six flags magic mountain and alpenexpress at europapark amongst otherscitation needed the void is a virtual reality theme park in pleasant grove utah that has attractions where by using virtual reality ar and customized mechanical rooms an illusion of tangible reality is created by the use of multiple senses7 social science and psychologyedit virtual reality offers social scientists and psychologists a costeffective tool to study and replicate interactions in a controlled environment in addition virtual reality enables a new form of perspectivetaking by allowing an individual to embody the form of a virtual avatar research in this area suggests that embodying another being presents a very different experience from solely imagining ones self as a form58 researchers have used the immersion of virtual reality to investigate how digital stimuli can alter human perception emotion and physiological state and how it has transformed social interaction in addition to studying how digital interaction can enact social change in the physical world altering perception emotion and physiological stateedit studies have considered how the form we take in virtual reality can affect our perception and actions one study suggests that embodying the body of a young child can influence perception of object sizes such that objects are perceived as being much larger than if the objects were perceived by an individual embodying an adult body59 similarly another study has found that caucasian individuals who embodied the form of a darkskinned avatar performed a drumming task with a more varied style than when they were represented by a pair of whiteshaded hands and in comparison to individuals who embodied a lightskin avatar60 as a whole these works suggest that immersive virtual reality can create bodytransfer illusions capable of influencing how humans respond to different circumstances research exploring perception emotions and physiological response within virtual reality suggest that controlled virtual environments can alter how a person feels or responds to stimuli  for example a controlled virtual environment of a park coupled with a strong perceived feeling of presence cause an individual to feel anxious or relaxed61 similarly simulated driving through areas of darkness in a virtual tunnel can induce a fear response in humans62 social interaction with virtual characters in a virtual environment has been shown to produce physiological responses such as changes in heart rate and galvanic skin response63 individuals with high levels of social anxiety were found to have larger changes in heart rate than their more socially confident counterparts63 the sense of presence in virtual reality is also linked to the triggering of emotional and physiological response research suggests that a strong presence can facilitate emotional response and this emotional response can further increase ones feeling of presence61 similarly breaks in presence or a loss in the sense of presence can cause physiological changes63 understanding bias and stereotypesedit researchers have used embodied perspectivetaking in virtual reality to explore whether changing a persons selfrepresentation may help in reducing bias against particular social groups  however the nature of the relationship between embodiment and implicit bias is not yet clear as studies have demonstrated contrasting effects individuals who embodied the avatars of old people have demonstrated significant reduction in negative stereotyping of the elderly when compared with individuals placed in avatars of young people64 similarly lightskinned individuals placed in avatars with a dark body have shown a reduction in their implicit racial bias65 however other research has shown individuals taking the form of a black avatar had higher levels of implicit racial bias favoring whites after leaving the virtual environment than individuals who were embodied as white avatars58 healthcare and clinical therapiesedit according to a recent report from goldman sachs healthcare could be one of the next markets that vrar disrupts66 already vr devices are being used in clinical therapy and the results are significant anxiety disorder treatmentedit virtual reality exposure therapy vret is a form of exposure therapy for treating anxiety disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and phobias studies have indicated that when vret is combined with other forms of behavioral therapy patients experience a reduction of symptoms6768 in some cases patients no longer meet the dsmv criteria for ptsd after a series of treatments with vret69 pain managementedit immersive vr has been studied for acute pain management on the theory that it may distract people reducing their experience of pain7071 researchers theorize that immersive vr helps with pain reduction by distracting the mind and flooding sensories with a positive experience717273 education and trainingedit us navy personnel using a vr parachute training simulator vr is used to provide learners with a virtual environment where they can develop their skills without the realworld consequences of failing it has also been used and studied in primary education for example in japans online high school n high school vr plays a major role in education even the schools opening ceremony was a virtual experience for 73 of the students they received headsets which were connected to the campus hundreds of miles away so they got to listen to the principals opening speech without having to travel so far according to the schools workers they wanted to give the students a chance to experience vr technology before having to use it live as part of their education74 military usesedit thomas a furness iii was one of the first to develop the use of vr for military training when in 1982 he presented the air force with a working model of his virtual flight simulator the visually coupled airborne systems simulator vcasscitation needed the second phase of his project which he called the super cockpit was even more advanced with high resolution graphics for the time and a responsive displaycitation needed furness iii is often credited as a pioneer in virtual reality for this research75 the ministry of defense in the united kingdom has been using vr in military training since the 1980s76 the united states military announced the dismounted soldier training system in 201277 it was cited as the first fully immersive military vr training system78 space trainingedit nasa has used vr technology for twenty years79 most notable is their use of immersive vr to train astronauts while they are still on earth such applications of vr simulations include exposure to zerogravity work environments and training on how to spacewalk8081 astronauts can even simulate what it is like to work with tools in space while using low cost 3d printed mock up tools82 flight and vehicular applicationsedit a headscreenwearing soldier sits at a gunner station while learning in a virtual training suite flight simulators are a form of vr pilot training they can range from a fully enclosed module to a series of computer monitors providing the pilots point of view83 by the same token virtual driving simulations are used to train tank drivers on the basics before allowing them to operate the real vehicle84 similar principles are applied in truck driving simulators for specialized vehicles such as firetrucks as these drivers often have less opportunity for realworld experience vr training provides additional training time85 medical trainingedit vr technology has many useful applications in the medical field86 simulated surgeries allow surgeons to practice their technical skills without any risk to patients numerous studies have shown that physicians who receive surgical training via vr simulations improve dexterity and performance in the operating room significantly more than control groups878889 through vr medical students and novice surgeons have the ability to view and experience complex surgeries without stepping into the operating room on april 14 2016 shafi ahmed was the first surgeon to broadcast an operation in virtual reality viewers followed the surgery in real time from the surgeons perspective90 the vr technology allowed viewers to explore the full range of activities in the operating room as it was streamed by a 4k 360fly camera91 fine artsedit david em was the first fine artist to create navigable virtual worlds in the 1970s92 his early work was done on mainframes at information international inc jet propulsion laboratory and california institute of technology jeffrey shaw explored the potential of vr in fine arts with early works like legible city 1989 virtual museum 1991 and golden calf 1994 virtopia was the first vr artwork to be premièred at a film festival created by artistresearcher jacquelyn ford morie with researcher mike goslin it debuted at the 1992 florida film festival subsequent screenings of a more developed version of the project were at the 1993 florida film festival and at siggraph 1994s emerging tech venue the edge morie was one of the first artists to focus on emotional content in vr experiences9394 world skin a photo safari in the land of war maurice benayoun jeanbaptiste barrière virtual reality installation 1997 canadian artist char davies created immersive vr art pieces osmose 1995 and ephémère 1998 maurice benayouns work introduced metaphorical philosophical or political content combining vr network generation and intelligent agents in works like is god flat 1994 is the devil curved 1995 the tunnel under the atlantic 1995 and world skin a photo safari in the land of war 1997 other pioneering artists working in vr have include knowbotic research rebecca allen and perry hoberman95 in 2015 futurist kerammalickisánchez created the fivarsfestivalofinternationalvirtualaugmentedrealitystories96 the first virtual and augmented reality showcase dedicated wholly to narrative forms endemic to spatialized media drawing from an international pool of sources the festival was responsible for the publication and distribution of many notable pieces including adam coscos knives sonar 360 and pearl among others in 2016 the first project in poland called the abakanowicz art room was realized – it was documentation of the art office magdalena abakanowicz made by jarosław pijarowski and paweł komorowski97 some museums have begun making some of their content virtual reality accessible including the british museum98 and the guggenheim99 engineeringedit the use of 3d computeraided design cad data was limited by 2d monitors and paper printouts until the midtolate 1990s when video projectors 3d tracking and computer technology enabled a renaissance in the use 3d cad data in virtual reality environments with the use of active shutter glasses and multisurface projection units immersive engineering was made possible by companies like vrcom and icido virtual reality has been used in automotive aerospace and ground transportation original equipment manufacturers oems in their product engineering and manufacturing engineering virtual reality adds more dimensions to virtual prototyping product building assembly service performance usecases this enables engineers from different disciplines to view their design as its final product engineers can view the virtual bridge building or other structure from any angle as well some computer models allow engineers to test their structures resistance to winds weight and other elements immersive vr engineering systems enable engineers to see virtual prototypes prior to the availability of any physical prototypes virtual reality in occupational safety and healthedit vr simulates real workplaces for occupational safety and health purposes information and projection technology are used to produce a virtual threedimensional dynamic work environment within work scenarios for example some parts of a machine move of their own accord while others can be moved by human operators perspective angle of view and acoustic and haptic properties change according to where the person is standing and how he or she moves relative to the environment vr technology allows human information processing close to real life situations vr enables all phases of a product life cycle from design through use up to disposal to be simulated analysed and optimised vr can be used for osh purposes to review and improve the usability of products and processes whilst their development and design are still in progress this enables errors in development and the need for subsequent modifications to be avoided systematically and empirically review design solutions for the humansystem interfaces and their influence upon human behaviour this reduces the need for physical modifications to machinery and for extensive field studies safely test potentially hazardous products processes and safety concepts this avoids actual hazards during the study of humansystem interaction identify causeeffect relationships following accidents on and involving products this saves material personnel time and financial outlay associated with insitu testing heritage and archaeologyedit the first use of a vr presentation in a heritage application was in 1994 when a museum visitor interpretation provided an interactive walkthrough of a 3d reconstruction of dudley castle in england as it was in 1550 this consisted of a computer controlled laserdiscbased system designed by britishbased engineer colin johnson the system was featured in a conference held by the british museum in november 1994 and in the subsequent technical paper imaging the past – electronic imaging and computer graphics in museums and archaeology100 virtual reality enables heritage sites to be recreated extremely accurately so that the recreations can be published in various media101 the original sites are often inaccessible to the public or due to the poor state of their preservation hard to picture102 this technology can be used to develop virtual replicas of caves natural environment old towns monuments sculptures and archaeological elements103 architectural and urban designedit a visitor at mozilla berlin hackshibition trying oculus rift virtual reality experience on firefox one of the first recorded uses of virtual reality in architecture was in the late 1980s when the university of north carolina modeled its sitterman hall home of its computer science department in a virtual environment104 a land development plan using prefurbia a 4th generation design system by 2010 vr programs were developed for urban regeneration planning and transportation projects105 music and concertsedit assembled google cardboard vr vr has the possibility of changing how we view live music106 by allowing the audience to be right up front their band or to attend virtual concerts like coachella107 virtual reality can also transform music videos by making them more intense and powerful108 music visualization also has the potential to be changed by vr with multiple apps being created for the oculus and the htc vive although some people dubious as to how popular these will be109 virtual reality is also used in visual music applications110 on may 3 2016 norwegian pop band aha gave a multimedia performance in collaboration with void a norwegian computational design studio the stereoscopic vrexperience was made available for android users directly through a youtube app and also made available for iphone users and other platforms111112113 marketingedit virtual reality presents a unique opportunity for advertisers to reach a completely immersed audience114 companies such as paramount pictures cocacola mcdonalds disney the north face115 and innis gunn116 have applied vr into marketing campaigns117118 nonprofit organizations such as amnesty international unicef and world wide fund for nature wwf have used virtual reality to bring potential supporters closer to their work effectively bringing distant social political and environmental issues and projects to members of the public in immersive ways not possible with traditional media panoramic 360 views of conflict in syria119 and face to face encounters with cgi tigers in nepal120 have been used in experiential activations and shared online for educational and fundraising purposes lowes ikea wayfair and other retailers have developed systems that allow their products to be seen in virtual reality to give consumers a better idea of how the product will fit into their home or to allow the consumer to get a better look at the product from home121 consumers looking at digital photos of the products can turn the product around virtually and see it from the side or the back several companies develop software or services that allow architectural design firms and real estate clients to tour virtual models of proposed building designs during the design process architects can use vr to experience the designs they are working on before they are built seeing a design in vr can give architect a correct sense of scale and proportion122 vr models can replace physical miniatures to demonstrate a design to clients or the public developers and owners can create vr model of built spaces that allow potential buyers or tenants to tour a space in vr even if reallife circumstances make a physical tour unfeasible in july 2015 oneplus became the first company to launch a product via virtual reality123 in fiction and popular cultureedit main article virtual reality in fiction there have been many novels that reference and describe forms of virtual reality neal stephensons snow crash 1992 and ernest clines ready player one 2011 are novels that have been influential for vr engineers working in the early 21st century7 in the 1980s and 1990s cyberpunks viewed the technology as a potential means for social change the recreational drug subculture praised virtual reality not only as a new art form but as an entirely new frontier75 concerns and challengesedit virtual reality technology faces a number of challenges including health and safety privacy and technical issues longterm effects of virtual reality on vision and neurological development are unknown users might become disoriented in a purely virtual environment causing balance issues computer latency might affect the simulation providing a lessthansatisfactory enduser experience navigating the nonvirtual environment if the user is not confined to a limited area might prove dangerous without external sensory information there have been rising concerns that with the advent of virtual reality some users may experience virtual reality addiction124 from an economic and financial perspective early entrants to the virtual reality market may spend a significant amount of time and money on the technology if it is not adopted by enough customers the investment will not pay off125 health and safetyedit there are many health and safety considerations of virtual reality most virtual reality systems come with consumer warnings including seizures developmental issues in children tripandfall and collision warnings discomfort repetitive stress injury and interference with medical devices126 a number of unwanted symptoms have been caused by prolonged use of virtual reality127 and these may have slowed proliferation of the technology virtual reality sickness also known as cybersickness occurs when a persons exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to motion sickness symptoms128 the most common symptoms are general discomfort headache stomach awareness nausea vomiting pallor sweating fatigue drowsiness disorientation and apathy129 other symptoms include postural instability and retching129 virtual reality sickness is different from motion sickness in that it can be caused by the visually induced perception of selfmotion real selfmotion is not needed128 it is also different from simulator sickness nonvirtual reality simulator sickness tends to be characterized by oculomotor disturbances whereas virtual reality sickness tends to be characterized by disorientation130 a 2016 publication assessed the effects of exposure to 2d vs 3d dissection videos on nine pathology resident physicians using selfreported physiologic symptoms watching the content in 3d vs 2d did not increase simulator sickness although the average simulator sickness questionnaire score did increase with time statistical analysis does not suggest significance131 privacyedit the persistent tracking required by all vr systems makes the technology particularly useful for and vulnerable to mass surveillance the expansion of vr will increase the potential and reduce the costs for information gathering of personal actions movements and responses7 in networked vr spaces with capacity for public interaction there is the potential for unexpected modifications of the environment125 conceptual and philosophical concernsedit in addition there are conceptual and philosophical considerations and implications associated with the use of virtual reality what the phrase virtual reality means or refers to can be ambiguous mychilo s cline argued in 2005 that through virtual reality techniques will be developed to influence human behavior interpersonal communication and cognition132133134 in the book the metaphysics of virtual reality by michael r heim seven different concepts of virtual reality are identified simulation interaction artificiality immersion telepresence fullbody immersion and network communication as we spend more and more time in virtual space there could be a gradual migration to virtual space resulting in important changes in economics worldview and culture135 philosophical implications of vr are discussed in books including philip zhais get real a philosophical adventure in virtual reality 1998 and digital sensations space identity and embodiment in virtual reality 1999 written by ken
