references originedit founded in october 1913 by bnai brith with sigmund livingston as its first leader the adls charter states the immediate object of the league is to stop by appeals to reason and conscience and if necessary by appeals to law the defamation of the jewish people its ultimate purpose is to secure justice and fair treatment to all citizens alike and to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens1 the antidefamation league was founded by bnai brith as a response to attacks on jews the leo frank affair was mentioned by adolf kraus when he announced the creation of the adl67 goalsedit jonathan greenblatt national director and ceo of the antidefamation league the stated purpose of the adl is to fight antisemitism and all forms of bigotry in the united states and abroad combat international terrorism probe the roots of hatred advocate before the united states congress come to the aid of victims of bigotry develop educational programs and serve as a public resource for government media law enforcement and the public all towards the goal of countering and reducing hatred historically the adl has opposed groups and individuals it considered to be antisemitic andor racist including nazis the ku klux klan henry ford father charles coughlin leader of the christian front the christian identity movement the germanamerican bund neonazis the american militia movement and white power skinheads although the adl acknowledges that there are also nonracist skinheads89 the adl publishes reports on a variety of countries regarding alleged incidents of antijewish attacks and propaganda the adl maintains that some forms of antizionism and criticism of israel cross the line into antisemitism the antidefamation league states criticism of particular israeli actions or policies in and of itself does not constitute antisemitism certainly the sovereign state of israel can be legitimately criticized just like any other country in the world however it is undeniable that there are those whose criticism of israel or of zionism is used to mask antisemitism10 the adl gives out its courage to care award to honor rescuers of jews during the holocaust era since 2010 the adl has published a list of the ten leading organizations responsible for maligning israel in the us which has included answer the international solidarity movement and jewish voice for peace for its call for bds11 in october 2010 the adl condemned remarks by haham ovadia yosef that the sole purpose of nonjews was to serve the jews12 when the antimormon film the god makers was produced rhonda m abrams central pacific san francisco regional director for the adl wrote a critical review including the following statement had a similar movie been made with either judaism or catholicism as its target it would be immediately denounced for the scurrilous piece that it is i sincerely hope that people of all faiths will similarly repudiate the godmakers as defamatory and untrue and recognize it for what it truly represents a challenge to the religious liberty of all13 separation of church and stateedit one of the adls major focuses is religious freedom for people of all faiths14 in the context of public schools the adl has taken the position that because creationism and intelligent design are religious beliefs and the government is prohibited from endorsing the beliefs of any particular religion they should not be taught in science classrooms the us constitution guarantees the rights of americans to believe the religious theories of creation as well as other theories but it does not permit them to be taught in public school science classes15 similarly the adl supports the legal precedent that it is unconstitutional for the government to post the ten commandments in courthouses schools and other public places true religious liberty means freedom from having the government impose the religion of the majority on all citizens16 the adl has also condemned the public school bible curriculum published by the national council on bible curriculum in public schools saying that it raises serious constitutional problems and advocates the acceptance of one faith traditions interpretation of the bible over another17 the adl opposed proposition 8 and supported the matthew shepard act tracking extremistsedit the adl keeps track of the activities of various extremist groups and movements18 according to adl director abe foxman our mission is to monitor and expose those who are antijewish racist antidemocratic and violenceprone and we monitor them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings … because extremist organizations are highly secretive sometimes adl can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources … who function in a manner directly analogous to investigative journalists some have performed great service to the american people—for example by uncovering the existence of rightwing extremist paramilitary training camps—with no recognition and at considerable personal risk19 a person apprehended in connection to the 2002 white supremacist terror plot had drawn a cartoon of himself blowing up the boston offices of the adl20 the adl regularly releases reports on antisemitism and extremist activities on the far left and the far right for instance as part of its law enforcement agency resource network learn the adl has published information about the militia movement21 in america and a guide for law enforcement officials titled officer safety and extremists22 an archive of the militia watchdog research on us rightwing extremism including groups not specifically cited as antisemitic from 1995 to 2000 is also available on the adl website21 in the 1990s some details of the adls monitoring activities became public and controversial including the fact that the adl had gathered information about some nonextremist groups in 2013 jm berger a former nonresident fellow of the brookings institution wrote that media organizations should be more cautious when citing the southern poverty law center and adl arguing that they are not objective purveyors of data23 in july 2017 the adl announced that they would be developing profiles on 36 altright and altlite leaders2425 role in arrest of potential assassins of barack obamaedit in october 2008 the adl reportedly assisted the us bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf by providing on request information on daniel cowart and paul schlesselman and their associates and contacts and on their ties to the supreme white alliance shortly thereafter the two men were arrested on charges of plotting to murder dozens of african americans and plotting to assassinate us presidentelect barack obama2627 holocaust awarenessedit the adl holds that it is important to remember the holocaust in order to prevent such an event from reoccurring along with sponsoring events and fighting holocaust deniers and revisionists the adl has been active in urging action to stop modernday ethnic cleansing and genocide in places such as bosnia darfur and sudancitation needed the adl spoke out against an advertising campaign by people for the ethical treatment of animals peta beginning in 2003 that equated meateating with the holocaust a press release from the adl stated that petas effort to seek approval for their holocaust on your plate campaign is outrageous offensive and takes chutzpah to new heights rather than deepen our revulsion against what the nazis did to the jews the project will undermine the struggle to understand the holocaust and to find ways to make sure such catastrophes never happen again28 in may 2005 peta apologized for its campaign with peta president ingrid newkirk stating that causing pain was never our intention and we are deeply sorry29 the national adl issued a statement on the armenian genocide on august 21 2007 the statement declared the consequences of those actions were indeed tantamount to genocide activists felt that the statement was not a full unequivocal acknowledgment of the armenian genocide because the use of the qualifier tantamount was seen as inappropriate and the use of the word consequences was seen as an attempt to circumvent the international legal definition of genocide by avoiding any language that would imply intent a crucial aspect of the 1948 un genocide convention definition the adl convened its national meeting in new york city in early november 2007 at which time the issue of the armenian genocide was discussed upon conclusion a onesentence press statement was issued that the national commission of the antidefamation league adl today at its annual meeting decided to take no further action on the issue of the armenian genocide30 political positionsedit the adl supports the jewish state and has vociferously opposed resolutions such as the 1975 united nations resolution revoked in 1991 which equated zionism with racism31 and attempts to revive that formulation at the 2001 un world conference against racism in durban south africa32 the adl also has expressed concern over israeli legislative proposals that would stifle freedom of expression and undermine israeli democracy3334 the adl honors individuals throughout the year for various reasons on september 23 2003 at its tribute to italy dinner the adl awarded italian prime minister silvio berlusconi the adls distinguished statesman award an honor conferred on world leaders who exhibit a commitment to furthering the achievement of regional and world peace and who possess a special commitment to promoting human and civil rights35 berlusconi is also known for his staunch proisrael stance3637 the adl has spoken out against redbaiting38 and mccarthyism39 in 2006 the adl condemned senate republicans in the united states for attempting to ban samesex marriage with the federal marriage amendment and praised its demise calling it discrimination40 that same year the adl warned that the debate over illegal immigration was drawing neonazis and antisemites into the ranks of the minutemen project in 1974 adl national leaders arnold forster and benjamin r epstein published a book called the new antisemitism new york 1974 arguing that a new kind of antisemitism is on the rise in 1982 adl national leader nathan perlmutter and his wife ruth ann perlmutter released a book entitled the real antisemitism in america new york 1982 in 2003 adls national director abraham foxman published never again the threat of the new antisemitism san francisco 2003 where on page 4 he states we currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s—if not a greater one41 in 2010 during a hearing for florida house bill 11 crimes against homeless persons which was to revise the list of offenses judged to be hate crimes in florida by adding a persons homeless status42 the league lobbied against the bill which subsequently passed in the house by a vote of 80 to 28 and was sent to the senate43 taking the position that adding more categories to the list would dilute the effectiveness of the law which already includes race religion sexual orientation disability and age44 the adl supports comprehensive and dream act legislation that would provide conditional permanent residency to certain illegal aliens of good moral character who graduate from us high schools arrived in the united states as minors and lived in the country continuously for at least five years prior to the bills enactment45 relations with religious and ethnic groupsedit relations with arabs and muslimsedit see also projects working for peace among israelis and arabs on june 18 2004 the adl issued a news release46 about the university of california irvine uci muslim students union in which the student group had invited speakers to campus who made public declarations of support for hamas advocated suicide bombings and called for the destruction of israel for graduation muslim students union members chose to wear green the traditional colour of islam graduation stoles bearing the shahada the islamic declaration of faith the adls press release explained that the shahada is a declaration of faith that has been closely identified with palestinian terrorists and said that suicide bombers connected to the palestinian group hamas wear green armbands and headbands inscribed with the shahada as a symbol of their movement and stated we are troubled that members of the uci muslim students union have chosen to display symbolism that is closely identified with palestinian terrorist groups and that can be especially offensive to jewish students the adl has publicly opposed antiislamic organizations like stop islamization of america and stop islamization of europe and activists like pamela geller and david yerushalmi describing them as antimuslim bigots47 relations with africanamericansedit in 1997 the national center for blackjewish relations of dillard university a historically black university in new orleans awarded the director of the adl abraham h foxman with the first annual martin luther king jr – donald r mintz freedom and justice award in 2004 the adl became the lead partner in the peace and diversity academy a new new york city public high school with predominantly black and hispanic students in celebration of black history month the adl created and distributed lesson plans to middle and high school teachers about shirley chisholm 1924–2005 the first black woman elected to the us congress and an important civil rights leader the adl has also publicly charged certain african americans with antisemitism the adl has catalogued a threedecade history of nation of islam leader louis farrakhans espousal of antisemitic rhetoric such as claims that certain jews are not real jews and that they are wicked deceivers of the american people who sucked americans blood and that powerful jews promote homosexuality and control black leadership48 farrakhan first attracted the attention of the adl with comments in a march 11 1984 radio broadcast saying that hitler was a very great man49 farrakhan insists that he was using the word great in the sense of great depression or great white shark50 and on june 24 1984 he described the jewish state as structured on injustice thievery lying and deceit and using the name of god to shield your dirty religion under his holy and righteous name49 the adl has urged various groups including the naacp whose leader benjamin chavis developed a working relationship with farrakhan in 1994 to dissociate themselves from farrakhan and his views51 in 1984 the boston globe reported that then adl national director nathan perlmutter said that rev jesse jackson sr was antisemitic after jackson referred to new york city as hymietown5253 however the adl later reconciled with jackson and has worked with him on the issue of the iranian jewish community54 film director spike lee was criticized by the antidefamation league for his portrayal of jewish nightclub owners moe and josh flatbush in his 1990 film mo better blues the antidefamation league claimed that the characterizations of the nightclub owners dredge up an ageold and highly dangerous form of antisemitic stereotyping and disappointed that spike lee – whose success is largely due to his efforts to break down racial stereotypes and prejudice – has employed the same kind of tactics that he supposedly deplores55 lees portrayal also angered the bnai brith and other such jewish organizations causing lee to apologize via an opinioneditorial article in the new york times56 during the 2002 election cycle the adl in a letter to the new york times harshly criticized congressional black caucus member cynthia mckinney of georgia for launching attacks perceived as racial against her jewish opponent according to an august 19 2002 article in the new york times adl director abraham foxman said it made sense that jewish americans would want to contribute to efforts to replace ms mckinney in february 2005 adl national director abraham foxman called it hypocritical for hiphop producer russell simmons to lead an ad campaign against antisemitism while also according to foxmans view defending or excusing louis farrakhans antisemitic statements57 later that year the adl urged prominent black leaders including simmons to reconsider their support for farrakhan and malik zulu shabazz organizing the millions more movement and to stand up against black antisemitism58 simmons responding to adl director abraham foxman said simply put you are misguided arrogant and very disrespectful of african americans and most importantly your statements will unintentionally or intentionally lead to a negative impression of jews in the minds of millions of african americans 59 foxman replied if there were a jewish event which was led by an outandout racist i would expect black leaders to say to me that adl should have nothing to do with it and i would agree with them rather than condemn them for their action60 interfaith campedit adls new england regional office has also established a faithbased initiative called the interfaith youth leadership program better known as camp if or camp interfaith involving teenagers of the christian jewish and islamic faiths the camp brings the teens together for a week at camp where the teens bond and learn about each others cultures the camp has emerged as a new attempt to foster good relations between younger members of the abrahamic faiths61 controversiesedit adl files controversyedit since the 1930s the adl has been gathering information and publishing reports on whatever it identifies as antisemitism racism and prejudice and on antijewish antiisrael racist antidemocratic violent and extremist individuals and groups as a result the organization amassed what it once called a famous storehouse of accurate detailed unassailable information on extremist individuals and organizations62 over the decades the adl has assembled thousands of files during the 1930s the adl along with the american jewish committee coordinated american jewish groups across the country in monitoring the activities of the germanamerican bund and its pronazis nativist allies in the united states in many instances these communitybased defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered the longestlived and most effective of these american jewish resistance organizations was the los angeles jewish community committee lajcc which was backed financially by the jewish leaders of the motion picture industry the daytoday operations of the lajcc were supervised by a jewish attorney leon lewis lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of nazism in los angeles having served as the first national secretary of the antidefamation league in chicago from 19251931 from 19341941 the lajcc maintained its undercover surveillance of the germanamerican bund the silver shirts and dozens of other pronazi nativist groups that operated in los angeles partnering with the american legion in los angeles the lajcc channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities working with the adl leon lewis and the lajcc played a strategic role in counseling the mccormackdickstein committee investigation of nazi propaganda activities in the united states 1934 and the dies committee investigation of unamerican activities 19381940 in their final reports to congress both committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the united states during the decade was due in part to the german governments support of these domestic groups63 one of its sources for the 1980s and 1990s was roy bullock an intelligence gatherer for the south african apartheid regime64 a private collector of information he amassed files on 10000–12000 individuals and 600 organizations65 and provided them to the adl as a secretly paid independent contractor for over 32 years bullock often wrote letters to various groups and forwarded copies of their replies to the adl clipped articles from newspapers and magazines and maintained files on his computer he also used less orthodox and possibly illegal methods such as combing through trash and tapping into white aryan resistances phone message system in order to find evidence of hate crimes some of the information he obtained and then passed on to the adl came from confidential documents including intelligence files on various nazi groups and drivers license records and other personal information on nearly 1400 people that were given to him by san francisco police officer and former cia agent tom gerard66 on april 8 1993 police seized bullocks computer and raided the adl offices in san francisco and los angeles california a search of bullocks computer revealed that he had compiled files on 9876 individuals and more than 950 groups across the political spectrum many of bullocks files concerned groups that did not fit the mold of extremist groups hate groups and organizations hostile to jews or israel that the adl would usually be interested in along with files on the ku klux klan white aryan resistance islamic jihad and the jewish defense league were data on the naacp the african national congress anc the american civil liberties union aclu the united auto workers the aids activist group act up mother jones magazine the tass sovietrussian news agency greenpeace jews for jesus and the national lawyers guild there were also files on politicians including democratic us representative nancy pelosi former republican us representative pete mccloskey and activist lyndon larouche6667 bullock told investigators that many of those were his own private files not information he was passing on to the adl an attorney for the adl stated that we knew nothing about the vast extent of the files those are not adls files … that is all bullocks doing68 as for its own records the adl indicated that just because it had a file on a group that did not mean that the adl opposed the group the san francisco district attorney at the time accused the adl of conducting a national spy network but dropped all accusations a few months later69 judging it to be a force for good the adl then offered the district attorneys office a sum of 75000 to fight bigotry which was duly accepted64 in the weeks following the raids twelve civil rights groups led by the americanarab antidiscrimination committee and the national lawyers guild filed a lawsuit demanding that the adl release its surveillance information and end its investigations as well as ordering it to pay punitive damages70 the lawsuit fueled speculation that the organization was waging a secret campaign to repress political dissent71 the plaintiffs attorney former representative mccloskey claimed that the information the adl gathered constituted an invasion of privacy the adl while distancing itself from bullock countered that it is entitled like any researcher or journalist to research organizations and individuals richard cohen legal director of the southern poverty law center in montgomery alabama stated that like journalists the adls researchers gather information however they can and welcome disclosures from confidential sources saying they probably rely on their sources to draw the line on how much can legally be divulged bullock admitted that he was overzealous and that some of the ways in which he gathered information may have been illegal68 the lawsuit was settled out of court in 1999 the adl agreed to pay 175000 for the court costs of the groups two of them jewish64 that sued it promised that it would not seek information from sources it knew could not legally disclose such information consented to remove sensitive information like criminal records or social security numbers from its files and spent 25000 in order to further relations between the jewish arab and black communities when the case was settled hussein ibish director of communications for the americanarab antidiscrimination committee adc claimed that the adl had gathered data systematically in a program whose clear intent was to undermine civil rights and arabamerican organizations adl national director abraham foxman called the adcs claims absolutely untrue saying that if it were true they would have won their case and noted that no court found the adl guilty of any wrongdoing the adl released a statement saying that the settlement explicitly recognizes adls right to gather information in any lawful and constitutionally protected manner which we have always done and will continue to do69 john mearsheimer and stephen walt claim that the organization rather than defending jews from bigotry was targeting individuals critical of israel or of us support for israel64 executive order 12333edit during congressional testimony in 1990 the organization was implicated in the use of executive order 12333 to facilitate some of its intelligence initiatives72 this compounded on a partnership with the fbi expanded by william webster beginning in 1978 and resulting in a memorandum in 1985 in which the agencies would cooperate through liaisons with direct lines of communication73 james rosenbergedit a case which has been compared to the bullock case was that of james mitchell rosenberg aka jim anderson rosenberganderson was an undercover operative of the adl who acted as an agent provocateur posing as a racist rightwing paramilitary extremist he appeared in this role as part of a tv documentary entitled armies of the right which premiered in 1981 rosenberg was arrested that same year in new york for carrying an unregistered firearm in public view in 1984 adl factfinding director irwin suall identified rosenberg as an adl operative in a court deposition74 armenian genocide controversyedit in 2007 abraham foxman came under criticism for his stance on the armenian genocide the adl had previously described it as a massacre and an atrocity but not as a genocide75 foxman had earlier opposed calls for the us government to recognise it as a genocide76 i dont think congressional action will help reconcile the issue the resolution takes a position it comes to a judgement said foxman in a statement issued to the jewish telegraphic agency the turks and armenians need to revisit their past the jewish community shouldnt be the arbiter of that history nor should the us congress and a congressional resolution on such matters is a counterproductive diversion and will not foster reconciliation between turks and armenians and may put at risk the turkish jewish community and the important multilateral relationship between turkey israel and the united states in early august 2007 complaints about the antidefamation leagues refusal to acknowledge the armenian genocide led to watertown massachusettss unanimous town council decision to end its participation in the adls no place for hate campaign watertown is known for its armenian population also in august 2007 an editorial in the boston globe criticized the adl by saying that as an organization concerned about human rights it ought to acknowledge the genocide against the armenian people during world war i and criticize turkish attempts to repress the memory of this historical reality77 then on august 17 2007 the adl fired its regional new england director andrew h tarsy for breaking ranks with the main organization and for saying that the adl should recognize the genocide78 in an august 21 2007 press release the adl changed its position and acknowledged the genocide but maintained its opposition to congressional resolutions aimed at recognizing it75 foxman wrote the consequences of those actions by the ottoman empire against armenians were indeed tantamount to genocide79 the turkish government condemned the leagues statement80 andrew h tarsy was rehired by the league on august 2781 though he has since chosen to step down from his position82 the adl was criticized by many in the armenian community including the armenian weekly newspaper in which writer michael mensoian stated the belated backtracking of the antidefamation league adl in acknowledging the planned systematic massacre of 1500000 armenian men women and children as …tantamount to genocide… is discouraging tantamount means something is equivalent if its equivalent why avoid using the term for the adl to justify its newly adopted statement because the word genocide did not exist at the time indicates a halfhearted attempt to placate armenians while not offending turkey historians use the term genocide simply because it is the proper term to describe the horrific events that the ottoman turkish government unleashed on the armenian people83 after foxmans capitulation the new england adl pressed the organizations national leadership to support a congressional resolution acknowledging the genocide84 after hours of closeddoor debate at the annual national meeting in new york the proposal was ultimately withdrawn84 the organization issued a statement saying it would take no further action on the issue of the armenian genocide the adl had earlier received direct pressure from the turkish foreign ministry85 tarsy submitted his resignation on december 484 since august some human rights commissions in other massachusetts communities decided to follow watertowns lead and withdraw from the adls no place for hate antidiscrimination program84 criticismedit in 1989 the linguist and leftwing commentator and activist noam chomsky characterized the adl as having lost entirely its focus on civil rights issues in order to become solely an advocate for israeli policy he held that the adl cast all leftwing opposition to israeli interests as antisemitism86 role in cancellation of speech by tony judt at polish consulateedit in 2006 the adl in addition to the american jewish committee was criticized by academic tony judt for allegedly pressuring the polish consulategeneral in new york to cancel a scheduled appearance by judt at network 2020 a nonprofit organization that rents space from the consulate in an interview with the new york sun foxman claimed that the group had nothing to do with the cancellation87 insisting that the adl only called to ask if the event was being sponsored by the polish government88 polish consul general krzysztof kasprzyk suggested in an interview with the washington post that calls by the adl and the american jewish committee were exercising a delicate pressure89 in reference to the role of the adl and the american jewish committee in organizing the cancellations judt told the washington post this is serious and frightening and only in america—not in israel—is this a problem these are jewish organizations that believe they should keep people who disagree with them on the middle east away from anyone who might listen89 the adl denied the charges according to foxman i think they made the right decision hes taken the position that israel shouldnt exist that puts him on our radar89 denver defamation suitedit in 1994 the adl became embroiled in a dispute between neighbors in denver colorado upon the involvement of the adl the petty quarreling of next door neighbors initially about garden plants and pets quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of antisemitism and counter charges of defamation candace and mitchell aronson jewish next door neighbors of william and dorothy quigley used a radio shack police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of mr mrs quigley when the aronsons heard the quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with nazi scare tactics the aronsons contacted the denver office of the adl upon the advice of the adl the aronsons then recorded the quigleys private telephone conversations the conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the aronsons home a reference to the holocaust burning one of the aronson children and wishing that the aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing the quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not antisemitic and were only intended to be sick humor90 neither the aronsons nor the adl were aware that congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone to transcribe the material and to use the transcriptions for any purpose not knowing about the new federal law the aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the quigleys in december 1994 a day later saul rosenthal regional director of the adl appeared at a news conference with the aronsons in which he described their encounter with the quigleys as a vicious antisemitic campaign based solely on conversations he and associates had with the aronsons later that day mr rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a denver radio talk show two days later jefferson county prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the quigleys the quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule they received threats and were forced to hire security guards for their home a package of dog feces was mailed to their house when they attended church their priest openly chastised them in his sermon the family was forced to shop in other towns to avoid being recognized91 mr quigleys career with united artists suffered serious damage92 upon investigation and after assistant district attorney steven jensen heard on the tapes the context of mrs quigleys remarks all charges but one a misdemeanor traffic violation against mr quigley were dropped the district attorney issued two letters of apology to the quigleys saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in antisemitic conduct or harassment93 the quigleys brought a lawsuit against the adl rosenthal the aronsons and two adl volunteer attorneys the two attorneys agreed to pay 350000 to the quigleys in settlement of their claims the quigley settlement with the aronsons did not involve a cash payment the quigleys maintained their action against the adl and rosenthal which was heard in federal court a federal jury returned a verdict of 10 million in favor of the quigleys the adl appealed according to an april 13 2001 article in the forward upon hearing the appeal a federal judge lambasted the adl for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an antisemitic event and upheld most of quigleys 10 million lawsuit for defamation according to a report in the rocky mountain news with accrued interest the judgment amounted to more than 12 million94 new antisemitism controversyedit main article new antisemitism in 1974 adl national leaders arnold forster and benjamin r epstein published a book called the new antisemitism new york 1974 arguing that a new kind of antisemitism is on the rise in 1982 adl national leader nathan perlmutter and his wife ruth ann perlmutter released a book entitled the real antisemitism in america new york 1982 in 2003 adls national director abraham foxman published never again the threat of the new antisemitism san francisco 2003 where on page 4 he states we currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s—if not a greater one41 reviewing forster and epsteins work in commentary earl raab founding director of the nathan perlmutter institute for jewish advocacy at brandeis university argued that a new antisemitism was indeed emerging in america in the form of opposition to the collective rights of the jewish people but he criticized forster and epstein for conflating it with antiisrael bias95 allan brownfeld writes that forster and epsteins new definition of antisemitism trivialized the concept by turning it into a form of political blackmail and a weapon with which to silence any criticism of either israel or us policy in the middle east96 while edward s shapiro in a time for healing american jewry since world war ii has written that forster and epstein implied that the new antisemitism was the inability of gentiles to love jews and israel enough97 norman finkelstein claims that organizations such as the antidefamation league have brought forward charges of new antisemitism at various intervals since the 1970s not to fight antisemitism but rather to exploit the historical suffering of jews in order to immunize israel against criticism98 the washington post has noted that the adl has repeatedly accused finkelstein of being a holocaust denier and that these charges have proved baseless99 conflict with jews for the preservation of firearms ownershipedit adl is an advocate for gun control legislation100 the adl supported the district of columbia before the us supreme court in district of columbia v heller which argued that the citys ban on the possession of handguns and any functional firearms even for selfdefense in the home is not prohibited by the second amendment101 the league urged the court to ensure that states retain the ability to keep guns out of the hands of violent bigots gun rights group jews for the preservation of firearms ownership jpfo has been highly critical of the antidefamation league in pamphlets such as why does the adl support nazibased laws102 and jpfo facts vs adl lies103 the jpfo has accused the adl of undermining the welfare of the jewish people by promoting gun control in a 2007 handbill the jpfo accused adl director abraham foxman of knowingly supporting the use of nazi gun control laws in america104 foxman has written about the jpfo antisemitism has a long and painful history and the linkage to gun control is a tactic by jews for the preservation of firearms ownership to manipulate the fear of antisemitism toward their own end105 park51 community center controversyedit on july 28 2010 the adl issued a statement in which it expressed opposition to the park51 community center which sponsors planned to build near the world trade center site in new york the adl stated the controversy which has emerged regarding the building of a community center at this location is counterproductive to the healing process therefore under these unique circumstances we believe the city of new york would be better served if an alternative location could be found106 the adl denounced what it saw as bigoted attacks on the project foxman opined that some of those who oppose the mosque are bigots and that the plans proponents may have every right to build the mosque at that location nevertheless he said that building the mosque at that site would unnecessarily cause more pain for families of some victims of 911106107108109 this opposition to the community center led to criticism of the statement from various parties including one adl board member the american jewish committee the jewish community relations council of new york rabbi irwin kula columnists jeffrey goldberg and peter beinart the interfaith alliance110 and the shalom center111 in an interview with the new york times abe foxman published a statement in reaction to criticism112 in protest of adls stance cnn host fareed zakaria returned the hubert h humphrey first amendment freedoms prize the adl awarded him in 2005113 adl chair robert g sugarman responded to a critical new york times editorial114 writing we have publicly taken on those who criticized the mosque in ways that reflected antimuslim bigotry or used the controversy for that purpose and stating that the adl has combated islamophobia115 accusation of armenian genocide denialedit mark arax a former los angeles times writer and current salon writer of armenian descent strongly criticized the role of the adl in american armenian genocide denial in 2007 he spoke with abraham foxman who said116 our focus is israel if helping turkey helps israel then thats what were in the business of doing was it genocide it was wartime things get messy the turks and armenians need to revisit their past the jewish community shouldnt be the arbiter of that history and i dont think the us congress should be the arbiter either arax later wrote on this i almost had to revisit his website to make sure that the adl was still in the business of fighting not only antisemitism but bigotry and extremism and securing justice and fair treatment to all when arax pointed out that the genocide had been documented as a fact by many prominent historians and that congress recognizes all sorts of peoples history including resolutions commemorating the victims of the holocaust foxman replied youre not suggesting that an armenian genocide is the same as the holocaust are you116 see alsoedit american civil liberties union aclu americanarab antidiscrimination committee antisemitism in the united states conference of presidents of major american jewish
