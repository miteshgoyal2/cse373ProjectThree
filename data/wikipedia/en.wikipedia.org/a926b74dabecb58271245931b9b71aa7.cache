soldier in the british army in the royal armoured corps and intelligence corps during the second world war before being seconded to the foreign office after the war he returned to the school of oriental and african studies at the university of london and was appointed to the new chair in near and middle eastern history in 2007 and 1999 respectively lewis was called the west’s leading interpreter of the middle east2 and the most influential postwar historian of islam and the middle east1 his advice was frequently sought by neoconservative policymakers including the bush administration3 lewis therefore is generally regarded as the dean of middle east scholars4 however his support of the iraq war and neoconservative ideals have since come under scrutiny5678910 lewis is also notable for his public debates with edward said who accused lewis and other orientalists of misrepresenting islam and serving the purposes of imperialist domination11 to which lewis responded by defending orientalism as a facet of humanism and accusing said of politicizing the subject112 lewis argues that the deaths of the armenian genocide resulted from a struggle between two nationalistic movements13 and that there is no proof of intent by the ottoman government to exterminate the armenian nation14 these views prompted a number of scholars to accuse lewis of genocide denial and resulted in a successful civil lawsuit against him in a french court15 lewis turned 100 in may 201616 contents 1 biography 11 family and personal life 12 academic career 2 research 21 armenian

and history while preparing for his bar mitzvah17 lewis has been a naturalized citizen of the united states since 1982 he married ruth hélène oppenhejm in 1947 with whom he had a daughter and a son their marriage was dissolved in 19741 academic careeredit in 1936 lewis graduated from the school of oriental studies now school of oriental and african studies soas at the university of london with a ba in history with special reference to the near and middle east he earned his phd three years later also from soas specializing in the history of islam18 lewis also studied law going part of the way toward becoming a solicitor but returned to study middle eastern history he undertook postgraduate studies at the university of paris where he studied with the orientalist louis massignon and earned the diplôme des études sémitiques in 19371 he returned to soas in 1938 as an assistant lecturer in islamic history during the second world war lewis served in the british army in the royal armoured corps and as a corporal in the intelligence corps in 1940–41 before being seconded to the foreign office19 after the war he returned to soas in 1949 at the age of 33 he was appointed to the new chair in near and middle eastern history20 in 1974 aged 57 lewis accepted a joint position at princeton university and the institute for advanced study also located in princeton new jersey the terms of his appointment were such that lewis taught only one semester per year and being free from administrative responsibilities he could devote more time to research than previously consequently lewiss arrival at princeton marked the beginning of the most prolific period in his research career during which he published numerous books and articles based on previously accumulated materials21 after retiring from princeton in 1986 lewis served at cornell university until 19901 in 1966 lewis was a founding member of the learned society middle east studies association of north america mesa but in 2007 he broke away and founded association for the study of the middle east and africa asmea to challenge mesa which the new york sun noted as dominated by academics who have been critical of israel and of americas role in the middle east22 the organization was formed as an academic society dedicated to promoting high standards of research and teaching in middle eastern and african studies and other related fields with lewis as chairman of its academic council in 1990 the national endowment for the humanities selected lewis for the jefferson lecture the us federal governments highest honor for achievement in the humanities his lecture entitled western civilization a view from the east was revised and reprinted in the atlantic monthly under the title the roots of muslim rage2324 his 2007 irving kristol lecture given to the american enterprise institute was published as europe and islam researchedit lewis influence extends beyond academia to the general public he is a pioneer of the social and economic history of the middle east and is famous for his extensive research of the ottoman archives1 he began his research career with the study of medieval arab especially syrian history1 his first article dedicated to professional guilds of medieval islam had been widely regarded as the most authoritative work on the subject for about thirty years25 however after the establishment of the state of israel in 1948 scholars of jewish origin found it more and more difficult to conduct archival and field research in the arab countries where they were suspected of espionage therefore lewis switched to the study of the ottoman empire while continuing to research arab history through the ottoman archives1 which had only recently been opened to western researchers a series of articles that lewis published over the next several years revolutionized the history of the middle east by giving a broad picture of islamic society including its government economy and demographics25 lewis argues that the middle east is currently backward and its decline was a largely selfinflicted condition resulting from both culture and religion as opposed to the postcolonialist view which posits the problems of the region as economic and political maldevelopment mainly due to the 19thcentury european colonization26 in his 1982 work muslim discovery of europe lewis argues that muslim societies could not keep pace with the west and that crusader successes were due in no small part to muslim weakness27 further he suggested that as early as the 11th century islamic societies were decaying primarily the byproduct of internal problems like cultural arrogance which was a barrier to creative borrowing rather than external pressures like the crusades1 in the wake of soviet and arab attempts to delegitimize israel as a racist country lewis wrote a study of antisemitism semites and antisemites 19861 in other works he argued arab rage against israel was disproportionate to other tragedies or injustices in the muslim world such as the soviet invasion of afghanistan and control of muslimmajority land in central asia the bloody and destructive fighting during the hama uprising in syria 1982 the algerian civil war 1992–98 and the iran–iraq war 1980–8828 external video booknotes interview with lewis on what went wrong december 30 2001 cspan29 in addition to his scholarly works lewis wrote several influential books accessible to the general public the arabs in history 1950 the middle east and the west 1964 and the middle east 19951 in the wake of the september 11 2001 attacks the interest in lewiss work surged especially his 1990 essay the roots of muslim rage three of his books were published after 911 what went wrong written before the attacks which explored the reasons of the muslim worlds apprehension of and sometimes outright hostility to modernization the crisis of islam and islam the religion and the people armenian genocideedit see also armenian genocide denial the first two editions of lewis the emergence of modern turkey 1961 and 1968 describe the armenian genocide as the terrible holocaust of 1915 when a million and a half armenians perished30 in later editions this text is altered to the terrible slaughter of 1915 when according to estimates more than a million armenians perished as well as an unknown number of turks31 in this passage lewis argues that the deaths were the result of a struggle for the same land between two competing nationalist movements13 lewis was later one of 69 scholars to cosign a 1985 petition asking the us congress to avoid a resolution condemning the events as genocide the change in lewis textual description of the armenian genocide and his signing of the petition against the congressional resolution was controversial among some armenian historians as well as journalists who suggested that lewis was engaging in historical revisionism to serve his own political and personal interests32 lewis called the label genocide the armenian version of this history in a november 1993 interview with le monde for which he faced a civil proceeding in a french court33 in a subsequent exchange on the pages of le monde lewis wrote that while terrible atrocities did occur there exists no serious proof of a decision and of a plan of the ottoman government aiming to exterminate the armenian nation34 in reference to both these articles the court stated that lewis failed in his duty of objectivity and prudence in expressing himself without nuance on such a sensitive subject35 he was ordered to pay one franc as damages for his statements on the armenian genocide in ottoman turkey36 three other court cases against bernard lewis failed in the paris tribunal including one filed by the armenian national committee of france and two filed by jacques trémollet de villers3637 lewis views on the armenian genocide were criticized by a number of historians and sociologists among them alain finkielkraut yves ternon richard g hovannisian robert melson and pierre vidalnaquet38394041 lewis has been labelled a genocide denier by stephen zunes42 israel charny43 david b macdonald44 and armenian national committee of america45 yair auron suggested that lewis stature provided a lofty cover for the turkish national agenda of obfuscating academic research on the armenian genocide46 israel charny wrote that lewis seemingly scholarly concern of armenians constituting a threat to the turks as a rebellious force who together with the russians threatened the ottoman empire and the insistence that only a policy of deportations was executed barely conceal the fact that the organized deportations constituted systematic mass murder47 charny compares the logical structures employed by lewis in his denial of the genocide to those employed by ernst nolte in his holocaust negationism48 in response lewis argued that the meaning of genocide is the planned destruction of a religious and ethnic group as far as it is known to me there is no evidence for that in the case of the armenians there is no evidence of a decision to massacre on the contrary there is considerable evidence of attempts to prevent it which were not very successful yes there were tremendous massacres the numbers are very uncertain but a million may well be likely49 and the issue is not whether the massacres happened or not but rather if these massacres were as a result of a deliberate preconceived decision of the turkish government there is no evidence for such a decision14 lewis stated that he believed to make the armenian genocide a parallel with the holocaust in germany was rather absurd49 in an interview with haaretz he stated the deniers of holocaust have a purpose to prolong nazism and to return to nazi legislation nobody wants the young turks back and nobody wants to have back the ottoman law what do the armenians want the armenians want to benefit from both worlds on the one hand they speak with pride of their struggle against the ottoman despotism while on the other hand they compare their tragedy to the jewish holocaust i do not accept this i do not say that the armenians did not suffer terribly but i find enough cause for me to contain their attempts to use the armenian massacres to diminish the worth of the jewish holocaust and to relate to it instead as an ethnic dispute50 when lewis received the national humanities medal from us president george w bush in november 2006 the armenian national committee of america objected the presidents decision to honor the work of a known genocide denier—an academic mercenary whose politically motivated efforts to cover up the truth run counter to the very principles this award was established to honor—represents a true betrayal of the public trust51 views and influence on contemporary politicsedit in the mid1960s lewis emerged as a commentator on the issues of the modern middle east and his analysis of the israeli–palestinian conflict and the rise of militant islam brought him publicity and aroused significant controversy american historian joel beinin has called him perhaps the most articulate and learned zionist advocate in the north american middle east academic community52 lewiss policy advice has particular weight thanks to this scholarly authority25 us vice president dick cheney remarked in this new century his wisdom is sought daily by policymakers diplomats fellow academics and the news media53 a harsh critic of the soviet union lewis continued the liberal tradition in islamic historical studies although his early marxist views had a bearing on his first book the origins of ismailism lewis subsequently discarded marxism his later works are a reaction against the leftwing current of thirdworldism which came to be a significant current in middle eastern studies1 david horovitz interviewing bernard lewis in 2011 lewis advocated closer western ties with israel and turkey which he saw as especially important in light of the extension of the soviet influence in the middle east modern turkey holds a special place in lewiss view of the region due to the countrys efforts to become a part of the west1 he is an honorary fellow of the institute of turkish studies an honor which is given on the basis of generally recognized scholarly distinction and long and devoted service to the field of turkish studies54 lewis views christendom and islam as civilizations that have been in perpetual collision since the advent of islam in the 7th century in his essay the roots of muslim rage 1990 he argued that the struggle between the west and islam was gathering strength according to one source this essay and lewis 1990 jefferson lecture on which the article was based first introduced the term islamic fundamentalism to north america55 this essay has been credited with coining the phrase clash of civilizations which received prominence in the eponymous book by samuel huntington56 however another source indicates that lewis first used the phrase clash of civilizations at a 1957 meeting in washington where it was recorded in the transcript57 in 1998 lewis read in a londonbased newspaper alquds alarabi a declaration of war on the united states by osama bin laden in his essay a license to kill lewis indicated he considered bin ladens language as the ideology of jihad and warned that bin laden would be a danger to the west56 the essay was published after the clinton administration and the us intelligence community had begun its hunt for bin laden in sudan and then in afghanistan views on islam and debates with edward saidedit lewis presents some of his conclusions about islamic culture sharia law jihad and the modern day phenomenon of terrorism in his text islam the religion and the people58 he writes of jihad as a distinct religious obligation but suggests that it is a pity that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion muslim fighters are commanded not to kill women children or the aged unless they attack first not to torture or otherwise illtreat prisoners to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities or their resumption after a truce and to honor agreements at no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays59 in lewis view the by now widespread terrorism practice of suicide bombing is a development of the 20th century with no antecedents in islamic history and no justification in terms of islamic theology law or tradition60 he further comments that the fanatical warrior offering his victims the choice of the koran or the sword is not only untrue it is impossible and that generally speaking muslim tolerance of unbelievers was far better than anything available in christendom until the rise of secularism in the 17th century61 lewis is known for his literary debates with edward said the palestinian american literary theorist whose aim was to deconstruct what he called orientalist scholarship said who was a professor at columbia university characterized lewis work as a prime example of orientalism in his 1978 book orientalism and in his later book covering islam said asserted that the field of orientalism was political intellectualism bent on selfaffirmation rather than objective study62 a form of racism and a tool of imperialist domination63 he further questioned the scientific neutrality of some leading middle east scholars including lewis on the arab world in an interview with alahram weekly said suggested that lewis knowledge of the middle east was so biased that it could not be taken seriously and claimed bernard lewis hasnt set foot in the middle east in the arab world for at least 40 years he knows something about turkey im told but he knows nothing about the arab world64 said considered that lewis treats islam as a monolithic entity without the nuance of its plurality internal dynamics and historical complexities and accused him of demagogy and downright ignorance65 in covering islam said argued that lewis simply cannot deal with the diversity of muslim much less human life because it is closed to him as something foreign radically different and other and he criticised lewis inability to grant that the islamic peoples are entitled to their own cultural political and historical practices free from lewis calculated attempt to show that because they are not western they cant be good11 rejecting the view that western scholarship was biased against the middle east lewis responded that orientalism developed as a facet of european humanism independently of the past european imperial expansion1 he noted the french and english pursued the study of islam in the 16th and 17th centuries yet not in an organized way but long before they had any control or hope of control in the middle east and that much of orientalist study did nothing to advance the cause of imperialism in his 1993 book islam and the west lewis wrote what imperial purpose was served by deciphering the ancient egyptian language for example and then restoring to the egyptians knowledge of and pride in their forgotten ancient past66 stance on the iraq waredit in 2002 lewis wrote an article for the wall street journal regarding the buildup to the iraq war entitled time for toppling where he stated his opinion that a regime change may well be dangerous but sometimes the dangers of inaction are greater than those of action67 in 2007 jacob weisberg described lewis as perhaps the most significant intellectual influence behind the invasion of iraq68 michael hirsh attributed to lewis the view that regime change in iraq would provide a jolt that would modernize the middle east and suggested that lewis allegedly orientalist theories about what went wrong in the middle east and other writings formed the intellectual basis of the push towards war in iraq69 writing in 2008 lewis did not advocate imposing freedom and democracy on islamic nations there are things you cant impose freedom for example or democracy democracy is a very strong medicine which has to be administered to the patient in small gradually increasing doses otherwise you risk killing the patient in the main the muslims have to do it themselves70 ian buruma writing for the new yorker in an article subtitled the two minds of bernard lewis finds lewiss stance on the war difficult to reconcile with lewis past statements cautioning democracy enforcement in the world at large buruma ultimately rejects suggestions by his peers that lewis promotes war with iraq to safeguard israel but instead concludes perhaps he loves it the arab world too much it is a common phenomenon among western students of the orient to fall in love with a civilization such love often ends in bitter impatience when reality fails to conform to the ideal the rage in this instance is that of the western scholar his beloved civilization is sick and what would be more heartwarming to an old orientalist than to see the greatest western democracy cure the benighted muslim it is either that or something less charitable if a final showdown between the great religions is indeed the inevitable result of a millennial clash then we had better make sure that we win71 alleged nuclear threat from iranedit in 2006 lewis wrote that iran had been working on a nuclear weapon for fifteen years in august 2006 in an article about whether the world can rely on the concept of mutual assured destruction as a deterrent in its dealings with iran lewis wrote in the wall street journal about the significance of 22 august 2006 in the islamic calendar the iranian president had indicated he would respond by that date to us demands regarding irans development of nuclear power lewis wrote that the date corresponded to the 27th day of the month of rajab of the year 1427 the day muslims commemorate the night flight of muhammad from jerusalem to heaven and back lewis wrote that it would be an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of israel and if necessary of the world72 according to lewis mutual assured destruction is not an effective deterrent in the case of iran because of what lewis describes as the iranian leaderships apocalyptic worldview and the suicide or martyrdom complex that plagues parts of the islamic world today73 he then suggested the possibility of a nuclear strike on israel on 22 august 2006 what is the significance of aug 22 this year aug 22 corresponds in the islamic calendar to the 27th day of the month of rajab of the year 1427 this by tradition is the night when many muslims commemorate the night flight of muhammad on the winged horse buraq first to the farthest mosque usually identified with jerusalem and then to heaven and backquran 171 this might well be deemed an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of israel and if necessary of the world it is far from certain that mr ahmadinejad plans any such cataclysmic events precisely for 22 aug but it would be wise to bear the possibility in mind72 lewis article received significant press coverage7475 however the day passed without any incident7677 in his 2009 book engaging the muslim world the american academic juan cole responded that there was no evidence to suggest that iran had been working on a nuclear weapon for fifteen years he also disagreed with lewis suggestion that ahmadinejad might deploy this weapon against israel on 22 august 2006 see alsoedit bernard lewis bibliography list of princeton university people referencesedit citationsedit a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o kramer martin
