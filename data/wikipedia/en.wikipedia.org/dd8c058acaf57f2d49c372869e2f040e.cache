september 14 1901 was the 25th president of the united states from march 4 1897 until his assassination in september 1901 six months into his second term mckinley led the nation to victory in the spanish–american war raised protective tariffs to promote american industry and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals mckinley was the last president to have served in the american civil war and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier beginning as a private in the union army and ending as a brevet major after the war he settled in canton ohio where he practiced law and married ida saxton in 1876 he was elected to congress where he became the republican partys expert on the protective tariff which he promised would bring prosperity his 1890 mckinley tariff was highly controversial which together with a democratic redistricting aimed at gerrymandering him out of office led to his defeat in the democratic landslide of 1890 he was elected ohios governor in 1891 and 1893 steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests with the aid of his close adviser mark hanna he secured the republican nomination for president in 1896 amid a deep economic depression he defeated his democratic rival william jennings bryan after a frontporch campaign in which he advocated sound money the gold standard unless altered by international agreement and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity rapid economic growth marked mckinleys presidency he promoted the 1897 dingley tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition and in 1900 he secured the passage of the gold standard act mckinley hoped to persuade spain to grant independence to rebellious cuba without conflict but when negotiation failed he led the nation into the spanish–american war of 1898 the us victory was quick and decisive as part of the peace settlement spain turned over to the united states its main overseas colonies of puerto rico guam and the philippines cuba was promised independence but at that time remained under the control of the us army the united states annexed the independent republic of hawaii in 1898 and it became a us territory historians regard mckinleys 1896 victory as a realigning election in which the political stalemate of the post–civil war era gave way to the republicandominated fourth party system which began with the progressive era mckinley defeated bryan again in the 1900 presidential election in a campaign focused on imperialism protectionism and free silver however his legacy was quickly cut short when he was shot on september 6 1901 by leon czolgosz a secondgeneration polishamerican with anarchist leanings mckinley died eight days later and was succeeded by his vice president theodore roosevelt as an innovator of american interventionism and probusiness sentiment mckinleys presidency is generally considered above average though his

child of william mckinley sr and nancy née allison mckinley 1809–18971 the mckinleys were of english and scotsirish descent and had settled in western pennsylvania in the 18th century tracing back to a david mckinley who was born in dervock county antrim in presentday northern ireland there the elder mckinley was born in pine township mercer county1 the family moved to ohio when the senior mckinley was a boy settling in new lisbon now lisbon he met nancy allison there and married her later1 the allison family was of mostly english descent and among pennsylvanias earliest settlers2 the family trade on both sides was ironmaking and mckinley senior operated foundries throughout ohio in new lisbon niles poland and finally canton3 the mckinley household was like many from ohios western reserve steeped in whiggish and abolitionist sentiment the latter based on the familys staunch methodist beliefs4 william followed in the methodist tradition becoming active in the local methodist church at the age of sixteen5 he was a lifelong pious methodist6 in 1852 the family moved from niles to poland ohio so that their children could attend the better schools there graduating from poland seminary in 1859 he enrolled the following year at allegheny college in meadville pennsylvania he remained at allegheny for only one year returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed he also spent time at mount union college in alliance ohio as a board member7 although his health recovered family finances declined and mckinley was unable to return to allegheny first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near poland ohio8 civil waredit western virginia and antietamedit rutherford b hayes was mckinleys mentor during the civil war and afterward when the southern states seceded from the union and the american civil war began thousands of men in ohio volunteered for service9 among them were mckinley and his cousin william mckinley osbourne who enlisted as privates in the newly formed poland guards in june 186110 the men left for columbus where they were consolidated with other small units to form the 23rd ohio infantry11 the men were unhappy to learn that unlike ohios earlier volunteer regiments they would not be permitted to elect their officers they would be designated by ohios governor william dennison11 dennison appointed colonel william rosecrans as the commander of the regiment and the men began training on the outskirts of columbus11 mckinley quickly took to the soldiers life and wrote a series of letters to his hometown newspaper extolling the army and the union cause12 delays in issuance of uniforms and weapons again brought the men into conflict with their officers but major rutherford b hayes convinced them to accept what the government had issued them his style in dealing with the men impressed mckinley beginning an association and friendship that would last until hayes death in 189313 after a month of training mckinley and the 23rd ohio now led by colonel eliakim p scammon set out for western virginia today part of west virginia in july 1861 as a part of the kanawha division14 mckinley initially thought scammon was a martinet but when the regiment finally saw battle he came to appreciate the value of their relentless drilling15 their first contact with the enemy came in september when they drove back confederate troops at carnifex ferry in presentday west virginia16 three days after the battle mckinley was assigned to duty in the brigade quartermaster office where he worked both to supply his regiment and as a clerk17 in november the regiment established winter quarters near fayetteville today in west virginia18 mckinley spent the winter substituting for a commissary sergeant who was ill and in april 1862 he was promoted to that rank19 the regiment resumed its advance that spring with hayes in command scammon by then led the brigade and fought several minor engagements against the rebel forces20 that september mckinleys regiment was called east to reinforce general john popes army of virginia at the second battle of bull run21 delayed in passing through washington dc the 23rd ohio did not arrive in time for the battle but joined the army of the potomac as it hurried north to cut off robert e lees army of northern virginia as it advanced into maryland21 the 23rd was the first regiment to encounter the confederates at the battle of south mountain on september 1422 after severe losses union forces drove back the confederates and continued to sharpsburg maryland where they engaged lees army at the battle of antietam one of the bloodiest battles of the war23 the 23rd was also in the thick of the fighting at antietam and mckinley himself came under heavy fire when bringing rations to the men on the line23a mckinleys regiment again suffered many casualties but the army of the potomac was victorious and the confederates retreated into virginia23 the regiment was then detached from the army of the potomac and returned by train to western virginia24 shenandoah valley and promotionedit mckinley in 1865 just after the war photograph by mathew brady while the regiment went into winter quarters near charleston virginia presentday west virginia mckinley was ordered back to ohio with some other sergeants to recruit fresh troops25 when they arrived in columbus governor david tod surprised mckinley with a commission as second lieutenant in recognition of his service at antietam25 mckinley and his comrades saw little action until july 1863 when the division skirmished with john hunt morgans cavalry at the battle of buffington island26 early in 1864 the army command structure in west virginia was reorganized and the division was assigned to george crooks army of west virginia27 they soon resumed the offensive marching into southwestern virginia to destroy salt and lead mines used by the enemy27 on may 9 the army engaged confederate troops at cloyds mountain where the men charged the enemy entrenchments and drove the rebels from the field27 mckinley later said the combat there was as desperate as any witnessed during the war27 following the rout the union forces destroyed confederate supplies and skirmished with the enemy again successfully27 mckinley and his regiment moved to the shenandoah valley as the armies broke from winter quarters to resume hostilities crooks corps was attached to major general david hunters army of the shenandoah and soon back in contact with confederate forces capturing lexington virginia on june 1128 they continued south toward lynchburg tearing up railroad track as they advanced28 hunter believed the troops at lynchburg were too powerful however and the brigade returned to west virginia28 before the army could make another attempt confederate general jubal earlys raid into maryland forced their recall to the north29 earlys army surprised them at kernstown on july 24 where mckinley came under heavy fire and the army was defeated30 retreating into maryland the army was reorganized again major general philip sheridan replaced hunter and mckinley who had been promoted to captain after the battle was transferred to general crooks staff31 by august early was retreating south in the valley with sheridans army in pursuit32 they fended off a confederate assault at berryville where mckinley had a horse shot out from under him and advanced to opequon creek where they broke the enemy lines and pursued them farther south33 they followed up the victory with another at fishers hill on september 22 and were engaged once more at cedar creek on october 1934 after initially falling back from the confederate advance mckinley helped to rally the troops and turn the tide of the battle34 after cedar creek the army stayed in the vicinity through election day when mckinley cast his first presidential ballot for the incumbent republican abraham lincoln34 the next day they moved north up the valley into winter quarters near kernstown34 in february 1865 crook was captured by confederate raiders35 crooks capture added to the confusion as the army was reorganized for the spring campaign and mckinley found himself serving on the staffs of four different generals over the next fifteen days—crook john d stevenson samuel s carroll and winfield s hancock35 finally assigned to carrolls staff again mckinley acted as the generals first and only adjutant36 lee and his army surrendered to general ulysses s grant a few days later effectively ending the war mckinley found time to join a freemason lodge later renamed after him in winchester virginia before he and carroll were transferred to hancocks first veterans corps in washington37 just before the wars end mckinley received his final promotion a brevet commission as major38 in july the veterans corps was mustered out of service and mckinley and carroll were relieved of their duties38 carroll and hancock encouraged mckinley to apply for a place in the peacetime army but he declined and returned to ohio the following month38 on march 7 1883 mckinley was elected as a first class companion of the district of columbia commandery of the military order of the loyal legion of the united states mollus—a military society of officers who served in the union armed forces during the american civil war and their descendants he was assigned mollus insignia number 3029 mckinley along with samuel m taylor and james c howe coauthored and published a twelve volume work official roster of the soldiers of the state of ohio in the war of the rebellion 1861–1866 published in 188639 legal career and marriageedit ida saxton mckinley katherine mckinley after the war ended in 1865 mckinley decided on a career in the law and began studying in the office of an attorney in poland ohio40 the following year he continued his studies by attending albany law school in new york41 after studying there for less than a year mckinley returned home and was admitted to the bar in warren ohio in march 186741 that same year he moved to canton the county seat of stark county and set up a small office41 he soon formed a partnership with george w belden an experienced lawyer and former judge42 his practice was successful enough for him to buy a block of buildings on main street in canton which provided him with a small but consistent rental income for decades to come42 when his army friend rutherford b hayes was nominated for governor in 1867 mckinley made speeches on his behalf in stark county his first foray into politics43 the county was closely divided between democrats and republicans but hayes carried it that year in his statewide victory43 in 1869 mckinley ran for the office of prosecuting attorney of stark county an office usually then held by democrats and was unexpectedly elected44 when mckinley ran for reelection in 1871 the democrats nominated william a lynch a prominent local lawyer and mckinley was defeated by 143 votes44 as mckinleys professional career progressed so too did his social life blossom as he wooed ida saxton the daughter of a prominent canton family44 they were married on january 25 1871 in the newly built first presbyterian church of canton although ida soon joined her husbands methodist church45 their first child katherine was born on christmas day 187145 a second daughter ida followed in 1873 but died the same year45 mckinleys wife descended into a deep depression at her babys death and her health never robust grew worse45 two years later in 1875 katherine died of typhoid fever ida never recovered from her daughters deaths the mckinleys had no more children45 ida mckinley developed epilepsy around the same time and thereafter disliked her husbands leaving her side45 he remained a devoted husband and tended to his wifes medical and emotional needs for the rest of his life45 ida insisted that mckinley continue his increasingly successful career in law and politics46 he attended the state republican convention that nominated hayes for a third term as governor in 1875 and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall46 the next year mckinley undertook a highprofile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers47 lynch mckinleys opponent in the 1871 election and his partner william r day were the opposing counsel and the mine owners included mark hanna a cleveland businessman47 taking the case pro bono he was successful in getting all but one of the miners acquitted47 the case raised mckinleys standing among laborers a crucial part of the stark county electorate and also introduced him to hanna who would become his strongest backer in years to come47 mckinleys good standing with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the republican nomination for ohios 17th congressional district48 delegates to the county conventions thought he could attract bluecollar voters and in august 1876 mckinley was nominated48 by that time hayes had been nominated for president and mckinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign49 both were successful mckinley campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff defeated the democratic nominee levi l lamborn by 3300 votes while hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency49 mckinleys victory came at a personal cost his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer50 rising politician 1877–1895edit spokesman for protectionedit representative mckinley for additional information on the currency question see cross of gold speech § background under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave protection is but the law of nature the law of selfpreservation of selfdevelopment of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man it is said that protection is immoral why if protection builds up and elevates 63000000 the us population of people the influence of those 63000000 of people elevates the rest of the world we cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefiting mankind everywhere well they say buy where you can buy the cheapest of course that applies to labor as to everything else let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that and it is the protection maxim buy where you can pay the easiest and that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards51 mckinley first took his congressional seat in october 1877 when president hayes summoned congress into special sessionb with the republicans in the minority mckinley was given unimportant committee assignments which he undertook conscientiously52 mckinleys friendship with hayes did mckinley little good on capitol hill the president was not wellregarded by many leaders there53 the young congressman broke with hayes on the question of the currency but it did not affect their friendship54 the united states had effectively been placed on the gold standard by the coinage act of 1873 when silver prices dropped significantly many sought to make silver again a legal tender equally with gold such a course would be inflationary but advocates argued that the economic benefits of the increased money supply would be worth the inflation opponents warned that free silver would not bring the promised benefits and would harm the united states in international trade55 mckinley voted for the bland–allison act of 1878 which mandated large government purchases of silver for striking into money and also joined the large majorities in each house that overrode hayes veto of the legislation in so doing mckinley voted against the position of the house republican leader his fellow ohioan and friend james garfield56 from his first term in congress mckinley was a strong advocate of protective tariffs the primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue but to allow american manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors mckinley biographer margaret leech noted that canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection and that this may have helped form his political views mckinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue57 garfields election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the house ways and means committee mckinley was selected to fill it placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms58 mckinley increasingly became a significant figure in national politics in 1880 he served a brief term as ohios representative on the republican national committee in 1884 he was elected a delegate to that years republican convention where he served as chair of the committee on resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside by 1886 mckinley senator john sherman and governor joseph b foraker were considered the leaders of the republican party in ohio59 sherman who had helped to found the republican party ran three times for the republican nomination for president in the 1880s each time failing60 while foraker began a meteoric rise in ohio politics early in the decade hanna once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor supported shermans ambitions as well as those of foraker the latter relationship broke off at the 1888 republican national convention where mckinley foraker and hanna were all delegates supporting sherman convinced sherman could not win foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful republican 1884 presidential nominee maine senator james g blaine when blaine stated he was not a candidate foraker returned to sherman but the nomination went to former indiana senator benjamin harrison who was elected president in the bitterness that followed the convention hanna abandoned foraker and for the rest of mckinleys life the ohio republican party was divided into two factions one aligned with mckinley sherman and hanna and the other with foraker61 hanna came to admire mckinley and became a friend and close adviser to him although hanna remained active in business and in promoting other republicans in the years after 1888 he spent an increasing amount of time boosting mckinleys political career62 in 1889 with the republicans in the majority mckinley sought election as speaker of the house he failed to gain the post which went to thomas b reed of maine however speaker reed appointed mckinley chairman of the ways and means committee the ohioan guided the mckinley tariff of 1890 through congress although mckinleys work was altered through the influence of special interests in the senate it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods63 gerrymandering and defeat for reelectionedit recognizing mckinleys potential the democrats whenever they controlled the ohio legislature sought to gerrymander or redistrict him out of office64 in 1878 mckinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district he won anyway causing hayes to exult oh the good luck of mckinley he was gerrymandered out and then beat the gerrymander we enjoyed it as much as he did65 after the 1882 election mckinley was unseated on an election contest by a near partyline house vote66 out of office he was briefly depressed by the setback but soon vowed to run again the democrats again redistricted stark county for the 1884 election mckinley was returned to congress anyway67 judge magazine cover from september 1890 showing mckinley left having helped dispatch speaker reeds opponent in earlyvoting maine hurrying off with the victor to mckinleys gerrymandered ohio district for 1890 the democrats gerrymandered mckinley one final time placing stark county in the same district as one of the strongest prodemocrat counties holmes populated by solidly democratic pennsylvania dutch the new boundaries seemed good based on past results for a democratic majority of 2000 to 3000 the republicans could not reverse the gerrymander as legislative elections would not be held until 1891 but they could throw all their energies into the district as the mckinley tariff was a main theme of the democratic campaign nationwide and there was considerable attention paid to mckinleys race the republican party sent its leading orators to canton including blaine then secretary of state speaker reed and president harrison the democrats countered with their best spokesmen on tariff issues68 mckinley tirelessly stumped his new district reaching out to its 40000 voters to explain that his tariff was framed for the people  as a defense to their industries as a protection to the labor of their hands as a safeguard to the happy homes of american workingmen and as a security to their education their wages and their investments  it will bring to this country a prosperity unparalleled in our own history and unrivalled in the history of the world69 democrats ran a strong candidate in former lieutenant governor john g warwick to drive their point home they hired young partisans to pretend to be peddlers who went door to door offering 25cent tinware to housewives for 50 cents explaining the rise in prices was due to the mckinley tariff in the end mckinley lost by 300 votes but the republicans won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory70 governor of ohio 1892–1896edit even before mckinley completed his term in congress he met with a delegation of ohioans urging him to run for governor governor james e campbell a democrat who had defeated foraker in 1889 was to seek reelection in 1891 the ohio republican party remained divided but mckinley quietly arranged for foraker to nominate him at the 1891 state republican convention which chose mckinley by acclamation the former congressman spent much of the second half of 1891 campaigning against campbell beginning in his birthplace of niles hanna however was little seen in the campaign he spent much of his time raising funds for the election of legislators pledged to vote for sherman in the 1892 senatorial election7172c mckinley won the 1891 election by some 20000 votes73 the following january sherman with considerable assistance from hanna turned back a challenge by foraker to win the legislatures vote for another term in the senate74 even after his final run for president in 1884 james g blaine was still seen as a possible candidate for the republican nomination in this 1890 puck cartoon he is startling reed and mckinley right as they make their plans for 1892 ohios governor had relatively little power—for example he could recommend legislation but not veto it—but with ohio a key swing state its governor was a major figure in national politics75 although mckinley believed that the health of the nation depended on that of business he was evenhanded in dealing with labor76 he procured legislation that set up an arbitration board to settle work disputes and obtained passage of a law that fined employers who fired workers for belonging to a union77 president harrison had proven unpopular there were divisions even within the republican party as the year 1892 began and harrison began his reelection drive although no declared candidate opposed harrison many republicans were ready to dump the president from the ticket if an alternative emerged among the possible candidates spoken of were mckinley reed and the aging blaine fearing that the ohio governor would emerge as a candidate harrisons managers arranged for mckinley to be permanent chairman of the convention in minneapolis requiring him to play a public neutral role hanna established an unofficial mckinley headquarters near the convention hall though no active effort was made to convert delegates to mckinleys cause mckinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him nevertheless he finished third behind the renominated harrison and behind blaine who had sent word he did not want to be considered78 although mckinley campaigned loyally for the republican ticket harrison was defeated by former president cleveland in the november election in the wake of clevelands victory mckinley was seen by some as the likely republican candidate in 189679 soon after clevelands return to office hard times struck the nation with the panic of 1893 a businessman in youngstown robert walker had lent money to mckinley in their younger days in gratitude mckinley had often guaranteed walkers borrowings for his business the governor had never kept track of what he was signing he believed walker a sound businessman in fact walker had deceived mckinley telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones walker was ruined by the recession mckinley was called upon for repayment in february 189380 the total owed was over 100000 and a despairing mckinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney81 instead mckinleys wealthy supporters including hanna and chicago publisher h h kohlsaat became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid both william and ida mckinley placed their property in the hands of the funds trustees who included hanna and kohlsaat and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money all of the couples property was returned to them by the end of 1893 and when mckinley who had promised eventual repayment asked for the list of contributors it was refused him many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with mckinley whose popularity grew81 he was easily reelected in november 1893 receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any ohio governor since the civil war82 mckinley campaigned widely for republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections many party candidates in districts where he spoke were successful his political efforts in ohio were rewarded with the election in november 1895 of a republican successor as governor asa bushnell and a republican legislature that elected foraker to the senate mckinley supported foraker for senate and bushnell who was of forakers faction for governor in return the new senatorelect agreed to back mckinleys presidential ambitions with party peace in ohio assured mckinley turned to the national arena83 election of 1896edit further information united states presidential election 1896 and william mckinley presidential campaign 1896 obtaining the nominationedit mckinleys close friend and adviser mark hanna it is unclear when william mckinley began to seriously prepare a run for president as phillips notes no documents no diaries no confidential letters to mark hanna or anyone else contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems84 from the beginning mckinleys preparations had the participation of hanna whose biographer william t horner noted what is certainly true is that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put mckinley in the white house85 sherman did not run for president again after 1888 and so hanna could support mckinleys ambitions for that office wholeheartedly86 backed by hannas money and organizational skills mckinley quietly built support for a presidential bid through 1895 and early 1896 when other contenders such as speaker reed and iowa senator william b allison sent agents outside their states to organize republicans in support of their candidacies they found that hannas agents had preceded them according to historian stanley jones in his study of the 1896 election another feature common to the reed and allison campaigns was their failure to make headway against the tide which was running toward mckinley in fact both campaigns from the moment they were launched were in retreat the calm confidence with which each candidate claimed the support of his own section of the country soon gave way to  bitter accusations that hanna by winning support for mckinley in their sections had violated the rules of the game87 hanna on mckinleys behalf met with the eastern republican political bosses such as senators thomas platt of new york and matthew quay of pennsylvania who were willing to guarantee mckinleys nomination in exchange for promises regarding patronage and offices mckinley however was determined to obtain the nomination without making deals and hanna accepted that decision88 many of their early efforts were focused on the south hanna obtained a vacation home in southern georgia where mckinley visited and met with republican politicians from the region mckinley needed 453½ delegate votes to gain the nomination he gained nearly half that number from the south and border states platt lamented in his memoirs hanna had the south practically solid before some of us awakened89 louis dalrymple cartoon from puck magazine june 24 1896 showing mckinley about to crown himself with the republican nomination the priests are hanna in green and representative charles h grosvenor red h h kohlsaat is the page holding the robe the bosses still hoped to deny mckinley a firstballot majority at the convention by boosting support for local favorite son candidates such as quay new york governor and former vice president levi p morton and illinois senator shelby cullom delegaterich illinois proved a crucial battleground as mckinley supporters such as chicago businessman and future vice president charles g dawes sought to elect delegates pledged to vote for mckinley at the national convention in st louis cullom proved unable to stand against mckinley despite the support of local republican machines at the state convention at the end of april mckinley completed a nearsweep of illinois delegates90 former president harrison had been deemed a possible contender if he entered the race when harrison made it known he would not seek a third nomination the mckinley organization took control of indiana with a speed harrison privately found unseemly morton operatives who journeyed to indiana sent word back that they had found the state alive for mckinley91 wyoming senator francis warren wrote the politicians are making a hard fight against him but if the masses could speak mckinley is the choice of at least 75 of the entire body of republican voters in the union92 by the time the national convention began in st louis on june 16 1896 mckinley had an ample majority of delegates the former governor who remained in canton followed events at the convention closely by telephone and was able to hear part of forakers speech nominating him over the line when ohio was reached in the roll call of states its votes gave mckinley the nomination which he celebrated by hugging his wife and mother as his friends fled the house anticipating the first of many crowds that gathered at the republican candidates home thousands of partisans came from canton and surrounding towns that evening to hear mckinley speak from his front porch the convention nominated republican national committee vice chairman garret hobart of new jersey for vice president a choice actually made by most accounts by hanna hobart a wealthy lawyer businessman and former state legislator was not widely known but as hanna biographer herbert croly pointed out if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it9394 general election campaignedit for additional information on the currency question see cross of gold speech § background before the 1896 convention mckinley tried to avoid coming down on one side or the other of the currency question william allen rogerss cartoon from harpers weekly june 1896 showing mckinley riding the rail of the currency question before the republican convention mckinley had been a straddle bug on the currency question favoring moderate positions on silver such as accomplishing bimetallism by international agreement in the final days before the convention mckinley decided after hearing from politicians and businessmen that the platform should endorse the gold standard though it should allow for bimetallism by international agreement adoption of the platform caused some western delegates led by colorado senator henry m teller to walk out of the convention however compared with the democrats republican divisions on the issue were small especially as mckinley promised future concessions to silver advocates959697 the bad economic times had continued and strengthened the hand of forces for free silver the issue bitterly divided the democratic party president cleveland firmly supported the gold standard but an increasing number of rural democrats wanted silver especially in the south and west the silverites took control of the 1896 democratic national convention and chose william jennings bryan for president he had electrified the delegates with his cross of gold speech bryans financial radicalism shocked bankers—they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy hanna approached them for support for his strategy to win the election and they gave 35 million for speakers and over 200 million pamphlets advocating the republican position on the money and tariff questions9899 mckinley speaks from his front porch historic recording of william mckinley the final 108 of this sound file starting at 540 contains an excerpt from one of his 1896 campaign speeches problems playing this file see media help bryans campaign had at most an estimated 500000 with his eloquence and youthful energy his major assets in the race bryan decided on a whistlestop political tour by train on an unprecedented scale hanna urged mckinley to match bryans tour with one of his own the candidate declined on the grounds that the democrat was a better stump speaker i might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against bryan i have to think when i speak100 instead of going to the people mckinley would remain at home in canton and allow the people to come to him according to historian r hal williams in his book on the 1896 election it was as it turned out a brilliant strategy mckinleys front porch campaign became a legend in american political history100 william and ida mckinley to her husbands left pose with members of the flower delegation from oil city pennsylvania before the mckinley home although women could not vote in most states they might influence male relatives and were encouraged to visit canton mckinley made himself available to the public every day except sunday receiving delegations from the front porch of his home the railroads subsidized the visitors with low excursion rates—the prosilver cleveland plain dealer disgustedly stated that going to canton had been made cheaper than staying at home101102 delegations marched through the streets from the railroad station to mckinleys home on north market street once there they crowded close to the front porch—from which they surreptitiously whittled souvenirs—as their spokesman addressed mckinley the candidate then responded speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation the speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks even the spokesmans remarks were approved by mckinley or a representative this was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him as had happened to blaine in 1884101103104 a man of mark 1896 homer davenport cartoon of mckinley as hannas creature from william randolph hearsts new york journal most democratic newspapers refused to support bryan the major exception being the new york journal controlled by william randolph hearst whose fortune was based on silver mines in biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of homer davenport hanna was viciously characterized as a plutocrat trampling on labor mckinley was drawn as a child easily controlled by big business105 even today these depictions still color the images of hanna and mckinley one as a heartless businessman the other as a creature of hanna and others of his ilk106 the democrats had pamphlets too though not as many jones analyzed how voters responded to the education campaigns of the two parties for the people it was a campaign of study and analysis of exhortation and conviction—a campaign of search for economic and political truth pamphlets tumbled from the presses to be read reread studied debated to become guides to economic thought and political action they were printed and distributed by the million  but the people hankered for more favorite pamphlets became dogeared grimy fell apart as their owners laboriously restudied their arguments and quoted from them in public and private debate107 the battleground proved to be the midwest—the south and most of the west were conceded to bryan—and the democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states108109 the northeast was considered most likely safe for mckinley after the earlyvoting states of maine and vermont supported him in september110 by then it was clear that public support for silver had receded and mckinley began to emphasize the tariff issue by the end of september the republicans had discontinued printing material on the silver issue and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question111 on november 3 1896 the voters had their say mckinley won the entire northeast and midwest he won 51 of the vote and an ample majority in the electoral college bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue and had not appealed to urban workers voters in cities supported mckinley the only city outside the south of more than 100000 population carried by bryan was denver colorado112 1896 electoral vote results the 1896 presidential election is often seen as a realigning election in which mckinleys view of a stronger central government building american industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed the voting patterns established then displaced the neardeadlock the major parties had seen since the civil war the republican dominance begun then would continue until 1932 another realigning election with the ascent of franklin roosevelt113 phillips argues that with the possible exception of iowa senator allison mckinley was the only republican who could have defeated bryan—he theorized that eastern candidates such as morton or reed would have done badly against the illinoisborn bryan in the crucial midwest114 according to the biographer though bryan was popular among rural voters mckinley appealed to a very different industrialized urbanized america115 presidency 1897–1901edit main article presidency of william mckinley

mckinley was sworn in as president on march 4 1897 as his wife and mother looked on the new president gave a lengthy inaugural address he urged tariff reform and stated that the currency issue would have to await tariff legislation he warned against foreign interventions we want no wars of conquest we must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression116 mckinleys most controversial cabinet appointment was that of john sherman as secretary of state sherman had an outstanding reputation but old age was fast reducing his abilities mckinley needed to have hanna appointed to the senate so senator sherman was moved up 117 shermans mental faculties were decaying even in 1896 this was widely spoken of in political circles but mckinley did not believe the rumors117 nevertheless mckinley sent his cousin william mckinley osborne to have dinner with the 73yearold senator he reported back that sherman seemed as lucid as ever118 mckinley wrote once the appointment was announced the stories regarding senator shermans mental decay are without foundation  when i saw him last i was convinced both of his perfect health physically and mentally and that the prospects of life were remarkably good118 maine representative nelson dingley jr was mckinleys choice for secretary of the treasury he declined it preferring to remain as chairman of the ways and means committee charles dawes who had been hannas lieutenant in chicago during the campaign was considered for the treasury post but by some accounts dawes considered himself too young dawes eventually became comptroller of the currency he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged mckinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate lyman j gage president of the first national bank of chicago and a gold democrat119 the navy department was offered to former massachusetts congressman john davis long an old friend from the house on january 30 1897120 although mckinley was initially inclined to allow long to choose his own assistant there was considerable pressure on the presidentelect to appoint theodore roosevelt head of the new york city police commission and a published naval historian mckinley was reluctant stating to one roosevelt booster i want peace and i am told that your friend theodore is always getting into rows with everybody nevertheless he made the appointment121 in addition to sherman mckinley made one other illadvised cabinet appointment122 that of secretary of war which fell to russell a alger former general and michigan governor competent enough in peacetime alger proved inadequate once the conflict with spain began with the war department plagued by scandal alger resigned at mckinleys request in mid1899123 vice president hobart as was customary at the time was not invited to cabinet meetings however he proved a valuable adviser both for mckinley and for his cabinet members the wealthy vice president leased a residence close to the white house the two families visited each other without formality and the vice presidents wife jennie tuttle hobart sometimes substituted as executive mansion hostess when ida mckinley was unwell124 for most of mckinleys administration george b cortelyou served as his personal secretary cortelyou who served in three cabinet positions under theodore roosevelt became a combination press secretary and chief of

spainedit main article spanish–american war political cartoon of 1898 for decades rebels in cuba had waged an intermittent campaign for freedom from spanish colonial rule by 1895 the conflict had expanded to a war for cuban independence126 as war engulfed the island spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher american public opinion favored the rebels and mckinley shared in their outrage against spanish policies127 however while public opinion called for war to liberate cuba mckinley favored a peaceful approach hoping that through negotiation spain might be convinced to grant cuba independence or at least to allow the cubans some measure of autonomy128 the united states and spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897 but it became clear that spain would never concede cuban independence while the rebels and their american supporters would never settle for anything less129 in january 1898 spain promised some concessions to the rebels but when american consul fitzhugh lee reported riots in havana mckinley agreed to send the battleship uss maine there to protect american lives and property130 on february 15 the maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed131 public attention focused on the crisis and the consensus was that regardless of who set the bomb spain had lost control over cuba mckinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine whether the explosion was accidental132 negotiations with spain continued as the court considered the evidence but on march 20 the court ruled that the maine was blown up by an underwater mine133 as pressure for war mounted in congress mckinley continued to negotiate for cuban independence134 spain refused mckinleys proposals and on april 11 mckinley turned the matter over to congress he did not ask for war but congress declared war anyway on april 20 with the addition of the teller amendment which disavowed any intention of annexing cuba135 editorial cartoon intervention in cuba columbia the american people reaches out to help oppressed cuba in 1897 while uncle sam the us government is blind to the crisis and will not use its powerful guns to help judge magazine february 6 1897 the expansion of the telegraph and the development of the telephone gave mckinley a greater control over the daytoday management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed and he used the new technologies to direct the armys and navys movements as far as he was able136 mckinley found alger inadequate as secretary of war and did not get along with the armys commanding general nelson a miles137 bypassing them he looked for strategic advice first from miless predecessor general john schofield and later from adjutant general henry clarke corbin137 the war led to a change in mckinleys cabinet as the president accepted shermans resignation as secretary of state day agreed to serve as secretary until the wars end138 within a fortnight the navy had its first victory when the asiatic squadron led by commodore george dewey destroyed the spanish navy at the battle of manila bay in the philippines139 deweys overwhelming victory expanded the scope of the war from one centered in the caribbean to one that would determine the fate of all of spains pacific colonies140 the next month he increased the number of troops sent to the philippines and granted the forces commander major general wesley merritt the power to set up legal systems and raise taxes—necessities for a long occupation141 by the time the troops arrived in the philippines at the end of june 1898 mckinley had decided that spain would be required to surrender the archipelago to the united states142 he professed to be open to all views on the subject however he believed that as the war progressed the public would come to demand retention of the islands as a prize of war143 meanwhile in the caribbean theater a large force of regulars and volunteers gathered near tampa florida for an invasion of cuba144 the army faced difficulties in supplying the rapidly expanding force even before they departed for cuba but by june corbin had made progress in resolving the problems145 after lengthy delays the army led by major general william rufus shafter sailed from florida on june 20 landing near santiago de cuba two days later146 following a skirmish at las guasimas on june 24 shafters army engaged the spanish forces on july 2 in the battle of san juan hill147 in an intense daylong battle the american force was victorious although both sides suffered heavy casualties148 the next day the spanish caribbean squadron which had been sheltering in santiagos harbor broke for the open sea but was intercepted and destroyed by rear admiral william t sampsons north atlantic squadron in the largest naval battle of the war149 shafter laid siege to the city of santiago which surrendered on july 17 placing cuba under effective american control150 mckinley and miles also ordered an invasion of puerto rico which met little resistance when it landed in july150 the distance from spain and the destruction of the spanish navy made resupply impossible and the spanish government began to look for a way to end the war151 peace and territorial gainedit see also philippine–american war signing of the treaty of paris mckinleys cabinet agreed with him that spain must leave cuba and puerto rico but they disagreed on the philippines with some wishing to annex the entire archipelago and some wishing only to retain a naval base in the area152 although public sentiment seemed to favor annexation of the philippines several prominent political leaders—including democrats bryan and cleveland and the newly formed american antiimperialist league—made their opposition known153 mckinley proposed to open negotiations with spain on the basis of cuban liberation and puerto rican annexation with the final status of the philippines subject to further discussion154 he stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation on cuba began to deteriorate when the american army was struck with yellow fever154 spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on august 12 and treaty negotiations began in paris in september 1898155 the talks continued until december 18 when the treaty of paris was signed156 the united states acquired puerto rico and the philippines as well as the island of guam and spain relinquished its claims to cuba in exchange the united states agreed to pay spain 20 million157 mckinley had difficulty convincing the senate to approve the treaty by the requisite twothirds vote but his lobbying and that of vice president hobart eventually saw success as the senate voted in favor on february 6 1899 57 to 27158 annexation of the republic of hawaii in 1898 during the war mckinley also pursued the annexation of the republic of hawaii the new republic dominated by business interests had overthrown the queen in 1893 when she rejected a limited role for herself159 there was strong american support for annexation and the need for pacific bases in wartime became clear after the battle of manila160 mckinley came to office as a supporter of annexation and lobbied congress to act warning that to do nothing would invite a royalist counterrevolution or a japanese takeover160 foreseeing difficulty in getting twothirds of the senate to approve a treaty of annexation mckinley instead supported the effort of democratic representative francis g newlands of nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of congress161 the resulting newlands resolution passed both houses by wide margins and mckinley signed it into law on july 8 1898161 mckinley biographer h wayne morgan notes mckinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of hawaii showing  a firmness in pursuing it162 the president told cortelyou we need hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did california it is manifest destiny163 expanding influence overseasedit even before peace negotiations began with spain mckinley asked congress to set up a commission to examine trade opportunities in asia and espoused an open door policy in which all nations would freely trade with china and none would seek to violate that nations territorial integrity164 american soldiers scale the walls of beijing to relieve the siege of the international legations august 1900 american missionaries were threatened with death when the boxer rebellion menaced foreigners in china165 americans and other westerners in peking were besieged and in cooperation with other western powers mckinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in june 1900 in the china relief expedition166 the westerners were rescued the next month but several congressional democrats objected to mckinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature167 mckinleys actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military166 after the rebellion ended the united states reaffirmed its commitment to the open door policy which became the basis of american policy toward china168 closer to home mckinley and hay engaged in negotiations with britain over the possible construction of a canal across central america the clayton–bulwer treaty which the two nations signed in 1850 prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there the war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a twoocean navy without a connection closer than cape horn169 now with american business and military interests even more involved in asia a canal seemed more essential than ever and mckinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty169 hay and the british ambassador julian pauncefote agreed that the united states could control a future canal provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified170 mckinley was satisfied with the terms but the senate rejected them demanding that the united states be allowed to fortify the canal170 hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation but mckinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the senates demands170 he was successful and a new treaty was drafted and approved but not before mckinleys assassination in 1901170 tariffs and bimetallismedit 1900 reelection poster celebrates mckinley standing tall on the gold standard with support from soldiers sailors businessmen factory workers and professionals mckinley had built his reputation in congress on high tariffs promising protection for american business and wellpaid american factory workers with the republicans in control of congress ways and means chairman dingley introduced the dingley act which would raise rates on wool sugar and luxury goods mckinley supported it and it became law171 american negotiators soon concluded a reciprocity treaty with france and the two nations approached britain to gauge british enthusiasm for bimetallism171 the prime minister lord salisbury and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the american envoy edward o wolcott that he would be amenable to reopening the mints in india to silver coinage if the viceroys executive council there agreed172 news of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans and misgivings by the indian administration led britain to reject the proposal172 with the international effort a failure mckinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard173 even without the agreement agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the united states and gold from recent strikes in the yukon and australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage174 in the absence of international agreement mckinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the senate175 by 1900 with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions mckinley urged congress to pass such a law and was able to sign the gold standard act on march 14 1900 using a gold pen to do so176 civil rightsedit in the wake of mckinleys election in 1896 african americans were hopeful of progress towards equality mckinley had spoken out against lynching while governor and most african americans who could vote supported him in 1896 mckinleys priority however was in ending sectionalism and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments although mckinley made some appointments of african americans to lowlevel government posts and received some praise for that the appointments were less than they had received under previous republican administrations blanche k bruce an african american who during reconstruction had served as senator from mississippi received the post of register at the treasury department this post was traditionally given to an african american by republican presidents mckinley appointed several black postmasters however when democrats protested the appointment of justin w lyons as postmaster of augusta georgia mckinley asked lyons to withdraw he was subsequently given the post of treasury register after bruces death in 1898177 the president did appoint george b jackson a former slave to the post of customs collector in presidio texas178 however african americans in northern states felt that their contributions to mckinleys victory were overlooked few were appointed to office177 the administrations response to racial violence was minimal causing him to lose black support177 when black postmasters at hogansville georgia in 1897 and at lake city south carolina the following year were assaulted mckinley issued no statement of condemnation although black leaders criticized mckinley for inaction supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events as harrison had done179 mckinley right of center flanked by georgia governor allen d candler front row to mckinleys right and gen william rufus shafter reviewing the atlanta peace jubilee parade december 15 1898 according to historian clarance a bacote before the spanish–american war the negroes in spite of some mistakes regarded mckinley as the best friend they ever had180 under pressure from black leaders mckinley required the war department to commission black officers above the rank of lieutenant mckinley toured the south in late 1898 promoting sectional reconciliation he visited tuskegee institute and black educator booker t washington he also visited confederate memorials in his tour of the south mckinley did not mention the racial tensions or violence although the president received a rapturous reception from southern whites many african americans excluded from official welcoming committees felt alienated by the presidents words and actions181182 gould concluded regarding race mckinley lacked the vision to transcend the biases of his day and to point toward a better future for all americans183 1900 electionedit mckinley ran on his record of prosperity and victory in 1900 winning easy reelection over bryan main article united states presidential election 1900 republicans were generally successful in state and local elections around the country in 1899 and mckinley was optimistic about his chances at reelection in 1900184 mckinleys popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second185 the only question about the republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination mckinley needed a new running mate as hobart had died in late 1899186 mckinley initially favored elihu root who had succeeded alger as secretary of war but mckinley decided that root was doing too good a job at the war department to move him186 he considered other prominent candidates including allison and cornelius n bliss but none were as popular as the republican partys rising star theodore roosevelt187 after a stint as assistant secretary of the navy roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment they fought bravely in cuba and roosevelt returned home covered in glory elected governor of new york on a reform platform in 1898 roosevelt had his eye on the presidency186 many supporters recommended him to mckinley for the second spot on the ticket and roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904186 mckinley remained uncommitted in public but hanna was firmly opposed to the new york governor188 the ohio senator considered the new yorker overly impulsive his stance was undermined by the efforts of political boss and new york senator thomas c platt who disliking roosevelts reform agenda sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president189 when the republican convention began in philadelphia that june no vice presidential candidate had overwhelming support but roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country186 mckinley affirmed that the choice belonged to the convention not to him190 on june 21 mckinley was unanimously renominated and with hannas reluctant acquiescence roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot191 the democratic convention convened the next month in kansas city and nominated william jennings bryan setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest192 the candidates were the same but the issues of the campaign had shifted free silver was still a question that animated many voters but the republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party193 democrats knew the war had been popular even if the imperialism issue was less sure so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power painting mckinley as the servant of capital and big business194 as in 1896 bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while mckinley stayed at home this time making only one speech to accept his nomination195 roosevelt emerged as the campaigns primary speaker and hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in pennsylvania196 bryans campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896 and mckinley never doubted that he would be reelected197 on november 6 1900 he was proven correct winning the largest victory for any republican since 1872198 bryan carried only four states outside the solid south and mckinley even won bryans home state of nebraska198 second termedit soon after his second inauguration on march 4 1901 william and ida mckinley undertook a sixweek tour of the nation traveling mostly by rail the mckinleys were to travel through the south to the southwest and then up the pacific coast and east again to conclude with a visit on june 13 1901 to the panamerican exposition in buffalo new york199 however the first lady fell ill in california causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches he had planned to give urging trade reciprocity he also postponed the visit to the fair until september planning a month in washington and two in canton before the buffalo visit200 assassination and death throesedit main article assassination of william mckinley mckinley entering the temple of music on september 6 1901 shortly before the shots were fired artists conception of the shooting of mckinley although mckinley enjoyed meeting the public cortelyou was concerned with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in europe such as the assassination of king umberto i of italy the previous year and twice tried to remove a public reception from the presidents rescheduled visit to the exposition mckinley refused and cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip201 on september 5 the president delivered his address at the fairgrounds before a crowd of some 50000 people in his final speech mckinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure american manufacturers access to foreign markets he intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term202203 one man in the crowd leon czolgosz hoped to assassinate mckinley he had managed to get close to the presidential podium but did not fire uncertain of hitting his target202 czolgosz since hearing a speech by anarchist emma goldman in cleveland had decided to do something he believed would advance the cause after his failure to get close enough on the fifth czolgosz waited the next day at the temple of music on the exposition grounds where the president was to meet the public czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief and when he reached the head of the line shot mckinley twice in the abdomen204 mckinley urged his aides to break the news gently to ida and to call off the mob that had set on czolgosz—a request that may have saved his assassins life205 mckinley was taken to the exposition aid station where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet although a primitive xray machine was being exhibited on the exposition grounds it was not used mckinley was taken to the milburn house206 in the days after the shooting mckinley appeared to improve doctors issued increasingly optimistic bulletins members of the cabinet who had rushed to buffalo on hearing the news dispersed vice president roosevelt departed on a camping trip to the adirondacks207 leech wrote it is difficult to interpret the optimism with which the presidents physicians looked for his recovery there was obviously the most serious danger that his wounds would become septic in that case he would almost certainly die since drugs to control infection did not exist  prominent new york city physician dr mcburney was by far the worst offender in showering sanguine assurances on the correspondents as the only bigcity surgeon on the case he was eagerly questioned and quoted and his rosy prognostications largely contributed to the delusion of the american public208 unknown to the doctors the gangrene that would kill him was growing on the walls of his stomach slowly poisoning his blood on the morning of september 13 mckinley took a turn for the worse relatives and friends gathered around the death bed at 215 am on september 14 president mckinley died theodore roosevelt had rushed back and took the oath of office as president in buffalo czolgosz put on trial for murder nine days after mckinleys death was found guilty sentenced to death on september 26 and executed by electric chair on october 29 1901209 funeral memorials and legacyedit play media president mckinleys funeral 1901

grief at the news of mckinleys passing210 the stock market faced with sudden uncertainty suffered a steep decline—almost unnoticed in the mourning the nation focused its attention on the casket that made its way by train first to washington where it first lay in the east room of the executive mansion and then in state in the capitol and then was taken to canton211 a hundred thousand people passed by the open casket in the capitol rotunda many having waited hours in the rain in canton an equal number did the same at the stark county courthouse on september 18 the following day a funeral service was held at the first methodist church the casket was then sealed and taken to the mckinley house where relatives paid their final respects212 it was then transported to the receiving vault at west lawn cemetery in canton to await the construction of the memorial to mckinley already being planned213 there was a widespread expectation that ida mckinley would not long survive her husband one family friend stated as william mckinley lay dying that they should be prepared for a double funeral214 this did not occur the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train leech noted the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who huddled in a compartment of the funeral train praying that the lord would take her with her dearest love215 she was thought too weak to attend the services in washington or canton although she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on north market street she remained in canton for the remainder of her life setting up a shrine in her house and often visiting the receiving vault until her death at age 59 on may 26 1907214 she died only months before the completion of the large marble monument to her husband in canton which was dedicated by president roosevelt on september 30 1907 william and ida mckinley are interred there with their daughters atop a hillside overlooking the city of canton216 other memorialsedit in addition to the canton site there are many memorials to mckinley there is a monument at his birthplace in niles 20 ohio schools bear his name217 there are several schools in the united states named mckinley school nearly a million dollars was pledged by contributors or allocated from public funds for the construction of mckinley memorials in the year after his death218 phillips suggests the significant number of major memorials to mckinley in ohio reflected the expectation among ohioans in the years after mckinleys death that he would be ranked among the great presidents219 statues to him may be found in more than a dozen states his name has been bestowed on streets civic organizations and libraries mckinleys name is also used in the large innercity honolulu hawaii high school president william mckinley high school220 in 1896 a gold prospector gave mckinleys name to denali the tallest mountain in north america at 20310 feet 6190 m in support of the then newly minted republican nominee for president the alaska board of geographic names changed the name of the mountain back to denali in 1975 which is what it was called by locals the department of the interior followed suit in august 2015 as a part of a visit to alaska by president barack obama221 similarly denali national park was known as mount mckinley national park until december 2 1980 when it was changed by legislation signed by president jimmy carter217 legacy and historical imageedit the official presidential portrait of william mckinley mckinleys biographer h wayne morgan remarks that mckinley died the most beloved president in history222 however the young enthusiastic roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessors death the new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity mckinley had intended to negotiate with other nations controversy and public interest surrounded roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of mckinley faded by 1920 according to gould mckinleys administration was deemed no more than a mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of theodore roosevelts210 beginning in the 1950s mckinley received more favorable evaluations nevertheless in surveys ranking american presidents he has generally been placed near the middle often trailing contemporaries such as hayes and cleveland210 morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during mckinleys presidency profoundly affected the nations future he more followed public opinion than led it and that mckinleys standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency223 there has been broad agreement among historians that mckinleys election was at the time of a transition between two political eras dubbed the third and fourth party systems224 kenneth f warren emphasizes the national commitment to a probusiness industrial and modernizing program represented by mckinley225 historian daniel p klinghard argued that mckinleys personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency—rather than simply follow the party platform—by representing himself as the voice of the people226 republican karl rove exalted mckinley as the model for a sweeping political realignment behind george w bush in the 2000s227—a realignment that did not happen some political scientists such as david mayhew questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment thereby placing in issue whether mckinley deserves credit for it228 historian michael j korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see mckinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern powerful president this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries229 phillips writes that mckinleys low rating is undeserved and that he should be ranked just after the great presidents such as washington and lincoln he pointed to mckinleys success at building an electoral coalition that kept the republicans mostly in power for a generation230 phillips believes that part of mckinleys legacy is the men he included in his administration who dominated the republican party for a quarter century after his death these officials included cortelyou who served in three cabinet positions under roosevelt and dawes who became vice president under coolidge other mckinley appointees who later became major figures include day who roosevelt elevated to the supreme court where he remained nearly twenty years and william howard taft whom mckinley had made governorgeneral of the philippines and who succeeded roosevelt as president231 a controversial aspect of mckinleys presidency is territorial expansion and the question of imperialism—with the exception of the philippines granted independence in 1946 the united states retains the territories taken under mckinley232 the territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of american empire233 morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of america as a world power he expects the debate over mckinleys actions to continue indefinitely without resolution and notes that however one judges mckinleys actions in american expansion one of his motivations was to change the lives of filipinos and cubans for the better234 morgan alludes to the rise of interest in mckinley as part of the debate over the more assertive american foreign policy of recent decades mckinley was a major actor in some of the most important events in american history his decisions shaped future policies and public attitudes he usually rises in the estimation of scholars who study his life in detail even those who disagree with his policies and decisions see him as an active responsible informed participant in charge of decision making his dignified demeanor and subtle operations keep him somewhat remote from public perception but he is once again at the center of events where he started235 mckinleys tomb in canton mckinley memorial by
