backgrounds visited for the gambling dancing and other forms of entertainment1 massacreedit the clubs regulars included many wealthy restaurant owners several of whom were among the victims security at the club was based in part on a system of passing through multiple successive doors which had been used in similar chinatown gambling dens for generations and had usually been quite effective mak and his accomplices defeated the system only because they were known and trusted by the people at the club their presumed intent was to leave no witnesses since club patrons could have readily identified them — as the one survivor wai y chin did mak had been planning the robbery for weeks and he enlisted benjamin ng and later tony ngcitation needed in the aftermath the doors to the club were padlocked shut until a fire destroyed much of the louisa hotel in 2013 the building continued to house businesses and a small number of residents until the fire1 trial and sentencingedit on
