regulations and decisions making environmental policy a core area of european politics62 european policymakers originally increased the eus capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem63 trade barriers and competitive distortions in the common market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state64 in subsequent years the environment became a formal policy area with its own policy actors principles and procedures the legal basis for eu environmental policy was established with the introduction of the single european act in 198762

environmental action programme65 which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at eu level and worldwide the lisbon treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions66 eu law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in europe as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management62 mitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of eu environmental policy in 2007 member states agreed that in future 20 of the

the general political directions and priorities of the union by gathering together its member states heads of stategovernment elected chief executives the conclusions of its summits held at least quarterly are adopted by consensus the european commission the guardian of the treaties consists of an executive cabinet of public officials led by an indirectly elected president this college of

executive meeting of ministers of member states governments departments which meets to amend approve or reject proposed legislation from the commission it forms the upper house of the eus essentially

legislature it shares with the council of the eu equal legislative powers to amend approve or reject commission proposals for most areas of eu legislation its powers are limited in areas where member states view sovereignty to be of primary concern ie defence it elects the commissions president must approve the college of commissioners and may vote to remove them collectively from office the court of justice of the european union ensures the uniform application of eu law and resolves disputes between eu institutions and member states and against eu institutions on behalf of individuals the european central bank is responsible for monetary stability within member states the european court of auditors investigates the proper management of finances within both the eu entities and eu

the council of europe main article council of europe beyond the eu institutions is the council of europe coe which is a wider international organisation with 47 member states whose stated aim is to uphold human rights democracy and the rule of law in europe its legislative principles are promulgated by the european convention on human rights and its judicial agent is the european court of human rights these ethical institutions are distinct from the legislative european union institutions mentioned above although echr decisions are enforcable upon the eu institutions and upon the several judiciaries of sovereign member states of the eu130 the venice commission formally the european commission for democracy through law provides advise regarding constitutional matters in order to improve functioning of democratic institutions and the protection of human rights in member states of the council of europe relations between the eu and its electorate apart from the national political structures within member states and the directly elected european parliament the eu also encourages citizen participation via development projects such as cordis the eu community research and development information service and the erasmus the european region action scheme for the mobility of university students lobbying at eu level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the aspirations of private initiatives with public interest decisionmaking process131 the five presidents in 2017 were led by the president of the european commission jeanclaude juncker

chairs the gatherings of the eus 28 national heads of governmentstate and is elected by them for a 25 year once renewable term eurogroup president jeroen dijsselbloem who chairs informal meetings of

discuss various possible future social and economic scenarios that will eventually require ratification by the eu electorate132 constitutional nature further information treaties of the european union political system of the european union the classification of the eu in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated it began life as an international organisation and gradually developed into a confederation of states however since the mid1960s it has also added several of the key attributes of a federation such as the direct effect of the law of the general level of government upon the individual133 and majority voting in the decisionmaking process of the general level of government134 without becoming a federation per se scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation being an instance of neither political structure135 for this reason the organisation is termed sui generis incomparable one of a kind136 although some argue that this designation is no longer valid137138 the organisation has traditionally used the terms community and later union to describe itself the difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations and international law where the subjects include sovereign states and international organisations they can also be seen in the light of differing european and american constitutional traditions137 especially in terms of the european tradition the term federation is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law so the eu cannot be called a federation — at least not without qualification it is however described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature and so it may be appropriate to consider it a federal union of states a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of states and the federal state139 the german constitutional court refers to the eu as a staatenverbund an intermediate structure between the staatenbund confederation of states and the bundesstaat federal state consistent with this concept140 this may be a longlived political form professor andrew moravcsik claims that the eu is unlikely to develop further into a federal state but instead has reached maturity as a constitutional system141

of seats and is divided into subnational constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system143 the european union council the council of ministers and the commission fulfilled the duties as the executive for the parliament 17 the european parliament and the council of the european union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure this also applies to the eu budget the european commission is accountable to parliament requiring its approval to take office having to report back to it and subject to motions

political authority145 it is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the eus policy agenda and strategies the european council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies it acts externally as a collective head of state and ratifies important documents for example international agreements and treaties146 tasks for the president of the european council are ensuring the external representation of the eu147 driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states both during meetings of the european council and over the periods between them the european council should not be mistaken for the council of europe an

title149 forms one half of the eus legislature it consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed notwithstanding its different configurations it is considered to be one single body150 in addition to its legislative functions the council also exercises executive functions in relations to the common foreign and security policy european commission commission president jeanclaude juncker the european commission acts as the eus executive arm and is responsible for initiating legislation and the daytoday running of the eu the commission is also seen as the motor of european integration it operates as a cabinet government with 28 commissioners for different areas of policy one from each member state though commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the eu as a whole rather than their home state one of the 28 is the president of the european commission currently jeanclaude juncker appointed by the european council after the president the most prominent commissioner is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who is exofficio a

council with a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions156 the court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and antifraud actions157 the parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the commissions handling of the budget the european court of auditors has signed off the european union accounts every year since 2007when and while making it clear that the european commission has more work to do has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level158159 in their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of union expenditure agriculture and the cohesion fund were materially affected by error160 the european commission estimated in 2009 that the financial effect of irregularities was €1863 million161 competences eu member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the european union in some areas the eu enjoys exclusive competence these are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation in other areas the eu and its member states share the competence to legislate while both can legislate member states can only legislate to the extent to which the eu has not in other policy areas the eu can only coordinate support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws162 that a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence and even with the same policy area the distribution of competences in various policy areas between member states and the union is divided in the following three categories as outlined in title i of part i of the consolidated treaty on the functioning of the european union view talk edit exclusive competence shared competence supporting competence the union has exclusive competence to make directives and conclude international agreements when provided for in a union legislative act

and charter of fundamental rights of the european union the court of justice seated in luxembourg the eu is based on a series of treaties these first established the european community and the eu and then made amendments to those founding treaties163 these are powergiving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals these legal powers include the ability to enact legislationp which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitantsq the eu has legal personality with the right to sign agreements and international treaties164 under the principle of supremacy national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified and thus the laws enacted under them even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law and within limits even constitutional provisionsr courts of justice the judicial branch of the eu—formally called the court of justice of the european union—consists of two courts the court of justice and the general court165 the court of justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states the institutions and cases referred to it by the courts of member states166 the general court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the eus courts167 and the european union civil service tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the european union and its civil service168 decisions from the general court can be appealed to the court of justice but only on a point of law169 fundamental rights the ceremony of the 1990 sakharov prize awarded to aung san suu kyi by martin schulz inside the parliaments strasbourg hemicycle in 2013 the treaties declare that the eu itself is founded on the values of respect for human dignity freedom democracy equality the rule of law and respect for human rights including the rights of persons belonging to minorities  in a society in which pluralism nondiscrimination tolerance justice solidarity and equality between women and men prevail170 in 2009 the lisbon treaty gave legal effect to the charter of fundamental rights of the european union the charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the eus legal acts can be judged it consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the court of justice and derived from the constitutional traditions common to the member states171 the court of justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has on occasion invalidated eu legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights172 although signing the european convention on human rights echr is a condition for eu memberships previously the eu itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a statet nor had the competence to accedeu the lisbon treaty and protocol 14 to the echr have changed this the former binds the eu to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it although the eu is independent from council of europe they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law human rights and democracy further european convention on human rights and european social charter the source of law of charter of fundamental rights are created by council of europe the eu also promoted human rights issues in the wider world the eu opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition abolition of the death penalty is a condition for eu membership173 acts the main legal acts of the eu come in three forms regulations directives and decisions regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force without the requirement for any implementing measuresv and automatically override conflicting domestic provisionsp directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result the details of how they are to be implemented are left to member statesw when the time limit for implementing directives passes they may under certain conditions have direct effect in national law against member states decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation they are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals companies or a particular member state they are most often used in competition law or on rulings on state aid but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions regulations directives and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy174 area of freedom security and justice further information area of freedom security and justice the borders inside the schengen area between germany and austria europol headquarters in the hague netherlands since the creation of the eu in 1993 it has developed its competencies in the area of freedom security and justice initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism to this end agencies have been established that coordinate associated actions europol for cooperation of police forces175 eurojust for cooperation between prosecutors176 and frontex for cooperation between border control authorities177 the eu also operates the schengen information system15 which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities this cooperation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the schengen agreement and the associated cross border crime furthermore the union has legislated in areas such as extradition178 family law179 asylum law180 and criminal justice181 prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treatiesx in more recent years these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race religion disability age and sexual orientationy by virtue of these powers the eu has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the workplace age discrimination and racial discriminationz foreign relations main articles foreign relations of the european union common foreign and security policy and european external action service high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy federica mogherini the eu participates in all g8 and g20 summits g20 summit in hangzhou 2016 donald tusk and jeanclaude juncker with us president donald trump foreign policy cooperation between member states dates from the establishment of the community in 1957 when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the common commercial policy182 steps for a more wideranging coordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of european political cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies it was not however until 1987 when european political cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the single european act epc was renamed as the common foreign and security policy cfsp by the maastricht treaty183 the aims of the cfsp are to promote both the eus own interests and those of the international community as a whole including the furtherance of international cooperation respect for human rights democracy and the rule of law184 the cfsp requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue the unanimity and difficult issues treated under the cfsp sometimes lead to disagreements such as those which occurred over the war in iraq185 the coordinator and representative of the cfsp within the eu is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who speaks on behalf of the eu in foreign policy and defence matters and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment the high representative heads up the european external action service eeas a unique eu department186 that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 december 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon187 the eeas will serve as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the european union188 besides the emerging international policy of the european union the international influence of the eu is also felt

flag on it the common eu format of vehicle registration plate slovak version pictured two of the original core objectives of the european economic community were the development of a common market subsequently becoming a single market and a customs union between its member states the single market involves the free circulation of goods capital people and services within the eu209 and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties discriminatory taxes or import quotas as they travel internally the noneu member states of iceland norway liechtenstein and switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union124 half the trade in the eu is covered by legislation harmonised by the eu221 free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries222 until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow postmaastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ecj judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom the free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to nonmember states the free movement of persons means that eu citizens can move freely between member states to live work study or retire in another country this required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states223 the free movement of services and of establishment allows selfemployed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis while services account for 60–70 of gdp legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas this lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise

community in 1969 in 1992 having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union the member states signed the maastricht treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreedon rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union the states wanting to participate had first to join the european exchange rate mechanism in 1999 the currency union started first as an accounting currency with eleven member states joining in 2002 the currency was fully put into place when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone which by then consisted of 12 member states the eurozone constituted by the eu member states which have adopted the euro has since grown to 19 countries225aa the euro and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the eu are under the control of the european central bank ecb226 the ecb is the central bank for the eurozone and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability it is at the centre of the european system of central banks which comprehends all eu national central banks and is controlled by its general council consisting of the president of the ecb who is appointed by the european council the vicepresident of the ecb and the governors of the national central banks of all 28 eu member states227 the european system of financial supervision is an institutional architecture of the eus framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities the european banking authority the european insurance and occupational pensions authority and the european securities and markets authority to complement this framework there is also a european systemic risk board under the responsibility of the ecb the aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the eu228 to prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the

agricultural policy the largest budgetary expenditure the common agricultural policy cap is one of the long lasting policies of the european community241 the policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production providing certainty in food supplies ensuring a high quality of life for farmers stabilising markets and ensuring reasonable prices for consumersac it was until recently operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention until the 1990s the policy accounted for over 60 of the then european communitys annual budget and as of 2013update accounts for around 34242not in citation given the policys price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction these were intervention stores of products bought up by the community to maintain minimum price levels to dispose of surplus stores they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below community guaranteed prices or farmers were offered subsidies amounting to the difference between the community and world prices to export their products outside the community this system has been criticised for undercutting farmers outside europe especially those in the developing world243 supporters of cap argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living243 since the beginning of the 1990s the cap has been subject to a series of reforms initially these reforms included the introduction of setaside in 1988 where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production milk quotas and more recently the decoupling or disassociation of the money farmers receive from the eu and the amount they produce by the fischler reforms in 2004 agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce toward direct payments based on farm size this is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels241 one of these reforms entailed the modification of the eus sugar regime which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain africancaribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the eu244 competition further information

policies that have affected sport such as the free movement of workers which was at the core of the bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with european citizenship271 the treaty of lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity272 this followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the international olympic committee and fifa due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing
