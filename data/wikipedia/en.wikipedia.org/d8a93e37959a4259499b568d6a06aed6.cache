consolidation or plan of consolidation originates when a landowner takes over several adjacent parcels of land and consolidates them into a single parcel in order to do this the landowner will usually need to make a survey of the parcels and submit the survey to the governing body that would have to approve the consolidation4 a plat of subdivision or plan of subdivision appears when a landowner or municipality divides land into smaller parcels if a landowner owns an acre of land for instance and wants to divide it into three pieces a surveyor would have to take precise measurements of the land and submit the survey to the governing body which would then have to approve it5 a plat of subdivision also applies when a landownerbuilding owner divides a multifamily building into multiple units this can apply for the intention of selling off the individual units as condominiums to individual ownerscitation needed a short plat is the plat of a socalled short subdivision of land into no more than four parcels or up to nine within an urban growth boundary depending on local regulations6 in the state of washington which provides for a more summary process for approval of such subdivisions7 a correction plat or amending plat records minor corrections to an existing plat such as correcting a surveying mistake or a scriveners error such plats can sometimes serve to relocate lotlines or other features but laws usually tightly restrict such use8 a vacating plat functions to legally void a prior plat or portion of a plat the rules normally allow such plats only when all the platted lots remain unsold and no construction of buildings or public improvements has taken place other names associated with parcel maps are land maps tax maps real estate maps landowner maps lot and block

property owner may be unable to utilize his or her property without having to trespass to reach it the platting process restricts the fraudulent practice of knowingly selling lots with no access to public right of way without revealing that such access does not exist property that does not have access to public right of way may be sold provided that the buyer is aware of the lack of a public means of access by water or land creation or vacation of easements dedication of land for other public uses such as parks or areas needed for flood protection ensuring compliance with zoning zoning regulations frequently contain restrictions that govern lot sizes and lot geometry the platting process allows the governing authorities to ensure that all lots comply with these regulations ensuring compliance with a land use plan established to control the development of a city ensuring that all property has access to public utilities reading a platedit plats contain a number of informational elements the property boundaries are indicated by bearing and distance the bearing is in the format of degrees minutes seconds with compass point letters before and afterward to indicate the compass quadrant for example n 38 00 00 e is 38 degrees into the northeast quadrant or 38 degrees east of north similarly s 22 00 00 w is 22 degrees west of south note that north here is true north so magnetic orientation must be corrected for magnetic declination the certification note provides information on the surveyor and is the location where recent us plats place the flood survey code in accordance with the national flood insurance act of 1968 the north arrow is familiar to most map readers the title block and lot numbers provide information specific to a development or land use plan

outline of the right of way and sometimes depicts the paved area historyedit a pamphlet for a walking tour of boises original ten blocks the creation of a plat map marks an important step in the
