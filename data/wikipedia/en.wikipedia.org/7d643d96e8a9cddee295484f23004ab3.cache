his father could continue his job as a cashier at the british colonial office he had a younger sister kashmira14 mercury spent most of his childhood in india and began taking piano lessons at the age of seven15 in 1954 at the age of eight mercury was sent to study at st peters school a britishstyle boarding school for boys in panchgani near bombay now mumbai16 at the age of 12 he formed a school band the hectics and covered rock and roll artists such as cliff richard and little richard17 it has been said that one of his formative musical influences at the time was bollywood singer lata mangeshkar18 but one of mercurys former bandmates from the hectics has said that that is a lot of rubbish the only music he listened to and played was western pop music19 a friend from the time recalls that he had an uncanny ability to listen to the radio and replay what he heard on piano20 it was also at st peters where he began to call himself freddie and in february 1963 he moved back to zanzibar where he joined his parents at their flat21 english heritage blue plaque at 22 gladstone avenue feltham london at the age of 17 mercury and his family fled from zanzibar for safety reasons due to the 1964 zanzibar revolution22 in which thousands of arabs and indians were killed23 the family moved into a small house at 22 gladstone avenue feltham middlesex england mercury enrolled at isleworth polytechnic now west thames college in west london where he studied art he ultimately earned a diploma in art and graphic design at ealing art college now the ealing campus of university of west london later using these skills to design the queen heraldic arms a british citizen at birth mercury remained so for the rest of his life16 following graduation mercury joined a series of bands and sold secondhand clothes in the kensington market in london with girlfriend mary austin he also held a job at heathrow airport friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man who showed a great deal of interest in music24 in 1969 he joined the liverpoolbased band ibex later renamed wreckage he lived briefly in a flat above the liverpool pub the dovedale towers2526 when this band failed to take off he joined a second band called sour milk sea however by early 1970 this group had broken up as well27 in april 1970 mercury joined guitarist brian may and drummer roger taylor who had previously been in a band called smile in 1971 they were joined by bassist john deacon despite reservations of the other members and trident studios the bands initial management mercury chose the name queen for the new band he later said its very regal obviously and it sounds splendid its a strong name very universal and immediate i was certainly aware of the gay connotations but that was just one facet of it28 at about the same time he changed his surname bulsara to mercury29 mercury designed queens logo called the queen crest shortly before the release of the bands first album30 the logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members two lions for leo deacon and taylor a crab for cancer may and two fairies for virgo mercury30 the lions embrace a stylised letter q the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion30 there is also a crown inside the q and the whole logo is overshadowed by an enormous phoenix the whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the royal coat of arms of the united kingdom particularly with the lion supporters30 career singer freddie mercury in 1977 mercurys known vocal range although mercurys speaking voice naturally fell in the baritone range he delivered most songs in the tenor range31 his known vocal range extended from bass low f f2 to soprano high f f632 he could belt up to tenor high f f532 biographer david bret described his voice as escalating within a few bars from a deep throaty rockgrowl to tender vibrant tenor then on to a highpitched perfect coloratura pure and crystalline in the upper reaches33 spanish soprano montserrat caballé with whom mercury recorded an album expressed her opinion that the difference between freddie and almost all the other rock stars was that he was selling the voice34 she adds his technique was astonishing no problem of tempo he sang with an incisive sense of rhythm his vocal placement was very good and he was able to glide effortlessly from a register to another he also had a great musicality his phrasing was subtle delicate and sweet or energetic and slamming he was able to find the right colouring or expressive nuance for each word32 the who lead singer roger daltrey called mercury the best virtuoso rock n roll singer of all time he could sing anything in any style he could change his style from line to line and god thats an art and he was brilliant at it35 a research team undertook a study in 2016 to understand the appeal behind mercurys voice36 led by professor christian herbst the team identified his notably faster vibrato and use of subharmonics as unique characteristics of mercurys voice particularly in comparison to opera singers and confirmed a vocal range from f2 to g5 just over 3 octaves but were unable to confirm claims of a 4octave range37 the research team studied vocal samples from 23 commercially available queen recordings his solo work and a series of interviews of the late artist they also used an endoscopic video camera to study a rock singer brought in to imitate mercurys singing voice3837 songwriter mercury wrote 10 of the 17 songs on queens greatest hits album bohemian rhapsody seven seas of rhye killer queen somebody to love good oldfashioned lover boy we are the champions bicycle race dont stop me now crazy little thing called love and play the game39 the most notable aspect of his songwriting involved the wide range of genres that he used which included among other styles rockabilly progressive rock heavy metal gospel and disco as he explained in a 1986 interview i hate doing the same thing again and again and again i like to see whats happening now in music film and theatre and incorporate all of those things40 compared to many popular songwriters mercury also tended to write musically complex material for example bohemian rhapsody is acyclic in structure and comprises dozens of chords4142 he also wrote six songs from queen ii which deal with multiple key changes and complex material crazy little thing called love on the other hand contains only a few chords despite the fact that mercury often wrote very intricate harmonies he also claimed that he could barely read music43 he wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of different key signatures41 live performer mercury performing live in september 1984 mercury was noted for his live performances which were often delivered to stadium audiences around the world he displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked a great deal of participation from the crowd a writer for the spectator described him as a performer out to tease shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself44 david bowie who performed at the freddie mercury tribute concert and recorded the song under pressure with queen praised mercurys performance style saying of all the more theatrical rock performers freddie took it further than the rest he took it over the edge and of course i always admired a man who wears tights i only saw him in concert once and as they say he was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his hand45 queen guitarist brian may wrote that mercury could make the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected46 mercurys main prop on stage was a broken microphone stand which after accidentally snapping off the heavy base during an early performance he realised could be used in endless ways47 one of mercurys most notable performances with queen took place at live aid in 1985 queens performance at the event has since been voted by a group of music executives as the greatest live performance in the history of rock music the results were aired on a television program called the worlds greatest gigs4849 mercurys powerful sustained note during the a cappella section came to be known as the note heard round the world50 in reviewing live aid in 2005 one critic wrote those who compile lists of great rock frontmen and award the top spots to mick jagger robert plant etc all are guilty of a terrible oversight freddie as evidenced by his dionysian live aid performance was easily the most godlike of them all51 over the course of his career mercury performed an estimated 700 concerts in countries around the world with queen a notable aspect of queen concerts was the large scale involved40 he once explained were the cecil b demille of rock and roll always wanting to do things bigger and better40 the band was the first ever to play in south american stadiums breaking worldwide records for concert attendance in the morumbi stadium in são paulo in 198152 in 1986 queen also played behind the iron curtain when they performed to a crowd of 80000 in budapest in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in eastern europe53 mercurys final live performance with queen took place on 9 august 1986 at knebworth park in england and drew an attendance estimated as high as 16000054 with the british national anthem god save the queen playing at the end of the concert mercurys final act on stage saw him draped in a robe holding a golden crown aloft bidding farewell to the crowd55 instrumentalist mercury playing rhythm guitar during a live concert with queen in frankfurt germany 1984 as a young boy in india mercury received formal piano training up to the age of nine later on while living in london he learned guitar much of the music he liked was guitaroriented his favourite artists at the time were the who the beatles jimi hendrix david bowie and led zeppelin he was often selfdeprecating about his skills on both instruments and from the early 1980s began extensively using guest keyboardists most notably he enlisted fred mandel a canadian musician who also worked for pink floyd elton john and supertramp for his first solo project and from 1985 onward collaborated with mike moran in the studio and spike edney in concert56 mercury played the piano in many of queens most popular songs including killer queen bohemian rhapsody good old fashioned lover boy we are the champions somebody to love and dont stop me now he used concert grand pianos and occasionally other keyboard instruments such as the harpsichord from 1980 onward he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio queen guitarist brian may claims that mercury was unimpressed with his own abilities at the piano and used the instrument less over time because he wanted to walk around onstage and entertain the audience57 although he wrote many lines for the guitar mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument songs like ogre battle and crazy little thing called love were composed on the guitar the latter featured mercury playing rhythm guitar on stage and in the studio58 solo career see also the solo collection in addition to his work with queen mercury put out two solo albums and several singles although his solo work was not as commercially successful as most queen albums the two offqueen albums and several of the singles debuted in the top 10 of the uk music charts his first solo effort goes back to 1972 under the pseudonym larry lurex when trident studios house engineer robin geoffrey cable was working in a musical project at the time when queen were recording their debut album cable enlisted mercury to perform lead vocals on the songs i can hear music and goin back both were released together as a single in 1973 it reached the 115 position on the us bubbling under the hot 100 chart59 eleven years

mercury a posthumous ivor novello award from the british academy of songwriters composers and authors63 allmusic critic eduardo rivadavia describes mr bad guy as outstanding from start to finish and expressed his view that mercury did a commendable job of stretching into uncharted territory64 in particular the album is heavily synthesiserdriven in a way that is not characteristic of previous queen albums his second album barcelona recorded with spanish soprano montserrat caballé combines elements of popular music and opera many critics were uncertain what to make of the album one referred to it as the most bizarre cd of the year65 the album was a commercial success66 and the albums title track debuted at no 8 in the uk and was also a hit in spain67 the title track received massive air play as the official anthem of the 1992 summer olympics held in barcelona one year after mercurys death caballé sang it live at the opening of the olympics with mercurys part played on a screen and

elektra records and in december 1976 mercury told austin of his sexuality which ended their romantic relationship5674 mercury moved out of the flat they shared into 12 stafford terrace in kensington and bought austin a place of her own nearby56 they remained close friends through the years with mercury often referring to her as his only true friend in a 1985 interview mercury said of austin all

friendship with kenny everett radio dj kenny everett first met mercury in 1974 when he invited the singer onto his breakfast show on capital london83 as two of britains most flamboyant outrageous and bestloved entertainers they shared much in common and instantly became close friends83 everett would play a major role in queens early success when in 1975 armed with an advance copy of the single bohemian rhapsody mercury went to see everett76 while privately everett doubted any station would play the song due to its length at over 6 minutes he said nothing to mercury and placed the song on the turntable and after hearing it enthused forget it its going to be number one for centuries76 while capital radio hadnt officially accepted the song the anarchic everett would talk incessantly about a record he had but couldnt play before the song accidentally started playing with everett stating oops my finger mustve slipped76 capitals switchboard was jammed with callers wanting to know when the song was going to be released – on one occasion everett aired the song 36 times in one day8384 during the 1970s their friendship became closer with everett becoming advisor and mentor to mercury and mercury as everetts confidante helping him to accept his sexuality83 throughout the early to mid1980s they continued to explore their homosexuality as well as experimenting in drugs and although they were never lovers they did experience london night life on a regular basis together83 by 1985 they had fallen out over a disagreement on their using and sharing of drugs and their friendship was further strained when everett was outed by in the autobiography of his exwife lady lee with mercury taking lees side83 with both suffering from failing health mercury and everett started talking again in 1989 and they were able to reconcile their differences83 sexual orientation while some commentators claimed mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public223485 others claimed he was openly gay8687 in december 1974 when asked directly so how about being bent by the new musical express mercury replied youre a crafty cow lets put it this way there were times when i

decriminalised in the united kingdom in 1967 only seven years earlier in the 1980s he would often distance himself from his partner jim hutton during public events82 in october 1986 the sun claimed mercury had confessed to a string of onenight gay sex affairs88 during his career mercurys flamboyant stage performances sometimes led journalists to allude to his sexuality dave dickson reviewing queens performance at wembley arena in 1984 for kerrang noted mercurys camp addresses to the audience and even described him as a posing pouting posturing tart89 in 1992 john marshall of gay times expressed the following opinion mercury was a scenequeen not afraid to publicly express his gayness but unwilling to analyse or justify his lifestyle it was as if freddie mercury was saying to the world i am what i am so what and that in itself for some was a statement90 in an article for afterelton robert urban stated mercury did not ally himself to political outness or to lgbt causes90 personality although he cultivated a flamboyant stage personality mercury was shy and retiring when not performing particularly around people he did not know well203491 and granted very few interviews

gay club or bar at night97 the party held on 5 september 1987 has been described as the most incredible example of excess the mediterranean island had ever seen and was attended by some 700 people98 a cake in the shape of gaudis sagrada família was provided for the party although the original cake collapsed and was replaced with a 2metrelong sponge with the notes from mercurys song barcelona96 the

returning from a trip to japan mercury denied he had a sexually transmitted disease88 according to his partner jim hutton mercury was diagnosed with aids in late april 1987100 around that time mercury claimed in an interview to have tested negative for hiv34 despite the denials the british press pursued the rampant rumours over the next few years fuelled by mercurys increasingly gaunt appearance queens absence from touring and reports from former lovers to various tabloid journals – by 1990 the rumours about mercurys health were rife101 at the 1990 brit awards held at the dominion theatre london on 18 february a visibly frail mercury made his final appearance on stage when he joined the rest of queen to collect the brit award for outstanding contribution to music102103 towards the end of his life he was routinely stalked by photographers while the sun featured a series of articles claiming that he was ill notably in an article from november 1990 that featured an image of a haggardlooking mercury on the front page accompanied by the headline its official – freddie is seriously ill104 however mercury and his inner circle of colleagues and friends whom he felt he could trust continually denied the stories even after one frontpage article published on 29 april 1991 showed mercury appearing very haggard in what was by then a rare public appearance105 it has been suggested that he could have made a contribution to aids awareness by speaking earlier about his situation and his fight against the disease106107 mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him with brian may confirming in a 1993 interview he had informed the band of his illness much earlier108109 filmed in may 1991 the music video for these are the days of our lives features a very thin mercury in what are his final scenes in front of the camera110 the rest of the band were ready to record when mercury felt able to come into the studio for an hour or two at a time may says of mercury he just kept saying write me more write me stuff i want to just sing this and do it and when i am gone you can finish it off he had no fear really99 justin shirleysmith the assistant engineer for those last sessions states this is hard to explain to people but it wasnt sad it was very happy he freddie was one of the funniest people i ever encountered i was laughing most of the time with him freddie was saying of his illness im not going to think about it im going to do this99 after the conclusion of his work with queen in june 1991 mercury retired to his home in kensington west london his former partner mary austin had been a particular comfort in his final years and in the last few weeks of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him111 near the end of

take his medication and continued taking only painkillers111 on 22 november 1991 mercury called queens manager jim beach over to his kensington home to discuss a public statement the next day the following announcement was made to the international press on behalf of mercury108 following the enormous conjecture in the press over the last two weeks i wish to confirm that i have been tested hiv positive and have aids i felt it correct to keep this information private to date to protect the privacy of those around me however the time has come now for my friends and fans around the world to know the truth and i hope that everyone will join with me my doctors and all those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease my privacy has always been very special to me and i am famous
