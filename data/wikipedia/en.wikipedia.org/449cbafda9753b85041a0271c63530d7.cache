wilkes expedition in 18412 however it is not known for whom the bay is named candidates include members of the expedition ships chaplain jared elliott ships boy george elliott and midshipman samuel elliott the last has been deemed the most likely namesake3 commodore jesse elliott has also been proposed as a possible source of the name4 the bay has been referred to as duwamish bay and seattle harbor5 especially before the us board on geographic names officially settled on the name elliott bay in 18952 duwamish head west seattle the duwamish people lived in the vicinity of elliott bay and the duwamish river for thousands of years and had established at least 17 settlements by the time white settlers came in the 1850s6 among the earliest white settlements was by the denny party at new york alki which is in the presentday neighborhood of alki in west seattle however after a hard winter they shifted across elliott bay near the presentday pioneer square which became seattle over the years the city expanded to cover all of the waterfront on elliott bay and codified it as one of its fairways a navigable waterway7 a local legend says that the puget sound mosquito fleet which peaked in the early 20th century was sonamed by a seattleite who looked out over elliott bay and remarked that the activity resembled that of mosquitoes8 two notable sinkings related to the mosquito fleet

east from a line drawn from duwamish head north to magnolia bluff12 the duwamish river empties into the southeastern part of the bay this area was extensively modified by human development in the 20th century to channelize the river and fill in tideflats to create harbor island which was once the worlds largest artificial island west of the river delta the land juts north into the bay at duwamish

other sites have been designated for cleanup including the pacific sound resources site29 and others along the lower duwamish the downtown waterfront offers a poor habitat for the juvenile salmon that migrate from the duwamish river due to the darkness under the piers and the lack of food along the vertical alaskan way seawall the seawall redevelopment project aims to improve the habitat by installing underwater structures to create shallows where salmon can find food and glass blocks in the sidewalk cantilevered over the bay so that sunlight can illuminate the shallows even at the piers30 referencesedit a b elliott bayduwamish river wa damage assessment remediation restoration program noaa office of response and restoration november 2 2010 archived from the original on october
