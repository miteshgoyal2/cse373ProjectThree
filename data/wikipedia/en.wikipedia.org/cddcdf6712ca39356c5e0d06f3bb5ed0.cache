message the republican national convention rnc is a series of presidential nominating conventions of the united states republican party since 1856 administered by the republican national committee the stated purpose of the convocation is to nominate an official candidate in an upcoming us presidential election and to adopt the party platform and rules for the election cycle like the democratic national convention it signifies the end of a presidential primary season and the start of campaigning for a general election in recent years the nominee has been known well before the convention some 2472 delegates have attended the 2016 republican national convention in cleveland ohio july 18–21 to select the presidential nominee the winner must carry 1237—half of the total plus one1 if no single candidate has secured a majority of delegates after the first ballot a brokered convention results it has never happened since the 1976 republican national convention historically the convention was the final determinant of the nomination and often contentious as various factions of party insiders maneuvered to advance their candidates since the almost universal adoption of the primary election for selecting delegates in the last quarter of the 20th century however the conventions significance has diminished the national party focuses on the convention as a unity point to bring together a party platform and state parties by having delegates vote on issues which the nominee can then incorporate into his presidential campaign in case of a brokered convention rule 40b of the 2016 convention rules states that a candidate must have the support of a majority of the delegates of at least eight delegations in order to get the nomination2 on the first ballot delegates from all states and territories except colorado wyoming north dakota virgin islands american samoa guam and a few from louisiana must vote for the candidate who won their support on the day of their states primary or caucus on the second ballot 55 percent of the delegates are free to vote for whomever they want by the third ballot 85 percent of the delegates are free3better source needed contents 1 delegations 11 calculation examples 111 texas 112 california 113 wyoming 2 history 3 see also 4 references 5 external links delegationsedit the size of delegations to the republican national convention for each state territory or other political subdivision are determined by rule 14 of the partys national rules the rules use a mix of atlarge delegates the number of which is equal among states but not territories delegates based roughly on population using the number of united states house of representatives members allocated to a state and delegates awarded based on the state partys success in electing or supporting republican candidates at the national and state levels as of 2012 the size of each states delegation is calculated as follows4 atlarge delegates the national committeeman the national committeewoman and the chairperson of the state republican party of each state american samoa the district of columbia guam the northern mariana islands puerto rico and the us virgin islands are automatically nominated as delegates to the national convention the republican party does not have superdelegates as does the democratic party the only delegates automatically seated based on official party position are these three persons in addition each of the fifty states but not territories or dc are allowed ten additional atlarge delegates congressional delegation delegates each state is allowed three district delegates for each member of the united states house of representatives in lieu of congressional delegation delegates nonstate political subdivisions are allowed specified numbers of delegates 16 from dc 20 from puerto rico but if it becomes a state prior to the next election the number is calculated using the three per house member rule and six each from american samoa guam the northern mariana islands and the us virgin islands presidential support delegates a state can earn additional delegates if the state voted in the plurality for the gop candidate if the state casts at least a majority of its electoral college votes for the republican nominee in the preceding presidential election the state can earn four and onehalf delegates at large plus a number of the delegates at large equal to 60 percent of the number of electoral votes of that state all fractions are rounded upwards should puerto rico become a state between national conventions it would earn additional delegates under this provision regardless of whether its voters supported the gop or democratic candidate should the district of columbia cast its electoral votes or a majority thereof for the republican nominee for president of the united states in the last preceding presidential election it shall be permitted four and one half delegates at large plus the number of delegates at large equal to thirty percent 30 of the 16 delegates at large allotted to the district of columbia rounding any fraction upward republican state success delegates each state can earn additional delegates based on how well the state party does in electing candidates to state and national elections the accomplishments are determined in the year of the last preceding presidential election or at any subsequent election held prior to january 1 of the year in which the next national convention is held as such a state is not penalized if for example it had a republican governor then voted a democratic governor into office but if the state had a democratic governor then voted in a republican governor it is rewarded for taking the seat a republican governor of a state the state would earn one delegate for this accomplishment republicans holding at least half of a states delegation in the united states house of representatives the state would earn one delegate for this accomplishment republicans holding a majority of members of either chamber of a state legislature if that chamber is also presided over by a republican the state would earn one delegate for this accomplishment if republicans hold a majority of members of both chambers of a state legislature and if both chambers are also presided over by a republican then the state would earn two delegates a republican united states senator or if one was elected by such state in the sixyear period prior to january 1 of the year in which the next national convention is held the state would earn one delegate if one senator is or was a republican or two if both are or were republicans one alternate delegate is also awarded for each regular delegate except for members of the republican national committee the composition of the individual state and territory delegations is determined by the bylaws of their respective state and territory parties since 1972 almost all have appointed delegates by primary election results although some notably iowa use caucuses and others combine the primary with caucuses or with delegates elected at a state convention in the past competing factions of a state party sometimes drew up separate lists of delegates each claiming to be the official one one of the first agenda items at a convention is therefore credentialing whereby the credentials committee determines which group is recognized as the official delegationcitation needed calculation examplesedit to show the calculation of a states delegation and the effect that both population and gop success within a state has on the delegations size the following examples for the 2016 convention are provided for three states texas california and wyoming texasedit texas is the secondmost populous state and it is also a republican stronghold its delegation would consist of 155 members as follows under the atlarge rule texas is allowed 13 delegates the chairperson of the texas republican party the state national committeeman and the state national committeewoman each count as one delegate plus the ten allowed for each state under the congressional delegation rule texas has 36 members in the house of representatives thus texas is allowed 108 delegates 36 3 under the presidential support rule as mitt romney carried texas in the 2012 united states presidential election and as texas has 38 electors 36 house members plus its two senators texas is allowed an automatic 45 delegates plus an additional 228 delegates based on electoral size 38 60 for a total of 273 45 228 rounded upward to 28 delegates under the republican state success rule texas is allowed additional delegates in each subcategory as follows the current governor of texas greg abbott is republican thus texas earns one additional delegate under this provision of the 36 current members of the texas delegation within the house of representatives 25 are republicans thus texas earns one additional delegate under this provision both houses of the texas legislature are controlled by the republican party 98–52 in the texas house of representatives and 20–11 in the texas senate and both chambers are presided over by a republican joe straus as the speaker of the house and dan patrick as lieutenant governor which presides over the senate thus texas two additional delegates under this provision one for having at least one chamber meeting the criteria and one for having both chambers meet the criteria both united states senators from texas are republicans john cornyn and ted cruz thus texas earns two additional delegates under this provision one for each republican senator the texas delegation would thus consist of 10 at large 3 chairs 108 congressional delegation 28 state carried for republican presidential candidate 1 republican governor 1 majority republican state delegation within the house 2 both state legislative chambers majority republican and both presided by republicans 2 two republican senators 155 members californiaedit california is the mostpopulous state however it is a democratic party stronghold its delegation would consist of 172 members as follows under the atlarge rule california is allowed 13 delegates the chairperson of the california gop the state national committeeman and the state national committeewoman each count as one delegate plus the ten allowed for each state under the congressional delegation rule california has 53 members in the house of representatives thus california is allowed 159 delegates 53 3 under the presidential support rule as mitt romney failed to carry california in the 2012 united states presidential election california is not allowed any additional delegates under the gop state success rule california is allowed no additional delegates as it did not earn any within any subcategory the current governor of california jerry brown is democrat and california has not elected a republican governor within the past four years brown was first elected in 2010 of the 53 current members of the california delegation within the house of representatives the majority are democrats and california has not had a majorityrepublican delegation within the past four years both chambers of the california legislature are controlled by the democrats and the republicans have not held a majority in either chamber within the past four years both united states senators from california are democrats barbara boxer and dianne feinstein and california has not elected a republican senator within the past six years both boxer and feinstein were elected in 1992 feinstein in a regular election and boxer in a special election the california delegation would thus consist of 10 at large 3 chairs 159 congressional delegation 172 members or only 11 more than those from texas despite being a considerably larger state its congressional delegation is over 47 larger than texas congressional delegation wyomingedit wyoming is the leastpopulous state and it is also a gop stronghold its delegation would consist of 29 members as follows under the atlarge rule wyoming is allowed 13 delegates the chairperson of the wyoming gop the state national committeeman and the state national committeewoman each count as one delegate plus the ten allowed for each state under the congressional delegation rule wyoming has a single member in the house of representatives thus wyoming is allowed three delegates 1 3 under the presidential support rule as mitt romney carried wyoming in the 2012 united states presidential election and as wyoming has three electors its single house member plus its two senators wyoming is allowed an automatic 45 delegates plus an additional 18 delegates based on electoral size 3 60 for a total of 63 45 18 rounded upward to seven delegates under the gop state success rule wyoming is allowed additional delegates in each subcategory as follows one additional delegate as the current governor of wyoming matt mead is republican as the single member of the wyoming delegation within the house of representatives is republican cynthia lummis thus one additional delegate under this provision as both houses of the wyoming legislature are controlled by the gop 528 in the wyoming house of representatives and 26–4 in the wyoming senate and both chambers are presided over by a republican kermit brown as the speaker of the house and phil nicholas as president of the senate two additional delegates one for having any chamber meeting the criteria and one additional for having both chambers meet the criteria as both united states senators from wyoming are republicans john barrasso and mike enzi two additional delegates the wyoming delegation would thus consist of 10 at large 3 chairs 3 congressional delegation 7 state carried for gop presidential candidate 1 gop governor 1 majority gop state delegation within the house 2 both state legislative chambers majority gop and both presided by republicans 2 two gop senators 29 members this is approximately 187 of the texas delegation even though the census estimate of the 2012 population of wyoming 576412 is only 22 of that for texas 26059203 comparing the three states in terms of population california gets one delegate for every 221171 residents texas gets one for every 168124 and wyoming gets one for every 19876 historyedit the first republican national convention was held at lafayette hall in pittsburgh on february 22–23 1856 at this convention the republican party was formally organized on a national basis and the first republican national committee was elected the first republican national convention to nominate a presidential candidate convened from june 17–19 1856 at the musical fund hall in philadelphia the 1860 convention nominated the first successful gop presidential candidate abraham lincoln of illinois and nominated hanibal hamlin of maine for vice president the 1864 event with the american civil war raging was branded as the national union convention as it included democrats who remained loyal to the union and nominated andrew johnson who had been elected governor of tennessee as a democrat for vice president the 1912 republican convention saw the businessoriented faction supporting william howard taft turn back a challenge from former president theodore roosevelt who boasted broader popular support and even won a primary in tafts home state of ohio roosevelt would run on the progressive party ticket handing the election to democrat woodrow wilson the 1924 republican convention made history by being the first gop convention to give women equal representation this was the first time the republican convention was held in cleveland ohio it was also the first time any convention was broadcast over radio – to nine cities through a special link over long distance telephone lines 5 the republican national committee approved a rule providing for a national committeeman and a national committeewoman from each state incumbent president calvin coolidge was formally nominated and went on to win the general election the convention nominated illinois governor frank lowden for vice president on the second ballot but he declined the nomination this is the only time a nominee refused to accept a vicepresidential nomination the republicans returned to cleveland in 1936 in the cavernous cleveland public auditorium former president herbert hoover addressed the delegates on the second day of the convention on the third alf landon of kansas who did not attend was nominated for president col frank knox was nominated as vice presidential candidate6 landon and knox were defeated in a landslide by fdr and john nance garner knox subsequently served as secretary of the navy in the roosevelt administration the 1940 convention was the first national convention of any party broadcast on live television it was carried by an early version of the nbc television network and consisted of flagship w2xbs now wnbc in new york city w3xe now kywtv in philadelphia and w2xb now wrgb in schenectadyalbany the growing importance of primaries became evident at the 1964 republican national convention in san francisco where arizona senator barry goldwater won the nomination easily turning away governor william scranton and others more favorable to the party establishment first lady pat nixon speaks to the delegates at the 1972 republican national convention she was the first republican first lady to do what is now considered common practice at the 1972 convention first lady pat nixon became the first first lady since eleanor roosevelt and the first republican first lady to deliver an address to the convention delegates7 it is now common practice for the presidential candidates spouse to deliver an address to the delegates also in 1972 the placing of favorite son candidates names into nomination was banned requiring at least five states request to do so in recent years only one candidates name has been put into nomination and challengers have been put under intense pressure to withdraw in order for the vote to be unanimous an exception was in 1976 when former california governor ronald reagan nearly toppled incumbent president gerald ford at the 1976 convention in kansas city gerald ford was only in office for two years before he was challenged by reagan who was a fellow republican reagan was on record saying that fellow republicans should never talk bad about one another but reagans view had since changed but the power of incumbency was too much for reagan to overcomethis was the last gop convention where the outcome of the nomination was in doubt after the republican national convention the pressure was on ford to cut way the factionalism in his republican party pat buchanan delivered a speech enthusiastically endorsing the conservative side of the culture war in american society at the 1992 republican national convention in houston it was widely criticized for supposedly alienating liberal and moderate voters who might otherwise have voted for the moderate nominee and thenincumbent president george h w bush division in the party was evident too at the 1996 convention at which more moderate party members such as california governor pete wilson and massachusetts governor william weld unsuccessfully sought to remove the human life amendment plank from the party platform the 1996 convention at the san diego convention center remains the last republican convention to be held in a convention center complex all others since then have been held at sports stadiums or arenas the republican party chose cleveland ohio as the site for its 2016 presidential nominating convention the convention was held in quicken loans arena home of the 2015–16 nba season champion cleveland cavaliers there may have been political reasons for the selection as no republican has won the presidency without winning ohio since abraham lincoln in 1860 clevelands home county cuyahoga has voted 19 times for republicans and 21 times for the democratic candidate since 1856 however the democrats have carried the county for
