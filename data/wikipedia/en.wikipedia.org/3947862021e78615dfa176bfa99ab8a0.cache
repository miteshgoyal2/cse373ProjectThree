tradition from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for other uses see tradition disambiguation olin levi warner tradition 1895 bronze tympanum over the main entrance library of congress thomas jefferson building washington dc a tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past12 common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes like lawyers wigs or military officers spurs but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years—the word tradition itself derives from the latin tradere literally meaning to transmit to hand over to give for safekeeping while it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history many traditions have been invented on purpose whether that be political or cultural over short periods of time various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways one way tradition is used more simply often in academic work but elsewhere also is to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed the phrase according to tradition or by tradition usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition but is not supported and perhaps may be refuted by physical documentation by a physical artifact or other quality evidence for example according to tradition homer was born on chios but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs this tradition may never be proven or disproven in another example king arthur by tradition a true british king has inspired many well loved stories of course whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature aside from this use in describing the quality of information various scholarly fields define the term differently as is needed for example anthropology and biology have each defined tradition it more precisely than in conventional as described below in order to facilitate scholarly discourse the concept of tradition as the notion of holding on to a previous time is also found in political and philosophical discourse for example it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism and also strands of many world religions including traditional catholicism in artistic contexts tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form for example in the performance of traditional genres such as traditional dance adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performers own preferences a number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition including industrialization globalization and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups in response to this traditionpreservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world focusing on aspects such as traditional languages tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated from customs conventions laws norms routines rules and similar concepts contents 1

definitionedit textual traditions of bound manuscripts of the sefer torah torah scroll are passed down providing additional vowel points pronunciation marks and stress accents in the authentic masoretic text of the jewish bible often the basis for translations of the christian old testament the english word tradition comes from the latin traditio the noun from the verb tradere to transmit to hand over to give for safekeeping it was originally used in roman law to refer to the concept of legal transfers and inheritance34 according to anthony giddens and others the modern meaning of tradition can be seen as having evolved in the european discourse in the last two hundred years during the enlightenment period as philosophers and thinkers counter posed the concept of modernity with the concept of tradition in the context of progress356 as with many other generic terms there are many definitions of tradition1247 the concept includes a number of interrelated ideas the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs objects or customs performed or believed in the past originating in it transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the next and are performed or believed in the present12 tradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are prehistoric with lost or arcane origins existing from time immemorial8 originally traditions were passed orally without the need for a writing system tools to aid this process include poetic devices such as rhyme and alliteration the stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition or as part of an oral tradition even such traditions however are presumed to have originated been invented by humans at some point23 traditions are often presumed to be ancient unalterable and deeply important though they may sometimes be much less natural than is presumed910 it is presumed that at least two transmissions over three generations are required for a practice belief or object to be seen as traditional8 some traditions were deliberately invented for one reason or another often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution11 traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition912 tradition changes slowly with changes from one generation to the next being seen as significant13 thus those carrying out the traditions will not be consciously aware of the change and even if a tradition undergoes major changes over many generations it will be seen as unchanged13 there are various origins and fields of tradition they can refer to the forms of artistic heritage of a particular culture14 beliefs or customs instituted and maintained by societies and governments such as national anthems and national holidays such as federal holidays in the united states910 beliefs or customs maintained by religious denominations and church bodies that share history customs culture and to some extent body of teachings1516 for example one can speak of islams tradition or christianitys tradition many objects beliefs and customs can be traditional2 rituals of social interaction can be traditional with phrases and gestures such as saying thank you sending birth announcements greeting cards etc21718 tradition can also refer to larger concepts practiced by groups family traditions at christmas18 organizations companys picnic or societies such as the practice of national and public holidays910 some of the oldest traditions include monotheism three millennia and citizenship two millennia19 it can also include material objects such as buildings works of art or tools2 tradition is often used as an adjective in contexts such as traditional music traditional medicine traditional values and others1 in such constructions tradition refers to specific values and materials particular to the discussed context passed through generations16 invention of traditionedit main article invented tradition the term invention of tradition introduced by e j hobsbawm refers to situations when a new practice or object is introduced in a manner that implies a connection with the past that is not necessarily present20 a tradition may be deliberately created and promulgated for personal commercial political or national selfinterest as was done in colonial africa or it may be adopted rapidly based on a single highly publicized event rather than developing and spreading organically in a population as in the case of the white wedding dress which only became popular after queen victoria wore a white gown at her wedding to albert of saxecoburg21 an example of an invention of tradition is the rebuilding of the palace of westminster location of the british parliament in the gothic style20 similarly most of the traditions associated with monarchy of the united kingdom seen as rooted deep in history actually date to 19th century12 other examples include the invention of tradition in africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces22 requiring legitimacy the colonial power would often invent a tradition which they could use to legitimize their own position for example a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job often these inventions were based in some form of tradition but were exaggerated distorted or biased toward a particular interpretation invented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by nationalism23 common examples include public holidays particularly those unique to a particular nation the singing of national anthems and traditional national cuisine see national dish expatriate and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation in scholarly discourseedit in science tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an authors thoughts to that of his or her field24 in 1948 philosopher of science karl popper suggested that there should be a rational theory of tradition applied to science which was fundamentally sociological for popper each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it24 unlike myth which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism scientific tradition was inherited from socrates who proposed critical discussion according to popper25 for thomas kuhn who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in 1977 a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is historically what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embrasure of tradition25 traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in social sciences—chiefly anthropology archeology and biology—with somewhat different meanings in different fields it is also used in varying contexts in other fields such as history psychology and sociology social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis in the 1970s and 1980s edward shils explored the concept in detail18 since then a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition meanwhile tradition has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions perspectives approaches in those disciplines26 anthropologyedit tradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology it can be said that anthropology is the study of tradition in traditional societies7 there is however no theory of tradition as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary as defining tradition is both unnecessary everyone can be expected to know what it is and unimportant as small differences in definition would be just technical7 there are however dissenting views scholars such as pascal boyer argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline7 archaeologyedit in archaeology the term tradition is a set of cultures or industries which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time the term is especially common in the study of american archaeology18 biologyedit biologists when examining groups of nonhumans have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next tradition is defined in biology as a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring ie is performed repeatedly over a period of time that is shared among two or more members of a group that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners and has been called a precursor to culture in the anthropological sense27 behavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish birds and mammals groups of orangutans and chimpanzees in particular may display large numbers of behavioral traditions and in chimpanzees transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another not just within a group has been observed such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change28 musicology and ethnomusicologyedit amar rabbi elazar a traditional setting of the last passage of the first tractate berakhot of the oral torah which describes how scholars of the talmud create peace in the world performed by cantor meyer kanewsky in 1919 for edison records problems playing this file see media help in the field of musicology and ethnomusicology tradition refers to the belief systems repertoire techniques style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns along with a sense of history traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time while both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being the scholarly study of music29 they differ in their methodology and subject of research tradition or traditions can be presented as a context in which to study the work of a specific composer or as a part of a wideranging historical perspective30 sociologyedit the concept of tradition in early sociological research around the turn of the 19th and 20th century referred to that of the traditional society as contrasted by the more modern industrial society12 this approach was most notably portrayed in max webers concepts of traditional authority and modern rationallegal authority12 in more modern works one hundred years later sociology sees tradition as a social construct used to contrast past with the present and as a form of rationality used to justify certain course of action12 traditional society is characterized by lack of distinction between family and business division of labor influenced primarily by age gender and status high position of custom in the system of values selfsufficiency preference to saving and accumulation of capital instead of productive investment relative autarky12 early theories positing the simple unilineal evolution of societies from traditional to industrial model are now seen as too simplistic12 in 1981 edward shils in his book tradition put forward a definition of tradition that became universally accepted12 according to shils tradition is anything which is transmitted or handed down from the past to the present12 another important sociological aspect of tradition is the one that relates to rationality it is also related to the works of max weber see theories of rationality and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by raymond boudon in his book action12 in this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as it has always been that way12 this line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the appeal to tradition or argumentum ad antiquitatem31 which takes the form this is right because weve always done it this way32 in most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the tradition being advocated may no longer be desirable or indeed may never have been despite its previous popularity philosophyedit the idea of tradition is important in philosophy twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an analytic tradition dominant in anglophone and scandinavian countries and a continental tradition dominant in german and romance speaking europe increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents following martin heidegger call the tradition which began with plato and aristotle in contrast some continental philosophers most notably hansgeorg gadamer have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of aristotelianism this move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by alasdair macintyre however macintyre has himself deconstructed the idea of the tradition instead posing aristotelianism as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others in political and religious discourseedit holiday celebrations may be passed down as traditions as is the case with this distinctly polish christmas meal decor with christmas tree a tradition since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century main articles traditional values and traditionalist conservatism the concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values in the united states in the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values33 similarly strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition for example the term traditionalist catholic refers to those such as archbishop lefebvre who want the worship and practices of the church to be as they were before the second vatican council of 1962–6534 likewise sunni muslims are referred to as ahlus sunnah wa aljamā‘ah arabic أهل السنة والجماعة‎‎ literally people of the tradition of muhammad and the community emphasizing their attachment to religious and cultural tradition more generally tradition has been used as a way of determining the political spectrum with rightwing parties having a stronger affinity to the ways of the past than leftwing onescitation needed here the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism or simply traditionalism which emphasizes the need for the principles of natural law and transcendent moral order hierarchy and organic unity agrarianism classicism and high culture and the intersecting spheres of loyalty35 traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of individualism liberalism modernity and social progress but promote cultural and educational renewal36 and revive interest in the church the family the state and local community this view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable for example stereotypical views of the place of women in domestic affairs37 in other societies especially ones experiencing rapid social change the idea of what is traditional may be widely contested with different groups striving to establish their own values as the legitimate traditional ones defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be a means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society in other cases tradition is a means of othering and keeping groups distinct from one another33 in artistic discourseedit in artistic contexts in the performance of traditional genres such as traditional dance adherence to traditional guidelines is of greater importance than performers preferences1 it is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional1 for artistic endeavors tradition has been used as a contrast to creativity with traditional and folk art associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition in contrast to fine art which is valued for being original and unique more recent philosophy of art however considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression33 relationship to other conceptsedit in the social sciences tradition is often contrasted with modernity particularly in terms of whole societies this dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern38 traditionoriented societies have been characterized as valuing filial piety harmony and group welfare stability and interdependence while a society exhibiting modernity would value individualism with free will and choice mobility and progress33 another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity anthony giddens sees tradition as something bound to ritual where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition39 gusfield and others though criticize this dichotomy as oversimplified arguing that tradition is dynamic heterogeneous and coexists successfully with modernity even within individuals38 tradition should be differentiated from customs conventions laws norms routines rules and similar concepts whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change19 whereas justification for tradition is ideological the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical10 over time customs routines conventions rules and such can evolve into traditions but that usually requires that they stop having primarily a practical purpose10 for example wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable spurs worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional10 preservationedit woman welcoming the shabbat a more than 3300 years old tradition in many countries concerted attempts are being made to preserve traditions that are at risk of being lost a number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition including industrialization globalization and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups40 customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved4142 likewise the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as cornish under the auspices of the european charter for regional or minority languages43 specifically the charter holds that these languages contribute to the maintenance and development of europes cultural wealth and traditions the charter goes on to call for the use or adoption of traditional and correct forms of placenames in regional or minority languages44 similarly unesco includes both oral tradition and traditional manifestations in its definition of a countrys cultural properties and heritage it therefore works to preserve tradition in countries such as brazil45 in japan certain artworks structures craft techniques and performing arts are considered by the japanese government to be a precious legacy of the japanese people and are protected under the japanese law for the protection of cultural properties46 this law also identifies people skilled at traditional arts as national living treasures and encourages the preservation of their craft47 for native peoples like the māori in new zealand there is conflict between the fluid identity assumed as part of modern society and the traditional identity with the obligations that accompany it the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition40 traditional cultural expressionsedit the phrase traditional cultural expressions is used by the world intellectual property organization to refer to any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied they are transmitted from one generation to the next and include handmade textiles paintings stories legends ceremonies music songs rhythms and dance48
