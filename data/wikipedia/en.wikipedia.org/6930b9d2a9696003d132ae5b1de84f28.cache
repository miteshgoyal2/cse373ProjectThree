question of life the universe and everything 42edit the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything in the radio series and the first novel a group of hyperintelligent pandimensional beings demand to learn the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything from the supercomputer deep thought specially built for this purpose it takes deep thought 7½ million years to compute and check the answer which turns out to be 42 deep thought points out that the answer seems meaningless because the beings who instructed it never actually knew what the question was1 when asked to produce the ultimate question deep thought says that it cannot however it can help to design an even more powerful computer that can this new computer will incorporate living beings into the computational matrix and will run for ten million years it is revealed as being the planet earth with its pandimensional creators assuming the form of white lab mice to observe its running the process is hindered after eight million years by the unexpected arrival on earth of the golgafrinchans and then is ruined completely five minutes before completion when the earth is destroyed by the vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass in the restaurant at the end of the universe this is revealed to have been a ruse the vogons had been hired to destroy the earth by a consortium of psychiatrists led by gag halfrunt who feared for the loss of their careers when the ultimate question became known2 lacking a real question the mice decide not to go through the whole thing again and settle for the outofthinair suggestion how many roads must a man walk down from bob dylans song blowin in the wind at the end of the radio series the television series and the novel the restaurant at the end of the universe arthur dent having escaped the earths destruction potentially has some of the computational matrix in his brain he attempts to discover the ultimate question by extracting it from his brainwave patterns as abusively3 suggested by ford prefect when a scrabbleplaying caveman spells out forty two arthur pulls random letters from a bag but only gets the sentence what do you get if you multiply six by nine six by nine forty two thats it thats all there is i always thought something was fundamentally wrong with the universe2 six times nine is of course fiftyfour the answer is deliberately wrong the program on the earth computer should have run correctly but the unexpected arrival of the golgafrinchans on prehistoric earth caused input errors into the system—computing because of the garbage in garbage out rule the wrong question—the question in arthurs subconscious being invalid all along2 quoting fit the seventh of the radio series on christmas eve 1978 narrator there is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable there is another theory mentioned which states that this has already happened4 some readers who were trying to find a deeper meaning in the passage soon noticed that 613 × 913 is actually 4213 as 4 × 13 2 54 ie 54 in decimal is equal to 42 expressed in base 134128 when confronted with this the author claimed that it was a mere coincidence stating that i may be a sorry case but i dont write jokes in base 135 in life the universe and everything prak a man who knows all that is true confirms that 42 is indeed the answer and confirms that it is impossible for both the answer and the question to be known in the same universe as they will cancel each other out and take the universe with them—to be replaced by something even more bizarre as described in the first theory and that it may have already happened as described in the second6 though the question is never found 42 is the table number at which arthur and his friends sit when they arrive at milliways at the end of the radio series likewise mostly harmless ends when arthur stops at a street address identified by his cry of there number 42 and enters the club beta owned by stavro mueller stavromula beta shortly after the earth is destroyed in all existing incarnations the number 42edit douglas adams was asked many times why he chose the number 42 many theories were proposed including that 42 is 101010 in binary code that light refracts through a water surface by 42 degrees to create a rainbow that light requires 10−42 seconds to cross the diameter of a proton7 adams rejected them all on 3 november 1993 he gave this answer8 on altfandouglasadams the answer to this is very simple it was a joke it had to be a number an ordinary smallish number and i chose that one binary representations base thirteen tibetan monks are all complete nonsense i sat at my desk stared into the garden and thought 42 will do i typed it out end of story adams described his choice as a completely ordinary number a number not just divisible by two but also six and seven in fact its the sort of number that you could without any fear introduce to your parents4 while 42 was a number with no hidden meaning adams explained in more detail in an interview with iain johnstone of bbc radio 4 recorded in 1998 though never broadcast9 to celebrate the first radio broadcasts 20th anniversary having decided it should be a number he tried to think what an ordinary number should be he ruled out nonintegers then he remembered having worked as a propborrower for john cleese on his video arts training videos cleese needed a funny number for the punchline to a sketch involving a bank teller himself and a customer tim brooketaylor adams believed that the number that cleese came up with was 42 and he decided to use it10 adams had also written a sketch for the burkiss way called 42 logical positivism avenue broadcast on bbc radio 4 on 12 january 197711 – 14 months before the hitchhikers guide first broadcast 42 in fit the fourth 29 march 19784 burkiss way logical positivism sketch excerpt an excerpt from douglas adams the burkiss way sketch logical positivism excerpt problems playing this file see media help in january 2000 in response to a panelists where does the number 42 come from on the radio show book club adams explained that he was on his way to work one morning whilst still writing the scene and was thinking about what the actual answer should be he eventually decided that it should be something that made no sense whatsoever – a number and a mundane one at that and that is how he arrived at the number 42 completely at random stephen fry a friend of adams claims that adams told him exactly why 42 and that the reason is fascinating extraordinary and when you think hard about it completely obvious12 however fry says that he has vowed not to tell anyone the secret and that it must go with him to the grave john lloyd adams collaborator on the meaning of liff and two hitchhikers fits said that adams has called 42 the funniest of the twodigit numbers13 the number 42 appears frequently in the work of lewis carroll and some critics have suggested that this was an influence they note in particular that alices attempt at her times tables chapter two of alices adventures in wonderland breaks down at 4 x 13 answered in base 421415 which virtually reverses the failure of the question what do you get if you multiply six by nine in that the latter would equal 42 if calculated in base 13 they find further evidence of carrolls influence in the fact that adams entitled the episodes of the original radio series of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy fits the word carroll used to name the chapters of the hunting of the snark there is the persistent tale that 42 is adams tribute to the indefatigable paperback book and is the average number of lines on an average page of an average paperback16 another common guess is that 42 refers to the number of laws in cricket a recurring theme of the books17 the number 42 also happens to be the ascii code for the asterisk which is a wildcard character indicating any number of characters or even an empty string in programming this could be interpreted as the answer anything you want it to be 18 42 puzzleedit the 42 puzzle the shape of the islands in the background spells out 42 and there are 42 coloured balls the 42 puzzle is a game devised by douglas adams in 1994 for the united states series of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy books the puzzle is an illustration consisting of 42 multicoloured balls in 7 columns and 6 rows douglas adams has said everybody was looking for hidden meanings and puzzles and significances in what i had written like is it significant that 6×9 42 in base 13 as if so i thought that just for a change i would actually construct a puzzle and see how many people solved it of course nobody paid it any attention i think thats terribly significant19 in the puzzle the question is unknown but the answer is already known to be 42 this is similar to the book where the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything is known but not the question the puzzle first appeared in the illustrated hitchhikers guide to the galaxy it was later incorporated into the covers of all five reprinted hitchhikers novels in the united states adams has described the puzzle as depicting the number 42 in ten different ways six possible questions are20 1 how many spheres are in the diagram six rows of seven is 42 2 what position in the grid does the earth occupy 42 3 the barcode on one of the spheres is the number 42 as an interleaved 2 of 5 barcode 4 considering redhued spheres red purple orange black as a 1 and those without as a 0 what number does each line represent in decimal form in binary each line reads 0101010 or 42 in decimal form 5 what number do the bluetinted spheres blue green purple black spell out similar to a colour blindness test 42 6 what number is represented by roman numerals spelled out by the yellowtinted spheres yellow orange green black in the first three rows xlii 42 on the internet and in softwareedit the number 42 and the phrase life the universe and everything have attained cult status on the internet life the universe and everything is a common name for the offtopic section of an internet forum and the phrase is invoked in similar ways to mean anything at all many chatbots when asked about the meaning of life will answer 42 several online calculators are also programmed with the question google calculator will give the result to the answer to life the universe and everything as 42 as will wolframs computational knowledge engine21 similarly duckduckgo also gives the result of the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything as 4222 in the online community second life there is a section on a sim called 42nd life it is devoted to this concept in the book series and several attempts at recreating milliways the restaurant at the end of the universe were made in openofficeorg software prior to version 34 if antwortdas leben das universum und der ganze rest german for answerlife the universe and everything is typed into any cell of a spreadsheet the result is 4223 isoiec 145192001 ieee std 100351999 ieee standard for information technology – posixr ada language interfaces – part 1 binding for system application program interface api uses the number 42 as the required return value from a process that terminates due to an unhandled exception the rationale says the choice of the value 42 is arbitrary and cites the adams book as the source of the value the random seed chosen to procedurally create the whole universe of the online multiplayer computer game eve online was chosen as 42 by its lead game designer in 200224 in the computer game gothic 42 is a code that deactivates all activated cheats after typing 42 in a right place text what was the question appears the opensuse team decided the next version will be based on suse linux enterprise desktop and named leap 42 the number 42 was chosen as a reference to the answer to life the universe and everything25 cultural referencesedit the allen telescope array a radio telescope used by seti has 42 dishes in homage to the answer26 in the american tv show lost 42 is the last of the mysterious numbers 4 8 15 16 23 and 42 in an interview with lostpedia producer david fury confirmed this was a reference to hitchhikers27 the british tv show the kumars at no 42 is so named because show creator sanjeev bhaskar is a hitchhikers fan28 the band coldplays album viva la vida includes a song called 42 when asked by q magazine if the songs title was hitchhikersrelated chris martin said it is and it isnt29 the band level 42 chose its name in reference to the book30 the episode 42 of the british science fiction television series doctor who was named in reference to the answer writer chris chibnall acknowledged that its a playful title31 ken jennings defeated along with brad rutter in a jeopardy match against ibms watson writes that watsons avatar which appeared onscreen for those

everything which caitlin suggests is 42 34 in the xfiles fox mulder lives in apartment 42 this has been acknowledged by the shows creator chris carter as a reference to hitchhikers35 dont panicedit towels in innsbruck with the words dont panic on towel day in the series dont panic is a phrase on the cover of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy1 the novel explains that this was partly because the device looked insanely complicated to operate and partly to keep intergalactic travellers from panicking36 it is said that despite its many glaring and occasionally fatal inaccuracies the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy itself has outsold the encyclopedia galactica because it is slightly cheaper and because it has the words dont panic in large friendly letters on the cover1 arthur c clarke said douglas adams use of dont panic was perhaps the best advice that could be given to humanity37 knowing where ones towel isedit somebody who can stay in control of virtually any situation is somebody who is said to know where his or her towel is the logic behind this statement is presented in chapter 3 of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy thus a towel has immense psychological value for some reason if a strag strag nonhitchhiker discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush washcloth soap tin of biscuits flask compass map ball of string gnat spray wetweather gear space suit etc etc furthermore the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have lost what the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy rough it slum it struggle against terrible odds win through and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with adams got the idea for this phrase when he went travelling and found that his beach towel kept disappearing in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy the radio scripts his friends describe how he would always mislay his towel on towel day fans commemorate adams by carrying towels with them mostly harmlessedit the only entry about earth in the guide used to be harmless but ford prefect managed to change it a little before getting stuck on earth mostly harmless provoked a very upset reaction from arthur when heard those two words are not what ford submitted as a result of his research—merely all that was left after his editors were done with it it is the title of the fifth book in the hitchhiker series its popularity is such that it has become the definition of earth in many standard works of scifi reference like the star trek encyclopedia additionally harmless and mostly harmless both feature as ranks in the computer game elite also in

to get a nutrimatic drinks dispenser to produce a cup of tea instead it invariably produces a concoction which most people found unpleasant that is almost but not quite entirely unlike tea one of the primary goals of the player as arthur dent in the computer game the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is to thwart the machine and find some decent tea a mission that the player is constantly reminded of by the inventory item no tea according to the jargon file the briefer not entirely unlike has entered hacker jargon39 share and enjoyedit share and enjoy is the slogan of the sirius cybernetics corporation complaints division in the radio version this phrase had its own song sung in fit the ninth of the radio series which was sung by a choir of robots during special occasions the sirius cybernetics corporation tends to produce inherently faulty goods which renders the statement ironic since few people would want to share and enjoy something that was defective among the design flaws is the choir of robots that perform this song they sing a tritone out of tune with the accompaniment the guide relates that the words share and enjoy were displayed in illuminated letters three miles high near the sirius cybernetics complaints division until their weight caused them to collapse through the underground offices of many young executives the upper half of the sign that now protrudes translates in the local tongue as go stick your head in a pig and is lit up only for special celebrations the episode fit the twentieth of the radio series features a personal computer os booting sound à la the microsoft sound set to the tune of share and enjoy furthermore fit the twentyfirst of the radio series the last episode in the adaptation of the novel so long and thanks for all the fish features a polyphonic ringtone version of the tune the share and enjoy tune also is used in the tv series as the backing for a sirius cybernetics corporation robot commercial slogan your plastic
