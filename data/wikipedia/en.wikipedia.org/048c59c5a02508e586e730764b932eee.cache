rooftop photovoltaic power station from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search rooftop pv systems around the world chicago united states topright berlin germany middle and kuppam india bottomright a rooftop photovoltaic power station or rooftop pv system is a photovoltaic system that has its electricitygenerating solar panels mounted on the rooftop of a residential or commercial building or structure1 the various components of such a system include photovoltaic modules mounting systems cables solar inverters and other electrical accessories2 rooftop mounted systems are small compared to groundmounted photovoltaic power stations with capacities in the megawatt range rooftop pv systems on residential buildings typically feature a capacity of about 5 to 20 kilowatts kw while those mounted on commercial buildings often reach 100 kilowatts or more contents 1 installation 2 feedin tariff mechanism 3 hybrid systems 4 advantages 5 disadvantages 6 technical challenges 7 cost 8 future prospects 9 see also 10 references installationedit rooftop pv systems at googleplex california the urban environment provides a large amount of empty rooftop spaces and can inherently avoid the potential land use and environmental concerns estimating rooftop solar insolation is a multifaceted process as insolation values in rooftops are impacted by the following time of the year latitude weather conditions roof slope roof aspect shading from adjacent buildings and vegetation3 there are various methods for calculating potential solar pv roof systems including the use of lidar4 and orthophotos5 sophisticated models can even determine shading losses over large areas for pv deployment at the municipal level6 feedin tariff mechanismedit in a grid connected rooftop photovoltaic power station the generated electricity can sometimes be sold to the servicing electric utility for use elsewhere in the grid this arrangement provides payback for the investment of the installer many consumers from across the world are switching to this mechanism owing to the revenue yielded a public utility commission usually sets the rate that the utility pays for this electricity which could be at the retail rate or the lower wholesale rate greatly affecting solar power payback and installation demand the fit as it is commonly known has led to an expansion in the solar pv industry worldwide thousands of jobs have been created through this form of subsidy however it can produce a bubble effect which can burst when the fit is removed it has also increased the ability for localised production and embedded generation reducing transmission losses through power lines2 hybrid systemsedit rooftop pv hybrid system a rooftop photovoltaic power station either ongrid or offgrid can be used in conjunction with other power components like diesel generators wind turbines batteries etc these solar hybrid power systems may be capable of providing a continuous source of power2 advantagesedit installers have the right to feed solar electricity into the public grid and hence receive a reasonable premium tariff per generated kwh reflecting the benefits of solar electricity to compensate for the current extra costs of pv electricity2 disadvantagesedit an electrical power system containing a 10 contribution from pv stations would require a 25 increase in load frequency control lfc capacity over a conventional systemjargon in issue which may be countered by using synchronverters in the dcaccircuit of the pv system the breakeven cost for pv power generation was in 1996 found to be relatively high for contribution levels of less than 10 higher proportions of pv power generation gives lower breakeven costs but economic and lfc considerations imposed an upper limit of about 10 on pv contributions to the overall power systems7 technical challengesedit there are many technical challenges to integrating large amounts of rooftop pv systems to the power grid for example reverse power flow the electric power grid was not designed for two way power flow at the distribution level distribution feeders are usually designed as a radial system for one way power flow transmitted over long distances from large centralized generators to customer loads at the end of the distribution feeder now with localized and distributed solar pv generation on rooftops reverse flow causes power to flow to the substation and transformer causing significant challenges this has adverse effects on protection coordination and voltage regulators ramp rates rapid fluctuations of generation from pv systems due to intermittent clouds cause undesirable levels of voltage variability in the distribution feeder at high penetration of rooftop pv this voltage variability reduces the stability of the grid due to transient imbalance in load and generation and causes voltage and frequency to exceed set limits if not countered by power controls that is the centralized generators cannot ramp fast enough to match the variability of the pv systems causing frequency mismatch in the nearby system this could lead to blackouts this is an example of how a simple localized rooftop pv system can affect the larger power grid the issue is partially mitigated by distributing solar panels over a wide area and by adding storage costedit residential pv system

financing plans for customers such as leases and power purchase agreements customers could pay for their solar panels over a span of years and get help with payments from credits from net metering programs as of may 2017 installation of a rooftop solar system costs an average of 20000 in the past it was more expensive9 utility dive wrote for most people adding a solar system on top of other bills and priorities is a luxury and rooftop solar companies by and large cater to the wealthier portions of the american population9 most households that get solar arrays are upper middleincome the average household salary for solar customers is around 1000009 however a surprising amount of lowincome customers appeared in a study of income and solar system purchases based on the findings of the study gtm researchers estimate that the four solar markets include more than 100000 installations at lowincome properties9 future prospectsedit the jawaharlal nehru national solar mission of the
