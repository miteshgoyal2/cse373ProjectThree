arrest is a sudden loss of blood flow resulting from the failure of the heart to effectively pump9 symptoms include loss of consciousness and abnormal or absent breathing12 some individuals may experience chest pain shortness of breath or nausea before cardiac arrest2 if not treated within minutes it usually leads to death9 the most common cause of cardiac arrest is coronary artery disease4 less common causes include major blood loss lack of oxygen very low potassium heart failure and intense physical exercise4 a number of inherited disorders may also increase the risk including long qt syndrome4 the initial heart rhythm is most often ventricular fibrillation4 the diagnosis is confirmed by finding no pulse1 while a cardiac arrest may be caused by heart attack or heart failure these are not the same9 prevention includes not smoking physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight5 treatment for cardiac arrest is immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr and if a shockable

symptomsedit cardiac arrest is sometimes preceded by certain symptoms such as fainting fatigue blackouts dizziness chest pain shortness of breath weakness and vomiting11 the arrest may also occur with no warning when the arrest occurs the most obvious sign of its occurrence will be the lack of a palpable pulse in the person experiencing it since the heart has ceased to contract the usual indications of its contraction such as a pulse will no longer be detectable certain types of prompt intervention can often reverse a cardiac arrest but without such intervention the event will almost always lead to death12 in certain cases it is an expected outcome of a serious illness where death is expected13 also as a result of inadequate cerebral perfusion the patient will quickly become unconscious and will have stopped breathing the main diagnostic criterion to diagnose a cardiac arrest as opposed to respiratory arrest which shares many of the same features is lack of circulation however there are a number of ways of determining this neardeath experiences are reported by 10–20 of people who survived cardiac arrest14 causesedit coronary artery disease is the leading cause of sudden cardiac arrest many other cardiac and noncardiac conditions also increase ones risk coronary artery disease often results in coronary ischemia and ventricular fibrillation vfib15 cases have shown that the most common finding at postmortem examination of scd is chronic highgrade stenosis of at least one segment of a major coronary artery16 the arteries that supply the heart muscle with its blood supply left ventricular hypertrophy is thought to be the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the adult population17 this is most commonly the result of longstanding high blood pressure which has caused secondary damage to the wall of the main pumping chamber of the heart the left ventricle18 although the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death is ventricular fibrillation other causes include the following19 coronary heart disease physical stress low levels of magnesium low levels of potassium major blood loss lack of oxygen severe physical activity which triggers adrenaline inherited disorders hypertrophic cardiomyopathy enlarged heart due to increased blood pressure commotio cordis coronary artery diseaseedit approximately 60–70 of scd is related to coronary artery disease also known as ischemic heart disease2021 among adults it is the predominant cause of arrest22 with 30 of people at autopsy showing signs of recent myocardial infarctioncitation needed nonischemic heart diseaseedit a number of nonischemic cardiac abnormalities can increase the risk of scd including cardiomyopathy cardiac rhythm disturbances myocarditis hypertensive heart disease20 and congestive heart failure23 in a group of military recruits aged 18–35 cardiac anomalies accounted for 51 of cases of scd while in 35 of cases the cause remained unknown underlying pathology included coronary artery abnormalities 61 myocarditis 20 and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 1324 congestive heart failure increases the risk of scd fivefold23 many additional conduction abnormalities exist that place one at higher risk for cardiac arrest for instance long qt syndrome a condition often mentioned in young peoples deaths occurs in one of every 5000 to 7000 newborns and is estimated to be responsible for 3000 deaths each year compared to the approximately 30000025 cardiac arrests seen by emergency services these conditions are a fraction of the overall deaths related to cardiac arrest but represent conditions which may be detected prior to arrest and may be treatable noncardiac causesedit about 35 of scds are not caused by a heart condition the most common noncardiac causes are trauma bleeding such as gastrointestinal bleeding aortic rupture or intracranial hemorrhage overdose drowning and pulmonary embolism26 cardiac arrest can also be caused by poisoning for example by the stings of certain jellyfish risk factorsedit the risk factors for scd are similar to those of coronary artery disease and include smoking lack of physical exercise obesity and diabetes as well as family history27 a prior episode of sudden cardiac arrest also increases the risk of future episodes mnemonic for causesedit main article hs and ts hs and ts is the name for a mnemonic used to aid in remembering the possible treatable or reversible causes of cardiac arrest2829 hs hypovolemia a lack of blood volume hypoxia a lack of oxygen hydrogen ions acidosis an abnormal ph in the body hyperkalemia or hypokalemia both excess and inadequate potassium can be lifethreatening hypothermia a low core body temperature hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia low or high blood glucose ts tablets or toxins cardiac tamponade fluid building around the heart tension pneumothorax a collapsed lung thrombosis myocardial infarction heart attack thromboembolism pulmonary embolism a blood clot in the lung traumatic cardiac arrest mechanismedit ventricular fibrillation the mechanism of death in the majority of people dying of sudden cardiac death is ventricular fibrillation4 structural changes in the diseased heart as a result of inherited factors mutations in ionchannel coding genes for example cannot explain the suddenness of scd30 also sudden cardiac death could be the consequence of electricmechanical disjunction and bradyarrhythmias3132 diagnosisedit cardiac arrest is synonymous with clinical death a cardiac arrest is usually diagnosed clinically by the absence of a pulse in many cases lack of carotid pulse is the gold standard for diagnosing cardiac arrest as lack of a pulse particularly in the peripheral pulses may result from other conditions eg shock or simply an error on the part of the rescuer nonetheless studies have shown that rescuers often make a mistake when checking the carotid pulse in an emergency whether they are healthcare professionals33 or lay persons34 owing to the inaccuracy in this method of diagnosis some bodies such as the european resuscitation council erc have deemphasised its importance the resuscitation council uk in line with the ercs recommendations and those of the american heart association29 have suggested that the technique should be used only by healthcare professionals with specific training and expertise and even then that it should be viewed in conjunction with other indicators such as agonal respiration28 various other methods for detecting circulation have been proposed guidelines following the 2000 international liaison committee on resuscitation ilcor recommendations were for rescuers to look for signs of circulation but not specifically the pulse29 these signs included coughing gasping colour twitching and movement35 however in face of evidence that these guidelines were ineffective the current recommendation of ilcor is that cardiac arrest should be diagnosed in all casualties who are unconscious and not breathing normally29 another method is to use molecular autopsy or postmortem molecular testing which uses a set of molecular techniques to find the ion channels that are cardiac defectivecitation needed classificationsedit clinicians classify cardiac arrest into shockable versus non–shockable as determined by the ecg rhythm this refers to whether a particular class of cardiac dysrhythmia is treatable using defibrillation28 the two shockable rhythms are ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia while the two non–shockable rhythms are asystole and pulseless electrical activity36 preventionedit with positive outcomes following cardiac arrest unlikely an effort has been spent in finding effective strategies to prevent cardiac arrest with the prime causes of cardiac arrest being ischemic heart disease efforts to promote a healthy diet exercise and smoking cessation are important for people at risk of heart disease measures such as blood pressure control cholesterol lowering and other medicotherapeutic interventions are used1 a cochrane review published in 2016 found moderatequality evidence to show that blood pressurelowering drugs do not appear to reduce sudden cardiac death37 code teamsedit in medical parlance cardiac arrest is referred to as a code or a crash this typically refers to code blue on the hospital emergency codes a dramatic drop in vital sign measurements is referred to as coding or crashing though coding is usually used when it results in cardiac arrest while crashing might not treatment for cardiac arrest is sometimes referred to as calling a code people in general wards often deteriorate for several hours or even days before a cardiac arrest occurs2838 this has been attributed to a lack of knowledge and skill amongst wardbased staff in particular a failure to carry out measurement of the respiratory rate which is often the major predictor of a deterioration28 and can often change up to 48 hours prior to a cardiac arrest in response to this many hospitals now have increased training for wardbased staff a number of early warning systems also exist which aim to quantify the risk which patients are at of deterioration based on their vital signs and thus provide a guide to staff in addition specialist staff are being used more effectively in order to augment the work already being done at ward level these include crash teams or code teams these are designated staff members with particular expertise in resuscitation who are called to the scene of all arrests within the hospital this usually involves a specialized cart of equipment including defibrillator and drugs called a crash cart or crash trolley medical emergency teams these teams respond to all emergencies with the aim of treating the people in the acute phase of their illness in order to prevent a cardiac arrest these teams have been found to decrease the rates of in hospital cardiac arrest and improve survival8 critical care outreach as well as providing the services of the other two types of team these teams are also responsible for educating nonspecialist staff in addition they help to facilitate transfers between intensive carehigh dependency units and the general hospital wards this is particularly important as many studies have shown that a significant percentage of patients discharged from critical care environments quickly deteriorate and are readmitted the outreach team offers support to ward staff to prevent this from happening in some medical facilities the resuscitation team may purposely respond slowly to a person in cardiac arrest a practice known as slow code or may fake the response altogether for the sake of the persons family a practice known as show code39 this is generally done for people for whom performing cpr will have no medical benefit40 such practices are ethically controversial41 and are banned in some jurisdictions implantable cardioverter defibrillatorsedit a technologically based intervention to prevent further cardiac arrest episodes is the use of an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator icd this device is implanted in the patient and acts as an instant defibrillator in the event of arrhythmia note that standalone icds do not have any pacemaker functions but they can be combined with a pacemaker and modern versions also have advanced features such as antitachycardic pacing as well as synchronized cardioversion a recent study by birnie et al at the university of ottawa heart institute has demonstrated that icds are underused in both the united states and canada42 an accompanying editorial by simpson explores some of the economic geographic social and political reasons for this43 patients who are most likely to benefit from the placement of an icd are those with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with systolic ejection fractions less than 30 as demonstrated by the maditii trial44 dietedit marinederived omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas has been promoted for the prevention of sudden cardiac death due to its postulated ability to lower triglyceride levels prevent arrhythmias decrease platelet aggregation and lower blood pressure45 however according to a recent systematic review omega3 pufa supplementation are not been associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death46 managementedit sudden cardiac arrest may be treated via attempts at resuscitation this is usually carried out based upon basic life support blsadvanced cardiac life support acls29 pediatric advanced life support pals47 or neonatal resuscitation program nrp guidelines cardiopulmonary resuscitationedit cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr is a key part of the management of cardiac arrest it is recommended that it be started as soon as possible and interrupted as little as possible the component of cpr that seems to make the greatest difference in most cases is the chest compressions correctly performed bystander cpr has been shown to increase survival however it is performed in less than 30 of out of hospital arrests as of 200748 if highquality cpr has not resulted in return of spontaneous circulation and the persons heart rhythm is in asystole discontinuing cpr and pronouncing the persons death is reasonable after 20 minutes49 exceptions to this include those with hypothermia or who have drowned49 longer durations of cpr may be reasonable in those who have cardiac arrest while in hospital50 bystander cpr by the lay public before the arrival of ems also improves outcomes8 either a bag valve mask or an advanced airway may be used to help with breathing51 high levels of oxygen are generally given during cpr51 tracheal intubation has not been found to improve survival rates in cardiac arrest48 and in the prehospital environment may worsen it52 when done by ems 30 compressions followed by two breaths appear better than continuous chest compressions and breaths being given well compressions are ongoing53 for bystanders cpr which involves only chest compressions results in better outcomes as compared to standard cpr for those who have gone into cardiac arrest due to heart issues53 mechanical chest compressions as performed by a machine are no better than chest compressions performed by hand51 it is unclear if a few minutes of cpr before defibrillation results in different outcomes than immediate defibrillation54 if cardiac arrest occurs after 20 weeks of pregnancy someone should pull or push the uterus to the left during cpr55 if a pulse has not returned by four minutes emergency cesarean section is recommended55 defibrillationedit defibrillation is indicated if a shockable rhythm is present the two shockable rhythms are ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia in children 2 to 4 jkg is recommended56 in addition there is increasing use of public access defibrillation this involves placing automated external defibrillators in public places and training staff in these areas how to use them this allows defibrillation to take place prior to the arrival of emergency services and has been shown to lead to increased chances of survival some defibrillators even provide feedback on the quality of cpr compressions encouraging the lay rescuer to press the patients chest hard enough to circulate blood57 in addition it has been shown that those who have arrests in remote locations have worse outcomes following cardiac arrest58 medicationsedit lipid emulsion as used in cardiac arrest due to local anesthetic agents medications while included in guidelines have not been shown to improve survival to hospital discharge following outofhospital cardiac arrest this includes the use of epinephrine atropine lidocaine and amiodarone59606162 epinephrine is generally recommended every five minutes51 vasopressin overall does not improve or worsen outcomes compared to epinephrine51 epinephrine does appear to improve shortterm outcomes such as return of spontaneous circulation63 some of the lack of longterm benefit may be related to delays in epinephrine use64 while evidence does not support its use in children guidelines state its use is reasonable56 lidocaine and amiodarone are also deemed reasonable in children with cardiac arrest who have a shockable rhythm5156 the general use of sodium bicarbonate or calcium is not recommended5165 the 2010 guidelines from the american heart association no longer contain the recommendation for using atropine in pulseless electrical activity and asystole due to the lack of evidence for its use66 neither lidocaine nor amiodarone in those who continue in ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation despite defibrillation improves survival to hospital discharge but both equally improve survival to hospital admission67 thrombolytics when used generally may cause harm but may be of benefit in those with a confirmed pulmonary embolism as the cause of arrest6855 evidence for use of naloxone in those with cardiac arrest due to opioids is unclear but it may still be used55 in those with cardiac arrest due to local anesthetic lipid emulsion may be used55 targeted temperature managementedit cooling adults after cardiac arrest who have a return of spontaneous circulation rosc but no return of consciousness improves outcomes6970 this procedure is called targeted temperature management previously known as therapeutic hypothermia people are typically cooled for a 24hour period with a target temperature of 32–36 °c 90–97 °f51 death rates in the hypothermia group are 30 lower than in those with no temperature management71 long term outcomes are also improved71 complications are generally no greater in those who receive this therapy6972 earlier versus later cooling may result in better outcomes73 a trial that cooled in the ambulance however found no difference compared to starting cooling inhospital73 a registry database found poor neurological outcome increased by 8 with each fiveminute delay in initiating th and by 17 for every 30minute delay in time to target temperature74 in children it is unclear if cooling is beneficial however fever should be prevented56 do not resuscitateedit some people choose to avoid aggressive measures at the end of life a do not resuscitate order dnr in the form of an advance health care directive makes it clear that in the event of cardiac arrest the person does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation75 other directives may be made to stipulate the desire for intubation in the event of respiratory failure or if comfort measures are all that are desired by stipulating that healthcare providers should allow natural death76 chain of survivaledit several organizations promote the idea of a chain of survival the chain consists of the following links early recognition if possible recognition of illness before the patient develops a cardiac arrest will allow the rescuer to prevent its occurrence early recognition that a cardiac arrest has occurred is key to survival for every minute a patient stays in cardiac arrest their chances of survival drop by roughly 1028 early cpr improves the flow of blood and of oxygen to vital organs an essential component of treating a cardiac arrest in particular by keeping the brain supplied with oxygenated blood chances of neurological damage are decreased early defibrillation is effective for the management of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia28 early advanced care early postresuscitation care which may include percutaneous coronary intervention77 if one or more links in the chain are missing or delayed then the chances of survival drop significantly these protocols are often initiated by a code blue which usually denotes impending or acute onset of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure although in practice code blue is often called in less lifethreatening situations that require immediate attention from a physiciancitation needed otheredit resuscitation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation devices has been attempted with better results for inhospital cardiac arrest 29 survival than outofhospital cardiac arrest 4 survival in populations selected to benefit most78 cardiac catheterization in those who have survived an outofhospital cardiac arrest appears to improve outcomes although high quality evidence is lacking79 it is recommended that it is done as soon as possible in those who have had a cardiac arrest with st elevation due to underlying heart problems51 the precordial thump may be considered in those with witnessed monitored unstable ventricular tachycardia including pulseless vt if a defibrillator is not immediately ready for use but it should not delay cpr and shock delivery or be used in those with unwitnessed out of hospital arrest80 prognosisedit the overall chance of survival among those who have cardiac arrest outside hospital is 7681 among children rates of survival is 3 to 16 in north america56 for in hospital cardiac arrest survival to discharge is around 22 with many having a good neurological outcome8 prognosis is typically assessed 72 hours or more after cardiac arrest51 rates of survival are better in those who someone saw collapse got bystander cpr or had either ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation when assessed81 survival among those with vfib or vtach is 15 to 2381 women are more likely to survive cardiac arrest and leave hospital than men82 a 1997 review into outcomes following inhospital cardiac arrest found a survival to discharge of 14 although the range between different studies was 02883 in those over the age of 70 who have a cardiac arrest while in hospital survival to hospital discharge is less than 2084 how well these individuals are able to manage after leaving hospital is not clear84 a study of survival rates from outofhospital cardiac arrest found that 146 of those who had received resuscitation by ambulance staff survived as far as admission to hospital of these 59 died during admission half of these within the first 24 hours while 46 survived until discharge from hospital this reflects an overall survival following cardiac arrest of 68 of these 89 had normal brain function or mild neurological disability 85 had moderate impairment and 2 had major neurological disability of those who were discharged from hospital 70 were still alive four years later85 epidemiologyedit based on death certificates sudden cardiac death accounts for about 15 of all deaths in western countries20 in the united states 326000 cases of out of hospital and 209000 cases of in hospital cardiac arrest occur among adults a year8 the lifetime risk is three times greater in men 123 than women 42 based on analysis of the framingham heart study86 however this gender difference disappeared beyond 85 years of age20 in the united states during pregnancy cardiac arrest occurs in about one in twelve thousand deliveries or 18 per 10000 live births55 rates are lower in canada55 namesedit in many publications the stated or implicit meaning of sudden cardiac death is sudden death from cardiac causes87 however sometimes physicians call cardiac arrest sudden cardiac death even if the person survives thus one can hear mentions of prior episodes of sudden cardiac death in a living person88 which sounds odd as judged by the sense of the term that involves death but is understood as invoking the other sense referencesedit a b c d e field john m 2009 the textbook of emergency
