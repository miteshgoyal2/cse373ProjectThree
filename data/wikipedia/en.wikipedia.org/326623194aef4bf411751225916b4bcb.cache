corruption32 from 1977 to 1981 during the carter administration giuliani practiced law at the patterson belknap webb and tyler law firm as chief of staff to his previous dc boss ace tyler tyler later became critical of giulianis turn as a prosecutor calling his tactics overkill26 on december 8 1980 one month after the election of ronald reagan brought republicans back to power in washington he switched his party affiliation from independent to republican26 giuliani later said the switches were because he found democratic policies naïve and that by the time i moved to washington the republicans had come to make more sense to me15 others suggested that the switches were made in order to get positions in the justice department26 giulianis mother maintained in 1988 that he only became a republican after he began to get all these jobs from them hes definitely not a conservative republican he thinks he is but he isnt he still feels very sorry for the poor26 in 1981 giuliani

detainees had fled their country due to political persecution alleging instead that they were economic migrants in defense of the governments position giuliani testified that political repression at least in general does not exist under president of haiti jeanclaude duvaliers regime2334 in 1983 giuliani was appointed us attorney for the southern district of new york which was technically a demotion but was sought by giuliani because of his desire to personally litigate cases it was in this position that he first gained national prominence by prosecuting numerous highprofile cases resulting in the convictions of wall street figures ivan boesky and michael milken he also focused on prosecuting drug dealers organized crime and corruption in government24 he amassed a record of 4152 convictions and 25 reversals as a federal prosecutor giuliani was credited with bringing the perp walk parading of suspects in front of the previously alerted media into common use as a prosecutorial tool35 after giuliani patented the perp walk the tool was used by increasing numbers of prosecutors nationwide36 giulianis critics claim he arranged public arrests of people then dropped charges for lack of evidence on highprofile cases rather than going to trial in a few cases his public arrests of alleged whitecollar criminals at their workplaces with charges later dropped or lessened sparked controversy and damaged the reputations of the alleged perps37 he claimed veteran stock trader richard wigton of kidder peabody co was guilty of insider trading in february 1987 he had officers handcuff wigton and march him through the companys trading floor with wigton in tears38 giuliani had his agents arrest tim tabor a young arbitrageur and former colleague of wigton so late that he had to stay overnight in jail before posting bond3839 within three months charges were dropped against both wigton and tabor giuliani said were not going to go to trial were just the tip of the iceberg but no further charges were forthcoming and the investigation did not end until giulianis successor was in place39 giulianis highprofile raid of the princetonnewport firm ended with the defendants having their cases overturned on appeal on the grounds that what they had been convicted of were not crimes40 mafia commission trialedit in the mafia commission trial february 25 1985 – november 19 1986 giuliani indicted eleven organized crime figures including the heads of new yorks socalled five families under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico on charges including extortion labor racketeering and murder for hire time magazine called this case of cases possibly the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the chicago mafia was swept away in 1943 and quoted giulianis stated intention our approach is to wipe out the five families41 eight defendants were found guilty on all counts and subsequently sentenced on january 13 1987 to hundreds of years of prison time4243 according to an fbi memo revealed about 20 years later leaders of the five new york mob families voted in 1987 on whether to issue a contract for the death of us attorney rudolph giuliani heads of the lucchese bonanno and genovese families rejected the idea though gambino leader john gotti encouraged assassination44 boesky milken trialsedit ivan boesky was a wall street arbitrageur who had amassed a fortune of about 200 million by betting on corporate takeovers he was investigated by the us securities and exchange commission sec for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders these stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover although insider trading of this kind was illegal laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until boesky was prosecuted boesky cooperated with the sec and informed on several others including junk bond trader michael milken per agreement with giuliani boesky received a  3 1⁄2year prison sentence along with a 100 million fine45 in 1989 giuliani charged milken under the rico act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud in a highly publicized case milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges46 mayoral campaignsedit giuliani was us attorney until january 1989 resigning as the reagan administration ended he garnered criticism until he left office for his handling of cases and was accused of prosecuting cases to further his political ambitions23 he joined the law firm white case in new york city as a partner he remained with white case until may 1990 when he joined the law firm anderson kill olick oshinsky also in new york city47 1989edit giuliani first ran for new york city mayor in 1989 attempting to unseat threeterm incumbent ed koch he won the september 1989 republican party primary election against business magnate ronald lauder in a campaign marked by claims that giuliani was not a true republican and by an acrimonious debate48 in the democratic primary koch was upset by manhattan borough president david dinkins in the general election giuliani ran as the fusion candidate of both the republican and liberal parties the conservative party which had often colined the republican party candidate withheld support from giuliani and ran lauder instead49 conservative party leaders were unhappy with giuliani on ideological grounds they cited the liberal partys endorsement statement that giuliani agreed with the liberal partys views on affirmative action gay rights gun control school prayer and tuition tax credits50 during two televised debates giuliani framed himself as an agent of change saying im the reformer51 that if we keep going merrily along this citys going down and that electing dinkins would represent more of the same more of the rotten politics that have been dragging us down48 giuliani pointed out that dinkins had not filed a tax return for many years and of several other ethical missteps in particular a stock transfer to his son51 dinkins filed several years of returns and said the tax matter had been fully paid off denied other wrongdoing and said that what we need is a mayor not a prosecutor and that giuliani refused to say the rword—he doesnt like to admit hes a republican51 dinkins won the endorsements of three of the four daily new york newspapers while giuliani won approval from the new york post52 in the end giuliani lost to dinkins by a margin of 47080 votes out of 1899845 votes cast in the closest election in new york citys history the closeness of the race was particularly noteworthy considering the small percentage of new york city residents who are registered republicans and resulted in giuliani being the presumptive nominee for a rematch with dinkins at the next election24 1993edit main article new york city mayoral election 1993 four years after he was beaten by dinkins giuliani again ran for mayor once again giuliani also ran on the liberal party line but not the conservative party line which ran activist george marlin53 the city was suffering from a spike in unemployment associated with the nationwide recession with local unemployment rates going from 67 in 1989 to 111 in 1992 although crime rates had already begun to decline under dinkins545556 giuliani promised to focus the police department on shutting down petty crimes and nuisances as a way of restoring the quality of life its the street tax paid to drunks and panhandlers its the squeegee men shaking down the motorist waiting at a light its the trash storms the swirling mass of garbage left by peddlers and panhandlers and openair drug bazaars on unclean streets57 dinkins and giuliani never debated during the campaign because they were never able to agree on how to approach a debate4853 dinkins was endorsed by the new york times and newsday58 while giuliani was endorsed by the new york post and in a key switch from 1989 the daily news59 giuliani came to visit the late lubavitcher rebbe rabbi menachem mendel schneerson seeking his blessing and endorsement60 giuliani won by a margin of 53367 votes he became the first republican elected mayor of new york city since john lindsay in 196561 1997edit main article new york city mayoral election 1997 giulianis opponent in 1997 was democratic manhattan borough president ruth messinger who had beaten al sharpton in the september 9 1997 democratic primary62 in the general election giuliani once again had the liberal party and not the conservative party listing giuliani ran an aggressive campaign parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city giulianis popularity was at its highest point to date with a late october 1997 quinnipiac university polling institute poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating 70 percent of new yorkers were satisfied with life in the city and 64 percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously63 throughout the campaign he was well ahead in the polls and had a strong fundraising advantage over messinger on her part messinger lost the support of several usually democratic constituencies including gay organizations and large labor unions64 the local daily newspapers—the new york times daily news new york post and newsday—all endorsed giuliani over messinger65 in the end giuliani won 59 of the vote to messingers 41 and became the first registered republican to win a second term as mayor while on the republican line since fiorello h la guardia in 194162 voter turnout was the lowest in 12 years with 38 of registered voters casting ballots66 the margin of victory included gains67 in his share of the african american vote 20 compared to 1993s 5 and the hispanic vote 43 from 37 while maintaining his base of white ethnic catholic and jewish voters from 199367 mayoraltyedit main article mayoralty of rudy giuliani giuliani served as mayor of new york city from 1994 through 2001 law enforcementedit in giulianis first term as mayor the new york city police department at the instigation of commissioner bill bratton adopted an aggressive enforcementdeterrent strategy based on james q wilsons broken windows approach68 this involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti turnstile jumping cannabis possession and aggressive panhandling by squeegee men on the theory that this would send a message that order would be maintained the legal underpinning for removing the squeegee men from the streets was developed under giulianis predecessor mayor david dinkins68 bratton with deputy commissioner jack maple also created and instituted compstat a computerdriven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions69 critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data an extensive study found a high correlation between crime rates reported by the police through compstat and rates of crime available from other sources suggesting there had been no manipulation70 the compstat initiative won the 1996 innovations in government award from the kennedy school of government71 national new york city and other major city crime rates 1990–200272 during giulianis administration crime rates dropped in new york city70 the extent to which giuliani deserves the credit is disputed73 crime rates in new york city had started to drop in 1991 under previous mayor david dinkins three years before giuliani took office74 the rates of most crimes including all categories of violent crime made consecutive declines during the last 36 months of dinkinss fouryear term ending a 30year upward spiral75 a small nationwide drop in crime preceded giulianis election and some critics say that he may have been the beneficiary of a trend already in progress additional contributing factors to the overall decline in new york city crime during the 1990s were the addition of 7000 officers to the nypd lobbied for and hired by the dinkins administration and an overall improvement in the national economy74 changing demographics were a key factor contributing to crime rate reductions which were similar across the country during this time76 because the crime index is based on that of the fbi which is selfreported by police departments some have alleged that crimes were shifted into categories that the fbi doesnt collect77 giulianis supporters cite studies concluding that the decline in new york citys crime rate in the 1990s and 2000s exceeds all national figures and therefore should be linked with a local dynamic that was not present as such anywhere else in the country what university of california sociologist frank zimring calls the most focused form of policing in history in his book the great american crime decline zimring argues that up to half of new yorks crime drop in the 1990s and virtually 100 percent of its continuing crime decline since 2000 has resulted from policing7879 bratton was featured on the cover of time in 199680 giuliani reportedly forced bratton out after two years in what was seen as a battle of two large egos in which giuliani was not tolerant of brattons celebrity8182 bratton went on to become chief of the los angeles police department83 giulianis term also saw allegations of civil rights abuses and other police misconduct under other commissioners after brattons departure there were police shootings of unarmed suspects84 and the scandals surrounding the torture of abner louima and the killings of amadou diallo and patrick dorismond giuliani supported the new york city police department for example by releasing what he called dorismonds extensive criminal record to the public including a sealed juvenile file85 city servicesedit the giuliani administration advocated the privatization of failing public schools and increasing school choice through a voucherbased system86 giuliani supported protection for illegal immigrants he continued a policy of preventing city employees from contacting the immigration and naturalization service about immigration violations on the grounds that illegal aliens should be able to take actions such as sending their children to school or reporting crimes to the police without fear of deportation87 during his mayoralty gay and lesbian new yorkers received domestic partnership rights giuliani induced the citys democraticcontrolled new york city council which had avoided the issue for years to pass legislation providing broad protection for samesex partners in 1998 he codified local law by granting all city employees equal benefits for their domestic partners88 appointees as defendantsedit several of giulianis appointees to head city agencies became defendants in criminal proceedings in 2000 giuliani appointed 34yearold russell harding the son of liberal party of new york leader and longtime giuliani mentor raymond

diagnosis due to term limits giuliani could not run in 2001 for a third term as mayor in november 1998 fourterm incumbent democratic us senator daniel patrick moynihan announced his retirement and giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the 2000 election for the nowopen seat due to his high profile and visibility giuliani was supported by the state republican party giulianis entrance led democratic congressman charles rangel and others to recruit thenus first lady hillary clinton to run for moynihans seat hoping she might combat his star power an early january 1999 poll showed giuliani trailing clinton by 10 points94 in april 1999 giuliani formed an exploratory committee in connection with the senate run by january 2000 giuliani had reversed the polls situation pulling nine points ahead after taking advantage of several campaign stumbles by clinton94 nevertheless the giuliani campaign was showing some structural weaknesses so closely identified with new york city he had somewhat limited appeal to normally republican voters in upstate new york95 the new york police departments fatal shooting of patrick dorismond in march 2000 inflamed giulianis already strained relations with the citys minority communities96 and clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue96 by april 2000 reports showed clinton gaining upstate and generally outworking giuliani who stated that his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more97 clinton was now 8 to 10 points ahead of giuliani in the polls96 then followed four tumultuous weeks in which giulianis medical life romantic life marital life and political life all collided at once in a most visible fashion giuliani discovered that he had prostate cancer and needed treatment his extramarital relationship with judith nathan became public and the subject of a media frenzy he announced a separation from his wife donna hanover and after much indecision on may 19 2000 he announced his withdrawal from the senate race98 september 11 terrorist attacksedit main article rudy giuliani during the september 11 attacks donald rumsfeld and giuliani at the site of the world trade center on november 14 2001 responseedit giuliani was prominent in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks he made frequent appearances on radio and television on september 11 and afterwards—for example to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure and that there was no reason to believe that the dispersion of chemical or biological weaponry into the air was a factor in the attack in his public statements giuliani said tomorrow new york is going to be here and were going to rebuild and were going to be stronger than we were before i want the people of new york to be an example to the rest of the country and the rest of the world that terrorism cant stop us99 the 911 attacks occurred on the scheduled date of the mayoral primary to select the democratic and republican candidates to succeed giuliani the primary was immediately delayed two weeks to september 25 during this period giuliani sought an unprecedented threemonth emergency extension of his term from january 1 to april 1 under the new york state constitution article 3 section 25100 he threatened to challenge the law imposing term limits on elected city officials and run for another full fouryear term if the primary candidates did not consent to the extension of his mayoralty101 in the end leaders in the state assembly and senate indicated that they did not believe the extension was necessary the election proceeded as scheduled and the winning candidate the giulianiendorsed republican convert michael bloomberg took office on january 1 2002 per normal custom giuliani claimed to have been at the ground zero site as often if not more than most workers i was there working with them i was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to so in that sense im one of them some 911 workers have objected to those claims102103104 while his appointment logs were unavailable for the six days immediately following the attacks giuliani spent a total of 29 hours over three months at the site this contrasted with recovery workers at the site who spent this much time at the site in two to three days105 giuliani at a nyfpc briefing after 911 when saudi prince alwaleed bin talal suggested that the attacks were an indication that the united states should reexamine its policies in the middle east and adopt a more balanced stand toward the palestinian cause giuliani asserted there is no moral equivalent for this act there is no justification for it and one of the reasons i think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the united states like israel and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism so i think not only are those statements wrong theyre part of the problem giuliani subsequently rejected the princes 10 million donation to disaster relief in the aftermath of the attack106 communication preparednessedit main article communication during the september 11 attacks § radio communications giuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the office of emergency management headquarters on the 23rd floor inside the 7 world trade center building those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous terrorist attack against the world trade center in 1993107108109 the office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters110 large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in 7 world trade to power the command center in may 1997 giuliani put responsibility for selecting the location on jerome m hauer who had served under giuliani from 1996 to 2000 before being appointed by him as new york citys first director of emergency management hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided fox news and new york magazine with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in brooklyn but was overruled by giuliani television journalist chris wallace interviewed giuliani on may 13 2007 about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the world trade center giuliani laughed during wallaces questions and said that hauer recommended the world trade center site and claimed that hauer said that the wtc site was the best location wallace presented giuliani a photocopy of hauers directive letter the letter urged giuliani to locate the command center in brooklyn instead of lower manhattan111112113114115 the february 1996 memo read the brooklyn building is secure and not as visible a target as buildings in lower manhattan116 giuliani at a joint session of congress on september 20 2001 in which president bush praised his efforts as mayor and named tom ridge to a new cabinetlevel position to oversee homeland defense initiatives in january 2008 an eightpage memo was revealed which detailed the new york city police departments opposition in 1998 to location of the citys emergency command center at the trade center site the giuliani administration overrode these concerns117 the 911 commission report noted that lack of preparedness could have led to the deaths of first responders at the scene of the attacks the commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the 1993 world trade center bombings family members of 911 victims have said that these radios were a complaint of emergency services responders for years118 the radios were not working when fire department chiefs ordered the 343 firefighters inside the towers to evacuate and they remained in the towers as the towers collapsed119120 however when giuliani testified before the 911 commission he said that the firefighters ignored the evacuation order out of an effort to save lives121122 giuliani testified to the commission where some family members of responders who had died in the attacks appeared to protest his statements123 a 1994 mayoral office study of the radios indicated that they were faulty replacement radios were purchased in a 33 million nobid contract with motorola and implemented in early 2001 however the radios were recalled in march 2001 after a probationary firefighters calls for help at a house fire could not be picked up by others at the scene leaving firemen with the old analog radios from 1993119124 a book later published by commission members thomas kean and lee h hamilton without precedent the inside story of the 911 commission argued that the commission had not pursued a tough enough line of questioning with giuliani125 an october 2001 study by the national institute of environmental safety and health said that cleanup workers lacked adequate protective gear108126 public reactionedit in the wake of the attacks giuliani gained international attention and was widely hailed for his leadership during the crisis127 when polled just six weeks after the attack giuliani received a 79 percent approval rating among new york city voters a dramatic increase over the 36 percent rating he had received a year earlier—average at the end of a twoterm mayorship128129 oprah winfrey called him americas mayor at a 911 memorial service held at yankee stadium on september 23 2001130131 other voices denied it was the mayor who had pulled the city together you didnt bring us together our pain brought us together and our decency brought us together we would have come together if bozo was the mayor said civil rights activist al sharpton in a statement largely supported by fernando ferrer one of three main candidates for the mayoralty at the end of 2001 he was a powerhungry person sharpton also said132 time person of the yearedit on december 24 2001133 time magazine named giuliani its person of the year for 200199 time observed that before 911 the public image of giuliani had been that of a rigid selfrighteous ambitious politician after 911 and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer his public image had been reformed to that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis historian vincent j cannato concluded in september 2006 with time giulianis legacy will be based on more than just 911 he left a city immeasurably better off—safer more prosperous more confident—than the one he had inherited eight years earlier even with the smoldering ruins of the world trade center at its heart debates about his accomplishments will continue but the significance of his mayoralty is hard to deny134 giuliani was praised by some for his close involvement with the rescue and recovery efforts but others argue that giuliani has exaggerated the role he played after the terrorist attacks casting himself as a hero for political gain135 giuliani has collected 114 million from speaking fees in a single year with increased demand after the attacks136 before september 11 giulianis assets were estimated to be somewhat less than 2 million but his net worth could now be as high as 30 times that amount137 he has made most of his money since leaving office138 giuliani and new york city fire department at the new york foreign press center briefing on new york city after september 11 2001 aftermathedit for his leadership on and after september 11 giuliani was given an honorary knighthood kbe by queen elizabeth ii on february 13 2002139 giuliani initially downplayed the health effects arising from the september 11 attacks in the financial district and lower manhattan areas in the vicinity of the world trade center site140 he moved quickly to reopen wall street and it was reopened on september 17 in the first month after the attacks he said the air quality is safe and acceptable141 however in the weeks after the attacks the united states geological survey identified hundreds of asbestos hot spots of debris dust that remained on buildings by the end of the month the usgs reported that the toxicity of the debris was akin to that of drain cleaner142 it would eventually be determined that a wide swath of lower manhattan and brooklyn had been heavily contaminated by highly caustic and toxic materials142143 the citys health agencies such as the department of environmental protection did not supervise or issue guidelines for the testing and cleanup of private buildings instead the city left this responsibility to building owners142 giuliani and secretary of state colin powell at the us delegation to osce’s antisemitism meeting in vienna austria in 2003 giuliani took control away from agencies such as the federal emergency management agency the army corps of engineers and the occupational safety and health administration leaving the largely unknown city department of design and construction in charge of recovery and cleanup documents indicate that the giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of respirators concurrently the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed144145 in june 2007 christie todd whitman former republican governor of new jersey and director of the environmental protection agency epa reportedly stated that the epa had pushed for workers at the wtc site to wear respirators but that she had been blocked by giuliani she stated that she believed that the subsequent lung disease and deaths suffered by wtc responders were a result of these actions146 however former deputy mayor joe lhota then with the giuliani campaign replied all workers at ground zero were instructed repeatedly to wear their respirators147 giuliani asked the citys congressional delegation to limit the citys liability for ground zero illnesses to a total of 350 million two years after giuliani finished his term fema appropriated 1 billion to a special insurance fund called the world trade center captive insurance company to protect the city against 911 lawsuits148 in february 2007 the international association of fire fighters issued a letter asserting that giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from world trade center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered mayor giulianis actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at ground zero forever with no closure for families or be removed like garbage and deposited at the fresh kills landfill it said adding hundreds remained entombed in ground zero when giuliani gave up on them149 lawyers for the international association of fire fighters seek to interview giuliani under oath as part of a federal legal action alleging that new york city negligently dumped body parts and other human remains in the fresh kills landfill150 postmayoraltyedit politicsedit before 2008 electionedit giuliani and president bush in las cruces new mexico on august 26 2004 since leaving office as mayor giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for republican candidates for political offices at all levels as the first republicans to simultaneously serve as mayor and governor of new york since nelson rockefeller and john lindsay giuliani and governor george pataki were instrumental in bringing the 2004 republican national convention to new york city151 he was a speaker at the convention and endorsed president george w bush for reelection by recalling that immediately after the world trade center towers fell without really thinking based on just emotion spontaneous i grabbed the arm of thenpolice commissioner bernard kerik and i said to him bernie thank god george bush is our president152 similarly in june 2006 giuliani started a website called solutions america to help elect republican candidates across the nation after campaigning on bushs behalf in the us presidential election of 2004 he was reportedly the top choice for secretary of homeland security after tom ridges resignation when suggestions were made that giulianis confirmation hearings would be marred by details of his past affairs and scandals he turned down the offer and instead recommended his friend and former new york police commissioner bernard kerik after the formal announcement of keriks nomination information about keriks past—most notably that he had ties to organized crime failed to properly report gifts he had received had been sued for sexual harassment and had employed an undocumented alien as a domestic servant—became known and kerik withdrew his nomination153 giuliani cutting the ribbon of the new drug enforcement administration mobile museum in dallas texas in september 2003 on march 15 2006 congress formed the iraq study group isg this bipartisan tenperson panel of which giuliani was one of the members was charged with assessing the iraq war and making recommendations they would eventually unanimously conclude that contrary to bush administration assertions the situation in iraq is grave and deteriorating and called for changes in the primary mission that would allow the united states to begin to move its forces out of iraq154 on may 24 2006 after missing all of the groups meetings155 including a briefing from general david petraeus former secretary of state colin powell and former army chief of staff eric shinseki156 giuliani resigned from the panel citing previous time commitments157 giulianis fundraising schedule had kept him from participating in the panel a schedule which raised 114 million in speaking fees over 14 months155 and that giuliani had been forced to resign after being given an ultimatum to either show up for meetings or leave the group by group leader james baker158 giuliani subsequently said that he had started thinking about running for president and being on the panel might give it a political spin159 giuliani was described by newsweek in january 2007 as one of the most consistent cheerleaders for the presidents handling of the war in iraq160 and as of june 2007 he remained one of the few candidates for president to unequivocally support both the basis for the invasion and the execution of the war161 giuliani spoke in support of the removal of the peoples mujahedin of iran mek also pmoi mko from the united states state department list of foreign terrorist organizations the group was on the state department list from 1997 until september 2012 they were placed on the list for killing six americans in iran during the 1970s and attempting to attack the iranian mission to the united nations in 1992162163 giuliani along with other former government officials and politicians ed rendell r james woolsey porter goss louis freeh michael mukasey james l jones tom ridge and howard dean were criticized for their involvement with the group some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals speaking fees164 giuliani and others wrote an article for the conservative publication national review stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization they supported their position by pointing out that the united kingdom and the european union had already removed the group from their terrorism lists they further assert that only the united states and iran still listed it as a terrorist group165 however canada did not delist the group until december 2012166 2008 presidential campaignedit main article rudy giuliani presidential campaign 2008 presidential campaign logo in november 2006 giuliani announced the formation of an exploratory committee toward a run for president of the united states in 2008 in february 2007 he filed a statement of candidacy and confirmed on the television program larry king live that he was indeed running167 giuliani at a rally at san diego state university in august 2007 when polls showed him as the frontrunner for the republican partys nomination early polls showed giuliani with one of the highest levels of name recognition and support among the republican candidates throughout most of 2007 he was the leader in most nationwide opinion polling among republicans senator john mccain who ranked a close second behind the new york mayor had faded and most polls showed giuliani to have more support than any of the other declared republican candidates with only former senator fred thompson and former governor mitt romney showing greater support in some perstate republican polls168 on november 7 2007 giulianis campaign received an endorsement from evangelist christian broadcasting network founder and past presidential candidate pat robertson169 this was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race as it gave credence that evangelicals and other social conservatives could support giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights170 giulianis campaign hit a difficult stretch during november and december 2007 during which time bernard kerik whom giuliani had recommended for the position of secretary of homeland security was indicted on 16 counts of tax fraud and other federal charges171 the media reported that while mayor of new york giuliani had billed to obscure city agencies several tens of thousands of dollars of mayoral security expenses incurred while visiting judith nathan with whom he was having an extramarital affair172 later analysis showed the billing to likely be unrelated to hiding nathan173 and several stories were published in the press regarding clients of giuliani partners and bracewell giuliani being in opposition to goals of american foreign policy174 giulianis national poll numbers began steadily slipping and his unusual strategy of focusing more on later multiprimary big states rather than the smaller firstvoting states was seen at risk175176 giuliani at a campaign event in derry new hampshire the day before the new hampshire primary despite his strategy giuliani did compete to a substantial extent177 in the january 8 2008 new hampshire primary but finished a distant fourth with 9 percent of the vote178 similar poor results continued in other early contests as giulianis staff went without pay in order to focus all efforts on the crucial late january florida republican primary179 the shift of the electorates focus from national security to the state of the economy also hurt giuliani176 as did the resurgence of mccains similarly themed campaign on january 29 2008 giuliani finished a distant third in the florida result with 15 percent of the vote trailing mccain and romney180 facing declining polls and lost leads in the upcoming large super tuesday states181182 including that of his home new york183 giuliani withdrew from the race on january 30 endorsing mccain184 giulianis campaign ended up 36 million in arrears185 and in june 2008 giuliani sought to retire the debt by proposing to appear at republican fundraisers during the 2008 general election and have part of the proceeds go towards his campaign185 during the 2008 republican national convention giuliani gave a primetime speech that praised mccain and his running mate sarah palin while criticizing democratic nominee barack obama he cited palins executive experience as a mayor and governor and belittled obamas lack of same and his remarks were met with wild applause from the delegates186 giuliani continued to be one of mccains most active surrogates during the remainder of mccains eventually unsuccessful campaign187 after 2008 electionedit following the end of his presidential campaign giulianis high appearance fees dropped like a stone188 he returned to work at both giuliani partners and bracewell giuliani189 giuliani

presidential primary candidate190191 during the march 2009 aig bonus payments controversy giuliani called for us treasury secretary tim geithner to step down and said that the obama administration lacked executive competence in dealing with the ongoing financial crisis192 giuliani giving the keynote speech at the jumeriah essex house in honor of the uss new york sailors and special purpose marine air ground task force 26 marines on november 8 2009 giuliani said his political career was not necessarily over and did not rule out a 2010 new york gubernatorial or 2012 presidential bid193 a november 2008 siena college poll indicated that although governor david paterson—promoted to the office via the eliot spitzer prostitution scandal a year before—was popular among new yorkers he would have just a slight lead over giuliani in a hypothetical matchup194 by february 2009 after the prolonged senate appointment process a siena college poll indicated that paterson was losing popularity among new yorkers and showed giuliani with a fifteenpoint lead in the hypothetical contest195 in january 2009 giuliani said he would not decide on a gubernatorial run for another six to eight months adding that he thought it would not be fair to the governor to start campaigning early while the governor tries to focus on his job196 giuliani worked to retire his presidential campaign debt but by the end of march 2009 it was still 24 million in arrears the largest such remaining amount for any of the 2008 contenders197 in april 2009 giuliani strongly opposed patersons announced push for samesex marriage in new york and said it would likely cause a backlash that could put republicans in statewide office in 2010198 by late august 2009 there were still conflicting reports about whether

me205 at a republican fundraising event in february 2015 giuliani stated i do not believe and i know this is a horrible thing to say but i do not believe that the president barack obama loves america and he doesn’t love you and he doesnt love me he wasnt brought up the way you were brought up and i was brought up through love of this country206 in response to criticism of the remarks giuliani said some people thought it was racist—i thought that was a joke since he was brought up by a white mother this isnt racism this is socialism or possibly anticolonialism white house deputy press secretary eric schultz said he agreed with giuliani that it was a horrible thing to say but said he would leave it up to the people who heard giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event206 although he received some support for his controversial comments giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours207208 2016 presidential electionedit giuliani speaking at
