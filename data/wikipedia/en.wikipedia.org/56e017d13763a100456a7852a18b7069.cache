1894 by william donaldson and james hennegan23 initially it covered the advertising and bill posting industry and was called billboard advertising45a at the time billboards posters and paper advertisements placed in public spaces were the primary means of advertising5 donaldson handled editorial and advertising while hennegan who owned hennegan printing co managed magazine production the first issues were just eight pages long6 the paper had columns like the bill room gossip and the indefatigable and tireless industry of the bill poster2 a department for agricultural fairs was established in 18967 the title was changed to the billboard in 18978 after a brief departure over editorial differences donaldson purchased hennegans interest in the business in 1900 for 500 equal to 14394 today to save it from bankruptcy69 that may donaldson changed it from a monthly to a weekly paper with a greater emphasis on breaking news he improved editorial quality and opened new offices in new york chicago san francisco london and paris89 he also refocused the magazine on outdoor entertainment like fairs carnivals circuses vaudeville and burlesque shows28 a section devoted to circuses was introduced in 1900 followed by more prominent coverage of outdoor events in 19017 billboard also covered topics including regulation a lack of professionalism economics and new shows it had a stage gossip column covering the private lives of entertainers a tent show section covering traveling shows and a subsection called freaks to order2 according to the seattle times donaldson also published news articles attacking censorship praising productions exhibiting good taste and fighting yellow journalism10 as railroads became more developed billboard set up a mail forwarding system for traveling entertainers the location of an entertainer was tracked in the papers routes ahead column then billboard would receive mail on the stars behalf and publish a notice in its letterbox column that it has mail for them2 this service was first introduced in 1904 it became one of billboards largest sources of profit10 and celebrity connections2 by 1914 there were 42000 people using the service6 it was also used as the official address of traveling entertainers for draft letters during world war i11 in the 1960s when it was discontinued billboard was still processing 1500 letters per week10 in 1920 donaldson made a thencontroversial move by hiring an africanamerican journalist james albert jackson to write a weekly column devoted to africanamerican performers2 according to the business of culture strategic perspectives on entertainment and media the column identified discrimination against black performers and helped validate their careers2 jackson was the first black critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience according to his grandson donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race10 donaldson died in 19252 focus on musicedit billboards editorial changed focus as technology in recording and playback developed it covered marvels of modern technology like the phonograph record players and wireless radios2 it began covering coinoperated entertainment machines in 1899 and created a dedicated section for them called amusement machines in march 19329 billboard began covering the motion picture industry in 19077 but ended up focusing on music due to competition from variety12 it created a billboard radio broadcasting station in the 1920s8 the jukebox industry continued to grow through the great depression and advertised heavily in billboard8262 this led to even more editorial focus on music8 the proliferation of the phonograph and radio also contributed to its growing music emphasis8 billboard published the first music hit parade on january 4 193613 and introduced a record buying guide in january 19399 in 1940 it introduced chart line which tracks the bestselling records this was followed by a chart for jukebox records in 1944 called music boxmachine charts89 by the 1940s billboard was more of a music industry specialist publication4 the number of charts it published grew
