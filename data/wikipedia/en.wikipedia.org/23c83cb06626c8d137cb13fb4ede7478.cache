not universal and although both electro and chicago house music were hugely influential both in europe and the usa mainstream media outlets and the record industry remained hostile to edm there was also a perceived association between edm and drug culture which led governments at state and city level to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture2 subsequently in the new millennium edm increased its popularity and mainstream profile in europe and across the world this time including the united states by the early 2010s the term electronic dance music and the

hardcore history of drum and bass and breakbeat by the early 1990s a style of music developed within the rave scene that had an identity distinct from american house and techno this music much like hiphop before it combined sampled syncopated beats or break beats other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and occasionally samples of music dialogue and effects from films and television programmes relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno so called rave music tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos or beats per minute bpm this subgenre was known as hardcore rave but from as early as 1991 some musical tracks made up of these hightempo break beats with heavy basslines and samples of older jamaican music were referred to as jungle techno a genre influenced by jack smooth and basement records and later just jungle which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on pirate radio in britain it is important to note when discussing the history of drum bass that prior to jungle rave music was getting faster and more experimental by 1994 jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music often referred to as junglists became a more recognisable part of youth subculture the genre further developed incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres including the raggamuffin sound dancehall mc chants dub basslines and increasingly complex heavily edited breakbeat percussion despite the affiliation with the ecstasyfuelled rave scene jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity both from the gang culture that had affected the uks hiphop scene and as a consequence of jungles often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence usually reflected in the choice of samples however this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hallbased jamaican music culture prevalent in london by 1995 whether as a reaction to or independently of this cultural schism some jungle producers began to move away from the raggainfluenced style and create

musical instruments were used and the focus in production was mainly on manipulating midi data as opposed to manipulating audio signals however since the late 1990s the use of software has been increasing a modern electronic music production studio generally consists of a computer running a digital audio workstation daw with various plugins installed such as software synthesizers and effects units which are controlled with a midi controller such as a midi keyboard this setup suffices for a producer to create an entire track from start to finish ready to be mastered111 festivalsedit main

or forms methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma also known as ecstasy e or molly is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs festivals and house parties124 in the rave environment the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug the psychedelic amphetamine quality of mdma offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the rave setting some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibitionreducing effects of the drug while others use it as party fuel because of the drugs stimulatory effects125 mdma is occasionally known for being taken in conjunction with psychedelic drugs the more common combinations include mdma combined with lsd mdma with psilocybin mushrooms and mdma with the disassociative drug ketamine many users use mentholated products while taking mdma for its cooling sensation while experiencing the drugs effects examples include menthol cigarettes vicks vaporub nyquil126 and lozenges the incidence of nonmedical ketamine has increased in the context of raves and other parties127 however its emergence as a club drug differs from other club drugs eg mdma due to its anesthetic properties eg slurred speech immobilization at higher doses128 in addition there are reports of ketamine being sold as ecstasy129 the use of ketamine as part of a postclubbing experience has also been documented130 ketamines rise in the dance culture was rapid in hong kong by the end of the 1990s128 before becoming a federally controlled substance in the united states in 1999 ketamine was available as diverted pharmaceutical preparations and as a pure powder sold in bulk quantities from domestic chemical supply companies131 much of the current ketamine diverted for nonmedical use originates in china and india131 drugrelated deaths at electronic dance music eventsedit a number of deaths attributed to apparent drug use have occurred at major electronic music

the prefix underground does not merely serve to explain that the associated type of music‚Äîand its cultural context‚Äîare familiar only to a small number of informed persons underground also points to the sociological function of the music framing it as one type of music that in order to have meaning and continuity is kept away to large degree from mainstream society mass media and those
