not universal and although both electro and chicago house music were hugely influential both in europe and the usa mainstream media outlets and the record industry remained hostile to edm there was also a perceived association between edm and drug culture which led governments at state and city level to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture2 subsequently in the new millennium edm increased its popularity and mainstream profile in europe and across the world this time including the united states by the early 2010s the term electronic dance music and the

improvised deconstructions of existing multitrack reggae mixes by using the studio mixing board as a performance instrument they also foregrounded spatial effects such as reverb and delay by using

hardcore history of drum and bass and breakbeat by the early 1990s a style of music developed within the rave scene that had an identity distinct from american house and techno this music much like hiphop before it combined sampled syncopated beats or break beats other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and occasionally samples of music dialogue and effects from films and television programmes relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno so called rave music tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos or beats per minute bpm this subgenre was known as hardcore rave but from as early as 1991 some musical tracks made up of these hightempo break beats with heavy basslines and samples of older jamaican music were referred to as jungle techno a genre influenced by jack smooth and basement records and later just jungle which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on pirate radio in britain it is important to note when discussing the history of drum bass that prior to jungle rave music was getting faster and more experimental by 1994 jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music often referred to as junglists became a more recognisable part of youth subculture the genre further developed incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres including the raggamuffin sound dancehall mc chants dub basslines and increasingly complex heavily edited breakbeat percussion despite the affiliation with the ecstasyfuelled rave scene jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity both from the gang culture that had affected the uks hiphop scene and as a consequence of jungles often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence usually reflected in the choice of samples however this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hallbased jamaican music culture prevalent in london by 1995 whether as a reaction to or independently of this cultural schism some jungle producers began to move away from the raggainfluenced style and create

edm4what is widely perceived to be club music has changed over time it now includes different genres and may not always encompass edm similarly electronic dance music can mean different things to different people both club music and edm seem vague but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres club music is defined by what is popular whereas edm is distinguished by musical attributes96 until the late 1990s when the larger us music industry created music charts for dance billboard magazine has maintained a dance chart since 1974 and it continues to this day93 in

a typical home studio setup for edm production with computer audio interface and various midi instruments electronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a recording studio with specialized equipment such as samplers synthesizers effects units and midi controllers all set up to interact with one another using the midi protocol in the genres early days hardware electronic musical instruments were used and the focus in production was mainly on manipulating midi data as opposed to manipulating audio signals however since the late 1990s the use of software has been increasing a modern electronic music production studio generally consists of a computer running a digital audio workstation daw with various plugins installed such as software synthesizers and effects units which are controlled with a midi controller such as a midi keyboard this setup suffices for a producer to create an entire track from start to finish ready to be mastered111 festivalsedit main

methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma also known as ecstasy e or molly is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs festivals and house parties124 in the rave environment the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug the psychedelic amphetamine quality of mdma offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the rave setting some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibitionreducing effects of the drug while others use it as party fuel because of the drugs stimulatory effects125 mdma is occasionally known for being taken in conjunction with psychedelic drugs the more common combinations include mdma combined with lsd mdma with psilocybin mushrooms and mdma with the disassociative drug ketamine many users use mentholated products while taking mdma for its cooling sensation while experiencing the drugs effects examples include menthol cigarettes vicks vaporub nyquil126 and lozenges the incidence of nonmedical ketamine has increased in the context of raves and other parties127 however its emergence as a club drug differs from other club drugs eg mdma due to its anesthetic properties eg slurred speech immobilization at higher doses128 in addition there are reports of ketamine being sold as ecstasy129 the use of ketamine as part of a postclubbing experience has also been documented130 ketamines rise in the dance culture was rapid in hong kong by the end of the 1990s128 before becoming a federally controlled substance in the united states in 1999 ketamine was available as diverted pharmaceutical preparations and as a pure powder sold in bulk quantities from domestic chemical supply companies131 much of the current ketamine diverted for nonmedical use originates in china and india131 drugrelated deaths at electronic dance music eventsedit a number of deaths attributed to apparent drug use have occurred at major electronic music concerts and festivals the los angeles memorial coliseum blacklisted insomniac events after an underaged attendee died from complications of ischemic encephalopathy due to methylenedioxymethamphetamine intoxication during electric daisy carnival 2010 as a result the event was relocated to las vegas the following year132112133134135 drugrelated deaths during electric zoo 2013 in new york city united states and future music festival asia 2014 in kuala lumpur malaysia prompted the final day of both events to be cancelled134136 while life in color cancelled a planned event in malaysia out of concern

freetekno rave music remix notesedit fikentscher 2000 p 5 in discussing the definition of underground dance music as it relates to postdisco music in america states that the prefix underground does not merely serve to explain that the associated type of music—and its cultural context—are familiar only to a small number of informed persons underground also points to the sociological function of the music framing it as one type of music that in order to have meaning and continuity is kept away to large degree from mainstream society mass media and those empowered to enforce prevalent moral and aesthetic codes and values although it can now be heard in detroits leading clubs the local area has shown a marked reluctance to get behind the music it has been in clubs like the powerplant chicago the world new york the hacienda manchester rock city nottingham and downbeat leeds where the techno sound has found most support ironically the only detroit club which really championed the sound was a peripatetic party night called visage which unromantically shared its name with one of britains oldest new romantic groups60 referencesedit 1permanent dead link a b c d e f how rave music
