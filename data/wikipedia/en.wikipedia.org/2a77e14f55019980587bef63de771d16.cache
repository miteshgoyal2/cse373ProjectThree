held in the chicago coliseum chicago cook county illinois on june 21 to june 23 1904 the popular president theodore roosevelt had easily ensured himself of the nomination though a threat had come from the old guard favourite ohio senator mark hanna the loyal kingmaker in republican politics but the senator had died early in 1904 therefore ending all opposition in the republican party there were also very informal talks with future president william howard taft about trying for the nomination but taft refused these motions as evidenced by a letter to henry hoyt the solicitor general in 1903 roosevelt was nominated by 994 votes to none the other threat to roosevelt indiana senator charles w fairbanks was nominated for vice president contents 1 platform 2 vice presidential candidates 3

the 1904 republican platform favored the protective tariff increased foreign trade the gold standard expansion of the merchant marine and strengthening of the united states navy it also praised roosevelts foreign and domestic policies vice presidential candidatesedit vice president roosevelt had ascended to the presidency in 1901 after the death of president william mckinley as the 25th amendment had not yet been passed there was no way to fill the vice presidential vacancy so the 1904 convention had the task of choosing a new running mate for roosevelt entering the convention senator charles fairbanks of indiana was considered the likely favorite for the vice presidential nomination but the roosevelt administration favored illinois congressman robert r hitt or secretary of war william howard taft of ohio1 speaker joseph gurney cannon of illinois also had support among the delegates but cannon had no desire to leave his position in the house1 however the administration did not launch a fight over the nomination of fairbanks and fairbanks was nominated by acclamation2 speakersedit there were significantly fewer speakers at the 1904 convention then there are at a typical convention today this is because the convention at the time was much lower in viewership as there were not the mass media devices of tv or radio at this time only those actually invited saw it also this was before the primary era so the delegates were expected to nominate the candidate at the actual convention as well as more typical tasks such as electing the chairman and handling other business which varies in importance at the republican convention today nonetheless there were speeches by the following individuals at the 1904 republican national convention tuesday june 21edit
