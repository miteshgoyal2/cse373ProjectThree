links history main article history of wikipedia jimmy wales and larry sanger nupedia wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project called nupedia other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before wikipedia but none were successful22 wikipedia began as a complementary project for nupedia a free online englishlanguage encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process11 nupedia was founded on march 9 2000 under the ownership of bomis a web portal company its main figures were jimmy wales the ceo of bomis and larry sanger editorinchief for nupedia and later wikipedia nupedia was licensed initially under its own nupedia open content license switching to the gnu free documentation license before wikipedias founding at the urging of richard stallman23 sanger and wales founded wikipedia2425 while wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia2627 sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal28 on january 10 2001 sanger proposed on the nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a feeder project for nupedia29 play media wikipedia according to simpleshow external audio the great book of knowledge part 1 ideas with paul kennedy cbc january 15 2014 launch and early growth wikipedia was launched on january 15 2001 as a single englishlanguage edition at wwwwikipediacom30 and announced by sanger on the nupedia mailing list26 wikipedias policy of neutral pointofview31 was codified in its first months otherwise there were relatively few rules initially and wikipedia operated independently of nupedia26 originally bomis intended to make wikipedia a business for profit32 wikipedia gained early contributors from nupedia slashdot postings and web search engine indexing by august 8 2001 wikipedia had over 8000 articles33 on september 25 2001 wikipedia had over 13000 articles34 by the end of 2001 it had grown to approximately 20000 articles and 18 language editions it had reached 26 language editions by late 2002 46 by the end of 2003 and 161 by the final days of 200435 nupedia and wikipedia coexisted until the formers servers were taken down permanently in 2003 and its text was incorporated into wikipedia the english wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on september 9 2007 making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled surpassing even the 1408 yongle encyclopedia which had held the record for almost 600 years36 citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in wikipedia users of the spanish wikipedia forked from wikipedia to create the enciclopedia libre in february 200237 these moves encouraged wales to announce that wikipedia would not display advertisements and to change wikipedias domain from wikipediacom to wikipediaorg38 though the english wikipedia reached three million articles in august 2009 the growth of the edition in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors appears to have peaked around early 200739 around 1800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006 by 2013 that average was roughly 80040 a team at the palo alto research center attributed this slowing of growth to the projects increasing exclusivity and resistance to change41 others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called lowhanging fruit—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively424344 in november 2009 a researcher at the rey juan carlos university in madrid spain found that the english wikipedia had lost 49000 editors during the first three months of 2009 in comparison the project lost only 4900 editors during the same period in 20084546 the wall street journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend47 wales disputed these claims in 2009 denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study48 two years later in 2011 wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline noting a decrease from a little more than 36000 writers in june 2010 to 35800 in june 2011 in the same interview wales also claimed the number of editors was stable and sustainable49 a 2013 article titled the decline of wikipedia in mits technology review questioned this claim the article revealed that since 2007 wikipedia had lost a third of the volunteer editors who update and correct the online encyclopedia and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae50 in july 2012 the atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline51 in the november 25 2013 issue of new york magazine katherine ward stated wikipedia the sixthmostused website is facing an internal crisis52 wikipedia blackout protest against sopa on january 18 2012 play media a promotional video of the wikimedia foundation that encourages viewers to edit wikipedia mostly reviewing 2014 via wikipedia content milestones in january 2007 wikipedia entered for the first time the topten list of the most popular websites in the us according to comscore networks with 429 million unique visitors wikipedia was ranked number 9 surpassing the new york times 10 and apple 11 this marked a significant increase over january 2006 when the rank was number 33 with wikipedia receiving around 183 million unique visitors53 as of march 2015update wikipedia has rank 5754 among websites in terms of popularity according to alexa internet in 2014 it received 8 billion pageviews every month55 on february 9 2014 the new york times reported that wikipedia has 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month according to the ratings firm comscore16 on january 18 2012 the english wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the united states congress—the stop online piracy act sopa and the protect ip act pipa—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours56 more than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced wikipedia content5758 loveland and reagle argue that in process wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements piecemeal through stigmergic accumulation5960 on january 20 2014 subodh varma reporting for the economic times indicated that not only had wikipedias growth flattened but that it has lost nearly 10 per cent of its pageviews last year thats a decline of about 2 billion between december 2012 and december 2013 its most popular versions are leading the slide pageviews of the english wikipedia declined by 12 per cent those of german version slid by 17 per cent and the japanese version lost 9 per cent61 varma added that while wikipedias managers think that this could be due to errors in counting other experts feel that googles knowledge graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up wikipedia users61 when contacted on this matter clay shirky associate professor at new york university and fellow at harvards berkman center for internet and security indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to knowledge graphs stating if you can get your question answered from the search page you dont need to click any further61 by the end of december 2016 wikipedia was ranked fifth in the most popular websites globally62 number of english wikipedia articles63 wikipedia editors with 100 edits per month63 openness differences between versions of an article are highlighted as shown unlike traditional encyclopediaswhich wikipedia follows the procrastination principlenotes 664 regarding the security of its content64 it started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles and any wikipedia article could be edited by any reader even those who did not have a wikipedia account modifications to all articles would be published immediately as a result any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors ideological biases and nonsensical or irrelevant text restrictions due to the increasing popularity of wikipedia popular editions including the english version have introduced editing restrictions in some cases for instance on the english wikipedia and some other language editions only registered users may create a new article65 on the english wikipedia among others some particularly controversial sensitive andor vandalismprone pages have been protected to some degree6667 a frequently vandalized article can be semiprotected or extended confirmed protected meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it68 a particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes69 in certain cases all editors are allowed to submit modifications but review is required for some editors depending on certain conditions for example the german wikipedia maintains stable versions of articles70 which have passed certain reviews following protracted trials and community discussion the english wikipedia introduced the pending changes system in december 201271 under this system new and unregistered users edits to certain controversial or vandalismprone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published72 the editing interface of wikipedia review of changes although changes are not systematically reviewed the software that powers wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others the history page of each article links to each revisionnotes 773 on most articles anyone can undo others changes by clicking a link on the articles history page anyone can view the latest changes to articles and anyone may maintain a watchlist of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes new pages patrol is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems74 in 2003 economics phd student andrea ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor creative construction over creative destruction75 vandalism main article vandalism on wikipedia any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of wikipedia is considered vandalism the most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam76 sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page less common types of vandalism such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting modify page semantics such as the pages title or categorization manipulate the underlying code of an article or use images disruptively77 american journalist john seigenthaler 1927–2014 subject of the seigenthaler incident obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from wikipedia articles the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes7879 however some vandalism takes much longer to repair80 in the seigenthaler biography incident an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of american political figure john seigenthaler in may 2005 seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of john f kennedy80 the article remained uncorrected for four months80 seigenthaler the founding editorial director of usa today and founder of the freedom forum first amendment center at vanderbilt university called wikipedia cofounder jimmy wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation wales replied that he did not although the perpetrator was eventually traced8182 after the incident seigenthaler described wikipedia as a flawed and irresponsible research tool80 this incident led to policy changes at wikipedia specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people83 policies and laws external video wikimania 60 minutes cbs 20 minutes april 5 2015 cofounder jimmy wales at fosdem content in wikipedia is subject to the laws in particular copyright laws of the united states and of the us state of virginia where the majority of wikipedias servers are located beyond legal matters the editorial principles of wikipedia are embodied in the five pillars and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content even these rules are stored in wiki form and wikipedia editors write and revise the websites policies and guidelines84 editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying noncompliant material originally rules on the nonenglish editions of wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the english wikipedia they have since diverged to some extent70 content policies and guidelines according to the rules on the english wikipedia each entry in wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionarylike85 a topic should also meet wikipedias standards of notability86 which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the articles subject further wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized87 it must not present original research a claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source among wikipedia editors this is often phrased as verifiability not truth to express the idea that the readers not the encyclopedia are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations88 this can at times lead to the removal of information that is valid89 finally wikipedia must not take sides90 all opinions and viewpoints if attributable to external sources must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article91 this is known as neutral point of view npov governance further information wikipediaadministration wikipedias initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time9293 an article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor and is not vetted by any recognized authority94 wikipedias contributors avoid a tragedy of the commons by internalizing benefits they do this by experiencing flow and identifying with and gaining status in the wikipedia community95 administrators editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship this begins with administrator9697 privileged users who can delete pages prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes and try to prevent certain persons from editing despite the name administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decisionmaking instead their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have projectwide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits such as vandalism9899 fewer editors become administrators than in years past in part because the process of vetting potential wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous100 bureaucrats name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community dispute resolution wikipedians often have disputes regarding content which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article known as edit warring101102 over time wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances in order to determine community consensus editors can raise issues at appropriate community forumsnotes 8 or seek outside input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a request for comment arbitration committee main article arbitration committee the arbitration committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read the arbitration committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted103 functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate therefore the committee does not dictate the content of articles although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates wikipedia policies for example if the new content is considered biased its remedies include cautions and probations used in 63 of cases and banning editors from articles 43 subject matters 23 or wikipedia 16 complete bans from wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and antisocial behavior when conduct is not impersonation or antisocial but rather anticonsensus or in violation of editing policies remedies tend to be limited to warnings104 community main article wikipedia community play media video of wikimania 2005 – an annual conference for users of wikipedia and other projects operated by the wikimedia foundation was held in frankfurt am main germany from august 4 to 8 each article and each user of wikipedia has an associated talk page these form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss coordinate and debate105 play media wikipedians and british museum curators collaborate on the article hoxne hoard in june 2010 wikipedias community has been described as cultlike106 although not always with entirely negative connotations107 the projects preference for cohesiveness even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials has been referred to as antielitism108 wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work these personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support administrative actions and types of articulation work109 wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification110 as wikipedia grew who writes wikipedia became one of the questions frequently asked on the project111 jimmy wales once argued that only a community  a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers makes the bulk of contributions to wikipedia and that the project is therefore much like any traditional organization112 in 2008 a slate magazine article reported that according to researchers in palo alto 1 percent of wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the sites edits113 this method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by aaron swartz who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content measured by number of characters contributed by users with low edit counts114 the english wikipedia has 5505334 articles 32141853 registered editors and 132425 active editors an editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past thirty days editors who fail to comply with wikipedia cultural rituals such as signing talk page comments may implicitly signal that they are wikipedia outsiders increasing the odds that wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions becoming a wikipedia insider involves nontrivial costs the contributor is expected to learn wikipediaspecific technological codes submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process and learn a baffling culture rich with injokes and insider references115 editors who do not log in are in some sense secondclass citizens on wikipedia115 as participants are accredited by members of the wiki community who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product on the basis of their ongoing participation116 but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their ip addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty a 2007 study by researchers from dartmouth college found that anonymous and infrequent contributors to wikipedia are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site117 jimmy wales stated in 2009 that it turns out over 50 of all the edits are done by just 7 of the users 524 people and in fact the most active 2 which is 1400 people have done 734 of all the edits112 however business insider editor and journalist henry blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles most content in wikipedia measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit is created by outsiders while most editing and formatting is done by insiders112 a 2008 study found that wikipedians were less agreeable open and conscientious than others118119 although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws including that the data showed higher openness that the differences with the control group were small as were the samples120 according to a 2009 study there is evidence of growing resistance from the wikipedia community to new content121 diversity wikipedia editor demographics 2008 one study found that the contributor base to wikipedia was barely 13 women the average age of a contributor was in the mid20s122 a 2011 study by researchers from the university of minnesota found that females comprised 161 of the 38497 editors who started editing wikipedia during 2009123 in a january 2011 new york times article noam cohen observed that just 13 of wikipedias contributors are female according to a 2008 wikimedia foundation survey124 sue gardner a former executive director of the wikimedia foundation hoped to see female contributions increase to 25 by 2015125 linda basch president of the national council for research on women noted the contrast in these wikipedia editor statistics with the percentage of women currently completing bachelors degrees masters degrees and phd programs in the united states all at rates of 50 percent or greater126 in response various universities have hosted editathons to encourage more women to participate in the wikipedia community in fall 2013 15 colleges and universities — including yale brown and pennsylvania state — offered college credit for students to write feminist thinking about technology into wikipedia127 a 2008 selfselected survey of the diversity of contributors by highest educational degree indicated that sixtytwo percent of responding wikipedia editors had attained either a high school or undergraduate college education128 in august 2014 wikipedia cofounder jimmy wales said in a bbc interview that the wikimedia foundation was really doubling down our efforts to reach 25 of female editors originally targeted by 2015 since the foundation had totally failed so far wales said a lot of things need to happen a lot of outreach a lot of software changes129 andrew lih writing in the new york times was quoted by bloomberg news in december 2016 as supporting wales comments concerning shortfalls in wikipedias outreach to female editors lih states his concern with the question indicating that how can you get people to participate in an editing environment that feels unsafe where identifying yourself as a woman as a feminist could open you up to ugly intimidating behavior130 language editions main article list of wikipedias there are currently 299 language editions of wikipedia also called language versions or simply wikipedias thirteen of these have over one million articles each english cebuano swedish german dutch

of wikipedia in turkey was imposed since wikipedia is based on the web and therefore worldwide contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries as is the case for the english edition these differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences eg colour versus color136 or points of view137 though the various language editions are held to global policies such as neutral point of view they diverge on some points of policy and practice most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use138139140 jimmy wales has described wikipedia as an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language141 though each language edition functions more or less independently some efforts are made to supervise them all they are coordinated in part by metawiki the wikimedia foundations wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects wikipedia and others142 for instance metawiki provides important statistics on all language editions of wikipedia143 and it maintains a list of articles every wikipedia should have144 the list concerns basic content by subject biography history geography society culture science technology and mathematics as for the rest it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition for example articles about small towns in the united states might only be available in english even when they meet notability criteria of other language wikipedia projects estimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different wikipedia editions translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions in part because fully automated translation of articles is disallowed145 articles available in more than one language may offer interwiki links which link to the counterpart articles in other editions a study published by plos one in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of wikipedia from different regions of the world it reported that the proportion of the edits made from north america was 51 for the english wikipedia and 25 for the simple english wikipedia146 the wikimedia foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the global south to 37 by 2015147 on march 1 2014 the economist in an article titled the future of wikipedia cited a trend analysis concerning data published by wikimedia stating that the number of editors for the englishlanguage version has fallen by a third in seven years148 the attrition rate for active editors in english wikipedia was cited by the economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for wikipedia in other languages nonenglish wikipedia the economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2000 editors up or down the attrition rates for editors in english wikipedia by sharp comparison were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50000 editors which has dropped to 30000 editors as of the start of 2014 at the quoted trend rate the number of active editors in english wikipedia has lost approximately 20000 editors to attrition since 2007 and the documented trend rate indicates the loss of another 20000 editors by 2021 down to 10000 active editors on english wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated148 given that the trend analysis published in the economist presents the number of active editors for wikipedia in other languages nonenglish wikipedia as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers at approximately 42000 active editors the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness of wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable and sustained basis148 no comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from wikipedia in other languages nonenglish wikipedia would provide a possible alternative to english wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the englishlanguage wikipedia149 critical reception see also academic studies about wikipedia and criticism of wikipedia several wikipedians have criticized wikipedias large and growing regulation which includes over 50 policies and nearly 150000 words as of 2014update150151 critics have stated that wikipedia exhibits systemic bias columnist and journalist edwin black criticizes wikipedia for being a mixture of truth half truth and some falsehoods20 articles in the chronicle of higher education and the journal of academic librarianship have criticized wikipedias undue weight policy concluding that the fact that wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject and give less attention to minor ones creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information152153154 journalists oliver kamm and edwin black noted how articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices usually by a group with an ax to grind on the topic20155 an article in education next journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin21 in 2006 the wikipedia watch criticism website listed dozens of examples of plagiarism in the english wikipedia156 accuracy of content main article reliability of wikipedia articles for traditional encyclopedias such as encyclopædia britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy157 however a peer review in 2005 of fortytwo scientific entries on both wikipedia and encyclopædia britannica by the science journal nature found few differences in accuracy and concluded that the average science entry in wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies britannica about three19 reagle suggested that while the study reflects a topical strength of wikipedia contributors in science articles wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects158 the findings by nature were disputed by encyclopædia britannica159160 and in response nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by britannica161 in addition to the pointforpoint disagreement between these two parties others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the nature effort and suggested a flawed study design in natures manual selection of articles in part or in whole for comparison absence of statistical analysis eg of reported confidence intervals and a lack of study statistical power ie owing to small sample size 42 or 4 × 101 articles compared vs 105 and 106 set sizes for britannica and the english wikipedia respectively162 as a consequence of the open structure wikipedia makes no guarantee of validity of its content since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it163 concerns have been raised by pc world in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users anonymity164 the insertion of false information165 vandalism and similar problems economist tyler cowen wrote if i had to guess whether wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think i would opt for wikipedia he comments that some traditional sources of nonfiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results in his opinion are overreported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports however he also cautions that errors are frequently found on internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them166 critics argue that wikipedias open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable167 some commentators suggest that wikipedia may be reliable but that the reliability of any given article is not clear168 editors of traditional reference works such as the encyclopædia britannica have questioned the projects utility and status as an encyclopedia169 external video inside wikipedia – attack of the pr industry deutsche welle 713 mins170 wikipedias open structure inherently makes it an easy target for internet trolls spammers and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia73171 in response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues wikipedia was reported in an article by jeff elder in the wall street journal on june 16 2014 to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing172 the article stated that beginning monday from date of article changes in wikipedias terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement katherine maher the nonprofit wikimedia foundations chief communications officer said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that were not an advertising service were an encyclopedia172173174175176 these issues among others had been parodied since the first decade of wikipedia notably by stephen colbert on the colbert report177 most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work preferring primary sources178 some specifically prohibit wikipedia citations179180 wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources and should not be relied upon as authoritative181 wales once 2006 or earlier said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited wikipedia he told the students they got what they deserved for gods sake youre in college dont cite the encyclopedia he said182 in february 2007 an article in the harvard crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at harvard university were including wikipedia articles in their syllabi although without realizing the articles might change183 in june 2007 former president of the american library association michael gorman condemned wikipedia along with google184 stating that academics who endorse the use of wikipedia are the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of big macs with everything a harvard law textbook legal research in a nutshell 2011 cites wikipedia as a general source that can be a real boon in coming up to speed in the law governing a situation and while not authoritative can provide basic facts as well as leads to more indepth resources185 medical information see also health information on wikipedia on march 5 2014 julie beck writing for the atlantic magazine in an article titled doctors 1 source for healthcare information wikipedia stated that fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the wikipedia site and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information186 beck continued to detail in this article new programs of dr amin azzam at the university of san francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve wikipedia articles on healthrelated issues as well as internal quality control programs within wikipedia organized by dr james heilman to improve a group of 200 healthrelated articles of central medical importance up to wikipedias highest standard of articles using its featured article and good article peer review evaluation process186 in a may 7 2014 followup article in the atlantic titled can wikipedia ever be a definitive medical text julie beck quotes wikiproject medicines dr james heilman as stating just because a reference is peerreviewed doesnt mean its a highquality reference187 beck added that wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as good or featured heilman who has participated in that process before says less than 1 percent of wikipedias medical articles have passed187 quality of writing in 2008 researchers at carnegie mellon university found that the quality of a wikipedia article would suffer rather than gain from adding more writers when the article lacked appropriate explicit or implicit coordination188 for instance when contributors rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making fulllength revisions high and lowquality content may be intermingled within an entry roy rosenzweig a history professor stated that american national biography online outperformed wikipedia in terms of its clear and engaging prose which he said was an important aspect of good historical writing189 contrasting wikipedias treatment of abraham lincoln to that of civil war historian james mcpherson in american national biography online he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in lincolns life but praised mcphersons richer contextualization his artful use of quotations to capture lincolns voice and his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words by contrast he gives an example of wikipedias prose that he finds both verbose and dull rosenzweig also criticized the waffling—encouraged by the npov policy—which means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in wikipedia history by example he quoted the conclusion of wikipedias article on william clarke quantrill while generally praising the article he pointed out its waffling conclusion some historians remember him as an opportunistic bloodthirsty outlaw while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero189 other critics have made similar charges that even if wikipedia articles are factually accurate they are often written in a poor almost unreadable style frequent wikipedia critic andrew orlowski commented even when a wikipedia entry is 100 per cent factually correct and those facts have been carefully chosen it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into a third passing an illiterate translator at each stage190 a study of wikipedia articles on cancer was conducted in 2010 by yaacov lawrence of the kimmel cancer center at thomas jefferson university the study was limited to those articles that could be found in the physician data query and excluded those written at the start class or stub class level lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable and thought that wikipedias lack of readability to noncollege readers may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing191 the economist argued that betterwritten articles tend to be more reliable inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information192 coverage of topics and systemic bias see also notability in the english wikipedia and criticism of wikipedia § systemic bias in coverage parts of this article those related to dwikidatastatisticswikipedia need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information march 2017 wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article since it has terabytes of disk space it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia193 the exact degree and manner of coverage on wikipedia is under constant review by its editors and disagreements are not uncommon see deletionism and inclusionism194195 wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable offensive or pornographic because wikipedia is not censored the policy has sometimes proved controversial in 2008 wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of muhammad in the english edition of its muhammad article citing this policy the presence of politically religiously and pornographically sensitive materials in wikipedia has led to the censorship of wikipedia by national authorities in china196 and pakistan197 amongst other countries pie chart of wikipedia content by subject as of january 2008198 a 2008 study conducted by researchers at carnegie mellon university and palo alto research center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth from july 2006 to january 2008 in each field198 culture and the arts 30 210 biographies and persons 15 97 geography and places 14 52 society and social sciences 12 83 history and events 11 143 natural and physical sciences 9 213 technology and the applied sciences 4 −6 religions and belief systems 2 38 health 2 42 mathematics and logic 1 146 thought and philosophy 1 160 these numbers refer only to the quantity of articles it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones through its wikipedia loves libraries program wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the new york public library for the performing arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles199 a 2011 study conducted by researchers at the university of minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics there was a greater concentration of females in the people and arts category while males focus more on geography and science200 coverage of topics and selection bias research conducted by mark graham of the oxford internet institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven africa is most underrepresented201 across 30 language editions of wikipedia historical articles and sections are generally eurocentric and focused on recent events202 an editorial in the guardian in 2014 noted that women porn stars are better covered than women writers as a further example203 systemic bias when multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics systemic bias may arise due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors in 2011 wales noted that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors which predominantly consists of young males with high education levels in the developed world cf previously49 the october 22 2013 essay by tom simonite in mits technology review titled the decline of wikipedia discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors50 systemic bias on wikipedia may follow that of culture generally for example favoring certain nationalities ethnicities or majority religions204 it may more specifically follow the biases of internet culture inclining to being young male englishspeaking educated technologically aware and wealthy enough to spare time for editing biases of its own may include overemphasis on topics such as pop culture technology and current events204 taha yasseri of the university of oxford in 2013 studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution205206 his research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring yasseri contended that simple reverts or undo operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting revertingreverted pairs or mutually reverting edit pairs such a mutually reverting edit pair is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then in sequence returns to revert the first editor in the mutually reverting edit pairs the results were tabulated for several language versions of wikipedia the english wikipedias three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles george w bush anarchism and muhammad206 by comparison for the german wikipedia the three largest conflict rates at the time of the oxford study were for the articles covering i croatia ii scientology and iii 911 conspiracy theories206 researchers from the washington university developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of wikipedias users regarding controversial topics the authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedias administrators after assuming the post writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact207208 identifying the filterbubble problem dimitra kessenides writing for bloomberg news weekly identified the filterbubble problem as a recurrent and longstanding issue at wikipedia209 as kessenides states if the only way to get an article about the developing world published on wikipedia was to know a former board member it was hard to imagine how a random editor in johannesburg or bangalore would have any hope this socalled filterbubble problem coined by eli pariser cofounder of the viral video site upworthy is the idea that the internet can contribute to the insularity of certain communities filter bubbles have been blamed for the spread of misinformation during the 2016 presidential election and for the failure of pundits in the uk to anticipate brexit wikipedias filterbubble problem is a particularly acute threat for an organization whose stated mission is to empower and engage people around the world209 explicit content see also internet watch foundation and wikipedia and reporting of child pornography images on wikimedia commons “ problem what problem so you didnt know that wikipedia has a porn problem ” — larry sanger210 wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information of graphic content articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content such as feces cadaver human penis vulva and nudity contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet including children the site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation photographs of nude children illustrations of zoophilia and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles the wikipedia article about virgin killer—a 1976 album from german heavy metal band scorpions—features a picture of the albums original cover which depicts a naked prepubescent girl the original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries in december 2008 access to the wikipedia article virgin killer was blocked for four days by most internet service providers in the united kingdom after the internet watch foundation iwf decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the articles url to a blacklist it supplies to british internet service providers211 in april 2010 sanger wrote a letter to the federal bureau of investigation outlining his concerns that two categories of images on wikimedia commons contained child pornography and were in violation of us federal obscenity law212213 sanger later clarified that the images which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon were not of real children but said that they constituted obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children under the protect act of 2003214 that law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under american law214 sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on wikipedia in schools215 wikimedia foundation spokesman jay walsh strongly rejected sangers accusation216 saying that wikipedia did not have material we would deem to be illegal if we did we would remove it216 following the complaint by sanger wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community after some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his cofounder status he wrote in a message to the wikimedia foundation mailinglist that this action was in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophicalcontent issues rather than be about me and how quickly i acted217 critics including wikipediocracy noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared218 privacy one privacy concern in the case of wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a private citizen rather than a public figure in the eyes of the law219notes 9 it is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life meatspace a particular problem occurs in the case of an individual who is relatively unimportant and for whom there exists a wikipedia page against her or his wishes in january 2006 a german court ordered the german wikipedia shut down within germany because it stated the full name of boris floricic aka tron a deceased hacker on february 9 2006 the injunction against wikimedia deutschland was overturned with the court rejecting the notion that trons right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated220 wikipedia has a volunteer response team that uses the otrs system to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties this is used for example in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project221 sexism main article gender bias in wikipedia wikipedia has been described as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment222223 the perceived toxic attitudes and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap in wikipedia editors224 in 2014 a female editor who requested a separate space on wikipedia to discuss improving civility had her proposal referred to by a male editor using the words the easiest way to avoid being called a cunt is not to act like one222 operation a group of wikipedia editors may form a wikiproject to focus their work on a specific topic area using its associated discussion page to coordinate changes across multiple articles225 wikimedia foundation and wikimedia movement affiliates main article wikimedia foundation katherine maher is the third executive director at wikimedia following the departure of lila tretikov in 2016 wikipedia is hosted and funded by the wikimedia foundation a nonprofit organization which also operates wikipediarelated projects such as wiktionary and wikibooks the foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission226 the foundations 2013 irs form 990 shows revenue of 397 million and expenses of almost 29 million with assets of 372 million and liabilities of about 23 million227 in may 2014 wikimedia foundation named lila tretikov as its second executive director taking over for sue gardner228 the wall street journal reported on may 1 2014 that tretikovs information technology background from her years at university of california offers wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that information like air wants to be free229230 the same wall street journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman jay walsh of wikimedia who said tretikov would address that issue paid advocacy as a priority we are really pushing toward more transparency we are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors better mobile support of wikipedia new geolocation tools to find local content more easily and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities walsh said229 following the departure of tretikov from wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the superprotection feature which some language versions of wikipedia have adopted katherine maher became the third executive director the wikimedia foundation in june 2016231 maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to wikipedia as identified by the wikipedia board in december maher stated regarding the harassment issue that it establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority and that correction requires that it has to be more than words232 wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the wikimedia foundation but independentlyrun called wikimedia movement affiliates these include wikimedia chapters which are national or subnational organizations such as wikimedia deutschland and wikimédia france thematic organizations such as amical wikimedia for the catalan language community and user groups these affiliates participate in the promotion development and funding of wikipedia software operations and support see also mediawiki the operation of wikipedia depends on mediawiki a custommade free and open source wiki software platform written in php and built upon the mysql database system233 the software incorporates programming features such as a macro language variables a transclusion system for templates and url redirection mediawiki is licensed under the gnu general public license and it is used by all wikimedia projects as well as many other wiki projects originally wikipedia ran on usemodwiki written in perl by clifford adams phase i which initially required camelcase for article hyperlinks the present double bracket style was incorporated later starting in january 2002 phase ii wikipedia began running on a php wiki engine with a mysql database this software was custommade for wikipedia by magnus manske the phase ii software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand in july 2002 phase iii wikipedia shifted to the thirdgeneration software mediawiki originally written by lee daniel crocker several mediawiki extensions are installed234 to extend the functionality of the mediawiki software in april 2005 a lucene extension235236 was added to mediawikis builtin search and wikipedia switched from mysql to lucene for searching the site currently uses lucene search 21237needs update which is written in java and based on lucene library 23238 in july 2013 after extensive beta testing a wysiwyg what you see is what you get extension visualeditor was opened to public use239240241242 it was met with much rejection and criticism and was described as slow and buggy243 the feature was changed from optout to optin afterward automated editing computer programs called bots have been used widely to perform simple and repetitive tasks such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data244245246 one controversial contributor massively creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to ten thousand articles on the swedish wikipedia on certain days247 there are also some bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parenthesis248 edits misidentified by a bot as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors an antivandal bot tries to detect and revert vandalism quickly and automatically245 bots can also report edits from particular accounts or ip address ranges as was done at the time of the mh17 jet downing incident in july 2014249 bots on wikipedia must be approved prior to activation250 according to andrew lih the current expansion of wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots251 wikiprojects and assessments of articles importance and quality this section is transcluded from english wikipedia edit history main article wikiproject a wikiproject is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve wikipedia these groups often focus on a specific topic area for example womens history a specific location or a specific kind of task for example checking newly created pages the english wikipedia currently has over 2000 wikiprojects and activity varies252 in 2007 in preparation for producing a print version the english wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles253 articles are rated by wikiprojects the range of quality classes begins with stub very short pages followed by start c and b in increasing order of quality community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality classes either good article a or the highest featured article of the about 44 million articles and lists assessed as of march 2015 a little more than 5000 012 are featured articles and fewer than 2000 004 are featured lists one featured article per day as selected by editors appears on the main page of wikipedia254255 the articles can also be rated as per importance as judged by a wikiproject currently there are 5 importance categories low mid high top and for unclassifieduncertain level for a particular article different wikiprojects may assign different importance levels the wikipedia version 10 editorial team has developed a table shown below that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance on the english wikipedia if an article or list receives different ratings by two or more wikiprojects then the highest rating is used in the table piecharts and barchart the software regularly autoupdates the data researcher giacomo poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors256 a 2010 study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is

hardware operations and support this section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information june 2017 see also wikimedia foundation § hardware wikipedia receives between 25000 and 60000 page requests per second depending on time of day259 as of 2008update page requests are first passed to a frontend layer of squid caching servers260needs update further statistics based on a publicly available 3month wikipedia access trace are available261 requests that cannot be served from the squid cache are sent to loadbalancing servers running the linux virtual server software which in turn pass them to one of the apache web servers for page rendering from the database the web servers deliver pages as requested performing page rendering for all the language editions of wikipedia to increase speed further rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses overview of system architecture as of december 2010update wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of linux servers mainly ubuntu262263 as of december 2009update there were 300 in florida and 44 in amsterdam264 by january 22 2013 wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an equinix facility in ashburn virginia265266 internal research and operational development in accordance with growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported50 the foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the reinvestment of donations into the internal research and development of the foundation267 two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a visual editor and a largely underutilized thank tab which were developed for the purpose of ameliorating issues of editor attrition which have met with limited success50243 the estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by adam jaffe who recorded that the range of 4 to 25 annually was to be recommended with high end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment268 at the 2013 level of contributions for wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars the computed budget level recommended by jaffe and caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 18 million and 113 million dollars annually268 in 2016 the level of contributions were reported by blomberg news as being at 77 million annually updating the jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between 308 million and 192 million dollars annually268 internal news publications communityproduced news publications include the english wikipedias the signpost founded in 2005 by michael snow an attorney wikipedia administrator and former chair of the wikimedia foundation board of trustees269 it covers news and events from the site as well as major events from other wikimedia projects such as wikimedia commons similar publications are the germanlanguage kurier and the portugueselanguage correio da wikipédia other past and present community news publications on english wikipedia include the wikiworld web comic the wikipedia weekly podcast and newsletters of specific wikiprojects like the bugle from wikiproject military history and the monthly newsletter from the guild of copy editors there are also a number of publications from the wikimedia foundation and multilingual publications such as the wikimedia blog and this month in education access to content content licensing when the project was started in 2001 all text in wikipedia was covered by the gnu free documentation license gfdl a copyleft license permitting the redistribution creation of derivative works and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work270 the gfdl was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the gpl this made it a poor choice for a general reference work for example the gfdl requires the reprints of materials from wikipedia to come with a full copy of the gfdl text in december 2002 the creative commons license was released it was specifically designed for creative works in general not just for software manuals the license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the web the wikipedia project sought the switch to the creative commons271 because the two licenses gfdl and creative commons were incompatible in november 2008 following the request of the project the free software foundation fsf released a new version of the gfdl designed specifically to allow wikipedia to relicense its content to cc bysa by august 1 2009 a new version of the gfdl automatically covers wikipedia contents in april 2009 wikipedia and its sister projects held a communitywide referendum which decided the switch in june 2009272273274275 the handling of media files eg image files varies across language editions some language editions such as the english wikipedia include nonfree image files under fair use doctrine while the others have opted not to in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries eg in japanese copyright law media files covered by free content licenses eg creative commons cc bysa are shared across language editions via wikimedia commons repository a project operated by the wikimedia foundation wikipedias accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text276 the wikimedia foundation is not a licensor of content but merely a hosting service for the contributors and licensors of the wikipedia this position has been successfully defended in court277278 methods of access because wikipedia content is distributed under an open license anyone can reuse or redistribute it at no charge the content of wikipedia has been published in many forms both online and offline outside of the wikipedia website websites – thousands of mirror sites exist that republish content from wikipedia two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are referencecom and answerscom another example is wapedia which began to display wikipedia content in a mobiledevicefriendly format before wikipedia itself did mobile apps – a variety of mobile apps provide access to wikipedia on handheld devices including both android and ios devices see wikipedia apps see also mobile access search engines – some web search engines make special use of wikipedia content when displaying search results examples include bing via technology gained from powerset279 and duckduckgo compact discs dvds – collections of wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs an english version 2006 wikipedia cd selection contained about 2000 articles280281 the polishlanguage version contains nearly 240000 articles282 there are german and spanishlanguage versions as well283284 also wikipedia for schools the wikipedia series of cds dvds produced by wikipedians and sos children is a free handchecked noncommercial selection from wikipedia targeted around the uk national curriculum and intended to be useful for much of the englishspeaking world285 the project is available online an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes printed books – there are efforts to put a select subset of wikipedias articles into printed book form286287 since 2009 tens of thousands of printondemand books that reproduced english german russian and french wikipedia articles have been produced by the american company books llc and by three mauritian subsidiaries of the german publisher vdm288 semantic web – the website dbpedia begun in 2007 extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the englishlanguage wikipedia wikimedia has created the wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of wikipedia and the other wmf wikis and make it available in a queriable semantic format rdf this is still under development as of feb 2014 it has 15000000 items and 1000 properties for describing them obtaining the full contents of wikipedia for reuse presents challenges since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged289 wikipedia publishes dumps of its contents but these are textonly as of 2007update there was no dump available of wikipedias images290 several languages of wikipedia also maintain a reference desk where volunteers answer questions from the general public according to a study by pnina shachaf in the journal of documentation the quality of the wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk with an accuracy of 55291 mobile access see also helpmobile access the mobile version of the english wikipedias main page wikipedias original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed internet connection although wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since july 2013 the new york times on february 9 2014 quoted erik möller deputy director of the wikimedia foundation stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry16 the article in the new york times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that only 20 percent of the readership of the englishlanguage wikipedia comes via mobile devices a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites many of which approach 50 percent and the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more16 the new york times reports that möller has assigned a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the wikimedia foundation one principal concern cited by the new york times for the worry is for wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment16 bloomberg businessweek reported
