agents then ordered more for resale soon he started a business selling watches through mail order catalogs the next year he moved to chicago illinois where he met alvah c roebuck who joined him in the business farmers did business in small rural towns before the sears catalog farmers typically bought supplies often at high prices and on credit from local general stores with narrow selections of goods prices were negotiated and depended on the storekeepers estimate of a customers creditworthiness sears took advantage of this by publishing catalogs offering customers a wider selection of products at clearly stated prices the business grew quickly the first sears catalog was published in 1888 in 1893 richard sears and alvah roebuck renamed their watch company sears roebuck company and began to diversify by 1894 the sears catalog had grown to 322 pages featuring sewing machines bicycles sporting goods automobiles produced from 1905 to 1915 by lincoln motor car works of chicago no

readytoassemble kit houses14 novelists and story writers often portrayed the importance of the catalog in the emotional lives of rural folk for children and their parents the catalog was a wish book that was eagerly flipped through it was not a question of purchasing but of dreaming they made up stories about the lives of the models on the pages the catalog was a means of entertainment though much of its magic wore off with the passing of childhood15 the company was badly hurt during 1919–21 as a severe depression hit the nations farms after farmers had overexpanded their holdings to bail out the company rosenwald pledged 21 million of his personal wealth16 by 1922 sears had regained financial stability first he oversaw the design and construction of the companys first department store
