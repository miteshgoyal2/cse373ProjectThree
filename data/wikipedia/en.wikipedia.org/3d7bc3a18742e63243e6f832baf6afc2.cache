achieve school integration4 mcdonald won the primary in a surprise upset and was elected in november 1974 to the 94th united states congress serving georgias 7th congressional district which included most of atlantas northwestern suburbs including marietta where opposition to school busing was especially high however during the general election j quincy collins jr an air force prisoner of war

could take a chainsaw to in terms of reductions12 his staunch conservative views on social issues attracted controversy for instance mcdonald sponsored amendments to stop government aid to

consideration or a protected status under law14 he advocated the use of the nonapproved drug laetrile to treat patients in advanced stages of cancer15 despite medical opinion that the promotion of

being manipulated by communists and secret communist agents20 however he supported many africanamerican causes and was a prime mover in dedicating two statues in the us congress capital rotundaarea to

of the john birch society in 1983 succeeding robert welch20 mcdonald rarely spoke on the house floor preferring to insert material into the congressional record20 these insertions typically dealt with foreign policy issues relating to the soviet union and domestic issues centered on the growth of nonsoviet and soviet sponsored leftist subversion a number of mcdonalds insertions relating to the socialist workers party were collected into a book trotskyism and terror the strategy of revolution published in 197722 during his time in congress mcdonald introduced over 150 bills including

a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the united states–south korea mutual defense treaty with three fellow members of congress senator jesse helms of north carolina senator steve symms of idaho and representative carroll hubbard of kentucky23 due to bad weather on sunday august 28 1983 mcdonalds flight from atlanta was diverted to baltimore and when he finally arrived at jfk airport in new york he had missed his connection to south korea by two or three minutes19 mcdonald could have boarded a pan am boeing 747 flight to seoul but he preferred the lower fares of korean air lines and chose to wait for the next kal flight two days later19 simultaneously hubbard and helms planned to meet with mcdonald to discuss how to join mcdonald on the kal 007 flight as the delays mounted instead of joining mcdonald hubbard at the last minute gave up on the trip canceled his reservations and accepted a kentucky speaking engagement while helms attempted to join mcdonald but was also delayed24 mcdonald occupied an aisle seat 02b in the first class section when kal 007 took off on august 31 at 1224 am local time on a 3400 miles 5500 km trip to anchorage alaska for a scheduled stopover seven hours later the plane remained on the ground for an hour and a half during which it was refueled reprovisioned cleaned and serviced19 the passengers were given the option of leaving the

kornukov shot down kal 007 near moneron island after the plane entered soviet airspacecitation needed the international committee for the rescue of kal 007 survivors a group made up of some families of the victims of the shootdown maintains that there is reason to believe that mcdonald and others of flight 007 survived the shootdown25 the committee corroborates this theory with claims that soviet military communication and black box transcripts show a postmissile detonation flightpath at 5000 meters 16000 ft for almost 5 minutes until the stricken aircraft was over the only land mass in the tatar straits and within soviet territorial waters where it began a slow spiral descentcitation needed this viewpoint has received some coverage in the conservative news agency accuracy in media and

his honor the larry mcdonald memorial highway quotationsedit the drive of the rockefellers and their allies is to create a oneworld government combining supercapitalism and communism under the same tent all under their control  do i mean conspiracy yes i do i am convinced there is such a plot international in scope generations old in planning and incredibly evil in intent3233unreliable source speaking of carroll quigley a history professor at georgetown university he says sure weve been working it sure weve been collaborating with communism yes were working with global accommodation yes were working for world government but the only thing i object to is that weve kept it a secret34 i personally believe that we dont need a lot more laws i think weve got far too many laws on the books now thats part of the problem we dont need more government more laws we need a lot less im up there in washington dc trying to dismantle a lot of this giant government when you pass a law with the current attitude in the congress what do you get in a law today you get either more spending or more taxes or more controls which do you want do you want more spending i think weve got too much do you want more taxes i think were taxed too heavily now do you want more controls over your life does anybody say hey look i really believe the federal government needs to control me i want to be a slave please tell me how to run every facet of my life i dont hear many people saying that i think most people say i think its time we get the government off our backs and out of our pockets11 the complexity of social organization does not change our technologically sophisticated industrial society is more complex than the agrarian society of america in the eighteenth century in this regard that was a simpler world but the complexities of politics politics here meaning the science of governing do not change much the basic political problems confronting the framers of our constitution were as complex as our political problems today—perhaps more so because they were striking off into the dangerous unknown whereas all we need do is return to the fine highway we were once on35 quotes
