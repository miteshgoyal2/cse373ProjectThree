keep your head up and monster has been an ongoing controversy among fans of jackson the three tracks along with nine other unreleased songs titled all i need all right black widow burn tonight fall in love soldier boy ready 2 win stay and water colloquially known as the cascio tracks are attributed to jackson eddie cascio and james porte and were allegedly recorded in the cascios basement in 20074142 doubts over whether the vocals were actually by jackson have been raised reportedly by katherine jackson and jacksons two children prince and paris43 as well as jacksons sister la toya44 his nephews tj taj and taryll45 william46 and many of his fans47 his brother randy jackson posted a series of messages about the album on his twitter account stating that family members were not allowed at his studio where the album was being completed48 according to randy when producer teddy riley played him some of the tracks i immediately said it wasnt his voice48 in a statement before the premiere of breaking news sony music group countered that it had complete confidence in the results of our extensive research as well as the accounts of those who were in the studio with michael that the vocals on the new album are his own49 producer riley frank dileo and jacksons estate defended sonys claims that the song is authentic50 on december 6 2010 the cascio family appeared on oprah where eddie cascio insisted the songs were sung by jackson and showed the studio where he had allegedly recorded the songs riley who had worked on two of the cascio tracks monster and breaking news said that he had to do more processing to the voice which is why people were asking about the authenticity of his voice51 riley also said that with the melodyne we actually move the stuff up which is the reason why some of the vibrato sounds a little off or processed overprocessed we truly apologize for that happening but you are still hearing the true michael jackson51 almost three years after the album release in september 2013 riley apologized on twitter52 for his work on the cascio tracks and claimed that his participation in the project had been set up53 many of the fans who have questioned the authenticity of the cascio tracks have suggested that jason malachi an italianamerican rb singer based in maryland is the possible vocalist on the cascio tracks however the jackson estates lawyer has said that according to his knowledge malachi was not involved in the recording of the cascio tracks50 on january 16 2011 a statement appeared on malachis facebook page noting he was the vocalist of the songs in question calling it his confession54 he later said on myspace that his facebook and official website were hacked malachis manager thad nauden later that day told tmz saying that someone created a phony facebook page in jasons name jason wants everyone to know beyond a shadow of a doubt he did not sing a single note on the album55 on june 12 2014 a consumer who had purchased the album filed a class action lawsuit against sony music the jackson estate mjj productions eddie cascio and james porte for violation of consumer laws unfair competition and fraud the complaint was based on an expert report prepared by forensic phonetician dr george papcun that contested authenticity of the vocals according to the lawsuit the report had been peer reviewed and supported by a second wellcredentialed independent audio expert56 sony the estate cascio and porte raised first amendment defense claiming that regardless of the songs authenticity they had a constitutional right to attribute them to jackson57 on june 30 2016 the judge refused to grant defendants motion and ordered that the case proceeds to class certification58 dave grohl album creditedit another controversy concerns the album credit of dave grohl who is credited as having played drums on the track i cant make it another day grohl himself claimed in the november 2011 issue of the red bulletin that he does not perform on the track according to grohl lenny kravitz asked him to play on the song but neither kravitz nor jackson contacted him after he had recorded his drums and the version of the song that appears on michael does not feature his playing grohl called the fact that he was credited in the album notes despite not playing on the record not cool59 release of material without jacksons consentedit prior to the albums release a lawyer for jacksons father joe stated that jackson was a perfectionist and would never have wanted his unfinished material to be released60 william who collaborated with jackson prior to his death61 also criticized the release saying it was disrespectful to release the unfinished material because jackson was not able to give it his blessing62 critical receptionedit professional ratings aggregate scores source rating metacritic 5410063 review scores source rating allmusic 64 the boston globe favorable65 chicago tribune 66 entertainment weekly b67 the guardian 68 los angeles times 69 nme 51070 rolling stone 2 slant magazine 71 spin 61072 michael received mixed reviews from most music critics at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics the album received an average score of 54 based on 19 reviews which indicates mixed or average reviews63 despite media skepticism and some dissent within jackson family ranks reviews largely found michael better than expected73 joe vogel of the huffington post stated that the bottom line is this michael contains some very impressive new material and his habits his obsessions his versatility and his genius are on display at every turn who else could move so seamlessly from social anthem to floor burner fleet hip hop to cosmic rock vintage funk to poignant folk ballad74 dan martin of nme called the album kind of enjoyable but commented that if this decentenough album is the best of the bunch things are going to get ugly from here on in70 neil mccormick of the telegraph called the album a fine album and stated that it is certainly a great deal better than anyone had any right to expect jackson is finally about to get the comeback he craved75 jody rosen of rolling stone thought the album was not a michael jackson album and jackson would not have released anything like this compilation a grab bag of outtakes and outlines but its a testament to the mans charisma that michael can be compelling2 leah greenblatt of entertainment weekly called it certainly no great affront to his name while the new york times said it was a miscellany of familiar jackson offerings inspirational loving resentful and paranoid6773 kitty empire in the observer said jackson sounded paler more emaciated more effectsladen than on his classic songs such as billie jean76 she characterized the album as a hotchpotch of odds and sods that often make plain their coauthors but singled out the breezy and carefree i like the way that you love me and the pugnacious hollywood tonight for praise76 the reno gazettejournal gave the album 3 stars out of 477 while the toronto sun gave it 3 stars out of 578 nima baniamer of contactmusiccom gave the album 45 and stated that jackson still seems to hold the capability to effortlessly transgress music genres baniamer also commented it wouldnt be a decent jackson record if it wasnt surrounded by controversy breaking news is a great track that touches upon the medias obsession with the pop icon ironically a track further surrounded by dispute as fans have claimed that it may not even be jacksons own voice on the track79 commercial performanceedit the album debuted at number one in germany selling 85000 copies in its first week80 the album also debuted at number one in austria italy
