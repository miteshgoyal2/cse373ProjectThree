he became involved with the actors studio and then formed his own theater workshop he organized an offbroadway group and became its director and continued directing in summer stock theatre while teaching acting at the high school of performing arts19 he was the senior drama coach at the new 46th st landmark building of performing arts fame the 25yearold lumet directed the drama department in a production of the young and faircitation needed early careeredit directing a tv show in 1953 lumet began his career as a director with offbroadway productions and then evolved into a highly respected tv director after working offbroadway and in summerstock he began directing television in 1950 after working as an assistant to friend and thendirector yul brynner he soon developed a lightning quick method for shooting due to the high turnover required by television as a result while working for cbs he directed hundreds of episodes of danger 1950–55 mama 1949–57 and you are there 1953–57 a weekly series which costarred walter cronkite in one of his earliest leading roles he chose cronkite for the role of anchorman because the premise of the show was so silly was so outrageous that we needed somebody with the most american homespun warm ease about him lumet said21 he also directed original plays for playhouse 90 kraft television theatre and studio one filming around 200 episodes which established him as one of the most prolific and respected directors in the business according to turner classic movies his ability to work quickly while shooting carried over to his film career2 because the quality of many of the television dramas was so impressive several of them were later adapted as motion pictures directing anna magnani in the fugitive kind 1960 his first movie 12 angry men was an auspicious beginning for lumet it was a critical success and established lumet as a director skilled at adapting theatrical properties to motion pictures for us supreme court justice sonia sotomayor seeing the film for the first time was a pivotal moment in her life as she was at that time considering a career in law it told me that i was on the right path she said22 fully half of lumets complement of films have originated in the theater23 a controversial tv show he directed in 1960 gained him notoriety the saccovanzetti story on nbc according to the new york times the drama drew flack from the state of massachusetts where sacco and vanzetti were tried and executed because it was thought to postulate that the condemned murderers were in fact wholly innocent however the resulting controversy actually did lumet more good than harm sending several prestigious film assignments his way24 directing marlon brando in the fugitive kind 1959 he began adapting classic plays for both film and television in 1959 he directed marlon brando joanne woodward and anna magnani in the feature film the fugitive kind based on the tennessee williams play orpheus descending he later directed a live television version of eugene oneills the iceman cometh which was followed by his 1962 film a view from the bridge another psychological drama from a play written by arthur miller this was followed by another eugene oneill play turned to cinema long days journey into night in 1962 with katharine hepburn gaining an oscar nomination for her performance as a drugaddicted housewife the four principal actors swept the acting awards at the 1962 cannes film festival25 it was also voted one of the years ten best films by the new york times deathedit lumet died at the age of 86 on april 9 2011 in his residence in manhattan from lymphoma1326 when asked in a 1997 interview about how he wanted to go out lumet responded i dont think about it im not religious i do know that i dont want to take up any space burn me up and scatter my ashes over katzs delicatessen27 following his death numerous tributes have been paid for his enduring body of work marked by many memorable portrayals of new york city fellow new york directors woody allen and martin scorsese both paid tribute to lumet allen called him the quintessential new york filmmaker while scorsese said our vision of the city has been enhanced and deepened by classics like serpico dog day afternoon and above all the remarkable prince of the city28 lumet also drew praise from new york mayor michael bloomberg who called him one of the great chroniclers of our city28 lumet was called the last of the great movie moralists in a tribute remembering a career in which he guided many of the worlds most respected actors through roles that connected with the conscience of multiple generations29 directing style and subjectsedit realism and energetic styleedit film critic owen gleiberman has observed that lumet was a hardboiled straightshooter who because he was trained during the golden age of television in the 1950s became noted for his energetic style of directing the words sidney lumet and energy he adds became synonymous the energy was there in the quietest moments it was an inner energy a hum of existence that lumet observed in people and brought out in them when he went into the new york streets he made them electric30 it was a working class outerborough energy lumets streets were just as mean as scorseses but lumets seemed plain rather than poetic he channeled that new york skeezy vitality with such natural force that it was easy to overlook what was truly involved in the achievement he captured that new york vibe like no one else because he saw it lived it breathed it – but then he had to go out and stage it or recreate it almost as if he were staging a documentary letting his actors square off like random predators insisting on the most natural light possible making offices look as ugly and bureaucratic as they were because he knew beneath that that they werent just offices but lairs and that there was a deeper intensity almost a kind of beauty to catching the coarseness of reality as it truly looked30 collaborationedit describing scene with treat williams in prince of the city 1981 lumet generally insisted on the collaborative nature of film sometimes ridiculing the dominance of the personal director writes film historian frank p cunningham as a result lumet became renowned among both actors and cinematographers for his openness to sharing creative ideas with the writer actor and other artists31 lumet has no equal in the distinguished direction of superior actors adds cunningham with many coming from the theater he was able to draw powerful performances from acting luminaries such as ralph richardson marlon brando richard burton katharine hepburn james mason sophia loren geraldine fitzgerald blythe danner rod steiger vanessa redgrave paul newman sean connery henry fonda dustin hoffman albert finney simone signoret and anne bancroft give him a good actor and he just might find the great actor lurking within wrote film critic mick lasalle32 when necessary lumet would choose untrained actors but stated over ninety percent of the time i want the best tools i can get actors writers lighting men cameramen propmen31 nonetheless when he did use less experienced actors he could still bring out superior and memorable acting performances he did so with nick nolte anthony perkins armand assante jane fonda faye dunaway timothy hutton and ali macgraw who herself referred to him as every actors dream33 in fondas opinion he was a master such control of his craft he had strong progressive values and never betrayed them34 while the goal of all movies is to entertain the kind of film in which i believe goes one step further it compels the spectator to examine one facet or another of his own conscience it stimulates thought and sets the mental juices flowing sidney lumet26 lumet believed that movies are an art and the amount of attention paid to movies is directly related to pictures of quality35 because he started his career as an actor he became known as an actors director and worked with the best of them over the years a roster probably unequaled by any other director4 acting scholar frank p tomasulo agrees and points out that many directors who are able to understand acting from an actors perspective were all great communicators36 according to film historians gerald mast and bruce kawin lumets sensitivity to actors and to the rhythms of the city have made him americas longestlived descendant of the 1950s neorealist tradition and its urgent commitment to ethical responsibility37 they cite his early film the hill 1965 as one of the most politically and morally radical films of the 1960s they add that beneath the social conflicts of lumets films lies the conviction that love and reason will eventually prevail in human affairs and that law and justice will eventually be served – or not37 his debut film twelve angry men was an acclaimed picture in its day representing a model for liberal reason and fellowship during the 1950s38 the film and lumet were nominated for academy awards and he was nominated for the directors guild award with the film widely praised by critics19 the encyclopedia of world biography states that his films often featured actors who studied method acting noted for portraying an earthy introspective style a leading example of such method actors would be al pacino who early in his career studied under method acting guru lee strasberg lumet also preferred the appearance of spontaneity in both his actors and settings which gave his films an improvisational look by shooting much of his work on location39 rehearsal and preparationedit lumet was a strong believer in rehearsal and felt that if you rehearse correctly the actor will not lose spontaneity according to acting author ian bernard he felt that it gives actors the entire arc of the role which gives them the freedom to find that magical accident40 director peter bogdanovich asked him whether he rehearsed extensively before shooting and lumet said he liked to rehearse a minimum of two weeks before filming4 during those weeks recalls faye dunaway who starred in network he also blocked the scenes with his cameraman as a result she adds not a minute is wasted while hes shooting and that shows not only on the studios budget but it shows on the impetus of performance41 she praises his style of directing in network in which she won her only academy award sidney let me say is one of if not the most talented and professional men in the worldand acting in network was one of the happiest experiences i have ever hadhes a really gifted man who contributed a good deal to my performance41 partly because his actors were well rehearsed he could execute a production in rapid order which kept his productions within their modest budget when filming prince of the city for example although there were over 130 speaking roles and 135 different locations he was able to coordinate the entire shoot in 52 days as a result write historians charles harpole and thomas schatz performers were eager to work with him as they considered him to be an outstanding director of actors the films star treat williams said that lumet was known for being energetic he was just a ball of fire he had passion for what he did and he came to work with all barrels burning he’s probably the most prepared director i’ve ever worked with emotionally his films always came in under schedule and under budget and everybody got home for dinner11 harpole adds that whereas many directors disliked rehearsals or advising actors on how to build their character lumet excelled at both35 he could thereby more easily give his performers a cinematic showcase for their abilities and help them deepen their acting contribution actor christopher reeve who costarred in deathtrap also pointed out that lumet knew how to talk technical language if you want to work that way – he knows how to talk method he knows how to improvise and he does it all equally well4 as a movie goes on it gets more and more grueling and you really need a director who will help remind you where your character is at all times sidney lumet was like that all wonderful directors will do that al pacino42 joanna rapf writing about the filming of the verdict states that lumet gave a lot of personal attention to his actors whether listening to them or touching them she describes how lumet and star paul newman sat on a bench secluded from the main set where newman had taken his shoes off in order to privately discuss an important scene about to be shot the actors walk through their scenes before the camera rolls this preparation was done because lumet likes to shoot a scene in one take two at the most newman liked to call him speedy gonzales adding that lumet did not shoot more than he had to he doesnt give himself any protection i know i would newman said4 film critic betsey sharkey agrees adding that he was a maestro of one or two takes years before clint eastwood would turn it into a respected specialty sharkey recalls faye dunaway once told me that lumet worked so fast it was as if he were on roller skates a racing pulse generated by a big heart43 character developmentedit biographer joanna rapf observes that lumet had always been an independent director and liked to make films about men who summon courage to challenge the system about the little guy against the system4intro this also includes the women characters as in garbo talks its star anne bancroft embodied the kind of character portrayal that attracted him a committed activist for all kinds of causes who stands up for the rights of the oppressed who is lively outspoken courageous who refuses to conform for the sake of convenience and whose understanding of life allows her to die with dignity  garbo talks in many ways is a valentine to new york4 in interview in 2006 he said that he had always been fascinated by the human cost involved in following passions and commitments and the cost those passions and commitments inflict on others4 this theme is at the core of most of his movies notes rapf such as his truelife films about of corruption in the new york city police department or in family dramas such as in daniel psychodramasedit film historian stephen bowles notes that lumet was most comfortable and effective as a director of serious psychodramas as opposed to light entertainments his academy award nominations for example were all for character studies of men in crisis from his first film twelve angry men to the verdict lumet excelled at putting drama on the screen23 most of his characters are driven by obsessions or passions such as the pursuit of justice honesty and truth or jealousy memory or guilt23 lumet was intrigued by those kinds of obsessive conditions writes bowles23 lumets protagonists tended to be antiheroes isolated and unexceptional men who rebel against a group or institution the most important criterion for lumet was not simply whether the actions of the people are right or wrong but whether they were genuine and justified by the individuals conscience whistleblower frank serpico for example is the quintessential lumet hero whom he described as a rebel with a cause44 an earlier example of psychodrama was the pawnbroker in 1964 starring rod steiger in it steiger played a holocaust survivor whose spirit had been broken and lives daytoday as a pawn shop owner in harlem lumet used the film to examine with occasional flashbacks the psychological and spiritual scars steigers character lives with including his lost capacity to feel pleasure45 steiger who has made nearly 80 films said during a tv interview that the film was his favorite as an actor46 issues of social justiceedit it was the social realism which permeated his greatest work that truly defined lumet  – the themes of youthful idealism beaten down by corruption and the hopelessness of inept social institutions allowed him to produce several trenchant and potent films that no other director could have made turner classic movies2 serpico 1973 was the first of four seminal films he made in the 1970s that marked him as one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation2 it was the story of power and betrayal in the new york city police force with an idealistic policeman battling impossible odds2 as lumet was a child during the depression he grew up poor in new york city and witnessed the poverty and corruption all around him4 it instilled in him at an early age the importance of justice for a democracy a subject he tried to put in his films he admits however that he does not believe that art itself has the power to change anything there is as he says a lot of shit to deal with in the entertainment industry but the secret of good work is to maintain your honesty and your passion4 film historian david thomson writes of his films he has steady themes the fragility of justice and the police and their corruption lumet quickly became esteemed  and he got a habit for big issues – fail safe the pawnbroker the hill – and seemed torn between dullness and pathos   he was that rarity of the 1970s a director happy to serve his material – yet seemingly not touched or changed by it  his sensitivity to actors and to the rhythms of the city have made him americas longestlived descendant of the 1950s neorealist tradition and its urgent commitment to ethical responsibility38 new york city settingsedit lumet always preferred to work in new york and shunned the dominance of hollywood4 as a director he became strongly identified with new york i always like being in woody allens world he said he claimed that the diversity of the city its many ethnic neighborhoods its art and its crime its sophistication and its corruption its beauty and its ugliness all feed into what inspires him4 he felt that in order to create it is important to confront reality on a daily basis for lumet new york is filled with reality hollywood is a fantasyland4 he used new york time and again as the backdrop – if not the symbol – of his preoccupation with americas decline according to film historians scott and barbara siegel1 lumet was attracted to crimerelated stories with new york urban settings where the criminals get caught in a vortex of events they can neither understand nor control but are forced to resolve23 use of contemporary jewish themesedit like other jewish directors from new york such as woody allen mel brooks and paul mazursky lumets characters often spoke overtly about controversial issues of the times they felt unconstrained as filmmakers and their art became filtered through their jewish consciousness notes film historian david desser lumet like the others sometimes turned to jewish themes in order to develop ethnic sensibilities that were characteristic of contemporary american culture473 by dynamically highlighting its unique tensions and cultural diversity this was partly reflected in lumets preoccupation with city life476 his film a stranger among us for example is the story of a woman undercover police officer and her experiences in a hasidic community within new york city the subject of guilt explains desser dominates many of lumets films from his first feature film 12 angry men 1957 in which a jury must decide the guilt or innocence of a young man to q a 1990 in which a lawyer must determine the question of guilt and responsibility on the part of a maverick policeman guilt is a common thread which runs through many of his films in a film like murder on the orient express 1974 all of the suspects are guilty47172 his films were also characterized by a strong emphasis on family life often showing tensions within the family 47172 this emphasis on the family included surrogate families as in the police trilogy serpico 1973 prince of the city 1981 and qa an untraditional family is also portrayed in dog day afternoon 197547172 directing techniquesedit sidney was a visionary filmmaker whose movies made an indelible mark on our popular culture with their stirring commentary on our society future generations of filmmakers will look to sidneys work for guidance and inspiration but there will never be another who comes close to him composer quincy jones28 lumet had always preferred naturalism andor realism according to joanna rapf he did not like the decorators look where the camera could call attention to itself he edited his films so the camera was unobtrusive his cinematographer ron fortunato said sidney flips if he sees a look thats too artsy4 partly because he was willing and able to take on so many significant social issues and problems he achieved strong performances from lead actors with fine work from character actors he is one of the stalwart figures of new york moviemaking he abides by good scripts when he gets them said critic david thomson38 although critics gave varying opinions of his films in general lumets body of work is held in high esteem19 most critics have described him as a sensitive and intelligent director having good taste the courage to experiment with his style and a gift for handling actors19 in a quote from his book lumet emphasized the logistics of directing “ someone once asked me what making a movie was like i said it was like making a mosaic each setup is like a tiny tile a setup the basic component of a films production consists of one camera position and its associated lighting you color it shape it polish it as best you can youll do six or seven hundred of these maybe a thousand there can easily be that many setups in a movie then you literally paste them together and hope its what you set out to do48 ” critic justin chang adds that lumets skill as a director and in developing strong stories continued up to his last film in 2007 noting that his nimble touch with performers his ability to draw out great warmth and zesty humor with one hand and coax them toward ever darker more anguished extremes of emotion with the other was on gratifying display in his ironically titled final film before the devil knows youre dead4950 vision of future filmsedit in the same interview with new york magazine he said he expects to see more directors from different ethnic backgrounds and communities telling their stories you know i started out making films about jews and italians and irish because i didnt know anything else51 personal lifeedit lumet was married four times the first three marriages ended in divorce he was married to actress rita gam from 1949–552 to socialite gloria vanderbilt from 1956–63 to gail jones daughter of lena horne from 1963–78 and to mary gimbel from 1980 until his death he had two daughters by jones amy who was married to p j orourke from 1990–1993 and actressscreenwriter jenny who had a leading role in his film q a she also wrote the screenplay for the 2008 film rachel getting married1952 legacyedit according to film historian bowles lumet succeeded in becoming a leading drama filmmaker partly because his most important criterion when directing is not whether the actions of his protagonists are right or wrong but whether their actions are genuine and where those actions are justified by the individuals conscience this gives his heroes uncommon strength and courage to endure the pressures abuses and injustices of others his films have thereby continually given us the quintessential hero acting in defiance of peer group authority and asserting his own code of moral values23 lumets published memoir about his life in film making movies 1996 is extremely lighthearted and infectious in its enthusiasm for the craft of moviemaking itself writes bowles and is in marked contrast to the tone and style of most of his films perhaps lumets signature as a director is his work with actors – and his exceptional ability to draw highquality sometimes extraordinary performances from even the most unexpected quarters23 jake coyle associated press writer agrees while lumet has for years gone relatively underappreciated actors have consistently turned in some of their most memorable performances under his stewardship from katharine hepburn to faye dunaway henry fonda to paul newman lumet is known as an actors director53 and to some like ali macgraw he is considered every actors dream33 lumet is one of the most important film directors in the history of american cinema and his work has left an indelible mark on both audiences and the history of film itself frank pierson former president of academy of motion pictures54 noting that lumets compelling stories and unforgettable performances were his strong suit director and producer steven spielberg believes that lumet was one of the greatest directors in the long history of film55 al pacino upon hearing of lumets death stated that with his films he leaves a great legacy but more than that to the people close to him he will remain the most civilized of humans and the kindest man i have ever known55 boston herald writer james verniere observes that at a time when the american film industry is intent on seeing how low it can go sidney lumet remains a master of the morally complex american drama56 he did not win an individual academy award although he did receive an academy honorary award in 2005 and 14 of his films were nominated for various oscars such as network which was nominated for 10 winning 4 in 2005 lumet received an academy award for lifetime achievement for his brilliant services to screenwriters performers and the art of the motion picture upon winning recognition from the academy lumet said i wanted one damn it and i felt i deserved one29 nonetheless director spike lee commented that his great work lives on with us forever much more important than oscar yadig57 a few months after lumets death in april 2011 tv commentator lawrence odonnell aired a tribute to lumet58 and a retrospective celebration of his work was held at new yorks lincoln center with the appearance of numerous speakers and film stars8 in october 2011 the organization human rights first inaugurated its sidney lumet award for integrity in entertainment for the tv show the good wife along with giving awards to two middle east activists who had worked
