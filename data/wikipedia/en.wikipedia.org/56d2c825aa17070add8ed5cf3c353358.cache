commercial growth of the internet was sparked by the advent of the world wide web and then the release of the mosaic web browser in 19933 in the late 1990s the reduction of the digital divide advances in internet connectivity increases in uses for the internet and better education on the use of the internet led to further increases in internet usage between 1990 and 1997 the percentage of households in the united states owning computers increased from 15 to 354 information and communications technology progressed from a luxury to a necessity the shift to an economy based on computerization is known as the information age stock market bubbleedit the nasdaq composite index spiked in the late 1990s and then fell sharply as a result of the dotcom bubble as a result of the rapidlyincreasing usage of the internet many investors were eager to invest at any valuation in any company that had one of the internetrelated prefixes or a com suffix in its name leading to a stock market bubble5 during the bubble the valuations of companies in the quaternary sector of the economy increased rapidly6 venture capitalists eager to profit on this investment demand moved to raise and invest capital faster and with less caution than usual a combination of rapidly increasing stock prices market confidence that the companies would turn future profits speculation in stocks by individuals and widely available venture capital created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics such as the price–earnings ratio in favor of basing confidence on technological advancements the low interest rates of 1998–99 helped increase the availability of funding7 the taxpayer relief act of 1997 which lowered the top marginal capital gains tax in the united states is also cited as a reason that people were willing to make more speculative investments8 an unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred during the boom and the press reported the phenomenon of people quitting their jobs to engage in fulltime day trading9 the value of the nasdaq composite stock market index which includes many technology companies rose from 1000 in 1995 to 5000 in the year 20005 by the end of the 1990s the nasdaq composite reached a price–earnings ratio of 200 dwarfing the peak price–earnings ratio of 80 for the japanese nikkei 225 during the japanese asset price bubble of 19916 in 1999 shares of qualcomm rose in value by 2619 and 12 other largecap stocks each rose over 100010 even though the nasdaq stock market index rose 856 and the sp 500 stock market index rose 195 in 1999 more stocks fell in value than rose in value as investors sold stocks in slower growing companies to invest in internet stocks10 at the height of the boom it was possible for a promising dotcom company to become a public company via an initial public offering and raise a substantial amount of money even though it had never made a profit—or in some cases realized any material revenue whatsoever american news media including respected business publications such as forbes and the wall street journal took advantage of the publics desire to invest in the stock market an article in the wall street journal suggested that investors rethink the quaint idea of profits and cnbc reported on the stock market with the same level of suspense as many networks provided to the broadcasting of sports events611 academics preston teeter and jorgen sandberg have criticized federal reserve chairman alan greenspan for his role in the promotion and rise in tech stocks6 their research cites numerous examples of greenspan putting a positive spin on historic stock valuations despite a wealth of evidence suggesting that stocks were overvalued author andrew smith argued that the financial industrys handling of initial public offerings tended to benefit the banks and initial investors rather than the companies12 this is because company staff were typically barred from selling their shares during a lockup period of 12 to 18 months although many were able to lock in profits by buying options or entering into forward sale agreements however the investment bankers and other initial investors were typically entitled to sell their shares on the first day of trading and lock in huge profits literally overnight smith argues that the high profitability of the ipos to wall street was a significant factor in the course of events of the bubble he wrote but did the kids the often young dotcom entrepreneurs dupe the establishment by drawing them into fake companies or did the establishment dupe the kids by introducing them to mammon and charging a commission on it however executives and employees who received employee stock options became instant paper millionaires when their company made its initial public offering several company executives such as mark cuban made vast fortunes when their companies were bought out at an early stage in the dotcom stock market bubble the most successful sold for cash or entered into hedging transactions on shares they received get big fastedit most dotcom companies operated at a net loss to harness network effects to build market share or mind share as fast as possible using the mottos get big fast and get large or get lost these companies offered their services or products for free or at a discount with the expectation that they could build enough brand awareness to charge profitable rates for their services in the future131415 advertisingedit technology companies sought to expand public awareness and their customer bases via massive advertising campaigns many dotcoms named themselves with onomatopoeic nonsense words that they hoped would be memorable and not easily confused with a competitor dotcom commercials during super bowl xxxiv in january 2000 featured advertisements by 16 dotcom companies that each paid over 2 million for a 30second spot cbsbacked iwoncom gave away 1 million to a lucky contestant on an april 15 2000 halfhour primetime special that was broadcast on cbs16 by june 2000 after the bubble burst dot com companies were forced to rethink their advertising campaigns17 in january 2001 just three dotcoms bought advertising spots during super bowl xxxv etrade monstercom and yahoo hotjobs18 lavish spending by dotcomsedit the growth over profits mentality and the aura of new economy invincibility led some companies to engage in lavish internal spending such as elaborate business facilities and luxury vacations for employees upon the launch of a new product or website a company would organize an expensive event called a dot com party bubble in telecomedit telecommunications equipment providers convinced that the future economy would require ubiquitous broadband access went deeply into debt to improve their networks with highspeed equipment and fiber optic cables in the struggle to become a technology hub many cities and states used tax money to fund technology conference centers advanced infrastructure and created favorable business and tax law to encourage development of the dotcom industry in their locale virginias dulles technology corridor along i495 is a prime example of this activity large quantities of highspeed fiber links were laid and the state and local governments gave tax exemptions to technology firms office vacancy increased significantly after the bubble burst although the area still remains a major technology hub aftermathedit see also early 2000s recession on january 10 2000 america online a favorite of dotcom investors and pioneer of dialup internet access announced plans to merge with time warner the worlds largest media company in the largest merger in history at that time19 the

capital was no longer available the operational mentality of executives and investors completely changed a moneylosing companys lifespan was measured by its burn rate the rate at which a nonprofitable company lacking a viable business model spent its existing capital many dotcoms ran out of capital and were acquired or went through liquidation the domain names were purchased by oldeconomy

top investment firms including citigroup and merrill lynch millions of dollars for misleading investors various supporting industries such as advertising and shipping scaled back their operations as demand for their services fell telecoms crashedit several companies that produced network equipment were irrevocably damaged by the debt taken on to fund their expansion and went bankrupt causing what is known as the telecoms crash however some communications companies that supplied equipment and outsourced manufacturing such as cisco and qualcomm were able to survive similarly in europe mobile phone companies overspent on 3g licences which led them deep into debt and led to the telecoms crash the investments in infrastructure were far out of proportion to both their current and projected cash flow worldcom led by bernard ebbers was the subject of accounting scandals worldcoms stock price fell drastically when the accounting scandal was publicized and in july 2002 it filed the largest

october 200227 surviving companiesedit although their stock prices declined significantly 48 of dotcom companies survived through 200414 many companies even those who were categorized as the small players were adequate enough to endure the stock market drop of 2000–200214 retail investors who felt burned by the burst transitioned their investment portfolios to more cautious positions28 job market and office equipment glutedit nevertheless laidoff technology experts such as computer programmers found a glutted job market university degree programs for computerrelated careers saw a noticeable drop in new students2930 anecdotes of unemployed programmers going back to school to become accountants or lawyers were common failed startups liquidated all of their equipment such as herman miller aeron chairs and computer equipment31 legacyedit on the longterm legacy of the bubble venture capitalist fred wilson who funded dotcom companies said about the dotcom bubble a friend of mine has a great line he says nothing important has ever been built without irrational exuberance meaning that you need some of this mania to cause investors to open up their pocketbooks and finance the building of the railroads or the automobile or aerospace industry or whatever and in this case much of the capital invested was lost but also much of it was invested in a very high throughput backbone for the internet and lots of software that works and databases and server structure all that stuff has allowed what we have today which has changed all our lives thats what all this speculative mania built32 as growth in the information technology sector stabilized several companies consolidated gained market share and came to dominate their respective fields a few large dotcom companies such as amazoncom ebay and google became industrydominating megafirms the information technology industry came to more closely resemble other traditional sectors of the economy albeit with still a faster growth rate and higher valuations than other sectors there are now many information technology companies ranked at the top of the fortune 500 list of the largest companies by revenues
