beanie 5 see also 6 references 7 external links stylesedit one popular style of the beanie during the early half of the twentieth century was a kind of skullcap made of four or six felt panels sewn together to form the cap the panels were often composed of two or more different contrasting colors to give them a novel and distinctive look this type of beanie was also very popular with some colleges and fraternities as they would often use school colors in the different panels making up the hat another style of beanie was the whoopee cap a formed and pressed wool felted hat with a flipped up brim that formed a band around the bottom of the cap the band would often have a decorative repeating zigzag or scalloped pattern cut around the edge it was also quite common for schoolboys to adorn their beanies with buttons and pins etymologyedit the clothcovered button on the crown is about the size of a bean seed and may be the origin of the term beanie some academics believe that the term is instead derived from a type of headgear worn in some medieval universities the yellow hats bejaunus meaning yellowbill later beanus a term used for both the hats and the new students evolved into the college beanies of later years1 according to the oxford dictionary the etymology is uncertain but probably derives from the slang term bean meaning head in new zealand and australia the term beanie is normally applied to a knit cap known as a tuque in canada and parts of the us but also may apply to the kind of skull cap historically worn by surf lifesavers2 and still worn during surf sports3 the nonknitted variety is normally called a cap in other countries in the united kingdom the term benny hat may also refer to a knitted style of headcovering this name originally comes from the character benny played by actor paul henry in the british crossroads soap opera the character appeared from the mid1970s to the late1980s and usually wore a knitted version of the hat historyedit a larger variant of the skullcap the beanie was working apparel associated with blue collar laborers including welders mechanics and other tradesmen who needed to keep their hair back but for whom a brim would be an unnecessary obstructioncitation needed beanies do sometimes have a very small brim less than an inch deep around the brow front the baseball cap evolved from this kind of beanie with the addition of a visor to block the suncitation needed by the mid1940s beanies fell out of general popularity as a hat in favor of cotton visored caps like the baseball cap however in the 1950s and possibly beyond they were worn by college freshmen and various fraternity initiates as a form of mild hazing for example lehigh university required freshmen to wear beanies or dinks and other colleges including franklin marshall gettysburg rutgers westminster college and others may have had similar practices4 benedictine college in atchison kansas still carries this tradition for the first week of a freshmans classes5 and is said to be the only college in the us to maintain this tradition6 wilson college continues this tradition today as a part of its oddeven class year rivalry 7 propeller beanieedit in the late 1940s science fiction fanzine artist ray nelson himself still in high school adopted the use of the propeller beanie as emblematic shorthand for science fiction fandom this was in selfmockery of the popular image of fans as childish and concerned with ephemera such as science fiction references to the distinctive headwear are ironically now used to identify oldfashioned fans as opposed to more modern fans of media sf the propeller beanie increased in popular use through comics and eventually made its way onto the character of beany boy of beany and cecil today computer savvy and other technically proficient people are sometimes pejoratively referred to as propellerheads thanks to the onetime popularity of the propeller beanie8 in the 21st century propeller beanies are rarely seen on the street and are primarily worn for satirical or comedic purposes in 1996 student hackers placed a giant propeller beanie on the great dome at the massachusetts
