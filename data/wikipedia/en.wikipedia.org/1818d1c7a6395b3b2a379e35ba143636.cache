oil boom early indian treaty territories in north dakota map and overview fort union trading post national historic site native american peoples lived in what is now north dakota for thousands of years before the coming of europeans the known tribes included the mandan people maybe from around the 11th century17 while the first hidatsa group arrived a few hundred years later18 they both assembled in villages on tributaries to missouri river in what would become the west central north dakota crow indians travelled the plains from the west to visit and trade with the related hidatsas17 after the split between them probably in the 17th century19 later came divisions of the dakota people the lakota the santee and the yanktonai the assiniboine and the plains cree undertook southward journeys to the village indians either for trade or for war1720 the shoshone indians in presentday wyoming and montana may have carried out attacks on indian enemies so far east as the missouri21 a group of cheyennes lived in a village of earth lodges at the lower sheyenne river biesterfeldt site for decades in the 18th century due to attacks by crees assiniboines and chippewas armed with fire weapons they left the area around 1780 and crossed the missouri some time after22 a band of the few sotaio indians lived east of missouri river and met the uprooted cheyennes before the end of the century they soon followed the cheyennes across the missouri and lived among them south of cannonball river23 eventually the cheyenne and the sutaio became one tribe and turned into mounted buffalo hunters with ranges mainly outside north dakota before the middle of the 19th century the arikara entered the upcoming state from the south and joined the mandan and hidatsa24 with time a number of indians entered into treaties with the united states many of the treaties defined the territory of a specific tribe see the map the first european to reach the area was the frenchcanadian trader pierre gaultier sieur de la vérendrye who led an exploration and trading party to the mandan villages in 1738 guided by assiniboine indians25 in 1762 the region became part of spanish louisiana until 180226 dakota territory was settled sparsely by european americans until the late 19th century when the railroads were constructed into the region with the advantage of grants of land they vigorously marketed their properties extolling the region as ideal for agriculture an omnibus bill for statehood for north dakota south dakota montana and washington titled the enabling act of 1889 was passed on february 22 1889 during the administration of grover cleveland his successor benjamin harrison signed the proclamations formally admitting north dakota and south dakota to the union on november 2 188927 the rivalry between the two new states presented a dilemma of which was to be admitted first harrison directed secretary of state james g blaine to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first and the actual order went unrecorded thus no one knows which of the dakotas was admitted first2829 however since north dakota alphabetically appears before south dakota its proclamation was published first in the statutes at large since then it has become common to list the dakotas alphabetically and thus north dakota is usually listed as the 39th statecitation needed unrest among wheat farmers especially among norwegian immigrants led to a populist political movement centered in the non partisan league npl around the time of world war i during which it ran candidates on the republican ticket yet merging into the democratic party after world war ii it tried to insulate north dakota from the power of outofstate banks and corporations in addition to founding the stateowned bank of north dakota and north dakota mill and elevator both still in existence the npl established a stateowned railroad line later sold to the soo line railroad anticorporate laws virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland these laws still in force today after having been upheld by state and federal courts make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland as even after foreclosure the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company3031 furthermore the bank of north dakota having powers similar to a federal reserve branch bank exercised its power to limit the issuance of subprime mortgages and their collateralization in the form of derivative instruments and so prevented a collapse of housing prices within the state in the wake of 2008s financial crisis32 the original north dakota state capitol in bismarck burned to the ground on december 28 1930 it was replaced by a limestonefaced art deco skyscraper that still stands today33 a round of federal investment and construction projects began in the 1950s including the garrison dam and the minot and grand forks air force bases34 there was a boom in oil exploration in western north dakota in the late 1970s and early 1980s as rising petroleum prices made development profitable35 this boom came to an end after petroleum prices declined35 in recent years the state has had a strong economy with unemployment lower than the national average and strong job and population growth67 much of the growth has been based on development of the bakken oil fields in the western part of the state5 estimates as to the remaining amount of oil vary with some estimating over 100 years worth of oil remaining in the area36 demographicsedit

century north dakota along with most of the midwest experienced a mass influx of newcomers from both the eastern united states and immigrants from europe north dakota was a known popular destination for immigrant farmers and general laborers and their families mostly from norway sweden germany and the united kingdom much of this settlement gravitated throughout the western side of the red river valley as was similarly seen in south dakota and in a parallel manner in minnesota this area is well known for its fertile lands by the outbreak of the first world war this was among north americas richest farming regions but a period of higher rainfall ended and many migrants werent successful in the arid conditions many family plots were too small to farm successfully from the 1930s until the end of the 20th century north dakotas population gradually declined interrupted by a couple of brief increases young adults with university degrees were particularly likely to leave the statecitation needed with the advancing process of mechanization of agricultural practices and environmental conditions requiring larger landholdings for successful agriculture subsistence farming proved to be too risky for families many people moved to urban areas for jobs47 since the late 20th century one of the major causes of migration from north dakota is the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates expansion of economic development programs has been urged to create skilled and hightech jobs but the effectiveness of such programs has been open to debate48 during the first decade of the 21st century the population increased in large part because of jobs in the oil industry related to development of shaleoil fields49 elsewhere the native american population has increased as some reservations have attracted people back from urban areas immigration north dakota is one of the top resettlement locations for refugees proportionally according to the us office of refugee resettlement in 2013–2014 more than 68 refugees per 100000 north dakotans were settled in the state50 in fiscal year 2014 582 refugees settled in the state51 fargo mayor mahoney said north dakota
