born in pennsylvania on march 24 1855 his name is listed on the 1860 census as william a mellon his father was thomas mellon a banker and judge who was a scotsirish immigrant from county tyrone ireland his mother was sarah jane negley mellon he had three older brothers thomas a james r and samuel and he also had a younger brother named richard b mellon he was educated at the western university of pennsylvania now the university of pittsburgh and left before graduating1 business careeredit mellon demonstrated financial ability early in 1872 his father set him up in a lumber and coal business which he soon turned into a profitable enterprise he joined his fathers banking firm t mellon sons in 1880 and two years later had ownership of the bank transferred to him in 1889 mellon helped organize the union trust company and union savings bank of pittsburgh he also branched into industrial activities oil steel shipbuilding and construction areas where mellons backing created giant enterprises included aluminum industrial abrasives carborundum and coke mellon financed charles martin hall whose refinery grew into the aluminum company of america alcoa he became the partner of edward goodrich acheson in manufacturing silicon carbide a revolutionary abrasive in the carborundum company he created an entire industry through his help to heinrich koppers inventor of coke ovens which transformed industrial waste into usable products such as coalgas coaltar and sulfur he also became an early investor in the new york shipbuilding corporation2 mellon was one of the wealthiest people in the united states the thirdhighest incometax payer in the mid1920s behind john d rockefeller and henry ford1 while he served as secretary of the us treasury department his wealth peaked at around 300–400 million in 1929–1930 mellon was a member of the south fork fishing and hunting club whose earthen dam failed in may 1889 causing the johnstown flood and he belonged to the duquesne club in pittsburgh along with his closest friends henry clay frick and philander knox also south fork fishing and hunting club members mellon served as a director of the pittsburgh national bank of commerce3 old overholt whiskeyedit mellon also was onethird owner with frick and one charles w mauck in the old overholt whiskey distillery in west overton pennsylvania4 at the time old overholt was one of the largest and most respected whiskey producers in the country5 in 1907 as prohibition became more popular across the country frick and mellon removed their names from the distilling license although they retained ownership in the company5 it is believed that mellons connections in the treasury department are what allowed the company to secure a medicinal permit during prohibition5 this permit allowed overholt to sell existing whiskey stocks to druggists for medicinal use5 when frick died in december 1919 he left his share to mellon5 in 1925 under pressure from prohibitionists mellon sold his share of the company to a new york grocer5 political careeredit secretary of the treasuryedit andrew mellon was appointed secretary of the treasury by new president warren g harding in 1921 he served for 10 years and 11 months the thirdlongest tenure of a secretary of the treasury his service continued through the coolidge and hoover administrations along with secretary of agriculture james wilson and secretary of labor james j davis he is one of only three cabinet members to serve in the same post under three consecutive presidents harding in his inaugural address on march 4 1921 called for a prompt and thorough revision of the tax system an emergency tariff act readjustment of war taxes and creation of a federal budget system these were policies mellon wholeheartedly subscribed to and his long experience as a banker qualified him to set about implementing these programs immediately as a conservative republican and a financier mellon was irritated by the manner in which the governments budget was maintained with expenses due now and rising rapidly with the failure of income or revenues to keep pace with those expense increases and with the lack of savings in 1926 mellon was involved in drafting the mellonberenger agreement to set the amount of french debts to the united states arising from loans during world war i and define the repayment schedule the agreement was named after him and the french ambassador henry bérenger who signed the agreement in april 1926 subject to ratification by the french parliament the agreement greatly reduced the amount owing but was felt to be as much as the french would be able to pay6 mellon was a key negotiator on germanys war debt even traveling to paris in the summer of 1931 to conduct talks on it he responded to fears that germany might strike out against its debt plight with everything will work out all right7 mellon planedit portrait photograph of aw mellon 1924 mellon came into office with a goal of reducing the huge federal debt from world war i to do this he needed to increase federal receipts and decrease federal spending he believed that if the tax rates were too high people would try to avoid paying them mellon also believed that by reducing taxes the federal government could actually increase receipts an idea he termed scientific taxation he observed that as tax rates had increased during the first part of the 20th century investors moved to avoid the highest rates by choosing taxfree municipal bonds for instance as mellon wrote in 19248 the history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid the high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business if the rates were set more reasonably taxpayers would have less incentive to avoid paying his theory was that by lowering the tax rates across the board he could increase the overall tax revenue this is similar to the laffer curve andrew mellons plan had four main points cut the top income tax rate from 77 to 24 percent – predicting that large fortunes would be put back into the economy cut taxes on low incomes from 4 to 12 percent – tax policy must lessen so far as possible the burden of taxation on those least able to bear it reduce the federal estate tax – large income taxes tempted the wealthy to shift their fortunes into taxexempt shelters efficiency in government – lower tax rates meant few tax returns to process by few government workers cutting the actual size of paper bills to fit into wallets saved expenses in paper and ink mellon believed that the income tax should remain progressive but with lower rates than those enacted during world war i he thought that the top income earners would willingly pay their taxes only if rates were 25 or lower mellon proposed tax rate cuts which congress enacted in the revenue acts of 1921 1924 and 1926 the top marginal tax rate was cut from 73 to 58 in 1922 50 in 1923 46 in 1924 25 in 1925 and 24 in 1929 rates in lower brackets were also cut substantially relieving burdens on the middleclass workingclass and poor households by 1926 65 of the income tax revenue came from incomes 300000 and higher when five years prior less than 20 diddubious – discuss during this same period the overall tax burden on those that earned less than 10000 dropped from 155 million to 325 million9 mellon also championed preferential treatment for earned income relative to unearned income as he argued in his 1924 book taxation the peoples business10 the fairness of taxing more lightly incomes from wages salaries and professional services than the incomes from business or from investments is beyond question in the first case the income is uncertain and limited in duration sickness or death destroys it and old age diminishes it in the other the source of the income continues the income may be disposed of during a mans life and it descends to his heirs surely we can afford to make a distinction between the people whose only capital is their mental and physical energy and the people whose income is derived from investments such a distinction would mean much to millions of american workers and would be an added inspiration to the man who must provide a competence during his few productive years to care for himself and his family when his earning capacity is at an end11 mellons policies helped reduce the overall public debt the national debt skyrocketed from 15 billion in 1916 to 24 billion in 1919 because of world war i obligations from 33 billion in 1919 to about 16 billion in 192912 but then the depression caused it to rise again because of reduced revenue and increasing spending the top tax rate went to 80 by 1935 and the federal government increased excise taxes in an attempt to make up for the lost revenue9 mellons tax plan also had social ramifications on society and the cultural development of the american people the tax reforms exemplified the transition from a 19thcentury rural society to the industrial capitalist power the country had become into the 1920s populists and rebellious republicans representing constituencies from the south west and midwest all opposed mellons tax reforms because they were resistant to trend toward an urban society13 since the tax system is a legal system bound by the law the economic ramifications of its implementation transformed societys interaction and contribution to the overall economy mellons tax plan replaced the united states main source of revenue from national tariffs and general state property taxes to a progressive income tax system combined with a probig business dominant political ideology and the reformation of the federal governments revenue stream mellons tax cut on the wealthy and big corporations encouraged greater investment by wealthy individuals and big companies13 he believed the tax cuts effectiveness on encouraging investment spending was more beneficial to the economy than placing a higher tax burden on the rich as mellon had postulated reducing tax rates on the wealthy class encouraged wealthy individuals to invest more into projects that contributed to the infrastructural development of cities and neighborhoods within in new york city during the 1920s the social ramifications were realized as many neighborhoods sprang up and were settled by people of different ethnicities and income that has given the city the cultural diversity for which it is known today14 great depressionedit mellon on us stamp mellon became unpopular with the onset of the great depression herbert hoover in memoirs published decades later wrote that mellon advised him as president to liquidate labor liquidate stocks liquidate farmers liquidate real estate it will purge the rottenness out of the system high costs of living and high living will come down people will work harder live a more moral life values will be adjusted and enterprising people will pick up from less competent people hoover claimed credit for disregarding this advice and intervening in the market though with little success15 there is no corroboration that mellon ever said such a thing however and the claim that he did is inconsistent with his published speeches which supported antirecessionary measures by the federal reserve as treasury secretary mellon was an exofficio member of the federal reserve board there he successfully urged the fed to cut its discount rate after the stock market crash in october 1929 and supported subsequent rate cuts although only a third of the commercial banks were a part of the federal reserve and could benefit from the rate cuts16 in november 1929 he recommended a cut of 1 percentage point in personal and corporate income tax rates he supported hoovers proposal to increase federal construction spending as an antirecession measure1 in 1929–31 mellon spent much of the time overseas negotiating for repayment of european war debts from world war i in 1928 mellon issued a denial to allegations made by a speaker for the democratic party in north carolina that he held an interest in a liquor distillery and that he was the largest distiller in the world prior to prohibition in a letter written to the republican executive committee of mecklenburg county north carolina mellon admits having stock in a distillery but that he had disposed of all interest in the company prior to becoming secretary of the treasury17 impeachment proceedingsedit in january 1932 25000 jobless men from pennsylvania coxs army marched to washington to petition congress and hoover to start a job program hoover fearing communist agitation ordered an investigation the investigation discovered that while the march was not financed by mellon he did write a personal check so that 276 participants in the march could return to pittsburgh this action may have undermined hoovers faith in his treasury secretary and coupled with the impeachment hearing below led to mellons resignation18 in january 1932 rep wright patman dtx later an fdr new deal supporter and others introduced articles of impeachment against mellon19 with hearings before the house judiciary committee at the end of that month20 after the hearings were over but before the scheduled vote on whether to report the articles to the full house mellon accepted an appointment to the post of ambassador to the court of st james and resigned as treasury secretary in february he served for one year as ambassador and then retired to private life representative louis thomas mcfadden rpa invoked mellons appointment while an impeachment was pending in his subsequent attempt to impeach president hooverclarification needed personal lifeedit in 1900 mellon then 45 years old married nora mary mcmullen 1879–1973 a 20yearold englishwoman who was the daughter of alexander p mcmullen21 a major shareholder of the guinness brewing co they had two children ailsa born in 1901 and paul born in 1907 their marriage ended in a bitter divorce in 1912 which was granted on grounds of nora mellons desertion and her adultery with capt george alfred curphey an english soldier and other men21 mellon did not remarry in 1923 his former wife married harvey arthur lee a britishborn antiques dealer 14 years her junior22 two years after the lees

established a memorial for his father the mellon institute of industrial research as a department of the university of pittsburgh in 1965 the institute merged with the carnegie institute of technology to form carnegie mellon university mellon also served as an alumni president24 and trustee25 of the university of pittsburgh and made several major donations to the school including the land on which the cathedral of learning and heinz chapel were constructed26 in total it is estimated that mellon donated over 43 million to the university of pittsburgh27 during world war i he participated in many fundraising activities such as the american red cross the national war council of the ymca the executive committee of the pennsylvania state council of national defense and the national research council of washington during his retirement years as he had done in earlier years mellon was an active philanthropist and gave generously of his private fortune to support art and research causes28 in 1937 he donated his substantial art collection collected at a cost of 25 million and valued at 40 million plus 10 million for construction29 to establish the national gallery of art on the national mall in washington dc the gallery was authorized in 1937 by congress the mellon tax trialedit the administration of president franklin d roosevelt subjected mellon to intense investigation of his personal income tax returns the us justice department empaneled a grand jury which declined to issue an indictment roosevelt hated mellon as the embodiment of everything he thought was bad about the 1920s mellon vehemently denied the charges a twoyear civil action beginning in 1935 dubbed the mellon tax trial eventually exonerated mellon albeit several months after his death deathedit mellon died
