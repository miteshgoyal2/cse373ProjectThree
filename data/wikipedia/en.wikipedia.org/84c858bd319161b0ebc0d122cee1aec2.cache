the playstation 3 video game console its compatibility was later expanded to its successor the playstation 4 in 2013 and its playstation vr platform in 2016 conceptually similar to nintendos wii remote and microsofts kinect its function is based around controller input in games stemming from the actual physical movement of the player the move uses inertial sensors in the wand to detect motion while the wands position is tracked using a playstation eye or playstation camera the device was generally wellreceived by critics but has not quite met sonys goals for integration into the market

footnotes 8 references 9 external links hardwareedit as with the standard playstation 3 wireless controllers sixaxis dualshock 3 both the main playstation move motion controller and the playstation move navigation controller use bluetooth 20 and an internal lithiumion battery5 charged via a usb minib port on the controller6 on the playstation 3 up to four move controllers can be used at once7 four move motion controllers8 or two move motion controllers and two move navigation controllers9 motion controlleredit the primary component of playstation move the playstation move motion controller is a wand controller which allows the user to interact with the console through motion and position in front of a playstation camera1 it functions similarly to the wii remote the playstation move features a variety of internal sensors to gauge orientation the playstation move motion controller features an orb at the head which can glow in any of a full range of colors using rgb lightemitting diodes leds10 based on the colors in the user environment captured by the camera the system dynamically selects an orb color that can be distinguished from the rest of the scene the colored light serves as an active marker the position of which can be tracked along the image plane by the camera1112 the uniform spherical shape and known size of the light also allows the system to simply determine the controllers distance from the camera through the lights image size thus enabling the controllers position to be tracked in three dimensions1213 with high precision and accuracyfn 1 the simple spherebased distance calculation allows the controller to operate with minimal processing latency16 as opposed to other camerabased control techniques on the playstation 317fn 2 a pair of inertial sensors inside the controller a threeaxis linear accelerometer and a threeaxis angular rate sensor are used to track rotation as well as overall motion1114 an internal magnetometer is also used for calibrating the controllers orientation against the earths magnetic field to help correct against cumulative error drift by the inertial sensors18 in addition an internal temperature sensor is used to adjust the inertial sensor readings against temperature effects19 the inertial sensors can be used for dead reckoning in cases which the camera tracking is insufficient such as when the controller is obscured behind the players back10 the controller face features a large oblong primary button move20 surrounded by small action buttons and with a regularsized ps button beneath arranged in a similar configuration as on the bluray disc remote control on the left and right side of the controller is a select and start button respectively on the underside is an analog trigger t10 on the tail end of the controller is the wrist strap usb port and extension port21 the motion controller features vibrationbased haptic technology10 in addition to providing a tracking reference the controllers orb light can be used to provide visual feedback10 simulating aesthetic effects such as the muzzle flash of a gun or the paint on a brush22 using different orb colors for each controller10 up to four motion controllers can be tracked at once on the playstation 322 demonstrations for the controller have featured activities using a single motion controller as well as those in which the user wields two motion controllers with one in each hand1123 to minimize the cost of entry sony stated that all launch titles for playstation move would be playableneeds update with one motion controller with enhanced options available for multiple motion controllers24 on the playstation 3 image processing for playstation move is performed in the consoles cell microprocessor16 according to sony use of the motiontracking library entails some synergistic processing unit spu overhead as well an impact on memory though the company states that the effects will be minimized25 according to move motion controller codesigner anton mikhailov the library uses 12 megabytes of system memory16 navigation controlleredit playstation move navigation controller the playstation move navigation controller is a onehanded supplementary controller designed for use in conjunction with the playstation move motion controller for certain types of gameplay similar to nintendo wii nunchuk replicating the major functionality of the left side of a standard playstation 3 gamepad the playstation move navigation controller features a left analog stick with l3 button function a dpad l1 button and l2 analog trigger6 the navigation controller also features and action buttons as well as a ps button since all controls correspond to those of a standard playstation 3 gamepad a sixaxis or dualshock 3 controller can be used in place of the navigation controller in playstation move applications18 accessoriesedit a number of additional accessories have also been released for use in conjunction with the playstation move controllers the playstation move charging station is a charging base unit designed to charge two playstation move controllers including any combination of motion controllers or navigation controllers26 the playstation move shooting attachment is an accessory for the playstation move motion controller that adapts the motion controller into a handgun form the motion controller is fitted into the gun barrel so that the motion controllers t trigger is interlocked with the trigger on the gun attachment26 while leaving all the topmost buttons accessible through a hole in the top similar to the wii zapper additionally the playstation move sharp shooter attachment is an accessory for the playstation move motion controller that adapts both the motion controller and navigation controller into a submachine gun form which features an adjustable shoulder support27 the motion controller is fitted into the gun barrel so that the motion controllers t trigger is interlocked with the trigger and the navigation controller is clipped into a holder below this gun barrel however the accessory adds several extra buttons and controls via the ext connector on the base of the move motion controller these extra buttons include and buttons on both sides located near the t and m buttons rl button located under the guns magazine and pumpaction mechanism located under the barrel which both can be used to reload or alternately may serve another function depending on future game design 3setting firing rate control mbutton lock and secondary m button located below the trigger for easy access the peripheral is officially supported by killzone 3 dead space extraction socom 4 us navy seals and resistance 3282930 the playstation move racing wheel utilises the motion tracking capabilities of the move controller to steer vehicles in video games and also features vibration feedback paddlestyle gear shifters and twist throttle controls it supports games like littlebigplanet karting gran turismo 5 need for speed hot pursuit burnout paradise and motorstorm apocalypse313233 bundle packagesedit in addition to selling the controllers individually sony also provides several different bundle options for playstation move hardware such as softwarecamera bundles with a playstation eye a move motion controller and motioncontrol enabled software console bundles which include a ps3 console dualshock 3 controller playstation eye and move motion controller and bundles with a move motion controller with select games34 though the games with the bundles vary in each region most bundles come with the playstation move demo disc which contains demos for eleven different games the bundles in europe and oceania however come with the playstation move

sports champions start the party and kung fu rider40 historyedit the playstation eye is used in conjunction with the move to track movement playstation move stems from early work on the eyetoy41 a webcambased controller for the playstation 2 conceived in 1999 and released in 2003 early in the eyetoys inception developers experimented with colorbased 3d wand tracking42 including prototypes using spheresfn 3 by the time it was released the eyetoys focus was on handsfree applications with the emergence of affordable inertial sensors and the success of the wii remote motion controller wand44 in 2008 sony began work on productizing its own motion controller wand revisiting the spheretracking concept for use with the playstation eye integrating inertial sensors and refining the device from an engineering and a design perspective14 the moves internal development codename was the ycon so called because three groups the hardware team in scei in japan the software engineering team at scea and sonys worldwide studios worked together to develop the hardware with the three points of a y indicating the three teams coming together this was the start of a new form of development at sony where hardware had previously been developed separately from software teams and later delivered along with technical documentation for software teams to get to grips with themselves this move was continued with the development of the playstation vita and playstation 445 the motion controller was revealed at sonys e3 2009 press conference on 2 june 2009 with a live demonstration using an engineering prototype46 tentatively referred to as the playstation motion controller the device was originally stated to be available in q1q2 2010 as of august 2009 the controller features and design had not been finalized24 soon after revealing the motion controller to developers sony indicated that it was exploring the possibility of using the motion controller in combination with a standard playstation 3 gamepad such as having the player use the motion controller as a sword and use dualshock 3 as a shield25fn 4 one combination control scheme was demonstrated in september 2009 at the tokyo game show for biohazard 5 alternative edition making particular use of the dualshock 3s analog stick although users found the setup to work well some found holding a dualshock with one hand to be somewhat awkward4849 at the time sony was already rumored to be in the design phase of a supplementary controller akin to that of the nunchuk controller for the wii remote50 in january 2010 sony announced a revised release target stating instead that the motion controller would launch in q3q4 of 201051 on march 10 sony revealed the official name and logo at the game developers conference showcasing the final motion controller design and unveiling the playstation move navigation controller then referred to as the playstation move subcontroller52 to be launched concurrently with the motion controller18 the logo is a colored squigglelike shape representing a light trail from the sphere of a playstation move motion controller being waved53 newly revealed in the final motion controller was the inclusion of an internal magnetometer nameedit prior to the game developers conference 2010 the playstation move motion controller was known by several names initially given little guidance on what to call the device when it was unveiled in june 2009 many in the video game press informally referred to the controller as the magic wand or simply wand due to the controllers wand design and glowing orb545556575859 sony had used the term playstation motion controller from the motion controllers introduction23 but many perceived it to be used merely as a description sony gradually clarified motion controller as the tentative name60 but by this time media attention had shifted to rumored final names in september 2009 statements in two unconnected interviews at the tokyo game show led to speculation that the controller may be referred to by developers as the sphere6162 in december a brief reference to the motion controller as gem by electronic arts ceo john riccitiello during a media industry conference presentation63 prompted an admission by sony that gem was an early code name for the controller64 in january 2010 video game blog vg247 reported that sony had named its ps3 motion control platform arc65 the name was observed to liken the controllers glowing orb to the charged sphere of a tesla coil or a plasma globe electrode66 the report was supported by evidence emerging in the following weeks including a registration of the playstationarccom domain name to sce dated october 2009 shortly after the tokyo game show67 and numerous references to arc by president brian farrell of video game publisher thq during the companys february earnings conference call68 responding to speculation that farrells statements effectively confirmed the name69 scea senior director of corporate communications patrick seybold stated that they did not and that farrell was referring to arc as a rumored code name70 on march 1 it was reported that sony submitted japanese trademark application filing for playstation arc71 a week later on march 8 sony was reportedly considering a hasty renaming due to a trademark held by competitor microsoft for its arcbrand pc accessories which could present trademark conflicts72 on march 9 sony submitted a european trademark filing for playstation move73 which was announced as the official name the next day at sonys press conference at the game developers conference18 video gaming blog joystiq reports several anonymous sony sources claiming that the playstation move logo presented at the conference resembles a letter a because it is the same design for when the name was playstation arc in which the a would stand for arc74 promotionedit as part of the promotional marketing for sorcery the playstation move controller was inducted into the magic circle museum by vice president scott penrose75 softwareedit main article list of playstation move games alongside sie worldwide studios and its secondparty partners a total of 36 thirdparty game development companies had confirmed that they would support the playstation move by the time the finalized controller was announced in march 201018 on the box art of playstation move games underneath the playstation 3 logo banner a blue bar with white letters indicates when a game supports the playstation move when a game can only be played with the playstation move the box art carries a playstation move required label when a game supports traditional sixaxisdualshock 3 controls and playstation move controls it carries a playstation move features or playstation move compatible label76 receptionedit critical receptionedit the playstation move has been generally well received game informer gave it an 8 out of 10 saying the playstation eye and motion controller are a killer combination for accurate and highly responsive motionbased gameplay and we applaud sony for getting the hardware right the first time77 kotaku praised its accuracy design use of augmented reality and said that the playstation move is a intuitive natural feeling way to play games and it brings with it not only a sense of increased immersion to already graphically immersive games but a new way to play with your reality and a refreshing form of colorful feedback78 ign gave the move an 85 out of 10 noting that the launch lineup of games for the controller was insufficient though it summarized by saying at the end of the day the playstation move has the potential to be the best motion control system on the current crop of consoles79 joystiq praised the move saying the hardwares great and i can see it being used in a multitude of really cool ways but of course its only as cool as the games that use it and that the launch lineup was not worth the purchase though it believed that the move would be worth the purchase in early 2011 due to a stronger lineup of games such as socom 4 us navy seals and killzone 380 cvg gave the move an extremely positive review and awarded it 9 out of 10 saying that sonys motion control gets beyond being a gimmick we found ourselves constantly itching for one more go81 the guardian strongly criticized the moves launch lineup though it noted that the hardware was strong and that after playing with the move it was very hard to go back to the relative inaccuracy of the wii82 the playstation move won the 2010 popular science award for the most immersive game controller83 salesedit in october 2010 the playstation move had shipped around 15 million units in europe and 1 million units in north america during its first month of release84 figures that sony felt were selling extremely well at the time85 on 30 november 2010 it was announced that 41 million units had been shipped worldwide in the first two months since its release86 by june 2011 at e3 2011 sony announced that the playstation move had sold 88 million units87 by november 2012 this figure had grown to 15 million4 in march 2012 fergal gara of sony uk spoke to official playstation magazine uk to acknowledge that the device had not lived up to their expectations in either their target audience or the software support that had been provided for it88 see alsoedit wonderbook razer hydra footnotesedit according to the move motion controllers designers the spheres position along the cameras image plane can be resolved at a really subpixel level14 translating to a spatial xyaxis precision to the nearest millimeter1015 the motion controllers distance from the camera zaxis can be resolved with a precision of a few centimeters10 according to scee senior designer for playstation move software mark d green the response time for the motion control system is 22 milliseconds15 the coloredsphere based 3d wand tracking technology was publicly demonstrated as early as 20004143 and 200113 the wireless controller for playstation 3 has some inertial sensing capabilities through the standard sixaxis feature sony had also submitted several patent applications describing techniques in which the port indicator lights of a wireless controller could be used as markers for tracking the controllers position and orientation with the
