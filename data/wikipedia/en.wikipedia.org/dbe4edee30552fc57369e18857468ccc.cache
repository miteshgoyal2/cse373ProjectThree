railroadedit in 1836 the georgia general assembly voted to build the western and atlantic railroad in order to provide a link between the port of savannah and the midwest29 the initial route was to run southward from chattanooga to a terminus east of the chattahoochee river which would then be linked to savannah after engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus the zero milepost was driven into the ground in what is now five points a year later the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement first known as terminus and later as thrasherville after a local merchant who built homes and a general store in the area30 by 1842 the town had six buildings and 30 residents and was renamed marthasville to honor the governors daughter later j edgar thomson chief engineer of the georgia railroad suggested the town be renamed atlanticapacifica which was shortened to atlanta31 the residents approved and the town was incorporated as atlanta on december 29

policies38 metropolitan areas growthedit atlanta played a vital role in the allied effort during world war ii due to the citys warrelated manufacturing companies railroad network and military bases leading to rapid population and economic growth in the 1950s the citys newly constructed highway system allowed middle class atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs as a result the city began to make up an eversmaller proportion of the metropolitan areas population31 civil rights movementedit during the 1960s atlanta was a major organizing center of the civil rights movement with dr martin luther king jr ralph david abernathy and students from atlantas historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movements leadership while minimal compared to other cities atlanta was not free of racial strife39 in 1961 the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by erecting road barriers in cascade heights countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster atlanta as the city too busy to hate3940 desegregation of the public sphere came in stages with public transportation desegregated by 195941 the restaurant at richs department store by 196142 movie theaters by 196343 and public schools by 197344 the olympic flag waves at the 1996 games in 1960 whites comprised 617 of the citys population45 by 1970 african americans were a majority of the citys population and exercised newfound political influence by electing atlantas first black mayor maynard jackson in 1973 under mayor jacksons tenure atlantas airport was modernized solidifying the citys role as a transportation center the opening of the georgia world congress center in 1976 heralded atlantas rise as a convention city46 construction of the citys subway system began in 1975 with rail

site for the 1996 summer olympic games following the announcement the city government undertook several major construction projects to improve atlantas parks sporting venues and transportation infrastructure while the games themselves were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies as well as the centennial olympic park bombing49 the spectacle was a watershed event in atlantas history that initiated a fundamental transformation of the city in the decade that followed48 recent historyedit during the 2000s atlanta underwent a profound physical cultural and demographic transformation suburbanization a booming economy and new migrants decreased the citys black percentage from a high of 67 in 1990 to 54 in 201050 from 2000 to 2010 atlanta gained 22763 white residents 5142 asian residents and 3095 hispanic residents while the citys black population decreased by 316785152 much of the citys demographic change during the decade was driven by young collegeeducated professionals

and west side of the divide flows into the gulf of mexico62 atlanta sits atop a ridge south of the chattahoochee river which is part of the acf river basin located at the far northwestern edge of the

also list of tallest buildings in atlanta the downtown skyline the midtown skyline the buckhead skyline most of atlanta was burned during the civil war depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture yet architecturally the city had never been particularly southern—because atlanta originated as a railroad town rather than a patrician southern seaport like savannah or charleston many of the citys landmarks could have easily been erected in the northeast or midwest21 the skyline of midtown viewed from piedmont park emerged with the construction of modernist colony square in 1972 during the cold war era atlanta embraced global modernist trends especially regarding commercial and institutional architecture examples of modernist architecture include the 1196240 square feet 111134 m264 westin peachtree plaza 1976 georgiapacific tower 1982 the state of georgia building 1966 and the atlanta marriott marquis 1985 in the latter half of the 1980s atlanta became one of the early adopters of postmodern designs that reintroduced classical elements to the cityscape many of atlantas tallest skyscrapers were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s with most displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns such as the 1187676 square feet 1103387 m265 one atlantic center 1987 191 peachtree tower 1991 and the four seasons hotel atlanta 1992 also

states the bank of america plaza is the tallest building outside of new york city and chicago and was the last building built in the united states to be in the top 10 tallest buildings in the world until one world trade center was completed externally in may 201366 the citys embrace of modern architecture translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks including the equitable building 1892–1971 terminal station 1905–1972 and the carnegie library 1902–1977 the fox theatre 1929—atlantas cultural icon—would have met the same fate had it not been for a grassroots effort to save it in the mid1970s21 atlanta is divided into 242 officially defined neighborhoods676869 the city contains three major

architecturallydistinct residential streets include the victorian inman park bohemian east atlanta and eclectic old fourth ward2175 on the westside and along the beltline on the eastside former warehouses and factories have been converted into housing retail space and art galleries transforming the onceindustrial areas such as west midtown into model neighborhoods for smart growth historic rehabilitation and infill construction76 in southwest atlanta neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar suburbs including the historic west end while those farther from downtown retain a postwar suburban layout including collier heights and cascade heights home to much of the citys affluent african american population777879 northwest atlanta contains the areas of the city to west of marietta boulevard and to the north of martin luther king jr drive including those neighborhoods remote to downtown such as riverside bolton and whittier mill which is one of atlantas designated landmark historical neighborhoods vine city though technically northwest adjoins the citys downtown area and has recently been the target of community outreach programs and economic development initiatives80 gentrification of the citys neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary atlanta the gentrification of atlanta has its origins in the 1970s after many of atlantas neighborhoods had undergone the urban decay that affected other major american cities in the mid20th century when neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two freeways from being built through citys the east side in 1975 the area became the starting point for atlantas gentrification after atlanta was awarded the olympic games in 1990 gentrification expanded into other parts of the city stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games gentrification was aided by the atlanta housing authoritys eradication of the citys public housing81 climateedit atlantas piedmont park in winter under the köppen classification atlanta has a humid subtropical climate cfa with four distinct seasons and generous precipitation
