background and early transit proposalsedit public transit service within seattle began in 1884 with the introduction of the citys first horsedrawn streetcar line by the end of the decade the system had been replaced with a network of electric streetcars and cable cars which spurred the development of new streetcar suburbs across modernday seattle23 interurban railways to everett tacoma and the rainier valley were established after the turn of the century giving the region an intercity passenger rail system to feed the streetcar lines4 by the late 1920s however the completion of us route 99 and the increasing popularity of automobile travel forced the interurban system to shut down by 1941 the streetcars had been acquired by the municipal government and replaced with a trolleybus network35 various proposals for a rapid transit system in seattle to replace the streetcar—and later bus—networks were published in the 20th century and rejected by city officials or voters due to their cost or other factors in 1911 urban planner virgil bogue proposed a 41mile 66 km system of subway tunnels and elevated railways as the centerpiece to a comprehensive plan for the city which was rejected by voters6 the seattle center monorail originally built for the 1962 worlds fair has been the subject of several unsuccessful expansion proposals backed by governor albert rosellini in the 1960s and seattle voters in the early 2000s7 the forward thrust committee of the late 1960s proposed a 47mile 76 km rapid transit system to be funded with assistance from the federal government and connect downtown seattle to ballard the university district lake city capitol hill bellevue and renton the rapid transit initiative was presented to voters in 1968 failing to receive the necessary supermajority to pass and in 1970 failing again due to a local economic downturn8 light rail planningedit following the failed forward thrust initiatives metro transit was created in 1972 to oversee a countywide bus network and plan for a future rail system9 in the early 1980s metro transit and the puget sound council of governments pscog explored light rail and busway concepts to serve the region10 ultimately choosing to build a downtown bus tunnel that would be convertible to light rail in the future11 the pscog formally endorsed a light rail plan in 1986 recommending a system be built by 2020 and include a line between seattle and seatac airport1213 an 1988 advisory measure on light rail planning was passed in king county encouraging metro transit to accelerate the plans timeline to open by 200014 in 1990 the state legislature endorsed the creation of a regional transit board composed of politicians from king pierce and snohomish counties with the goal of implementing the regional transit plan15 the central puget sound regional transit authority later renamed sound transit was created in 1993 to write and present a regional transit plan for voter approval16 the agency proposed a 70mile 110 km light rail network as the centerpiece of a 67 billion transit ballot measure with a surface line through the rainier valley and tunnels between downtown seattle capitol hill and the university district1718 the ballot measure failed to pass on march 14 199519 and the light rail line was truncated to 25 miles 40 km between the university district and seatac airport20 the smaller 39 billion proposal was approved by voters on november 5 1996 along with increases to sales taxes and motor vehicle excise taxes across the regional transit district2021 sound transit considered several routing options during a series of public hearings and studies early into the environmental impact study for the project22 which adopted the name central link23 in 1999 sound transit selected the alignment for the light rail project consisting of a line between the university district and seatac airport with surface segments passing through tukwila the rainier valley and sodo and tunnels under beacon hill first hill capitol hill and portage bay24 budget issues and delaysedit the central link project was originally planned to open in 2006 and cost 19 billion but the estimates were found to be unrealistic by auditors in november 2000 a revised plan with an opening date pushed back three years to 2009 and costing 38 billion was presented by new executives hired by sound transit to replace previous program directors2526 additionally planning of the portage bay tunnel between capitol hill and the university district was suspended due to higher than expected contractor bids attributed to difficult soil conditions27 the revised budget and schedule were adopted by sound transit in january 2001 including provisions to restudy routing options between downtown seattle and the university district along with a 500 million federal grant agreement to fund the construction of an initial segment28 the initial segment identified and approved by sound transit later that year shortened the line to 14 miles 23 km between downtown seattle and a southern tukwila station near seatac airport the remaining routes to the airport and university district were sent back to the planning stage and reorganized into separate light rail projects2930 in november 2001 sound transit approved construction of the shortened central link light rail project calling for a summer 2002 groundbreaking31 property acquisition in the rainier valley began in march 200232 but the groundbreaking was delayed by two legal battles a lawsuit filed by light rail opponents alleging that sound transit lacked the authority to shorten a voterapproved line was ruled in favor of sound transit by the king county superior court in november 200233 the approval of tim eymans initiative 776 threatened to repeal motor vehicle excise taxes needed to fund sound transits budget but was declared unconstitutional in february 200334 an additional routing change requested by the city of tukwila placing light rail tracks along freeways in lieu of international boulevard was approved by sound transit and the federal transit administration in 2002 moving the project closer to construction35 construction and testingedit the headhouse of beacon hill station seen under construction in may 2009 sound transit received its 500 million federal grant agreement in october 200336 and a groundbreaking ceremony was held in sodo on november 8 200337 construction contracts for various segments were awarded in 2004 and 2005 coming six percent under sound transits estimates38 and work began along all parts of the system3940 the first rails were installed on august 18 2005 in the sodo area38 a month later the downtown transit tunnel closed for a twoyear renovation to accommodate light rail service41 excavation of the beacon hill tunnel and station began in 2005 and a tunnel boring machine was launched in early 2006 to bore the twin tunnels between sodo and the rainier valley42 the sodo and stadium stations were completed in may 200643 and light rail testing in the sodo area began the following march44 testing was extended to the reopened downtown transit tunnel in september 2007 initially limited to weekends without bus service45 and further extended to the rainier valley after the completion of the beacon hill tunnel in 20084647 the elevated guideway in tukwila including crossings of major freeways and the duwamish river was completed in 2007 after the installation of 2457 precast concrete segments and balanced cantilever bridges48 during construction in the rainier valley sound transit and the city of seattle offered 50 million in mitigation funds and development opportunities to affected businesses49 construction of light rail along martin luther king jr way south also resulted in utility lines moved underground improved sidewalks street crossings and landscaping50 opening and later extensionsedit central link was opened on july 18 2009 with a community celebration that attracted more than 92000 riders over the first weekend of free service51 trains began operating on 139mile 224 km segment between westlake and tukwila international boulevard stations52 along with a bus shuttle to serve seatac airport from tukwila53 the 17mile 27 km extension to seatacairport station opened on december 19 2009 replacing the shuttle and other bus services to the airport54 sound transit added lubrication equipment and rubber mats to segments in tukwila and the rainier valley in 2010 to reduce noise levels of up to 83 decibels surpassing federal safety standards and triggering noise complaints from nearby residents55 a contract dispute with the rainier valley construction contractor was settled in 2011 bringing the projects total price to 117 million below the 244 billion budget56 the opening of light rail service to the rainier valley spurred new transitoriented development which had initially stalled during the great recession but recovered in the mid 2010s5758 central link train service was increased to a frequency of six minutes during peak hours from 75 minutes in 2015 to prepare for the opening of the university link extension59 the line was extended north to university of washington station via capitol hill station on march 19 2016 via a 18 billion 315mile 507 km tunnel60 the extension opened six months ahead of its scheduled date and the opening celebrations drew 67000 people during the first day of service additional threecar light rail trains were deployed by sound transit to cope with higher ridership after the extension opened61 the line was extended 16 miles 26 km south from seatac airport to angle lake station on september 24 2016 including the opening of a 1120stall park and
