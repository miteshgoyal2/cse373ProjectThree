were given to white americans but denied to native americans african americans asian americans and hispanic and latino americans european americans particularly the affluent white anglosaxon protestants were granted exclusive privileges in matters of education immigration voting rights citizenship land acquisition and criminal procedure over periods of time extending from the 17th century to the 1960s however nonprotestant immigrants from europe particularly irish people poles and italians suffered xenophobic exclusion and other forms of ethnicitybased discrimination in american society were vilified as racially inferior and were not considered fully white in addition middle eastern american groups like jews and arabs have faced continuous discrimination in the united states and as a result some people belonging to these groups do not identify as white east and south asians have similarly faced racism in america major racially and ethnically structured institutions included slavery segregation the american indian wars native american reservations native american boarding schools immigration and naturalization law and internment camps1 formal racial discrimination was largely banned in the mid20th century and came to be perceived as socially unacceptable andor morally repugnant as well racial politics remains a major phenomenon and racism continues to be reflected in socioeconomic inequality23 racial stratification continues to occur in employment housing education lending and government in the view of the us human rights network a network of scores of us civil rights and human rights organizations discrimination in the united states permeates all aspects of life and extends to all communities of color4 while the nature of the views held by average americans have changed much over the past several decades surveys by organizations such as abc news have found that even recently large sections of americans selfadmit to holding discriminatory viewpoints for example a 2007 article by the organization stated that about one in ten admitted to holding prejudices against hispanic and latino americans and about one in four did so

trade reproduction of a handbill advertising a slave auction in charleston south carolina in 1769 while the existence of slavery is arguably the root of subsequent conceptualizations of africanamericans the origins of african enslavement have a large economic foundation among the european elite who structured national policy throughout the age of the atlantic system of trade there existed a popular ideology called mercantilism or the belief that policy pursuits were centralized around military power and economic wealth colonies were sources of mineral wealth and crops to be used to the home countrys advantage6 using europeans for labor proved unsustainably expensive as well as harmful to the supply of labor in the home countries however african slaves were available in large numbers at prices that made plantation agriculture in the americas profitable7 it is also argued that along with the economic motives underlying slavery in the americas european world schemas played a large role in the enslavement of africans according to this view the european ingroup for humane behavior included the subcontinent while african and american indian cultures had a more localized definition of an insider while neither schema has inherent superiority the technological advantage of europeans became a resource to disseminate the conviction that underscored their schemas that noneuropeans could be enslaved with the capability to spread their schematic representation of the world europeans could impose a social contract morally permitting three centuries of african slavery while the disintegration of this social contract by the eighteenth century led to abolitionism it is argued that the removal of barriers to insider status is a very slow process uncompleted even today 20158 as a result of the above the atlantic slave trade prospered according to estimates in the transatlantic slave trade database between 1626 and 1860 more than 470000 slaves were forcibly transported from africa to what is now the united states910 prior to the civil war eight serving presidents owned slaves a practice protected by the us constitution11 providing wealth for the white elite approximately one southern family in four held slaves prior to the civil war according to the 1860 us census there were about 385000 slaveowners out of a white population in the slave states of approximately 7 million1213 steps toward abolition of slavery scars of a whipped slave april 2 1863 baton rouge louisiana in the early part of the 19th century a variety of organizations were established advocating the movement of black people from the united states to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom some endorsed colonization while others advocated emigration during the 1820s and 1830s the american colonization society acs was the primary vehicle for proposals to return black americans to greater freedom and equality in africa14 and in 1821 the acs established the colony of liberia assisting thousands of former africanamerican slaves and free black people with legislated limits to move there from the united states the colonization effort resulted from a mixture of motives with its founder henry clay stating unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country it was desirable therefore as it respected them and the residue of the population of the country to drain them off15 advertisement by a slave trader offering various amounts for slaves in lexington kentucky 1853 although in 1820 the atlantic slave trade was equated with piracy punishable by death16 the practice of chattel slavery existed for the next half century the domestic slave trade was a major economic activity in the us which lasted until the 1860s17 enslaved family members would be split up never to see each other again17 between 1830 and 1840 nearly 250000 slaves were taken across state lines17 in the 1850s more than 193000 were transported and historians estimate nearly one million in total took part in the forced migration17 ashleys sack is a cloth that recounts a slave sale separating a mother and her daughter the sack belonged to a nineyearold girl ashley which was a parting gift from her mother rose after ashley had been sold rose filled the sack with a dress braid of her hair pecans and my love always the historian ira berlin called this forced migration of slaves the second middle passage because it reproduced many of the same horrors as the middle passage the name given to the transportation of slaves from africa to north america these sales of slaves broke up many families with berlin writing that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved the massive deportation traumatized black people18 individuals lost their connection to families and clans added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes many ethnic africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in africa most were descended from families who had been in the us for many generations17 slaves waiting for sale richmond virginia 1853 all slaves in only the areas of the confederate states of america that were not under direct control of the united states government were declared free by the emancipation proclamation which was issued on january 1 1863 by president abraham lincoln19 while personally opposed to slavery lincoln believed that the constitution did not give congress the power to end slavery stating in his first inaugural address that he had no objection to this being made express and irrevocable via the corwin amendment20 on social and political rights for blacks lincoln stated i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people i as much as any man am in favor of the superior position assigned to the white race21 the emancipation proclamation did not apply to areas loyal to or controlled by the union slavery was not actually abolished in the us until the passage of the 13th amendment which was declared ratified on december 6 186522 about four million black slaves were freed in 1865 ninetyfive percent of blacks lived in the south comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the north consequently fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the south than in the north23 based on 1860 census figures 8 of males aged 13 to 43 died in the civil war including 6 in the north and 18 in the south24 reconstruction era to world war ii main articles nadir of american race relations and mass racial violence in the united states reconstruction era the mobstyle lynching of will james cairo illinois 1909 a crowd of ten thousand watched the lynching25 after the civil war the 13th amendment in 1865 formally abolishing slavery was ratified furthermore congress passed the civil rights act of 1866 which broadened a range of civil rights to all persons born in the united states despite this the emergence of black codes sanctioned acts of subjugation against blacks continued to bar africanamericans from due civil rights the naturalization act of 1790 limited us citizenship to whites only and in 1868 the effort toward civil rights was underscored with the 14th amendment which granted citizenship to blacks26 the civil rights act of 1875 followed which was eliminated in a decision that undermined federal power to thwart private racial discrimination27 nonetheless the last of the reconstruction era amendments the 15th amendment promised voting rights to africanamerican men previously only white men of property could vote and these cumulative federal efforts africanamericans began taking advantage of enfranchisement africanamericans began voting seeking office positions utilizing public education yet by the end of reconstruction in the mid 1870s violent white supremacists came to power via paramilitary groups such as the red shirts and the white league and imposed jim crow laws that deprived africanamericans of voting rights and instituted systemic discriminatory policies through policies of unequal racial segregation28 segregation which began with slavery continued with jim crow laws with signs used to show blacks where they could legally walk talk drink rest or eat29 for those places that were racially mixed nonwhites had to wait until all white customers were dealt with29 segregated facilities extended from white only schools to white only graveyards30 postreconstruction era during the 1921 tulsa race riot thousands of whites rampaged through the black community killing men and women burning and looting stores and homes up to 300 blacks were killed31 the new century saw a hardening of institutionalized racism and legal discrimination against citizens of african descent in the united states throughout this post civil war period racial stratification was informally and systemically enforced in order to solidify the preexisting social order although technically able to vote poll taxes pervasive acts of terror such as lynching in the united states often perpetrated by groups such as the reborn ku klux klan founded in the reconstruction south and discriminatory laws such as grandfather clauses kept black americans and many poor whites disenfranchised particularly in the south furthermore discrimination extended to state legislation that allocated vastly unequal financial support for black and white schools in addition to this county officials sometimes redistributed resources earmarked for blacks to white schools further undermining educational opportunities32 in response to de jure racism protest and lobbyist groups emerged most notably the naacp national association for the advancement of colored people in 190933 this time period is sometimes referred to as the nadir of american race relations because racism segregation racial discrimination and expressions of white supremacy all increased so did antiblack violence including race riots such as the atlanta race riot of 1906 and the tulsa race riot of 1921 the atlanta riot was characterized by the french newspaper le petit journal as a racial massacre of negroes34 the charleston news and courier wrote in response to the atlanta riots separation of the races is the only radical solution of the negro problem in this country there is nothing new about it it was the almighty who established the bounds of the habitation of the races the negroes were brought here by compulsion they should be induced to leave here by persuasion35 the great migration a group of white men pose for a 1919 photograph as they stand over the black victim will brown who had been lynched and had his body mutilated and burned during the omaha race riot of 1919 in omaha nebraska photographs and postcards of lynchings were popular souvenirs in the us36 in addition racism which had been viewed primarily as a problem in the southern states burst onto the national consciousness following the great migration the relocation of millions of african americans from their roots in the southern states to the industrial centers of the north after world war i particularly in cities such as boston chicago and new york city harlem within chicago for example between 1910 and 1970 the percentage of africanamericans leapt from 20 percent to 327 percent37 the demographic patterns of black migrants and external economic conditions are largely studied stimulants regarding the great migration38 for example migrating blacks between 1910 and 1920 were more likely to be literate than blacks that remained in the south known economic push factors played a role in migration such as the emergence of a split labor market and agricultural distress from the boll weevil destruction of the cotton economy39 white tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the housing project erected this sign detroit 1942 southern migrants were often treated in accordance with preexisting racial stratification the rapid influx of blacks into the north disturbed the racial balance within cities exacerbating hostility between both black and white northerners stereotypic schemas of southern blacks were used to attribute issues in urban areas such as crime and disease to the presence of africanamericans overall africanamericans in northern cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life within employment economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the loweststatus and restrictive in potential mobility within the housing market stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx resulting in a mix of targeted violence restrictive covenants redlining and racial steering40 a white gang looking for blacks during the chicago race riot of 1919 throughout this period racial tensions exploded most violently in chicago and lynchings—mobdirected hangings usually racially motivated—increased dramatically in the 1920s urban riots—whites attacking blacks—became a northern problem41 many whites defended their space with violence intimidation or legal tactics toward african americans while many other whites migrated to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions a process known as white flight42 elected in 1912 president woodrow wilson ordered segregration throughout the federal government43 in world war i blacks served in the united states armed forces in segregated units black soldiers were often poorly trained and equipped and were often put on the frontlines in suicide missions the us military was still heavily segregated in world war ii the air force and the marines had no blacks enlisted in their ranks there were blacks in the navy seabees in addition no africanamerican would receive the medal of honor during the war and black soldiers had to sometimes give up their seats in trains to the nazi prisoners of war44 world war ii to civil rights era a black youth at a segregated drinking fountain in halifax north carolina in 1938 the jim crow laws were state and local laws enacted in the southern and border states of the united states and enforced between 1876 and 1965 they mandated separate but equal status for black americans in reality this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those provided to white americans the most important laws required that public schools public places and public transportation like trains and buses have separate facilities for whites and blacks statesponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court of the united states in 1954 in brown v board of education one of the first federal court cases to challenge segregation in schools was mendez v westminster in 1946 emmett till before and after the lynching on august 28 1955 he was a fourteenyearold boy in chicago who went to spend the summer together with his uncle moses wright in money mississippi and was massacred by white men for a whistle of appreciation to a white woman by the 1950s the civil rights movement was gaining momentum membership in the naacp increased in states across the us a 1955 lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of emmett till a 14yearold boy from chicago spending the summer with relatives in money mississippi till was killed for allegedly having wolfwhistled at a white woman till had been badly beaten one of his eyes was gouged out and he was shot in the head before being thrown into the tallahatchie river his body weighed down with a 70pound 32 kg cotton gin fan tied around his neck with barbed wire david jackson writes that mamie till emmetts mother brought him home to chicago and insisted on an open casket tens of thousands filed past tills remains but it was the publication of the searing funeral image in jet with a stoic mamie gazing at her murdered childs ravaged body that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of american racism45 news photographs circulated around the country and drew intense public reaction the visceral response to his mothers decision to have an opencasket funeral mobilized the black community throughout the us46 vann r newkirk wrote the trial of his killers became a pageant illuminating the tyranny of white supremacy46 the state of mississippi tried two defendants but they were speedily acquitted by an allwhite jury47 the little rock nine black students being escorted up the steps of the desegregated little rock central high school by the army after the arkansas national guard had prevented them from entering the ordeal of 15yearold elizabeth eckford was captured in a photo on the morning of september 4 1957 where she was followed and threatened by angry white protesters in response to heightening discrimination and violence nonviolent acts of protest began to occur for example in february 1960 in greensboro north carolina four young africanamerican college students entered a woolworth store and sat down at the counter but were refused service the men had learned about nonviolent protest in college and continued to sit peacefully as whites tormented them at the counter pouring ketchup on their heads and burning them with cigarettes after this many sitins took place in order to nonviolently protest against racism and inequality sitins continued throughout the south and spread to other areas eventually after many sitins and other nonviolent protests including marches and boycotts places began to agree to desegregate48 due to threats and violence against her us marshals escorted 6yearold ruby bridges to and from the previously whites only william frantz elementary school in new orleans 1960 as soon as bridges entered the school white parents pulled their children out the 16th street baptist church bombing marked a turning point during the civil rights era on sunday september 15 1963 with a stack of dynamite hidden on an outside staircase ku klux

seat on the bus to a white person with the bombing occurring only a couple of weeks after martin luther king jrs march on washington for jobs and freedom it became an integral aspect of transformed perceptions of conditions for blacks in america it influenced the passage of the civil rights act of 1964 that banned discrimination in public accommodations employment and labor unions and voting rights act of 1965 which overruled remaining jim crow laws nonetheless neither had been implemented by the end of the 1960s as civil rights leaders continued to strive for political and social freedom

were sentenced to a year in prison in virginia for marrying each other51 their marriage violated the states antimiscegenation statute the racial integrity act of 1924 which prohibited marriage between

the us53 we cater to white trade only sign on a restaurant window in lancaster ohio in 1938 in 1964 martin luther king jr was arrested and spent a night in jail for attempting to eat at a whiteonly restaurant in st augustine florida segregation continued even after the demise of the jim crow laws data on house prices and attitudes toward integration from suggest that in the mid20th century segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods54 segregation also took the form of redlining the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services such as banking insurance access to jobs55 access to health care56 or even supermarkets57 to residents in certain often racially determined58 areas although in the us informal discrimination and segregation have always existed redlining began with the national housing act of 1934 which established the federal housing administration fha the practice was fought first through passage of the fair housing act of 1968 which prevents redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race religion gender familial status disability or ethnic origin and later through the community reinvestment act of 1977 which requires banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities59 although redlining is illegal some argue that it continues to exist in other forms up until the 1940s the full revenue potential of what was called the negro market was largely ignored by whiteowned manufacturers in the us with advertising focused on whites60 blacks were also denied commercial deals on his decision to take part in exhibition races against racehorses in order to earn money olympic champion jesse owens stated people say that it was degrading for an olympic champion to run against a horse but what was i supposed to do i had four gold medals but you cant eat four gold medals61 on the lack of opportunities owens added there was no television no big advertising no endorsements then not for a black man anyway62 in the reception to honor his olympic success owens was not permitted to enter through the main doors of the waldorf astoria new york and instead forced to travel up to the event in a freight elevator63 the first black academy award recipient hattie mcdaniel was not permitted to attend the premiere of gone with the wind with georgia being racially segregated and at the oscars ceremony in los angeles she was required to sit at a segregated table at the far wall of the room the hotel had a strict noblacks policy but allowed mcdaniel in as a favor64 present the emanuel african methodist episcopal church where nine blacks including the pastor were killed in the 2015 charleston church shooting the church had been rebuilt after one of the churchs cofounders denmark vesey was suspected of planning a slave rebellion in charleston in 1822 35 people including vesey were hanged and the church was burned down65 while substantial gains were made in the succeeding decades through middle class advancement and public employment black poverty and lack of education continued in the context of deindustrialization6667 despite gains made after the 16th street baptist church bombing some violence against black churches has also continued – 145 fires were set to churches around the south in the 1990s68 and a mass shooting in charleston was perpetrated in 2015 at the historic mother emanuel church69 from 1981 to 1997 the united states department of agriculture discriminated against tens of thousands of black american farmers denying loans that were provided to white farmers in similar circumstances the discrimination was the subject of the pigford v glickman lawsuit brought by members of the national black farmers association which resulted in two settlement agreements of 125 billion in 1999 and of 115 billion in 200970 during the 1980s and 90s a number of riots occurred that were related to longstanding racial tensions between police and minority communities the 1980 miami riots were catalyzed by the killing of an africanamerican motorist by four white miamidade police officers they were subsequently acquitted on charges of manslaughter and evidence tampering similarly the sixday 1992 los angeles riots erupted after the acquittal of four white lapd officers who had been filmed beating rodney king an africanamerican motorist khalil gibran muhammad the director of the harlembased schomburg center for research in black culture has identified more than 100 instances of mass racial violence in the united states since 1935 and has noted that almost every instance was precipitated by a police incident71 politically the winnertakeall structure that applies to 48 out of 50 states72 in the electoral college benefits white representation as no state has voters of color as the majority of the electorate73 this has been described as structural bias and often leads voters of colors to feel politically alienated and therefore not vote the lack of representation in congress has also led to lower voter turn out73 as of 2016 african americans only made up 87 of congress and latinos 774 many cite the united states presidential election 2008 as a step forward in race relations white americans played a role in electing barack obama the countrys first black president75 in fact obama received a greater percentage of the white vote 4376 than did the previous democratic candidate john kerry 4177 racial divisions persisted throughout the election wide margins of black voters gave obama an edge during the presidential primary where 8 out of 10 africanamericans voted for him in the primaries and an msnbc poll found that race was a key factor in whether a candidate was perceived as being ready for office in south carolina for instancewhites were far likelier to name clinton than obama as being most qualified to be commander in chief likeliest to unite the country and most apt to capture the white house in november blacks named obama over clinton by even stronger margins—two and threeto one—in all three areas78 with the election of 2016 being a pivotal point in the discussion of race relations president donald trump has insinuated that much of the discourse and violence surrounding race relations in the united states has been prompted by increasingly vocal black activist groups such as black lives matter as reported by cnn79 sociologist russ long stated in 2013 that there is now a more subtle racism that associates a specific race with a specific characteristic80 in a 1993 study conducted by katz and braly it was presented that blacks and whites hold a variety of stereotypes towards each other often negative81 the katz and braley study also found that africanamericans and whites view the traits that they identify each other with as threatening interracial communication between the two is likely to be hesitant reserved and concealing81 interracial communication is guided by stereotypes stereotypes are transferred into personality and character traits which lead to have an effect on communication multiple factors go into how stereotypes are established such as age and the setting in which they are being applied81 for example in a study done by the entmanrojecki index of race and media in 2014 89 of black women in movies are shown swearing and acting in offensive behavior while only 17 of white women are portrayed in this manner82 in 2014 followed the shooting of michael brown ferguson unrest toked place asian americans a world war ii antijapanese propaganda poster utilizing the jap slur and depicting the japanese as rats after they conquered parts of alaska the naturalization act of 1790 made asians ineligible for citizenship with citizenship limited to whites only83 asian americans including those of east asian southeast asian and south asian descent have experienced racism since the first major groups of chinese immigrants arrived in america firstgeneration immigrants children of immigrants and asians adopted by nonasian families have all been impacted84 a political cartoon from 1882 ridiculing the chinese exclusion act showing a chinese man surrounded by benefits of chinese immigration being barred entry to the golden gate of liberty while other groups including communists and hoodlums are allowed to enter the caption reads sarcastically we must draw the line somewhere you know in the 19th century america was undergoing rapid industrialization leading to labor shortages in the mining and rail industries chinese immigrant labor was often used to fill this gap most notably with the construction of the first transcontinental railroad leading to largescale chinese immigration84 these chinese immigrants were despised because they took the jobs of whites for cheaper pay and the phrase yellow peril which predicted the demise of western civilization as a result of chinese immigrants gained popularity85 this discrimination apexed with the 1882 chinese exclusion act which banned chinese immigration to the united states this was the first time that a law was passed to exclude a major group from the nation that was based on ethnicity and class84 local discriminatory laws were also enacted to stifle chinese business and job opportunities for example in the 1886 supreme court case of yick wo v hopkins a san francisco city ordinance requiring permits for laundries which were mostly chineseowned was struck down as it was clear the law solely targeted chinese americans when the law was in effect the city issued permits to virtually all nonchinese permit applicants while only granting one permit out of two hundred applications from chinese laundry owners when the chinese laundries continued to operate the city tried to fine the owners in 1913 california home to many chinese immigrants enacted an alien land law which significantly restricted land ownership by asian immigrants and extended it in 1920 ultimately banning virtually all land ownership by asians86 in 1907 japanese immigrants which were unaffected by the exclusion act began to enter the united states filling labor shortages that were once filled by chinese workers this influx also led to discrimination and was stymied when president theodore roosevelt restricted japanese immigration later japanese immigration was closed when japan entered into the gentlemens agreement of 1907 to stop issuing passports to japanese workers intending to move to the us87 during world war ii the republic of china was an ally of the united states and the federal government praised the resistance of the chinese against japan in the second sinojapanese war attempting to reduce antichinese sentiment in 1943 the magnuson act was passed by congress repealing the chinese exclusion act and reopening chinese immigration however at the time the united states was actively fighting the empire of japan which was a member of the axis powers antijapanese racism which spiked after the attack on pearl harbor was tacitly encouraged by the government which used slurs such as jap in propaganda posters and even interned japanese americans citing possible security threats soldiers in the pacific theater seem often dehumanized their enemy leading to american mutilation of japanese war dead88 the racist nature of this dehumanization is apparent in the inconsistency of the treatment of corpses in the pacific and the european theaters apparently some soldiers mailed home japanese skulls as souvenirs while none mailed home german or italian skulls89 this prejudice continued for some time after the war and asian racism affected us policy in the korean and vietnam wars even though asians were on both sides of those wars as well as world war ii some historians have alleged that a climate of racism with unofficial rules like the mere gook rule9091 allowed for a pattern in which south vietnamese civilians were treated as less than human and war crimes became common92 prior to 1965 indian immigration to the us was small and isolated with fewer than fifty thousand indian immigrants in the country the bellingham riots in bellingham washington on september 5 1907 epitomized the low tolerance in the us for indians and hindus while antiasian racism was embedded in us politics and culture in the early 20th century indians were also racialized for their anticolonialism with us officials casting them as a hindu menace pushing for western imperial expansion abroad93 in the 1923 case united states v bhagat singh thind the supreme court ruled that high caste hindus were not white persons and were therefore racially ineligible for naturalized citizenship94 the court argued that the racial difference between indians and whites was so great that the great body of our people would reject assimilation with indians94 it was after the luce–celler act of 1946 that a quota of 100 indians per year could immigrate to the us and become citizens95 the immigration and nationality act of 1965 dramatically opened entry to the us to immigrants other than traditional northern european and germanic groups and as a result would significantly and unintentionally alter the demographic mix in the us96 on the us immigration laws prior to 1965 sociologist stephen klineberg states the law declared that northern europeans are a superior subspecies of the white race96 in 1990 asian immigration was encouraged when nonimmigrant temporary working visas were given to help with the shortage of skilled labor within the united states84 in modern times asians have been perceived as a model minority they are seen as more educated and successful and are stereotyped as intelligent and hardworking but socially inept97 asians may experience expectations of natural intelligence and excellence from whites as well as other minorities8698 this has led to discrimination in the workplace as asian americans may face unreasonable expectations because of the model minority stereotype in 2000 out of 1218 adult asian americans 92 percent of those who experienced personal discrimination believed that the unfair treatment was due to their ethnicity97 asian american stereotypes can also obstruct career paths because asians are seen as better skilled in engineering computing and mathematics they are often encouraged to pursue technical careers they are also discouraged from pursuing nontechnical occupations or executive occupations requiring more social interaction since asians are expected to have poor social skills in the 2000 study forty percent of those surveyed who experienced discrimination believed that they had lost hiring or promotion opportunities in 2007 the equal employment opportunity commission reported that asians make up 10 percent of professional jobs while 37 percent of them held executive senior level or manager positions97 other forms of discrimination include racial profiling and hate crimes research shows that discrimination has led to more use of informal mental health services by asian americans99 asian americans who feel discriminated against also tend to smoke more100 nonanglo europeans see also anticatholicism antigerman sentiment antiirish sentiment antiitalianism antipolish sentiment and antirussian sentiment various european american immigrant groups have been subject to discrimination either on the basis of their immigrant status known as nativism or on the basis of their ethnicities country of origin philadelphia nativist riots new york times 1854 ad reading no irish need apply in the 19th century this was particularly true of antiirish prejudice which was partly anticatholic sentiment partly antiirish as an ethnicity this was especially true for irish catholics who immigrated to the us in the mid19th century the large number of irish both catholic and protestant who settled in america in the 18th century had largely but not entirely escaped such discrimination and eventually blended into the american white population during the 1830s in the us riots for control of job sites broke out in rural areas among rival labour teams from different parts of ireland and between irish and local american work teams competing for construction jobs101 the native american party commonly called the know nothing movement was a political party whose membership was limited to protestant men that operated on a national basis during the mid1850s and sought to limit the influence of irish catholics and other immigrants thus reflecting nativism and anticatholic sentiment there was widespread antiirish job discrimination in the united states and no irish need apply signs were common102103104 ku klux klan members march down pennsylvania avenue in washington dc in 1928 the second era klan was a large nationwide movement with between four to six million members the second era ku klux klan was a very large nationwide organization in the 1920s consisting of between four to six million members 15 of the nations eligible population that especially opposed catholics105 the revival of the klan was spurred by the release of the 1915 film the birth of a nation106 the second and third incarnations of the ku klux klan made frequent references to americas anglosaxon blood107 anticatholic sentiment which appeared in north america with the first pilgrim and puritan settlers in new england in the early 17th century remained evident in the us up to the presidential campaign of john f kennedy who went on to become the first catholic and first nonprotestant us president in 1961108 further information nordic race § nordicism in the united states the 20th century saw discrimination against immigrants from southern and eastern europe notably italian americans and polish americans partly from anticatholic sentiment as well as discrimination against irishamericans and partly from nordicism which considered all nongermanic immigrants as racially inferior “ biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend the nordics propagate themselves successfully with other races the outcome shows deterioration on both sides ” — future us president calvin coolidge 1921109 an advocate of the us immigration laws that favored northern europeans the klansman lothrop stoddard wrote primarily on the alleged dangers posed by colored peoples to white civilization with his most famous book the rising tide of color against white worldsupremacy in 1920 nordicism led to the reduction in southern european along with slavic eastern european and russian immigrants in the national origins formula of the emergency quota act of 1921 and the immigration act of 1924 whose goal was to maintain the status quo distribution of ethnicity by limiting immigration of nonnorthern europeans according to the us department of state the purpose of the act was to preserve the ideal of american homogeneity110 the racial term untermensch originates from the title of stoddards 1922 book the revolt against civilization the menace of the underman111 it was later adopted by the nazis and its chief racial theorist alfred rosenberg from that books german version der kulturumsturz die drohung des untermenschen 1925112 there was also discrimination against german americans and italian americans due to germany and italy being enemy countries during world war i germany and world war ii germany and italy this resulted in a sharp decrease in germanamerican ethnic identity and a sharp decrease in the use of german in the united states following world war i which had hitherto been significant and to german american internment and italian american internment during world war ii see also world war i antigerman sentiment beginning in world war i german americans were sometimes accused of having political allegiances to germany and thus not to the united states113 the justice department attempted to prepare a list of all german aliens counting approximately 480000 of them more than 4000 of whom were imprisoned in 1917–18 the allegations included spying for germany or endorsing the german war effort114 thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty115 the red cross barred individuals with german last names from joining in fear of sabotage one person was killed by a mob in collinsville illinois germanborn robert prager was dragged from jail as a suspected spy and lynched116 questions of german american loyalty increased due to events like the german bombing of black tom island117 and the us entering world war i many german americans were arrested for refusing allegiance to the us118 war hysteria led to the removal of german names in public names of things such as streets119 and businesses120 schools also began to eliminate or discourage the teaching of the german language121 years later during the second world war german americans were once again the victims of war hysteria discrimination following its entry into the second world war the us government interned at least 11000 american citizens of german ancestry the last to be released a germanamerican remained imprisoned until 1948 at ellis island122 three and a half years after the cessation of hostilities against germany specific racism against other europeanamerican ethnicities significantly diminished as a political issue in the 1930s being replaced by a biracialism of blackwhite as described and predicted by lothrop stoddard due to numerous causes the national origins formula significantly reduced inflows of nonnordic ethnicities the great migration of africanamericans out of the south displaced antiwhite immigrant racism with antiblack racism42 antiziganism see also antiziganism the roma population in america has blended moreorless seamlessly into the rest of societycitation needed in the us the term gypsy has come to be associated with a trade profession or lifestyle more than with the romani ethnicracial groupcitation needed some americans especially those selfemployed in the fortunetelling and psychic reading business123 use the term gypsy to describe themselves or their enterprise despite having no ties to the roma people this can be chalked up to misperception and ignorance regarding the term rather than any bigotry or even antiziganism124dubious – discuss hispanic and latino americans americans of latin american ancestry often categorized as hispanic come from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds latinos are not all distinguishable as a racial minority after the mexican–american war 1846–1848 the us annexed much of the current southwestern region from mexico mexicans residing in that territory found themselves subject to discrimination it is estimated that at least 597 mexicans were lynched between 1848 and 1928 this is a conservative estimate due to lack of records in many reported lynchings mexicans were lynched at a rate of 274 per 100000 of population between 1880 and 1930 this statistic is second only to that of the african american community during the same period which suffered an average of 371 per 100000 of population125 between 1848 and 1879 mexicans were lynched at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100000 of population126 hispanic protest against california immigration policy todos somos ilegales – we are all illegals also the land we stand on every inch of it stolen during the great depression the us government sponsored a mexican repatriation program which was intended to encourage mexican immigrants to voluntarily return to mexico however many were forcibly removed against their will in total up to one million persons of mexican ancestry were deported approximately 60 percent of those individuals were actually us citizens the zoot suit riots were vivid incidents of racial violence against latinos eg mexicanamericans in los angeles in 1943 naval servicemen stationed in a latino neighborhood conflicted with youth in the dense neighborhood frequent confrontations between small groups and individuals had intensified into several days of nonstop rioting large mobs of servicemen would enter civilian quarters looking to attack mexican american youths some of whom were wearing zoot suits a distinctive exaggerated fashion popular among that group127 the disturbances continued unchecked and even assisted by the local police for several days before base commanders declared downtown los angeles and mexican american neighborhoods offlimits to servicemen128 many public institutions businesses and homeowners associations had official policies to exclude mexican americans school children of mexican american descent were subject to racial segregation in the public school system in many counties mexican americans were excluded from serving as jurors in court cases especially in those that involved a mexican american defendant in many areas across the southwest they lived in separate residential areas due to laws and real estate company policies129130131132 during the 1960s mexican american youth formed the chicano civil rights movement jewish americans main article antisemitism in the united states antisemitism has also played a role in the united states during the late 19th and early 20th centuries hundreds of thousands of ethnic jews were escaping the pogroms in europe they boarded boats from ports on the baltic sea and in northern germany and largely arrived at ellis island new york133 it is suggested by leo rosten in his book the joys of yiddish that as soon as they left the boat they were subject to racism from the port immigration authorities the derogatory term kike was adopted when referring to jews because they often could not write so they may have signed their immigration papers with circles – or kikel in yiddish134 efforts were also made by the asiatic exclusion league to bar jewish immigrants along with other middle eastern ethnic groups like arabs assyrians and armenians from naturalization but they along with assyrians and armenians were nevertheless granted us citizenship despite being classified as asian135 from the 1910s the southern jewish communities were attacked by the ku klux klan who objected to jewish immigration and often used the jewish banker in their propaganda in 1915 leo frank was lynched in georgia after being convicted of rape and sentenced to death his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment136 this event was a catalyst in the reformation of the new ku klux klan137 the events in nazi germany also attracted attention from the united states jewish lobbying for intervention in europe drew opposition from the isolationists amongst whom was father charles coughlin a well known radio priest who was known to be critical of jews believing that they were leading the united states into the war138 he preached in weekly overtly antisemitic sermons and from 1936 began publication of a newspaper social justice in which he printed antisemitic accusations such as the protocols of the elders of zion139 a number of jewish organizations christian organizations muslim organizations and academics consider the nation of islam to be antisemitic specifically they claim that the nation of islam has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the holocaust and exaggerates the role of jews in the african slave trade140 the antidefamation league adl alleged that the nois health minister dr abdul alim muhammad accused jewish doctors of injecting blacks with the aids virus141 an allegation that muhammad and the washington post have refuted142 although jews are often perceived as white in the american mainstream the relationship of jews to whiteness remains complex with some preferring not to identify as white143144145146 prominent activist and rabbi michael lerner argues in a 1993 village voice article that in america to be white means to be the beneficiary of the past 500 years of european exploration and exploitation of the rest of the world and that jews can only be deemed white if there is massive amnesia on the part of nonjews about the monumental history of antisemitism146 africanamerican activist cornel west in an interview with the united states holocaust memorial museum has explained even if some jews do believe that theyre white i think that theyve been duped i think that antisemitism has proven itself to be a powerful force in nearly every post of western civilization where christianity has a presence and so even as a christian i say continually to my jewish brothers and sisters dont believe the hype about your full scale assimilation and integration into the mainstream it only takes an event or two for a certain kind of antijewish antisemitic sensibility to surface in places that you would be surprised but im just thoroughly convinced that america is not the promised land for jewish brothers and sisters a lot of jewish brothers say no thats not true we finally  yeah—they said that in alexandria you said that in weimar germany147 new antisemitism main article new antisemitism in recent years some scholars have advanced the concept of new antisemitism coming simultaneously from the far left the far right and radical islam which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a jewish homeland in the state of israel and argue that the language of antizionism and criticism of israel are used to attack jews more broadly in this view the proponents of the new concept believe that criticisms of israel and zionism are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind and attribute this to antisemitism148 yehuda bauer professor of holocaust studies at the hebrew university of jerusalem has argued that the concept of a new antisemitism is essentially false since it is in fact an alternative form of the old antisemitism of previous decades which he believes remains latent at times but recurs whenever it is triggered in his view the current trigger is the israeli situation if a compromise making ground in the arabisraeli peace process were achieved he believes that antisemitism would decline but not disappear noted critics of israel such as noam chomsky and norman finkelstein question the extent of new antisemitism in the united states chomsky has written in his work necessary illusions that the antidefamation league casts any question of proisraeli policy as antisemitism conflating and muddling issues as even zionists receive the allegation149 finkelstein has stated that supposed new antisemitism is a preposterous concept advanced by the adl to combat critics of israeli policy150 middle eastern and south asian americans see also antiarabism islamophobia in the united states and antiiranian sentiment an assyrian church vandalized in detroit 2007 assyrians although not arabs and mostly christians often face backlash in the us for their middle eastern background151 people of middle eastern and south asian descent historically occupied an ambiguous racial status in the united states middle eastern and south asian immigrants were among those who sued in the late 19th and early 20th century to determine whether they were white immigrants as required by naturalization law by 1923 courts had vindicated a commonknowledge standard concluding that scientific evidence including the notion of a caucasian race including middle easterners and many south asians was incoherent legal scholar john tehranian argues that in reality this was a performancebased standard relating to religious practices education intermarriage and a communitys role in the united states152 arab americans see also antiarabism in the united states racism against arab americans153 and racialized islamophobia against muslims has risen concomitantly with tensions between the american government and the islamic world154 following the september 11 2001 attacks in the united states discrimination and racialized violence has markedly increased against arab americans and many other religious and cultural groups155 scholars including sunaina maira and evelyn alsultany argue that in the postseptember 11 climate muslim americans have been racialized within american society although the markers of this racialization are cultural political and religious rather than phenotypic156157 arab americans in particular were most demonized which led to hatred towards middle easterners living in the united states and elsewhere in the western world158159 there have been attacks against arabs not only on the basis of their religion islam but also on the basis of their ethnicity numerous christian arabs have been attacked based on their appearances160 in addition other middle eastern peoples iranians assyrians armenians jews turks yezidis kurds etc who are mistaken for arabs because of perceived similarities in appearance have been collateral victims of antiarabism nonarab and nonmuslim middle eastern people as well as south asians of different ethnicreligious backgrounds hindus muslims and sikhs have been stereotyped as arabs the case of balbir singh sodhi a sikh who was murdered at a phoenix gas station by a white supremacist for looking like an arab terrorist because of the turban that is a requirement of sikhism as well as that of hindus being attacked for being muslims have achieved prominence and criticism following the september 11 attacks161162 those of middle eastern descent who are in the united states military sometimes face racism from fellow soldiers army spc zachari klawonn endured numerous instances of racism during his enlistment at fort hood texas during his basic training he was made to put cloth around his head and play the role of terrorist his fellow soldiers had to take him down to the ground and draw guns on him he was also called things such as raghead sand monkey and zachari bin laden163164 according to a 2004 study although official parameters encompass arabs as part of the white american racial category some arab americans from places other than the levant feel they are not white and are not perceived as white by american society165 iranian americans see also antiiranian sentiment a man holding a sign that reads deport all iranians and get the hell out of my country during a protest of the iran hostage crisis in washington dc in 1979 the november 1979 iranian hostage crisis of the us embassy in tehran precipitated a wave of antiiranian sentiment in the united states directed both against the new islamic regime and iranian nationals and immigrants even though such sentiments gradually declined after the release of the hostages at the start of 1981 they sometimes flare up in response some iranian immigrants to the us have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily on the basis of their ethnic or religious affiliations166 since the 1980s and especially since the 1990s it has been argued hollywoods depiction of iranians has gradually shown signs of vilifying iranians167 hollywood network productions such as 24168 john doe on wings of eagles 1986169 escape from iran the canadian caper 1981170 and jag almost regularly host persian speaking villains in their storyline native americans main article genocide of indigenous peoples members of the muscogee creek nation in oklahoma around 1877 notice the members with european and african ancestry the creek were originally from the alabama region native americans who have lived on the north american continent for at least 10000 years171 had an enormously complex impact on american history and racial relations during the colonial and independent periods a long series of conflicts were waged often with the objective of obtaining resources of native americans through wars forced displacement such as in the trail of tears and the imposition of treaties land was taken the loss of land often resulted in hardships for native americans in the early 18th century the english had enslaved nearly 800 choctaws172 after the creation of the united states the idea of indian removal gained momentum however some native americans chose or were allowed to remain and avoided removal whereafter they were subjected to official racism the choctaws in mississippi described their situation in 1849 we have had our habitations torn down and burned our fences destroyed cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged manacled fettered and otherwise personally abused until by such treatment some of our best men have died173 joseph b cobb who moved to mississippi from georgia described choctaws as having no nobility or virtue at all and in some respect he found blacks especially native africans more interesting and admirable the red mans superior in every way the choctaw and chickasaw the tribes he knew best were beneath contempt that is even worse than black slaves174 in the 1800s conflicts were spurred by ideologies such as manifest destiny which held that the united states was destined to expand from coast to coast on the north american continent in the years leading up to the indian removal act of 1830 there were many armed conflicts between settlers and native americans175 a justification for the policy of conquest and subjugation of the indigenous people emanated from the stereotyped perceptions of all native americans as merciless indian savages as described in the united states declaration of independence176 simon moyasmith culture editor at indian country today states any holiday that would refer to my people in such a repugnant racist manner is certainly not worth celebrating july fourth is a day we celebrate our resiliency our culture our languages our children and we mourn the millions – literally millions – of indigenous people who have died as a consequence of american imperialism177 in 1861 residents of mankato minnesota formed the knights of the forest with a goal of eliminating all indians from minnesota an egregious attempt occurred with the california gold rush the first two years of which saw the deaths of thousands of native americans under mexican rule in california indians were subjected to de facto enslavement under a system of peonage by the white elite while in 1850 california formally entered the union as a free state with respect to the issue of slavery the practice of indian indentured servitude was not outlawed by the california legislature until 1863178 the 1864 deportation of the navajos by the us government occurred when 8000 navajos were forced to an internment camp in bosque redondo179 where under armed guards more than 3500 navajo and mescalero apache men women and children died from starvation and disease179 the ghost dance ritual the natives believed the dance would reunite the living with spirits of the dead bring the spirits of the dead to fight on their behalf make the white invaders vanish and bring peace prosperity and unity to indian peoples throughout the region native american nations on the plains in the west continued armed conflicts with the us throughout the 19th century through what were called generally indian wars180 notable conflicts in this period include the dakota war great sioux war snake war and colorado war in the years leading up to the wounded knee massacre the us government had continued to seize lakota lands a ghost dance ritual on the northern lakota reservation at wounded knee south dakota led to the us armys attempt to subdue the lakota the dance was part of a religion founded by wovoka that told of the return of the messiah to relieve the suffering of native americans and promised that if they would live righteous lives and perform the ghost dance properly the european american invaders would vanish the bison would return and the living and the dead would be reunited in an edenic world181 on december 29 1890 at wounded knee gunfire erupted and us soldiers killed up to 300 indians mostly old men women and children182 mass grave for the dead lakota following the wounded knee massacre during the period surrounding the 1890 wounded knee massacre author l frank baum wrote two editorials about native americans five days after the killing of the lakota sioux holy man sitting bull baum wrote the proud spirit of the original owners of these vast prairies inherited through centuries of fierce and bloody wars for their possession lingered last in the bosom of sitting bull with his fall the nobility of the redskin is extinguished and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them the whites by the law of conquest by a justice of civilization are masters of the american continent and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining indians why not annihilation their glory has fled their spirit broken their manhood effaced better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are183 following the december 29 1890 massacre baum wrote the pioneer has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extermination sic of the indians having wronged them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth in this lies safety for our settlers and the soldiers who are under incompetent commands otherwise we may expect future years to be as full of trouble with the redskins as those have been in the past183184 military and civil resistance by native americans has been a constant feature of american history so too have a variety of debates around issues of sovereignty the upholding of treaty provisions and the civil rights of native americans under us law reservation marginalization see also native american reservations once their territories were incorporated into the united states surviving native americans were denied equality before the law and often treated as wards of the state185 many native americans were moved to reservations—constituting 4 of us territory in a number of cases treaties signed with native americans were violated tens of thousands of american indians and alaska natives were forced to attend a residential school system which sought to reeducate them in white settler american values culture and economy186187 the treatment of the native americans was admired by the nazis188 nazi expansion eastward was accompanied with invocation of americas colonial expansion westward under the banner of manifest destiny with the accompanying wars on the native americans189 in 1928 hitler praised americans for having gunned down the millions of redskins to a few hundred thousand and now kept the modest remnant under observation in a cage in the course of founding their continental empire190 on nazi germanys expansion eastward hitler stated “our mississippi the line beyond which thomas jefferson wanted all indians expelled must be the volga and not the niger189 further dispossession of various kinds continues into the present although these current dispossessions especially in terms of land rarely make major news headlines in the country eg the lenape peoples recent fiscal troubles and subsequent land grab by the state of new jersey and sometimes even fail to make it to headlines in the localities in which they occur through concessions for industries such as oil mining and timber and through division of land from the allotment act forward these concessions have raised problems of consent exploitation of low royalty rates environmental injustice and gross mismanagement of funds held in trust resulting in the loss of 10–40 billion191 the worldwatch institute notes that 317 reservations are threatened by environmental hazards while western shoshone land has been subjected to more than 1000 nuclear explosions192 assimilation further information native american boarding schools caricature showing uncle sam lecturing four children

uncle sam to his new class in civilization the government appointed agents like benjamin hawkins to live among the native americans and to teach them through example and instruction how to live like whites193 americas first president george washington formulated a policy to encourage the civilizing process194 the naturalization act of 1790 limited citizenship to whites only the indian citizenship act of 1924 granted us citizenship to all native americans prior to the passage of the act nearly twothirds of native americans were already us citizens195 the earliest recorded date of native americans becoming us citizens was in 1831 when the mississippi choctaw became citizens after the united states legislature ratified the treaty of dancing rabbit creek under article xiv of that treaty any choctaw who elected not to move to native american territory could become an american citizen when he registered and if he stayed on designated lands for five years after treaty ratification while formal equality has been legally recognized american indians alaska natives native hawaiians and pacific islanders remain among the most economically disadvantaged groups in the country and according to national mental health studies american indians as a group tend to suffer from high levels of alcoholism depression and suicide196 consequences developmental using the schedule of racist events sre an 18item selfreport inventory that assesses the frequency of racist discrimination hope landrine and elizabeth a klonoff found that racist discrimination is rampant in the lives of african americans and is strongly related to psychiatric symptoms197 a study on racist events in the lives of african american women found that lifetime experiences of racism were positively related to lifetime history of both physical disease and frequency of recent common colds these relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism the results suggest that racism can be detrimental to african americans well being198 the physiological stress caused by racism has been documented in studies by claude steele joshua aronson and steven spencer on what they term stereotype threat199 quite similarly another example of the psychosocial consequences of discrimination have been observed in a study sampling mexicanorigin participants in fresno california it was found that perceived discrimination is correlated with depressive symptoms especially for those less acculturated in the united states like mexican immigrants and migrants200 along the vein of somatic responses to discrimination kennedy et al found that both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality r 053 to 056 as well as with white mortality r 048 to 054 these data suggest that racism measured as an ecologic characteristic is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites201 some researchers also suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality thomas laveist 1989 1993 tested the hypothesis that segregation would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities analyzing 176 large and midsized cities laveist found support for the hypothesis since laveists studies segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of racial disparities in mortalitycitation needed studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female african americans are lower in areas with lower levels of residential segregation mortality for male and female whites was not associated in either direction with residential segregation202 researchers sharon a jackson roger t anderson norman j johnson and paul d sorlie found that after adjustment for family income mortality risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among blacks aged 25 to 44 years and nonblacks aged 45 to 64 years in most ageracegender groups the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation respectively these results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death203 rates of heart disease among african americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live fang et al 1998 stephanie a bond huie writes that neighborhoods affect health and mortality outcomes primarily in an indirect fashion through environmental factors such as smoking diet exercise stress and access to health insurance and medical providers204 moreover segregation strongly influences premature mortality in the us205 as early as 1866 the civil rights act provided a remedy for intentional race discrimination in employment by private employers and state and local public employers the civil rights act of 1871 applies to public employment or employment involving state action prohibiting deprivation of rights secured by the federal constitution or federal laws through action under color of law title vii is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers labor organizations training programs and employment agencies based on race or color religion gender and national origin title vii also prohibits retaliation against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute or for making a charge testifying assisting or participating in a proceeding under the statute the civil rights act of 1991 expanded the damages available in title vii cases and granted title vii plaintiffs the right to a jury trial title vii also provides that race and color discrimination against every race and color is prohibited societal schemas and stereotypes this racist postcard from the 1900s shows the casual

despite her strong stench media see also stereotypes of african americans stereotypes of east asians in the western world stereotypes of native americans and stereotypes of west and central asians in the united states popular culture songs theater for european american audiences in the 19th century created and perpetuated negative stereotypes of african americans one key symbol of racism against african americans was the use of blackface directly related to this was the institution of minstrelsy other stereotypes of african americans included the fat darkskinned mammy and the irrational hypersexual male buck in recent years increasing numbers of africanamerican activists have asserted that rap music videos commonly utilize scantily clothed africanamerican performers posing as thugs or pimps the naacp and the national congress of black women also have called for the reform of images on videos and on television julian bond said that in a segregated society people get their impressions of other groups from what they see in videos and what they hear in music206207208209 in 1899 uncle sam balances his new possessions which are depicted as savage children the figures are puerto rico hawaii cuba philippines and lad robes the mariana islands in a similar vein activists protested against the bet show hot ghetto mess which satirizes the culture of workingclass africanamericans the protests resulted in the change of the television show name to we got to do better206 it is understood that representations of minorities in the media have the ability to reinforce or change stereotypes for example in one study a collection of white subjects were primed by a comedy skit either showing a stereotypical or neutral portrayal of africanamerican characters participants were then required to read a vignette describing an incident of sexual violence with the alleged offender either white or black and assign a rating for perceived guilt for those shown the stereotypical africanamerican character there was a significantly higher guilt rating for black alleged offender in the subsequent vignette in comparison to the other conditions210 while schemas have an overt societal consequence the strong development of them have lasting effect on recipients overall it is found that strong ingroup attitudes are correlated with academic and economic success in a study analyzing the interaction of assimilation and racialethnic schemas for hispanic youth found that strong schematic identities for hispanic youth undermined academic achievement211 additional stereotypes attributed to minorities continue to influence societal interactions for example a 1993 harvard law review article states that asianamericans are commonly viewed as submissive as a combination of relative physical stature and western comparisons of cultural attitudes furthermore asianamericans are depicted as the model minority unfair competitors foreigners and indistinguishable these stereotypes can serve to dehumanize asianamericans and catalyze hostility and violence212 formal discrimination formal discrimination against minorities has been present throughout american history leland t saito associate professor of sociology and american studies ethnicity at the university of southern california writes political rights have been circumscribed by race class and gender since the founding of the united states when the right to vote was restricted to white men of property throughout the history of the united states race has been used by whites – a category that has also shifted through time – for legitimizing and creating difference and social economic and political exclusion213 within education a survey of black students in sixteen majority white universities found that four of five africanamericans reported some form of racial discrimination for example in february 1988 the university of michigan enforced a new anti discrimination code following the distribution of fliers saying blacks dont belong in classrooms they belong hanging from trees other forms of reported discrimination were refusal to sit next to black in lecture ignored input in class settings and informal segregation while the penalties are imposed the psychological consequences of formal discrimination can still manifest black students for example reported feelings of heightened isolation and suspicion furthermore studies have shown that academic performance is stunted for black students with these feelings as a result of their campus race interactions214 minorityminority racism main article interminority racism in the united states minority racism is sometimes considered controversial because of theories of power in society some theories of racism insist that racism can only exist in the context of social power to impose it upon others215 yet discrimination and racism between racially marginalized groups has been noted for example there has been ongoing violence between african american and mexican american gangs particularly in southern california216217218219 there have been reports of racially motivated attacks against mexican americans who have moved into neighborhoods occupied mostly by african americans and vice versa220221 according to gang experts and law enforcement agents a longstanding race war between the mexican mafia and the black guerilla family a rival african american prison gang has generated such intense racial hatred among mexican mafia leaders or shot callers that they have issued a green light on all blacks this amounts to a standing authorization for latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the mexican mafiadead link222 there have been several significant riots in california prisons where mexican american inmates and african americans have targeted each other particularly based on racial reasons223224 there has also been noted conflict between recent immigrant groups and their established ethnic counterparts within the united states rapid growth in african and caribbean immigrants has come into conflict with american blacks interaction and cooperation between black immigrants and american blacks are ironically debatable one can argue that racial discrimination and cooperation is not ordinarily based on color of skin but more on shared common cultural experiences and beliefs225226 furthermore conflict between chinese immigrants and japanese americans are known to have occurred in the san gabriel valley of the los angeles area in the 1980scitation needed interpersonal discrimination in a manner that defines interpersonal discrimination in the united states darryl brown of the virginia law review states that while our society has established a consensus against blatant intentional racism and in decades since brown v board of education has developed a sizeable set of legal remedies to address it our legal system ignores the possibility that race is structural or interstitial that it can be the root of injury even when not traceable to a specific intention or action227 interpersonal discrimination is defined by its subtlety unlike formal discrimination interpersonal discrimination is often not an overt or deliberate act of racism for example in an incident regarding a racial remark from a professor at virginia law a rift was created by conflicting definitions of racism for the students that defended the professors innocence racism was defined as an act of intentional maliciousness yet for african americans racism was broadened to a detrimental influence on the substantive dynamics of the classroom as an effect it is argued that the daily repetition of subtle racism and subordination in the classroom and on campus can ultimately be for african americans more productive of stress anxiety and alienation than even blatant racists acts moreover the attention to these acts of discrimination diverts energy from academics becoming a distraction that white students do not generally face227 institutional institutional racism is the theory that aspects of the structure pervasive attitudes and established institutions of society disadvantage some racial groups although not by an overtly discriminatory mechanism228 there are several factors that play into institutional racism including but not limited to accumulated wealthbenefits from racial groups that have benefited from past discrimination educational and occupational disadvantages faced by nonnative english speakers in the united states ingrained stereotypical images that still remain in the society eg black men are likely to be criminals229 in his article peter kaufman describes three instances in which institutional racism has contributed to current views of race230 these are the mis and missing education of race in which he describes problems the educational system has in discussing slavery race racism and topics such as white privilege he goes on to say that schools are still segregated based on class and race which also contributes to race relations230 residential racial segregation according to kaufman the reason that schools are still segregated is due to towns and cities being largely segregated still media monsters this describes the role in which the media has in the portrayal of race mass media tends to play on depictions of racialized stereotypes in the mass media which are ubiquitous and such caricaturized images shape our perceptions of various racial groups an example of this is the stereotyping of blacks as criminals230231 immigration see also immigration to the united states access to united states citizenship was restricted by race beginning with the naturalization act of 1790 which excluded nonwhites from citizenship26 institutionalized prejudice existed against white followers of roman catholicism who immigrated from countries such as ireland germany italy and france232 other efforts include the 1882 chinese exclusion act and the 1924 national origins act233234 the immigration act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the southern and eastern europeans who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s by limiting immigration of nonnorthern europeans according to the us department of state office of the historian the purpose of the 1924 act was to preserve the ideal of american homogeneity235 german praise for americas institutional racism previously found in hitlers mein kampf was continuous throughout the early 1930s and nazi lawyers were advocates of the use of american models236 us citizenship laws and antimiscegenation laws directly inspired the two principal nuremberg laws—the citizenship law and the blood law236 in conjunction with immigration reform in the late 1980s seen with the immigration reform and control act of 1986 there have been noted ircarelated discriminatory behavior toward hispanics within employment as the measure made it unlawful to hire without authorization to work in the united states avoidant treatment toward foreignappearing workers increased to bypass the required recordkeeping or risk of sanctions237 wealth see also wealth inequality in the united states massive racial differentials in account of wealth remain in the united states between whites and african americans the gap is a factor of twenty238 an analyst of the phenomenon thomas shapiro professor of law and social policy at brandeis university argues the wealth gap is not just a story of merit and achievement its also a story of the historical legacy of race in the united states239 differentials applied to the social security act which excluded agricultural workers a sector that then included most black workers rewards to military officers and the educational benefits offered returning soldiers after world war ii preexisting disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income subsidize mortgages and subsidize private sector developers240 health care main article race and health in the united states there are major racial differences in access to health care and in the quality of health care provided a study published in the american journal of public health estimated that over 886000 deaths could have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if african americans had received the same care as whites the key differences they cited were lack of insurance inadequate insurance poor service and reluctance to seek care241 a history of governmentsponsored experimentation such as the notorious tuskegee syphilis study has left a legacy of african american distrust of the medical system242 inequalities in health care may also reflect a systemic bias in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic groups a university of edinburgh professor of public health raj bhopal writes that the history of racism in science and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times and warns of dangers to avoid in the future243 a harvard professor of social epidemiology contended that much modern research supported the assumptions needed to justify racism racism she writes underlies unexplained inequities in health care including treatment for heart disease244 renal failure245 bladder cancer246 and pneumonia247 bhopal writes that these inequalities have been documented in various studies and that there are consistent findings that black americans receive less health care than white americans—particularly where this involves expensive new technology248 politics it is argued that racial coding of concepts like crime and welfare has been used to strategically influence public political views racial coding is implicit it incorporates racially primed language or imagery to allude to racial attitudes and thinking for example in the context of domestic policy it is argued that ronald reagan implied linkages between concepts like special interests and big government with illperceived minority groups in the 1980s using the conditioned negativity toward the minority groups to discredit certain policies and programs during campaigns in a study analyzing how political ads prime attitudes valentino compares the voting responses of participants after being exposed to narration of a george w bush advertisement paired with three different types of visuals with different embedded racial cues to create three conditions neutral race comparison and undeserving blacks for example as the narrator states democrats want to spend your tax dollars on wasteful government programs the video shows an image of a black woman and child in an office setting valentino found that the undeserving blacks condition produced the largest primed effect in racialized policies like opposition to affirmative action and welfare spending249 ian haneylópez professor of law at the university of california berkeley refers to this phenomenon as dogwhistle politics which has pushed he argues middle class white americans to vote against their economic selfinterest in order to punish undeserving minorities who they believe are receiving too much public assistance at their expense according to lópez conservative middleclass whites convinced that minorities are the enemy by powerful economic interests supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime but inadvertently they also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich such as slashing taxes for top income brackets giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets busting unions cutting pensions for future public employees reducing funding for public schools and retrenching the social welfare state he argues that these same voters cannot link rising inequality which has impacted their lives to the policy agendas they support which resulted in a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1 of the population since the 1980s250 justice system main article race and crime in the united states racial disparities have been noted in all levels of the us justice system according to 2009 congressional testimony from marc mauer while african americans comprise 13 of the us population and 14 of monthly drug users they are 37 of the people arrested for drug offenses as well as 56 of the people in state prisons for drug offenses the us sentencing commission reported in march 2010 that in the federal system black offenders receive sentences that are 10 longer than white offenders for the same crimes a july 2009 report by the sentencing project found that twothirds of the people in the us with life sentences are nonwhite251 contemporary issues hate crimes main article hate crime in the united states most crimes that target victims on the basis of their race or ethnicity are considered hate crimes for federal law purposes crimes targeting hispanics because of their identity are considered hate crimes based on ethnicity leading forms of bias cited in the fbis uniform crime reporting ucr program based on law enforcement agency filings are antiblack antijewish antiwhite antihomosexual and antihispanic bias in that order in both 2004 and 2005252 according to the bureau of justice statistics whites blacks and hispanics had similar rates of violent hate crime victimization between 2007 and 2011253254 however from 2011 to 2012 violent hate crimes against hispanic people increased by 300255 when considering all hate crimes and not just violent ones african americans are far more likely to be victims than other racial groups256257 the new century foundation a white nationalist organization founded by jared taylor argues that blacks are more likely than whites to commit hate crimes and that fbi figures inflate the number of hate crimes committed by whites by counting hispanics as white258 other analysts are sharply critical of the ncfs findings referring to the mainstream criminological view that racial and ethnic data must be treated with caution existing research on crime has generally shown that racial or ethnic identity is not predictive of criminal behavior with data which has been controlled for social and economic factors259 ncfs methodology and statistics are further sharply criticized as flawed and deceptive by antiracist activists tim wise and the southern poverty law center260261 the first postjim crow era hate crime to make sensational media attention was the murder of vincent chin an asian american of chinese descent in 1982 he was attacked by two white assailants who were recently laid off from a detroit area auto factory job and blamed the japanese for their individual unemployment chin was not of japanese descent but the assailants testified at the criminal court case that he looked like a jap an ethnic slur used to describe japanese and other asians and that they were angry enough to beat him to death hateful views continuing antisemitism in the united states has remained an issue as the 2011 survey of american attitudes toward jews in america released by the antidefamation league adl has found that the recent world economic recession increased some antisemitic viewpoints among americans most people express projewish sentiments with 64 of those surveyed agreeing that jews have contributed much to us social culture yet the polling found that 19 of americans answered probably true to the antisemitic canard that jews have too much controlinfluence on wall street while 15 concurred with the related statement that jews seem more willing to use shady practices in business reflecting on the lingering antisemitism of about one in five americans abraham h foxman adl national director has argued it is disturbing that with all of the strides we have made in becoming a more tolerant society antisemitic beliefs continue to hold a vicegrip on a small but not insubstantial segment of the american public262 an abc news report in 2007 recounted that past abc polls across several years have tended to find that six percent have selfreported prejudice against jews 27 percent against muslims 25 percent against arabs and one in 10 concedes harboring at least some such feelings against hispanic americans the report also remarked that a full 34 of americans reported some racist feelings in general as a selfdescription5 an associated press and yahoo news survey of 2227 adult americans in 2008 found that 10 of white respondents stated that a lot of discrimination against africanamericans exists while 45 answered some compared to 57 of black respondents answering that a lot exists in the same poll more whites applied positive attributes to black americans than negative ones with blacks describing whites even more highly but a significant minority of whites still called their fellow americans irresponsible lazy or other such things263 in 2008 stanford university political scientist paul sniderman remarked that in the modern us racism and prejudices are a deep challenge and its one that americans in general and for that matter political scientists just havent been ready to acknowledge fully263 alleviation there is a wide plethora of societal and political suggestions to alleviate the effects of continued discrimination in the united states for example within universities it has been suggested that a type of committee could respond to nonsanctionable behavior227 it is also argued that there is a need for white students and faculty to reformulate whiteawareness toward a more secure identity that is not threatened by black cultural institutions and that can recognize the racial nonneutrality of the institutions whites dominate brown 334 paired with this effort brown encourages the increase in minority faculty members so the embedded white normative experience begins to fragment227 within media it is found that racial cues prime racial stereotypic thought thus it is argued that stereotype inconsistent cues might lead to more intentioned thought thereby suppressing racial priming effects249 see also united states portal affirmative action in the united states antiamericanism categoryantiblack racism in the united

scientific racism in the united states us commission on civil rights white privilege in the united states references internment camps are particularly associated with world war ii but also occurred during world war i most significant was the japanese american internment of 120000 japanese americans during world war ii there was also internment of almost 11000 german americans in german american internment during world war ii and some italian american internment in his 2009 visit to the us the un special rapporteur on racism noted that socioeconomic indicators show that poverty and race and ethnicity continue to overlap in the united states this reality is a direct legacy of the past in particular slavery segregation the forcible resettlement of native americans which was confronted by the united states during the civil rights movement however whereas the country managed to establish equal treatment and nondiscrimination in its laws it has yet to redress the socioeconomic
