history billboard began an album chart in 1945 initially only five positions long the album chart was not published on a weekly basis sometimes three to seven weeks passing before it was updated a biweekly though with a few gaps 15position bestselling popular albums chart appeared in 1955 with the increase in album sales as the early 1950s format wars stabilized into market dominance by 45 rpm singles and longplaying twelveinch albums with 78 rpm record and longplaying teninch album sales decreasing dramatically billboard premiered a weekly bestselling popular albums chart on march 24 1956 the position count varied anywhere from 10 to 30 albums the first numberone album on the new weekly list was belafonte by harry belafonte the chart was renamed to bestselling pop albums later in 1956 and then to bestselling pop lps in 1957 beginning on may 25 1959 billboard split the ranking into two charts bestselling stereophonic lps for stereo albums 30 positions and bestselling monophonic lps for mono albums 50 positions these were renamed to stereo action charts 30 positions and mono action charts 40 positions in 1960 in january 1961 they became action albums—stereophonic 15 positions and action albums—monophonic 25 positions three months later they became top lps—stereo 50 positions and top lps—monaural 150 positions on august 17 1963 the stereo and mono charts were combined into a 150position chart called top lps on april 1 1967 the chart was expanded to 175 positions then finally to 200 positions on may 13 1967 in february 1972 the album charts title was changed to top lps tape in 1984 it was retitled top 200 albums in 1985 it was retitled again to top pop albums in 1991 it became the billboard 200 top albums and it was given its current title of the billboard 200 on march 14 1992 catalog albums in 1960 billboard began concurrently publishing album charts which ranked sales of older or midpriced titles these essential inventory charts were divided by stereo and mono albums and featured titles that had already appeared on the main stereo and mono album charts mono albums were moved to the essential inventory—mono chart 25 positions after spending 40 weeks on the mono action chart and stereo albums were moved to the essential inventory—stereo chart 20 positions after 20 weeks on the stereo action chart in january 1961 the action charts became action albums—monophonic 24 positions and action albums—stereophonic 15 positions albums appeared on either chart for up to nine weeks then were moved to an essential inventory list of approximately 200 titles with no numerical ranking this list continued to be published until the consolidated top lps chart debuted in 1963 in 1982 billboard began publishing a midline albums chart alternatively titled midline lps which ranked older or midpriced titles the chart held 50 positions and was published on a biweekly and later triweekly basis on may 25 1991 billboard premiered the top pop catalog albums chart the criteria for this chart were albums that were more than 18 months old and had fallen below position 100 on the billboard 2005 an album needed not have charted on the billboard 200 at all to qualify for catalog status starting with the issue dated december 5 2009 however the catalog limitations which removed albums over 18 months old that have dropped below position 100 and have no currentlyrunning single from the billboard 200 was lifted turning the chart into an allinclusive list of the 200 highestselling albums in the country essentially changing top comprehensive albums into the billboard 200 a new chart that keeps the previous criteria for the billboard 200 dubbed top current albums was also introduced in the same issue6 holiday albums billboard has adjusted its policies for christmas7 and holiday7 albums several times the albums were eligible for the main album charts until 1963 when a christmas albums list was created albums appearing here were not listed on the top lps chart in 1974 this rule was reverted and holiday albums again appeared within the main list in 1983 the christmas albums chart was resurrected but a titles appearance here did not disqualify it from appearing on the top pop albums chart in 1994 the chart was retitled top holiday albums as of 2009 the chart holds 50 positions and is run for several weeks during the endofcalendaryear holiday season its current policy allows holiday albums to concurrently chart on the top holiday albums list and the billboard 200 incorporation of streaming data and track sales see also albumequivalent unit beginning with the december 13 2014 issue billboard updated the methodology of its album chart again changing from a pure salesbased ranking to one measuring multimetric consumption3 with this overhaul the billboard 200 includes ondemand streaming and digital track sales as measured by nielsen soundscan by way of a new algorithm utilizing data from all of the major ondemand audio subscription services including spotify beats music google play and xbox music under the new methodology ten track sales or 1500 song streams from an album are treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album billboard will continue to publish a pure album sales chart called top album sales that maintains the traditional billboard 200 methodology based exclusively on soundscans sales data3 nielsen soundscan since may 25 1991 the billboard 200s positions have been derived from nielsen soundscan sales data as of 2008update contributed by approximately 14000 music sellers because these numbers are supplied by a subset of sellers rather than record labels it is common for these numbers to be substantially lower than those reported by the recording industry association of america when gold platinum and diamond album awards are announced riaa awards reflect wholesale shipments not retail sales yearend charts billboards chart year runs from the first week of december to the final week in november this altered calendar allows for billboard to calculate yearend charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of december prior to nielsen soundscan yearend charts were calculated by an inversepoint system based solely on an albums performance on the billboard 200 for example an album would be given one point for a week spent at position 200 two points for a week spent at position 199 up to 200 points for each week spent at number one other factors including the total weeks on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into an albums yearend total after billboard began obtaining sales information from nielsen soundscan the yearend charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales this gives a more accurate picture of any given years bestselling albums as a title that hypothetically spent nine weeks at number one in march could possibly have sold fewer copies than one spending six weeks at number three in january interestingly albums at the peak of their popularity at the time of the novemberdecember chartyear cutoff many times end up ranked lower than one would expect on a yearend tally yet are ranked on the following years chart as well as their cumulative points are split between the two chartyears uses the billboard 200 can be helpful to radio stations as an indication of the types of music listeners are interested in hearing retailers can also find it useful as a way to determine which recordings should be given the most prominent display in a store other outlets such as airline music services also employ the billboard charts to determine their programming limitations this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed september 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message the chart omits unit sales for listed albums and total recorded sales making it impossible to determine for example if the numberone album this week sold as well as the numberone from the same period in the prior year it is also impossible to determine the relative success of albums on a single chart there is no indication of whether the numberone album sold thousands more copies than number 50 or only dozens more all music genres are combined but there are separate billboard charts for individual market segments the complete sales data broken down by location is made available but only in the form of separate soundscan subscriptions alltime
