francisco by alex steffen jamais cascio and a core of initial contributors1 in 2005 worldchanging moved its offices to seattle washington in early 2006 cascio left to form the website open the future2 from 2005 2010 worldchanging was headquartered in seattle with alex steffen as executive editor and editorial lead julia levitt and amanda reed as managing editors and several contributing editors including jeremy faludi and sarah rich it relied extensively on an international network of writers and correspondents3 worldchanging was overseen by a board of directors led by worldchangings chairman the environmental photographer edward burtynsky until may 20104 worldchanging was supported by grants book sales speaker fees and reader donations on november 29 2010 worldchanging announced that due to fundraising difficulties it would shut down56 it was acquired by architecture for humanity in september 20117 that organization subsequently filed for bankruptcy in january 2015 and the worldchanging website became unavailable around march 20168 contentedit cynicism is often seen as a rebellious attitude in western popular culture but in reality our cynicism advances the desires of the powerful cynicism is obedience — alex steffen go bright green the guardian9 worldchanging practiced solutionsbased journalism countering cynicism by highlighting possible solutions to the planets most pressing problems rather than just reporting on those problems and their causes10 in the opening paragraph of its manifesto worldchanging declared worldchanging is a solutionsbased online magazine that works from a simple premise that the tools models and ideas for building a better future lie all around us that plenty of people are working on tools for change but the fields in which they work remain unconnected that the motive means and opportunity for profound positive change are already present that another world is not just possible its here we only need to put the pieces together11 impactedit it made me proud to call myself an environmentalist again — ross robertson12 this pithy remark is an indication of the impact worldchanging had in the first decade of the twentyfirst century much environmental reporting of the time was preoccupied with predictions of social and ecological collapse unless there was a wholescale retreat from industrial modernism worldchanging provided a welcome breath of optimism it demonstrated that not only were there solutions to even the most pressing problems they were available now1 this school of thought has come to be known as bright green environmentalism reflecting on the closure of worldchanging in 2010 andrew revkin contrasted its work with the world without us which examined how quickly nature would erase the works of civilisation were humans to suddenly disappear he summarised worldchangings work as taking on the tougher challenge of charting life on the world with us13 critical receptionedit wired columnist bruce sterling called worldchanging the best collaborative weblog in the whole wide world14 journalist and author bill mckibben considered it one of the most professional and interesting web sites that you could possibly bookmark on your browser15 author architect richard meier named it as his favorite site and praised it for having a wealth of information on sustainability16 alex steffen gave a ted global talk in 2005 and jamais cascio gave a ted talk in 20061718 worldchanging won or was a finalist for the following awards and prizes winner of the 2004 utne independent press award for best online cultural coverage19 finalist in 2005 webby for best blog20 finalist in 2005 bloggie for best nonweblog content of a weblog site21 finalist in 2006 bloggie for best group weblog22 finalist in 2007 webby for best magazine23 official honoree in 2008 webby24 in 2007 time magazine named worldchanging one of the worlds top 15 environmental websites25 in 2008 nielsen rated worldchanging the second leading sustainability site in the world for 200726 worldchanging bookedit in november 2006 worldchanging published a survey of global innovation worldchanging a users guide for the 21st century with a foreword by al gore design by stefan sagmeister and an introduction by bruce sterling27 it was a 2007 winner of the santa monica librarys green prize for sustainable literature28 and received a 2007 organic award29 it saw translation into french german korean and several other languages3031 receptionedit the book was well received on its release and was rated highly by the general public on book review sites3233 the layout and design were also received favourably34 it was emphatically recommended by treehugger who praised its structure and while noting that the coverage was broader than it was deep also noted that each section contained references to further reading material35 publishers weekly concluded that its hard to imagine a more complete resource for those hoping to live in a future that is as editor steffen puts it bright green free and tough36 writing in the new york review of books bill mckibben described the book as seeking answers to the question how we can radically transform our daily lives he found it had a refreshingly pragmatic approach although he also felt it placed a little too much emphasis on the individual over the government as agents of change15 looking past observations that it leans left and it appears to downplay the role of markets as a possible solution bloomberg businessweeks bruce nussbaum found worldchanging to be full of innovation and pragmatic solutions37 writing in new scientist andrew simms was less enthusiastic while he thought it made the positive point that all is not hopeless and that there are more ways of improving the human lot than are being used he also thought it betrayed a technocratic mindset that sought to impose solutions from outside a problem rather than acknowledging that those inside a problem refugees know perfectly well what they need38 in the guardian childrens author josh lacey described the book as a vision of how things might look if the geeks inherit the earth he found the brief articles contributed by over sixty authors ranged from practical suggestions for changing your daily life to simple inspirations but that all this information is sandwiched between thick slices of polemic the wideeyed gusto does sometimes get a bit irritating lacey did conclude on a positive note describing the book itself as elegantly produced and built to last and that having all this information available to hand was a pretty good reminder of why books arent yet redundant and probably wont be for a long time39 there were less favourable reviews several commentators asked how a website that promoted sustainability could justify consuming resources to publish a 600page hardcover book and conduct a national tour to promote it a sentiment foreshadowed by sterlings reference to a dizzyingly comprehensive chunk of treeware in his introduction on p 1440 the books publishers noted on the back page that they recorded the ecological costs and applied the appropriate offsets41 the criticism may be taken as an illustration of the differences between bright and dark green thinking revised editionedit worldchanging revised edition a users guide for the 21st century42 was issued in 2011 as a revision with updated technological material relating to sustainable living including some 160 new entries relating to food security sustainable transport carbon neutrality ecotourism and updated information on the emerging local food movement again it rated well with the general public but by the time of publication worldchanging had ceased operations and the book received virtually no coverage in editorial columns43 referencesedit a b newman julie ed 3 may 2011 green ethics and philosophy an atoz guide sage publications p 375 isbn 9781412996877 retrieved 21 september 2016
