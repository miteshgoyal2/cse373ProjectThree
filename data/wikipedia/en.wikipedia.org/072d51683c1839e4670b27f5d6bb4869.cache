the llama ˈlɑːmə spanish ˈʝama locally ˈʎama or ˈʒama lama glama is a domesticated south american camelid widely used as a meat and pack animal by andean cultures since the precolumbian era the height of a fullgrown fullsize llama is 17 to 18 m 56 to 59 ft tall at the top of the head and can weigh between 130 and 200 kg 290 and 440 lb at birth a baby llama called a cria can weigh between 9 and 14 kg 20 and 31 lb llamas typically live for 15 to 25 years with some individuals surviving 30 years or more234 they are very social animals and live with other llamas as a herd the wool produced by a llama is very soft and lanolinfree llamas are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions when using a pack they can carry about 25 to 30 of their body weight for 8 to 13 km 5–8 miles5 the name llama in the past also spelled lama or glama was adopted by european settlers from native peruvians6 llamas appear to have originated from the central plains of north america about 40 million years ago they migrated to south america about three million years ago during the great american interchange by the end of the last ice age 10000–12000 years ago camelids were extinct in north america5 as of 2007 there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in south america and due to importation from south america in the late 20th century there are now over 158000 llamas and 100000

prev lama guanicoe pacos and the domestic llama lama glama guanacos and vicuñas live in the wild while alpacas – as well as llamas – exist only as domesticated animals8 although early writers compared llamas to sheep their similarity to the camel was soon recognized they were included in the genus camelus along with alpaca in the systema naturae 1758 of carl linnaeus9 they were however separated by georges cuvier in 1800 under the name of lama along with the guanaco10 alpacas and vicuñas are in genus vicugna the genera lama and vicugna are with the two species of true camels the sole existing representatives of a very distinct section of the artiodactyla or eventoed ungulates called tylopoda or bumpfooted from the peculiar bumps on the soles of their feet the tylopoda consist of a single family the camelidae and shares the order artiodactyla with the suina pigs the tragulina chevrotains the pecora ruminants and the whippomorpha hippos and cetaceans which belong to artiodactyla from a cladistic if not traditional standpoint the tylopoda have more or less affinity to each of the sister taxa standing in some respects in a middle position between them sharing some characteristics from each but in others showing special modifications not found in any of the other taxacitation needed a domestic llama the 19thcentury discoveries of a vast and previously unexpected extinct paleogene fauna of north america as interpreted by paleontologists joseph leidy edward drinker cope and othniel charles marsh aided understanding of the early history of this familycitation needed llamas were not always confined to south america abundant llamalike remains were found in pleistocene deposits in the rocky mountains and in central america some of the fossil llamas were much larger than current forms some species remained in north america during the last ice ages north american llamas are categorized as a single extinct genus hemiauchenia llamalike animals would have been a common sight 25000 years ago in modernday california texas new mexico utah missouri and florida11 the camelid lineage has a good fossil record camellike animals have been traced from the thoroughly differentiated modern species back through early miocene forms their characteristics became more general and they lost those that distinguished them as camelids hence they were classified as ancestral artiodactylscitation needed no fossils of these earlier forms have been found in the old world indicating that north america was the original home of camelids and that old world camels crossed over via the bering land bridge the formation of the isthmus of panama three million years ago allowed camelids to spread to south america as part of the great american interchange where they evolved further meanwhile north american camelids died out at the end of the pleistocene12 characteristicsedit the following characteristics apply especially to llamas dentition of adultsincisors 13 canines 11 premolars 22 molars 32 total 32 in the upper jaw a compressed sharp pointed laniariform incisor near the hinder edge of the premaxilla is followed in the male at least by a moderatesized pointed curved true canine in the anterior part of the maxilla13 the isolated caninelike premolar that follows in the camels is not present the teeth of the molar series which are in contact with each other consist of two very small premolars the first almost rudimentary and three broad molars constructed generally like those of camelus in the lower jaw the three incisors are long spatulate and procumbent the outer ones are the smallest next to these is a curved suberect canine followed after an interval by an isolated minute and often deciduous simple conical premolar then a contiguous series of one premolar and three molars which differ from those of camelus in having a small accessory column at the anterior outer edge names of llama body parts 1 ears – 2 poll – 3 withers – 4 back

lessdeveloped cranial ridges being due to its smaller size the nasal bones are shorter and broader and are joined by the premaxilla vertebrae cervical 7 dorsal 12 lumbar 7 sacral 4 caudal 15 to 20 the ears are rather long and slightly curved inward characteristically known as banana shaped there is no dorsal hump the feet are narrow the toes being more separated than in the camels each having a distinct plantar pad the tail is short and fibre is long woolly and soft in essential structural characteristics as well as in general appearance and habits all the animals of this genus very closely resemble each other so whether they should be considered as belonging to one two or more species is a matter of controversy among naturalists the question is complicated by the circumstance of the great majority of individuals that have come under observation being either in a completely or partially domesticated state many are also descended from ancestors that have previously been domesticated a state that tends to produce a certain amount of variation from the original type the four forms commonly distinguished by the inhabitants of south america are recognized as distinct species though with difficulties in defining their distinctive characteristics these are the llama lama glama linnaeus the alpaca vicugna pacos linnaeus the guanaco from the quechua huanaco lama guanicoe müller and the vicuña vicugna vicugna molina the llama and alpaca are only known in the domestic state and are variable in size and of many colors being often white brown or piebald some are grey or black the guanaco and vicuña are wild the former being endangered and of a nearly uniform lightbrown color passing into white below they certainly differ from each other the vicuña being smaller more slender in its proportions and having a shorter head than the guanaco the vicuña lives in herds on the bleak and elevated parts of the mountain range bordering the region of perpetual snow amidst rocks and precipices occurring in various suitable localities throughout peru in the southern part of ecuador and as far south as the middle of bolivia its manners very much resemble those of the chamois of the european alps it is as vigilant wild and timid the fiber is extremely delicate and soft and highly valued for the purposes of weaving but the quantity that each animal produces is minimal alpacas are descended from wild vicuna ancestors while domesticated llamas are descended from wild guanaco ancestors though a considerable amount of hybridization between the two species has occurred differential characteristics between llamas and alpacas include the llamas larger size longer head and curved ears alpaca fiber is generally more expensive but not always more valuable alpacas tend to have a more consistent color throughout the body the most apparent visual difference between llamas and camels is that camels have a hump or humps and llamas do not reproductionedit dam and her cria llamas have an unusual reproductive cycle for a large animal female llamas are induced ovulators14 through the act of mating the female releases an egg and is often fertilized on the first attempt female llamas do not go into estrus heat15 like humans llama males and females mature sexually at different rates females reach puberty at about 12 months old males do not become sexually mature until around three years of age16 matingedit llamas mate with the female in a kush lying down position which is fairly unusual in a large animal they mate for an extended time 20–45 minutes also unusual in a large animal17 gestationedit the gestation period of a llama is 115 months 350 days dams female llamas do not lick off their babies as they have an attached tongue that does not reach outside of the mouth more than half an inch 13 cm rather they will nuzzle and hum to their newborns18 criasedit a cria from spanish for baby is the name for a baby llama alpaca vicuña or guanaco crias are typically born with all the females of the herd gathering around in an attempt to protect against the male llamas and potential predators llamas give birth standing birth is usually quick and problemfree over in less than 30 minutes most births take place between 8 am and noon during the warmer daylight hours this may increase cria survival by reducing fatalities due to hypothermia during cold andean nights this birthing pattern is speculated to be a continuation of the birthing patterns observed in the wild crias are up and standing walking and attempting to suckle within the first hour after birth192021 crias are partially fed with llama milk that is lower in fat and salt and higher in phosphorus and calcium than cow or goat milk a female llama will only produce about 60 ml 21 imp fl oz of milk at a time when she gives milk so the cria must suckle frequently to receive the nutrients it requires22 breeding methodsedit in harem mating the male is left with females most of the year for field mating a female is turned out into a field with a male llama and left there for some period of time this is the easiest method in terms of labor but the least useful in terms of prediction of a likely birth date an ultrasound test can be performed and together with the exposure dates a better idea of when the cria is expected can be determined hand mating is the most efficient method but requires the most work on the part of the human involved a male and female llama are put into the same pen and mating is monitored they are then separated and remated every other day until one or the other refuses the mating usually one can get in two matings using this method though some stud males routinely refuse to mate a female more than once the separation presumably helps to keep the sperm count high for each mating and also helps to keep the condition of the female llamas reproductive tract more sound if the mating is not successful within two to three weeks the female is mated again pregnancyedit llamas at san pedro de atacama chile this section contains instructions advice or howto content the purpose of wikipedia is to present facts not to

two to three six and at least 12 weeks for spit testing bring the potentially pregnant dam to an intact male if the stud attempts to mate with her and she lies down for him within a fairly short period of time she is not pregnant if she remains on her feet spits attacks him or otherwise prevents his being able to mate it is assumed she is probably pregnant this test gets its name due to the dam spitting at the male if she is pregnant for progesterone testing a veterinarian can test a blood sample for progesterone a high level can indicate a pregnancy with palpation the veterinarian or breeder manually feels inside the llama to detect a pregnancy some risks to the llama exist but it can be an accurate method for pregnancy detection ultrasound is the most accurate method for an experienced veterinarian who can do an exterior examination and detect a fetus as early as 45 days spit testing with an intact male is generally free and is usually accurate however some hormonal conditions in females can make them reject a male when they are in fact not pregnant and more rarely accept a male when they are pregnant progesterone tests can give a high reading in some females with a hormonal problem that are in fact not pregnant neither of the previous methods nor palpation can give a reasonably accurate idea of the age of the fetus while an ultrasound procedure can in addition an ultrasound procedure can distinguish between pregnancy and misleading physical conditions or between a live and dead fetus the disadvantages of an ultrasound procedure are cost some training in the use of ultrasound equipment is required and not all veterinarians have the equipment needed to perform the examination nutritionedit options for feeding llamas are quite wide a wide variety of commercial and farmbased feeds are available the major determining factors include feed cost availability nutrient balance and energy density required young actively growing llamas require a greater concentration of nutrients than mature animals because of their smaller digestive tract capacities23 estimated daily requirementsclarification needed what units of bromgrass hay alfalfa hay

a pack llama in the rocky mountain national park llamas which are wellsocialized and trained to halter and lead after weaning are very friendly and pleasant to be around they are extremely curious and most will approach people easily however llamas that are bottlefed or oversocialized and overhandled as youth will become extremely difficult to handle when mature when they will begin to treat humans as they treat each other which is characterized by bouts of spitting kicking and neck wrestlingcitation needed when correctly reared llamas spitting at a human is a rare thing llamas are very social herd animals however and do sometimes spit at each other as a way of disciplining lowerranked llamas in the herd a llamas social rank in a herd is never static they can always move up or down in the social ladder by picking small fights this is usually done between males to see which will become dominant their fights are visually dramatic with spitting ramming each other with their chests neck wrestling and kicking mainly to knock the other off balance the females are usually only seen spitting as a means of controlling other herd members while the social structure might always be changing they live as a family and they do take care of each other if one notices a strange noise or feels threatened a warning bray is sent out and all others become alert they will often hum to each other as a form of communication the sound of the llama making groaning noises or going mwa mwaʰ is often a sign of fear or anger if a llama is agitated it will lay its ears back one may determine how agitated the llama is by the materials in the spit the more irritated the llama is the further back into each of the three stomach compartments it will try to draw materials from for its spit an orgle is the mating sound of a llama or alpaca made by the sexually aroused male the sound is reminiscent of gargling but with a more forceful buzzing edge males begin the sound when they become aroused and continue throughout the act of procreation – from 15 minutes to more than an hour2526 guard behavioredit main article guard llama llama guarding sheep on the south downs in west sussex using llamas as livestock guards in north america began in the early 1980s and some sheep producers have used llamas successfully since then2728 they are used most commonly in the western regions of the united states where larger predators such as coyotes and feral dogs are prevalent typically a single gelding castrated male is used research suggests the use of multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one multiple males tend to bond with one another rather than with the livestock and may ignore the flock a gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to lambing many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs using llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers the value of the livestock saved each year more than exceeds the purchase cost and annual maintenance of a llama although not every llama is suited to the job most are a viable nonlethal alternative for reducing predation requiring no training and little care29better source needed historyedit moche 100–300 ad at lombards museum this sculpture originating from the chancay valley and adjacent chillón drainage

important people as offerings or provisions for the afterlife31 the moche culture of precolumbian peru depicted llamas quite realistically in their ceramics inca empireedit in the inca empire llamas were the only beasts of burden and many of the people dominated by the inca had long traditions of llama herding for the inca nobility the llama was of symbolic significance and llama figures were often buried with the dead32 in south america llamas are still used as beasts of burden as well as for the production of fiber and meat33 the inca deity urcuchillay was depicted in the form of a multicolored llama34 scholar alex chepstowlusty has argued that the switch from a huntergatherer lifestyle to widespread agriculture was only possible because of the use of llama dung as fertilizer35 spanish empireedit the first image of llamas in europa 1553 one of the main uses for llamas at the time of the spanish conquest was to bring down ore from the mines in the mountains36 gregory de bolivar estimated that in his day as many as 300000 were employed in the transport of produce from the potosí mines alone but since the introduction of horses mules and donkeys the importance of the llama as a beast of burden has greatly diminished37 according to juan ignacio molina the dutch captain joris van spilbergen observed the use of chilihueques possibly a llama type by native mapuches of mocha island as plow animals in 161438 fiberedit llamas have a fine undercoat which can be used for handicrafts and garments the coarser outer guard hair is used for rugs wallhangings and lead ropes
