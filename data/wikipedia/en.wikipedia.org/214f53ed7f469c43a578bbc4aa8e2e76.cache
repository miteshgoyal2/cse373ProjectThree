euniverse employees with friendster accounts saw potential in its social networking features the group decided to mimic the more popular features of the website within 10 days the first version of myspace was ready for launch implemented using coldfusion1219 a complete infrastructure of finance human resources technical expertise bandwidth and server capacity was available for the site the project was overseen by brad greenspan euniverses founder chairman ceo who managed chris dewolfe myspaces starting ceo josh berman tom anderson myspaces starting president and a team of programmers and resources provided by euniverse the first myspace users were euniverse employees the company held contests to see who could sign up the most users20 euniverse used its 20 million users and email subscribers to breathe life into myspace21 and move it to the head of the pack of social networking websites a key architect was tech expert toan nguyen who helped stabilize the myspace platform when brad greenspan asked him to join the team22 cofounder and cto aber whitcomb played an integral role in software architecture utilizing the then superior development speed of coldfusion over other dynamic database driven serverside languages of the time despite over ten times the number of developers friendster which was developed in javaserver pages jsp could not keep up with the speed of development of myspace and cfm logo from 2004 until 2010 the myspacecom domain was originally owned by yourzcom inc intended until 2002 for use as an online data storage and sharing site by 2004 it was transitioned from a file storage service to a social networking site a friend who also worked in the data storage business reminded chris dewolfe that he had earlier bought the domain myspacecom23 dewolfe suggested they charge a fee for the basic myspace service24 brad greenspan nixed the idea believing that keeping myspace free was necessary to make it a successful community25 2005–2008 rise and purchase by news corpedit myspace quickly gained popularity among teenage and young adult social groups in february 2005 dewolfe held talks with mark zuckerberg over acquiring facebook but dewolfe rejected zuckerbergs 75 million asking price26 some employees of myspace including dewolfe and berman were able to purchase equity in the property before myspace and its parent company euniverse now renamed intermix media was bought in july 2005 in one of the companys first major internet purchases rupert murdochs news corporation the parent company of fox broadcasting and other media enterprises purchased myspace for us580 million1927 news corporation had beat out viacom by offering a higher price for the website28 and the purchase was seen as a good investment at the time28 of the 580 million purchase price approximately 327 million has been attributed to the value of myspace according to the financial adviser fairness opinion29 within a year myspace had tripled in value from its purchase price28 news corporation saw the purchase as a way to capitalize on internet advertising and drive traffic to other news corporation properties27 after losing the bidding war for myspace viacom chairman sumner redstone stunned the entertainment industry in september 2006 when he fired tom freston from the position of ceo redstone believed that the failure to acquire myspace contributed to the 20 drop in viacoms stock price in 2006 up to the date of frestons ouster frestons successor as ceo philippe dauman was quoted as saying never ever let another competitor beat us to the trophy redstone told interviewer charlie rose that losing myspace had been humiliating adding myspace was sitting there for the taking for 500 million myspace was sold in 2012 by news corp for 35 million30 oxfam america president raymond c offenheiser wendi deng and rupert murdoch with myspace cofounders anderson and dewolfe at the 2006 oxfammyspace rock for darfur event in january 2006 fox announced plans to launch a uk version of myspace in a bid to tap into the uk music scene which they did31 they released a version in china and launched similar versions in other countries the 100 millionth account was created on august 9 2006 in the netherlands32 on november 1 2007 myspace and bebo joined the googleled opensocial alliance which already included friendster hi5 linkedin plaxo ning and six apart opensocial was to promote a common set of standards for software developers to write programs for social networks facebook remained independent google had been unsuccessful in building its own social networking site orkut in the us market and was using the alliance to present a counterweight to facebook33343536 by late 2007 and into 2008 myspace was considered the leading social networking site and consistently beat out main competitor facebook in traffic initially the emergence of facebook did little to diminish myspaces popularity at the time facebook was targeted only at college students at its peak when news corp attempted to merge it with yahoo in 2007 myspace was valued at 12 billion3738 2008–2012 decline and sale by news corpedit on april 19 2008 facebook overtook myspace in the alexa rankings3940 since then myspace has seen a continuing loss of membership and there are several suggestions for its demise including the fact that it stuck to a portal strategy of building an audience around entertainment and music whereas facebook and twitter continually added new features to improve the socialnetworking experience4142 marvin l gittelman suggested that the 900 million threeyear advertisement deal with google while being a shortterm cash windfall was a handicap in the long run that deal required myspace to place even more ads on its already heavily advertised space which made the site slow more difficult to use and less flexible myspace could not experiment with its own site without forfeiting revenue while rival facebook was rolling out a new clean site design4344 myspace ceo chris dewolfe reported that he had to push back against fox interactive medias sales team who monetized the site without regard to user experience12 while facebook focused on creating a platform that allowed outside developers to build new applications myspace built everything inhouse shawn gold myspaces former head of marketing and content said myspace went too wide and not deep enough in its product development we went with a lot of products that were shallow and not the best products in the world the products division had introduced many features communication tools such as instant messaging a classifieds program a video player a music player a virtual karaoke machine a selfserve advertising platform profileediting tools security systems privacy filters and myspace book lists among others however the features were often buggy and slow as there was insufficient testing measuring and iterating12 danah boyd a senior researcher at microsoft research noted of social networking websites that myspace and others were a very peculiar business—one in which companies might serially rise fall and disappear as influential peers pull others in on the climb up—and signal to flee when its time to get out the volatility of social networks was exemplified in 2006 when connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal launched an investigation into childrens exposure to pornography on myspace the resulting media frenzy and myspaces inability to build an effective spam filter gave the site a reputation as a vortex of perversion around that time specialized social media companies such as twitter formed and began targeting myspace users while facebook rolled out communication tools which were seen as safe in comparison to myspace boyd compared the shift of white middleclass kids from the seedy myspace to the supposedly safer haven of facebook to the white flight from american cities the perception of myspace eventually drove advertisers away as well12 in addition myspace had particular problems with vandalism phishing malware and spam which it failed to curtail making the site seem inhospitable45 these have been cited as factors why users who as teenagers were myspaces strongest audience in 2006 and 20164647 had been migrating to facebook facebook which started strongly with the 18to24 group mostly college students48 has been much more successful than myspace at attracting elderly men495051 chairman and ceo rupert murdoch was said to be frustrated that myspace never met expectations as a distribution outlet for fox studio content and missing the us1 billion mark in total revenues52 that resulted in dewolfe and anderson gradually losing their status within murdochs inner circle of executives plus dewolfes mentor peter chernin the president and coo of news corp who was based in los angeles departed the company former aol executive jonathan miller who joined news corp in charge of the digital media business was in the job for three weeks when he shuffled myspaces executive team in april 2009 myspace president tom anderson stepped down while chris dewolfe was replaced as myspace ceo by former facebook coo owen van natta5354 a news corp meeting in march 2009 over the direction of myspace was reportedly the catalyst for that management shakeup with the google search deal about to expire the departure of key personnel myspaces coo svp of engineering and svp of strategy to form a startup furthermore the opening of extravagant new offices around the world was questioned as rival facebook did not have similarly expensive expansion plans yet it still attracted international users at a rapid rate12 the changes to myspaces executive ranks was followed in june 2009 by a layoff of 375 of its workforce including 30 of its us employees reducing employees from 1600 to 100012 in 2009 around the time that myspace underwent layoffs and a management shakeup the site relied on drastic redesigns as hail mary passes to get users back however this may have backfired for myspace as it is noted that users generally disliked interface tweaks on rival facebook which avoided major site redesigns4655 myspace has attempted to redefine itself as a social entertainment website with more of a focus on music movies celebrities and tv instead of a social networking website myspace also developed a linkup with facebook that would allow musicians and bands to manage their facebook profiles ceo mike jones was quoted as saying that myspace now is a complementary offer to facebook inc which is not a rival anymore38 in march 2011 market research figures released by comscore suggested that myspace had lost 10 million users between january and february 2011 and that it had fallen from 95 million to 63 million unique users during the previous twelve months56 myspace registered its sharpest audience declines in the month of february 2011 as traffic fell 44 from a year earlier to 377 million unique us visitors advertisers have been reported as unwilling to commit to long term deals with the site57 in late february 2011 news corp officially put the site up for sale which was estimated to be worth 50–200 million58 losses from last quarter of 2010 were 156 million over double of the previous year which dragged down the otherwise strong results of parent news corp359 the deadline for bids may 31 2011 passed without any above the reserve price of 100 million being submitted60 it has been said that the rapid deterioration in myspaces business during the most recent quarter deterred many potential suitors3 on june 29 2011 myspace announced to label partners and press via email that it had been acquired by specific media for an undisclosed sum rumoured to be a figure as low as 35m6162 cnn reported that myspace sold for 35 million and noted that it was far less than the 580 million news corp paid for myspace in 200563 rupert murdoch went on to call the myspace purchase a huge mistake64 time magazine compared news corporations purchase of myspace to time warners purchase of aol – a conglomerate trying to stay ahead of the competition28 many former executives have gone onto further success after departing myspace65 2016–present time inc ownershipedit on february 11 2016 it was announced that myspace and its parent company had been bought by time

realizing the competitive threat to the new myspace videos service myspace banned embedded youtube videos from its user profiles myspace users widely protested the ban prompting myspace to lift the

in early 2006 that could utilize a service known as myspace mobile to access and edit ones profile and communicate with and view the profiles of other members70 additionally uievolution and myspace

artists redesignsedit past redesignsedit on march 10 2010 myspace added some new features like a recommendation engine for new users which suggests games music and videos based on their previous

friends only 18 and older or everyone the website will also release several mobile micro applications for myspace gamers besides sending them games alerts the site may release 20 to 30 micro apps and go mobile in 201178 in october 2010 myspace introduced a beta version of a new site design on a limited scale with plans to switch all interested users to the new site in late november chief executive mike jones said the site is no longer competing with facebook as a general social networking site instead myspace would be musicoriented and would target younger people jones believed most younger users would continue to use the site after the redesign though older users might not the goal of the redesign is to increase the number of myspace users and how long they spend there on october 26 btig analyst richard greenfield said most investors have written off myspace now and he was unsure whether the changes would help the company recover79 in november 2010 myspace changed its logo to coincide with the new site design the word my appears in the helvetica font followed by a symbol representing a space the logo change was announced on october 8 2010 and appeared on the site on november 11 201080 also that month myspace integrated with facebook connect – calling it mash up with facebook in an announcement widely seen as the final act of acknowledging facebooks domination of the social networking industry81 in january 2011 it was announced that the myspace staff would be reduced by 4782 despite the new design user adoption continued to decrease83 in september 2012 a new redesign was announced but no date given making myspace more visual and apparently optimized for tablets84 by april 2013 presumably before users were able to transfer over to the new myspace redesign
