scientist and writer he is best known for pioneering work in virtual memory especially for inventing the workingset model for program behavior which addressed thrashing in operating systems and became the reference standard for all memory management policies he is also known for his works on principles of operating systems operational analysis of queueing network systems design and implementation of csnet the acm digital library codifying the great principles of computing and most recently for the book the innovators way2 on innovation as a set of learnable practices contents 1 biography 2

born january 6 1942 in queens ny and raised in darien ct he took an early interest in science pursuing astronomy botany radio and electronics while in grade school at fairfield prep he submitted home designed computers to the science fair in 1958 1959 and 1960 the second computer which solved linear equations using pinball machine parts won the grand prize3 he attended manhattan college for a bachelor in ee 1964 and then mit for a phd 1968 at mit he was part of project mac and contributed to the design of multics his phd thesis resource allocation in multiprocess computer systems introduced seminal ideas in working sets locality thrashing and system balance at princeton university from 1968 to 1972 he wrote his classic book operating systems principles with e g coffman he collaborated with alfred aho and jeffrey ullman on optimality proofs for paging algorithms and on a simple proof that compilers based on precedence parsing do not need to backtrack at purdue university 1972–1983 he supervised numerous phd theses validating localitybased theories of memory management and extending the new mathematics of operational analysis of queueing networks he cofounded csnet he became department head in 1979 and completed another book on computational models machines languages and computation with jack dennis and joe qualitz at nasa ames from 1983 to 1991 he founded the research institute for advanced computer science riacs4 and turned it into one of the first centers for interdisciplinary research in computational and space science at george mason university from 1991 to 2002 he headed the computer science department was an associate dean and vice provost and founded the center for the new engineer the center was a pioneer in webbased learning he created a design course for engineers called sense 21 which was the basis of his project to understand innovation as a skill he created a course on core of information technology5 the basis his great principles of computing project6 at naval postgraduate school since 2002 he heads the computer science department directs the cebrowski institute for innovation and information superiority7 he chaired the faculty council denning served continuously as a volunteer in association for computing machinery acm since 1967 in that time he served as president vice president three board chairs memberatlarge editor of acm computing surveys and editor of the monthly acm communications he received seven acm awards for service technical contribution and education acm presented him with a special award8 in june 2007 recognizing 40 years of continuous service denning has received 26 awards for service and technical contribution these include one quality customer service award three professional society fellowships three honorary degrees six awards for technical contribution six for distinguished service and seven for education9 he married dorothy e denning in 1974 she went on to become a noted computer security expert workedit dennings career has been a search for fundamental principles in subfields of computing he writes prolifically from 1980 to 1982 he wrote 24 columns as acm president focusing on technical and political issues of the field from 1985 to 1993 he wrote 47 columns on the science of computing for american scientist magazine10 focusing on scientific principles from across the field beginning in 2001 he has written quarterly it profession columns11 for communications of the acm focusing on principles of value to practicing professionals virtual memoryedit in 1970 he published a classic paper that displayed a scientific framework for virtual memory and the validating scientific evidence putting to rest a controversy over virtual memory stability and performance12 in 1966 he proposed the working set as a dynamic measure of memory demand and explained why it worked using the locality idea introduced by les belady of ibm his working set paper13 became a classic it received an acm best paper award in 1968 and a sigops hall of fame award 14 in 2005 operating system principlesedit in the early 1970s he collaborated with ed coffman jr on operating systems theory which became a classic textbook used in graduate courses and stayed in print until 1995 that book helped to erase doubts that the os field could be approached as a science in the middle 1970s he collaborated with jeffrey buzen on operational analysis extending buzens basic operational laws to deal with all queueing networks the operational framework explained why computer performance models work so well even though violating the traditional stochastic markovian assumptions it has become the preferred method for teaching performance prediction in computing courses in the early 1980s he was one of the four founding principal investigators of computer science network sponsored by the national science foundation the other three were dave farber larry landweber and tony hearn they led the development of a fully selfsupporting cs community network that by 1986 included 165 sites and 50000 users csnet was the key transitional stepping stone from the original arpanet to the nsfnet and then the internetcitation needed in 2009 the internet society awarded csnet its prestigious jon postel award recognizing its key role in bridging from the arpanet to nsfnet he led the acm digital library project 199297 which went live in 1997 the association for computing machinery became the first professional society to offer a fully searchable library of everything it ever published15 great principles of computingedit in 1999 he expanded the search for fundamental principles to cover all of computing the discovery of natural information processes in biology physics economics materials and other fields convinced him that the basic definitions of computation had to be modified to encompass natural information processes as well as artificial he and his team have produced a draft framework16 the great principles framework revealed that innovating is a core practice of computing unable to find anyone who understood how to teach the skill of innovating he joined with bob dunham and identified eight foundational practices of innovation17 they published the innovators way a book laying the eight essential practices of successful innovation computing educationedit denning has been a major influence in computing education in the early 1970s he led a task force that designed the first core course on operating systems os principles os became the first nonmath cs core course in the mid 1980s he led a joint acmieee committee that described computing as a discipline with nine functional areas and three cognitive processes the basis of acm curriculum 1991 in the 1990s he set out on a quest to codify the great principles of computing he maintains that computing is a science both of natural and artificial information processes nsf designated him a distinguished education fellow18 in 2007 to launch a movement to use the great principles framework for innovations in education and research in 2009 acms sigcse special interest group on computer science education recognized his contributions with its lifetime service award19 humoredit denning is an inveterate punster who frequently uses humor to get points across examples 2021 april fool special section when he was editor acm communications april 1984 on active and passive writing a treatise exhorting students to write in the active voice a tale of two islands fable about a controversy in queueing theory over operational analysis first published in 1991 contained as an appendix to a 2006 overview of operational analysis22 quotesedit computation is the principle the computer is the tool all speech is free its just the consequences that get you a request is not in the words you speak it is in the listening of those who hear you after many years of trying to make computers think like brains ai researchers got brains that think they are computers locality is a principle of nature caching works because our brains organize information by localities innovation is not brilliant new ideas it is new practice adopted by a community solidarity not software generates collaboration publicationsedit he is author or editor of 340 technical papers and
