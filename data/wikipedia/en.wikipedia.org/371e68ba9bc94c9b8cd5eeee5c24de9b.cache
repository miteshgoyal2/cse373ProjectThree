himmelfarb a historian in 1942 they had two children elizabeth nelson and william kristol the editor of the weekly standard kristol died aged 89 on september 18 2009 at the capital hospice in falls church virginia from complications of lung cancer110 ideasedit in 1973 michael harrington coined the term neoconservatism to describe those liberal intellectuals and political philosophers who were disaffected with the political and cultural attitudes dominating the democratic party and were moving toward a new form of conservatism11 intended by harrington as a pejorative term it was accepted by kristol as an apt description of the ideas and policies exemplified by the public interest unlike liberals for example neoconservatives rejected most of the great society programs sponsored by lyndon johnson and unlike traditional conservatives they supported the more limited welfare state instituted by franklin delano roosevelt in february 1979 kristol was featured on the cover of esquire the caption identified him as the godfather of the most powerful new political force in america – neoconservatism12 that year also saw the publication of the book the neoconservatives the men who are changing americas politics like harrington the author peter steinfels was critical of neoconservatism but he was impressed by its growing political and intellectual influence kristols response appeared under the title confessions of a true selfconfessed – perhaps the only – neoconservative13 neoconservatism kristol maintains is not an ideology but a persuasion a way of thinking about politics rather than a compendium of principles and axioms14 it is classical rather than romantic in temperament and practical and antiutopian in policy one of kristols most celebrated quips defines a neoconservative as a liberal who has been mugged by reality these concepts lie at the core of neoconservative philosophy to this day15 that reality for kristol is a complex one while propounding the virtues of supplyside economics as the basis for the economic growth that is a sine qua non for the survival of a modern democracy he also insists that any economic philosophy has to be enlarged by political philosophy moral philosophy and even religious thought which were as much the sine qua non for a modern democracy16 one of his early books two cheers for capitalism asserts that capitalism or more precisely bourgeois capitalism is worthy of two cheers one cheer because it works in a quite simple material sense by improving the conditions of people and a second cheer because it is congenial to a large measure of personal liberty these are no small achievements he argues and only capitalism has proved capable of providing them but it also imposes a great psychic burden upon the individual and the social order as well because it does not meet the individuals existential human needs it creates a spiritual malaise that threatens the legitimacy of that social order as much as anything else it is the withholding of that third cheer that is the distinctive mark of neoconservatism as kristol understands it17 articlesedit men and ideas niccolo machiavelli encounter december
