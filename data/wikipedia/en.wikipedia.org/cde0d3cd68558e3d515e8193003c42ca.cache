centenary supplement since digitised was published11 the original fourpage weekly had a print run of 750 in 1840 the newspaper began to publish daily in 1841 an englishman named john fairfax purchased the operation renaming it the sydney morning herald the following year12 fairfax whose family were to control the newspaper for almost 150 years based his editorial policies upon principles of candour honesty and honour we have no wish to mislead no interest to gratify by unsparing abuse or indiscriminate approbation during the decade 1890 donald murray worked there the smh was late to the trend of printing news rather than just advertising on the front page doing so from 15 april 1944 of the countrys metropolitan dailies only the west australian was later in making the switch in 1949 the newspaper launched a sunday edition the sunday herald four years later this was merged with the newly acquired sun newspaper to create the sunherald which continues to this day in 1995 the company launched the newspapers web edition smhcomau13 the site has since grown to include interactive and multimedia features beyond the content in the print edition around the same time the organisation moved from jones street to new offices at darling park and built a new printing press at chullora in the citys west the smh has since moved with other sydney fairfax divisions to a building at darling island in may 2007 fairfax media announced it would be moving from a broadsheet format to the smaller compact or tabloidsize in the footsteps of the times for both the sydney morning herald and the age14 fairfax media dumped these plans later in the year however in june 2012 fairfax media again announced it planned to shift both broadsheet newspapers to tabloid size in march 201315 fairfax also announced it would cut staff across the entire group by 1900 over three years and erect paywalls around the papers websites16 the subscription type is to be a freemium model limiting readers to a number of free stories per month with a payment required for further access17 the announcement was part of an overall digital first strategy of increasingly digital or online content over printed delivery to increase sharing of editorial content and to assist the managements wish for full integration of its online print and mobile platforms16 in july 2013 it was announced that the smhs news director darren goodsir would become editorinchief replacing sean aylmer18 on 22 february 2014 the final saturday edition was produced in broadsheet format with this too converted to compact format on 1 march 201419 ahead of the decommissioning of the printing plant at chullora in june 201420 political viewpointedit historically the smh was a conservative newspaper it did not endorse the australian labor party at any election until the 1984 federal election or at a state election until 2003 during the 2004 australian federal election the herald announced it would no longer endorse one party or another at election time the newspaper said the policy might yet be revised a truly awful government of any colour for example would bring reappraisal21 the herald subsequently endorsed the conservative coalition at the 2007 nsw state election22 but endorsed labor at the 2007 and 2010 federal elections23 before endorsing the coalition again at the 2013 federal elections the herald believes only the coalition can achieve a stable government that can be trusted to deliver what it promises24 the newspaper has in recent years attempted to spearhead political campaigns including the campaign for sydney planning and transport and earth hour environmentcitation needed notable contributorsedit waleed aly julia baird lucian boz mike carlton anne davies elizabeth farrelly peter
