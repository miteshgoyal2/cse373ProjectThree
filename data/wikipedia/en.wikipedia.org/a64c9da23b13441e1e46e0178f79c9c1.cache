christmas 2008 chip saltsman sent members of the republican national committee a music cd of 41 songs that included one entitled barack the magic negro set to the tune of puff the magic dragon the origin of the song was the title a los angeles times column written by david ehrenstein in march 2007 that criticized the reception that obama a long shot candidate at the time was getting in white america ehrenstein described the image of obama in white america as that of a magical negro a stereotypical gentle black man who helps white people often used in movies created by white people16 rush limbaugh commented on the column the day it published and interpreted it as criticizing obama himself called the column an example of the racism of the left and sang the words barack the magic negro to the tune of puff the magic dragon1718 shortly after that paul shanklin recorded a song about barack the magic negro set to that same tune which limbaugh played numerous times throughout the 2008 presidential election season19 this is the song that saltsman included on his cd2021 saltsmans campaign imploded as a result of the controversy caused by the cd and he withdrew from the race2223
