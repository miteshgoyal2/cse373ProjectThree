farm near mount sterling in madison county in south central ohio he was the son of laura née king and lemuel spencer bricker1 he attended ohio state university at columbus where he divided his time between the debating team the varsity baseball team2 and the delta chi fraternity after graduating with a bachelor of arts from ohio state in 1916 and from its law school in 1920 he was admitted to the bar in 1917 and began his legal practice in columbus in 19203 he was married to the former harriet day public serviceedit during world war i bricker served as first lieutenant and chaplain in the

of victory2 bricker espoused a stance against centralized government preferring to increase involvement in state and local governments and made this known in his inaugural address as governor there must be a revitalization of state and local governments throughout the nation the individual citizen must again be conscious of his responsibility to his government and alert to the preservation of his rights as a citizen under it that cannot be done by taking government further away but by keeping it at home — john w bricker inaugural gubernatorial address january 9 19392 bricker was the 1944 republican nominee for vice president having run with presidential nominee thomas e dewey the governor of new york who was nine years brickers junior the republicans lost handily to the democratic ticket of franklin d roosevelt and harry s truman in that campaign bricker proved to be a tireless campaigner he visited thirtyone states and made 173 speeches including 28 over a sixday period his final remarks came on radio on election eve from the governors office in columbus when he declared not only has the new deal depleted our resources recklessly spent our money but it has undermined the very spiritual foundations of our government4 though most of his campaigning was in new england the middle west and the american west bricker even visited the thenhistorically and heavily democratic state of texas where in dallas he called franklin roosevelt a front for the hillmanbrowder communist party referring to the respective leaders of the congress of industrial organizations labor union and the communist party of the united states of america political party5 in 1946 bricker was elected to the united states senate he was reelected in 1952 serving from january 3 1947 to january 3 1959 governor dewey was the republican presidential nominee again in 1948 but senator bricker was not his running mate dewey chose instead governor earl warren of california in the hope that the 1948 ticket would carry california which the deweybricker ticket had failed to do the deweywarren ticket also lost california and the absence of bricker on the second ticket may have been a factor in deweys failure to win brickers home state of ohio againcitation needed bricker had campaigned with warren in 1944 in sacramento where bricker attacked the politics of wartime rationing then in san francisco bricker charged that roosevelt had packed the us judiciary with liberal jurists hostile to the constitution5 however even if dewey had carried both california and ohio in 1948 the two large states would have been insufficient to elect him president in that second campaign brickers senate service is best remembered for his attempts to amend the united states constitution to limit the presidents treatymaking powers the bricker amendment he was the chairman of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce during the 83rd congress on july 12 1947 a former capitol police officer fired shots at senator bricker as he boarded the underground trolley from the senate office building to the capitol the two shots fired as close range narrowly missed the target6 in 1958 stephen m young ran for the senate against the incumbent bricker bricker seemed invincible but young capitalized on widespread public opposition to the proposed right to work amendment to ohios constitution which bricker had endorsed few thought that young 70 at the time could win even members of his own party had doubts particularly ohios other senator democrat frank j lausche in an upset amid a national democratic trend young defeated bricker by 52 to 48 percent bricker then retired from public life professional life and deathedit in 1945 bricker founded the columbus law firm now known as
