to become the highestgrossing film released to that point11 critics lauded it as a timeless story of friendship12 and the american film institute ranks it as the third greatest science fiction film ever produced in the united states13 productionedit michael jackson began work on et the extraterrestrial around the same time as he recorded thriller jackson began work on the audiobook of et the extraterrestrial in june 1982—around the same time he began recording his sixth studio album thriller quincy jones served as the producer for both projects in addition to working as the narrative writer for the audiobook1415 during the recording of the narration jackson became so upset when et died that he wept jones and spielberg both felt that trying to record the part again would not change the pop stars emotional reaction and decided to leave jacksons crying in the finished recording jackson biographer lisa d campbell wrote that jones had learned this during the recording of shes out of my life from the off the wall album where the singer also broke down in tears16 several of the contributors to the et the extraterrestrial storybook album had worked with jackson on his solo projects in the past rod temperton who had written several songs featured on off the wall and thriller wrote the music for someone in the dark freddy demann and ron weisner former managers of the jacksons served as the production coordinators for the album bruce swedien engineered et the extraterrestrial a task he had performed on off the wall and thriller and would go on to perform for the albums bad 1987 and dangerous 1991 dick zimmerman photographed jackson for the thriller album cover before again capturing the singer for the accompanying poster to the et the extraterrestrial album1617 once the recording and engineering aspects of production had been completed mca records the distributor of the album pressed more than 1 million copies of the audiobook in 1982 a journalist for billboard wrote that it was one of the most ambitious projects that mca records had taken on to date18 jacksons empathy with the et characteredit according to the biography michael jackson the magic and the madness written by journalist j randy taraborrelli the pop singer had shown an early attachment to the story of et after a publicity photo shoot for the soundtrack album in which an animatronic robot of the extraterrestrial character hugged jackson the singer stated with wonderment he was so real that i was talking to him i kissed him before i left the next day i missed him15 jackson later revealed in the december 1982 issue of ebony magazine—in which both he and et appear on the cover—that he felt he actually was the creature during the album recording and shared his thoughts on why he had such a strong connection to the character hes in a strange place and wants to be accepted—which is a situation that i have found myself in many times when travelling from city to city all over the world hes most comfortable with children and i have a great love for kids he gives love and wants love in return which is me and he has that super power which lets him lift off and fly whenever he wants to get away from things on earth and i can identify with that he and i are alike in many ways4 release and legal issuesedit epic records allowed jackson to record the album on two conditions mca records was not to release et the extraterrestrial until after christmas 1982 this was to avoid the audiobook competing with jacksons new album thriller the song someone in the dark was not to be released as a single1 mca records breached both conditions releasing the storybook in november 1982 and giving 7inch promo copies of someone in the dark to radio stations after epic lodged a 2 million lawsuit mca records was forced to withdraw the album and prohibited from releasing someone in the dark as a single1161920 epic executives had felt that mca was misleading members of the public into believing that the thenrecently released single the girl is mine was featured on the storybook album the plaintiffs further requested that mca records be banned from working with jackson in the future and that any other media owned by mca featuring the singer be prohibited from release18 as a result of the legal restrictions that prohibited the public release of someone in the dark as a single the promo copies which were made have since become one of the singers rarest and most soughtafter records some have been sold for over £1000 15872122 the song was later included as a bonus track on the 2001 special edition of thriller as well as the box set michael jackson the ultimate collection232425 receptionedit et the extraterrestrial was a commercial success it reached number 82 on the uk albums chart26 which was considered high for a storybook album27 the audiobook won jackson a grammy award in 1984n 1 for best recording for children293031 upon collecting the award and taking home a record eight grammys from an unprecedented twelve nominations the singer stated that of all the awards had received that night he was most proud of this one323334 et the extraterrestrial was also wellreceived critically charles l sanders of ebony magazine described it as an extraordinary album35 mark bego of the toledo blade asserted that the song someone in the dark was one of the most beautiful ballads that jackson had ever recorded1 he further commented that the amalgamation of jones production dialogue from the film jacksons effective and emotional reading of the narrative and the audiobooks grand soaring orchestration made the et the extraterrestrial album elicit as many tears as the movie does1 a writer for billboard described the audiobook as being lavishly packaged lovingly produced and worth its high asking price36 a journalist for the lexington heraldleader concluded that it was a delightful storybook album37 track listingedit side one no title writers length 1 someone in the dark
