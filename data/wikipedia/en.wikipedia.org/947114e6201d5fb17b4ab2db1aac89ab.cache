country they still do not understand why donald trump is the president of the united states”112 breitbart editor julia hahn followed bannon to the white house where she was appointed as bannons aide as well as special assistant to president trump113 bannon along with stephen miller was involved in the creation of executive order 13769 which resulted in restricted us travel and immigration by individuals from seven countries suspension of the united states refugee admissions program usrap for 120 days and indefinite suspension of the entry of syrians to the united states114115 according to the economist a british news magazine bannon and miller see mr vladimir putin as a fellow nationalist and crusader against cosmopolitanism116 at the end of january 2017 in a departure from the previous format of the national security council nsc the holder of bannons position along with that of the chief of staff were designated by presidential memorandum as regular attendees to the nscs principals committee a cabinetlevel senior interagency forum for considering national security issues4117 the enacted arrangement was criticised by several members of previous administrations and was

justifying his presence on the committee119 play media bannon says corporatist global media opposed to economic nationalist agenda video from voice of america recorded at the conservative political action conference 2017 in february 2017 bannon appeared on the cover of time on which he was labeled the great manipulator120 the headline used for the associated article was is steve bannon the

who bannon had helped select5 some white house officials said bannons main purpose of serving on the committee was as a check against former national security advisor michael t flynn who had resigned in february 2017 for misleading the vice president about a conversation with the russian ambassador to the united states1256 hence with flynn gone bannon was no longer needed5 bannon reportedly opposed his removal from the council and threatened to quit if president trump went forward with it although republican megadonor rebekah mercer urged him to stay67 the white house said bannon had not attempted to leave and bannon said any indication that he threatened resignation was total nonsense126 bannon had only attended one nsc meeting127 it has been reported that he has intentionally published stories to undermine hr mcmaster bannon has allegedly done this by leaking information to the alternative media including altright writer mike cernovich128129 it has been also reported that the trump administration retroactively granted bannon a blanket exemption from federal ethics rules that would allow him to communicate with editors at breitbart news130 which according to former

ended on august 18 2017 less than a week after charlottesvilles unite the right rally which degenerated into violence and acrimony whereas members of both political parties condemned the hatred and violence of white nationalists neonazis and altright activists the new york times noted that trump was the only national political figure to spread blame for the hatred bigotry and violence that resulted in the death of one person to many sides132 the decision was reported to have come from white house chief strategist steve bannon133 the naacp released a statement saying that while they acknowledge and appreciate president trumps disavowment of the hatred which has resulted in a loss of life today they called on trump to take the tangible step to remove steve bannon – a wellknown

claim181 bannon often describes himself as an economic nationalist criticizing crony capitalism austrian economics and the objectivist capitalism of ayn rand which he believes seeks to make people commodities and to objectify people178182183184 however he has also stated that he generally considers himself a free market capitalist believing it to be the underpinnings of our society while noting that he believes america is more than an economy162 bannons strategic thinking has been influenced by neil howes and william strausss fourth turning theory which proposes that populism nationalism and staterun authoritarianism would soon be on the rise not just in america but around the world once one strips away the extraneous accidents and technology you are left with only a limited number of social moods which tend to recur in a fixed order forests need periodic fires rivers need periodic floods societies too185 the book is said to have been a major influence on bannons film generation zero186 a former practitioner of zen meditation and a nominal orthodox roman catholic187 bannons political thinking has been influenced by the politics of american populism exemplified by andrew
