a threehour autopsy was performed the next day on behalf of the los angeles county coroner by the chief medical examiner lakshmanan sathyavagiswaran24 jacksons family arranged for a second autopsy a practice that could yield expedited albeit limited results25 after the preliminary autopsy was completed craig harvey chief investigator for the coroners office said there was no evidence of trauma or foul play26 on august 28 the la county coroner made an official statement classifying that jacksons death was a homicide the county coroner stated that he died from the combination of drugs in his body with the most significant drugs being the anesthetic propofol and the anxiolytic lorazepam less significant drugs found in jacksons body were midazolam diazepam lidocaine and ephedrine the coroner is keeping the complete toxicology report private as requested by the police and district attorney2 the autopsy report revealed that jackson was otherwise healthy27 for his age and that his heart was strong the document stated that jacksons most significant health problem was his lungs were chronically inflamed which however did not contribute to his death his other major organs were normal and he had no atherosclerosis except for some slight plaque accumulation in the arteries in his leg2829 the autopsy stated that he weighed 136 pounds 62 kg and was 59 175 cm tall which equates to a body mass index of 20130 fox news said that this confirmed rumors that jackson was emaciated31 while the associated press stated that his weight was in the acceptable range29 law enforcement agencies although they did not immediately announce that they suspected foul play the los angeles police department lapd began to investigate the unusual and highprofile case by the day after jacksons death32 by august 28 the lapd had announced that the case would be referred to prosecutors who might file criminal charges2 because the lapd did not secure jacksons home and allowed the jackson family access to it too before returning to remove certain items the department raised concerns by some observers that the chain of custody had been broken3334 the police maintained that they had followed protocol34 on july 1 the drug enforcement administration dea joined the lapd in the investigation having the authority to investigate issues otherwise protected by doctorpatient confidentiality the dea could legally follow the entirety of what appeared to be the complex trail of prescription drugs supplied to jackson33 california attorney general jerry brown announced that his office was helping the lapd and dea to create a statewide database of all medical doctors and prescriptions filled35 the lapd subpoenaed medical records from doctors who had treated jackson on july 9 william j bratton then the los angeles chief of police indicated that investigators were focusing on the possibility of homicide or accidental overdose but had to wait for the full toxicology reports from the coroner36 the los angeles times quoted a senior law enforcement source as saying authorities may not pursue charges even if the coroner declares the case a homicide because jacksons welldocumented drug abuse would make any prosecution difficult nonetheless the source said prosecutors had not ruled out more serious charges all the way up to involuntary manslaughter if it were determined that jacksons death was indeed caused by the drug propofol37 druguse allegations jackson was said to have used propofol as well as alprazolam an antianxiety agent and sertraline an antidepressant38 other drugs named in connection with him included omeprazole hydrocodone paroxetine carisoprodol and hydromorphone39 after his death police found several drugs in his home which included propofol some of these drugs had labels made out to jackson under pseudonyms while others were unlabeled4041 a 2004 police document prepared for the 2005 people v jackson child abuse trial alleged that jackson was taking up to 40 alprazolam pills a night36 alprazolam was not found in his bloodstream at his time of death3 dr aj farshchian michael jacksons friend and confidante has claimed that jackson was scared of drugs42 deepak chopra an internist endocrinologist and speaker about mind–body intervention who was a friend of jacksons for 20 years expressed concern that despite presumably having access to a large arsenal of drugs jackson appears to have been given no naloxone a drug used to counteract the effects of an opioid overdose43 chopra also criticized what he saw as enabling by some hollywood doctors this cult of drugpushing doctors with their codependent relationships with addicted celebrities must be stopped lets hope that michaels unnecessary death is the call for action43 eugene aksenoff a tokyobased physician who had treated jackson and his children on a few occasions expressed concern about jacksons use of and interest in various drugs aksenoff said that jackson asked for stimulants so that he could get through some demanding performances he said he refused to prescribe them he recalled that the singer suffered chronic fatigue fever insomnia and other symptoms and took a large amount of drugs he suspected one of the major factors causing jackson these symptoms was excessive use of steroids or other skinwhitening medications44 according to the toxicological tests effectuated on jacksons body no addiction had been reported and none of the experts called to testify at murrays trial have identified the singer as a drug addict3 janet jackson confirmed that the jackson family tried to stage an intervention in early 2007 when jackson was living in las vegas45 janet jackson and some of her brothers allegedly traveled to his home but were turned away by security guards who were ordered not to let them in he was also rumored to have refused calls from his mother if you tried to deal with him one family source said he would shut you out you just wouldnt hear from him for long periods the family denied that they had tried to intervene46 propofol an ampoule of propofol of all the drugs found in jacksons home the one that most concerned investigators was propofol diprivan a powerful anesthetic administered intravenously in hospitals to induce and maintain anesthesia during surgery47 nicknamed milk of amnesia because of its opaque milklike appearance and a play on the words milk of magnesia the drug has been associated with cardiac arrest47 but it still may be increasingly used offlabel for anxiolytic and other medically unsubstantiated purposes41 several propofol bottles some empty some full were found in jacksons home41 on june 30 cherilyn lee a nurse who had worked as jacksons nutritionist said that he had asked her in may to provide propofol to help him sleep but she refused he told her he had been given the drug before for persistent insomnia and that a doctor had said it was safe lee said she received a telephone call from an aide to jackson on june 21 to say that jackson was ill although she no longer worked for him she reported overhearing jackson complain that one side of his body was hot the other side cold she advised the aide to send jackson to a hospital48 arnold klein said that jackson used an anesthesiologist to administer propofol to help him sleep while he was on tour in germany the anesthesiologist would take him down at night and bring him back up in the morning during the history tour of 1996 and 199746 medical professionals the dea was focusing on at least five doctors who prescribed drugs to jackson trying to determine whether they had had a face to face relationship with him and whether they had made legally required diagnoses41 at least nine doctors were under investigation49 the police wanted to question 30 doctors nurses and pharmacists including arnold klein50 klein said that he occasionally had given jackson pethidine to sedate him but had administered nothing stronger and that he had
