the penniman children were raised in a neighborhood of macon called pleasant hill4 in childhood he was nicknamed lil richard by his family because of his small and skinny frame a mischievous child who played pranks on neighbors little richard began singing in church at a young age67 possibly as a result of complications at birth little richard had a slight deformity that left one of his legs shorter than the other this produced an unusual gait he was mocked for his allegedly effeminate appearance8 little richards family was very religious joining various ame baptist and pentecostal churches with some family members becoming ministers little richard enjoyed the pentecostal churches the most because of their charismatic worship and live music9 he later recalled that people in his neighborhood during segregation sang gospel songs throughout the day to keep a positive outlook because there was so much poverty so much prejudice in those days10 he had observed that people sang to feel their connection with god and to wash their trials and burdens away11 gifted with a loud singing voice little richard recalled that he was always changing the key upwards and that they once stopped him from singing in church for screaming and hollering so loud earning him the nickname war hawk12 little richards initial musical influences were gospel performers such as brother joe may sister rosetta tharpe mahalia jackson and marion williams may who as a singing evangelist was known as the thunderbolt of the middle west because of his phenomenal range and vocal power inspired the boy to become a preacher1314 little richard attended macons hudson high school15 where he was a belowaverage student his musical talent however was recognized there when he learned to play the alto saxophone his mother recalled how richard was always musical and that when he was young he would always beat on the steps of the house and on tin cans and pots and pans or whatever while singing16 she

of her gospel recordings before her concert at macon city auditorium tharpe was so impressed that she invited him to sing onstage during the concert17 clint brantley recalled that little richard approached him before the show announcing that tharpe was allowing him to open the show brantley as the promoter told him he could not however when the curtain lifted little richard began to sing and surprised brantley with his vocal ability the crowd cheered and tharpe paid him for his performance little richard was hooked on performing for a living after that18 he began singing with traveling shows that came through town and was losing interest in school he would sing to draw people to the local town prophet and spiritualist doctor nubilio who wore a turban and a colorful cape carried a black stick and exhibited something he called the devils child – the driedup body of a baby with claw feet like a bird and horns on its head nubilio told little richard that he was gonna be famous but that he would have to go where the grass is greener19 because of problems at home and school and associations in the community little richard left and joined dr hudsons medicine show in 1948 performing caldonia19 little richard recalled the song was the first secular rb song he learned since his family had strict rules against playing rb music which they considered devil music20 little richard soon joined his first musical band buster browns orchestra while performing with the band he began using the name little richard21 after his tenure with the band ended in 1950 little richard began performing for various vaudeville groups including sugarfoot sam from alabam the tidy jolly steppers the king brothers circus and broadway follies earning a reputation as a drag performer22

during an atlanta performance in 195025 in 1951 wright put little richard in contact with his manager zenas sears a local deejay sears recorded little richard at his station backed by wrights band the recordings led to a contract that year with rca victor26 little richard recorded a total of eight sides for rca including the blues ballad every hour which became his first single and a hit in georgia26 the release of every hour improved his relationship with his father who began regularly playing the song on his nightclub jukebox26 after its release little richard fronted perry welch and his orchestra playing at clubs and army bases for 100 a week27 little richard learned how to play boogiewoogie piano from teenage musician esquerita around this time28 little richard left rca victor in february 1952 after his records failed to catch on that same month his father was killed after a confrontation outside his club little richard struggling with poverty settled for work as a dishwasher for greyhound lines and hired clint brantley as his manager29 he formed a band called the tempo toppers that year and began to perform as part of blues package tours in clubs across the south such as club tijuana in new orleans and club matinee in houston3031 with the tempo toppers little richard signed with don robeys peacock records in february 1953 recording eight sides including four with johnny otis and his band that were unreleased at the time32 33 little richard had a contentious relationship with robey and soon found himself disenchanted with the record business and with his group leaving peacock and disbanding the tempo toppers that same year little richard formed a harddriving rb band the upsetters which included drummer charles connor and saxophonist wilbert lee diamond smith and toured under brantleys management343536 the upsetters began to tour successfully even without a bass player forcing drummer connor to thump real hard on his bass drum in order to get a bass fiddle effect34 at the suggestion of lloyd price little richard sent a twosong demo to prices label specialty records in february 1955 time passed before little richard got a call to record for the label37 art rupe owner of specialty records loaned little richard money to buy out his peacock contract and set him up to work with producer robert bumps blackwell38 upon hearing the demo blackwell felt little richard was specialtys answer to ray charles little richard told blackwell he preferred the sound of fats domino as a result little richard began recording at cosimo matassas jm studios in new orleans that september recording there with several of dominos session musicians including drummer earl palmer and saxophonist lee allen39 the initial cuts failed to produce anything that would inspire huge sales and little richard and his producer took a break at a club called the dew drop inn while there little richard performed a risqué song he had improvised from his days on the club circuit called tutti frutti40 the songs a cappella introduction was based on a drum rhythm little richard had devised blackwell felt the song had hit potential and hired songwriter dorothy labostrie to replace some of little richards sexual lyrics with less controversial words4142 recorded in three takes in september 1955 tutti frutti was released as a single in november43 initial success and conversion 1955–1961edit a lot of songs i sang to crowds first to watch their reaction thats how i knew theyd hit little richard44 tutti frutti became an instant hit reaching no 2 on billboard magazines rhythm and blues bestsellers chart and crossing over to the pop charts in both the united states and overseas in the united kingdom it reached no 17 on the billboard top 100 in america and no 29 on the british singles chart eventually selling a million copies2445 little richards next hit single long tall sally 1956 became his first to reach no 1 on the rb chart and the first

addition of saxophonists clifford gene burks and leader grady gaines bassist olsie baysee robinson and guitarist nathaniel buster douglas46 little richard began performing on package tours across the united states often appearing last where he would steal the show art rupe described the differences between little richard and a similar hitmaker of the early rock and roll period by stating that while the similarities between little richard and fats domino for recording purposes were close little richard would sometimes stand up at the piano while he was recording and that onstage where domino was plodding very slow little richard was very dynamic completely uninhibited unpredictable wild so the band took on the ambience of the vocalist47 during a period of racial tension in the united states little richard attracted mixedrace audiences at a time when public places were divided into white and colored domains hb barnum later explained that little richard opened the door he brought the races together48 prior to little richard audiences in musical shows were either all black or all white and no one else could come in48 little richards success enabled audiences of both races to enter the building albeit still segregated eg blacks on the balcony and whites on the main floor by the end of little richards performances however the audiences would come together to dance49 despite broadcasts on tv from local supremacist groups such as the north alabama white citizens council warning that rock and roll brings the races together little richards popularity was helping to shatter the myth that black performers could not successfully perform at whiteonly venues especially in the south where racism was most overt50 little richards show according to barnum was the first rock and roll show to use spotlights and flicker lights which had been a show business tradition accentuating little richards innovative use of colorful capes blouse shirts makeup and suits studded with multicolored precious stones and sequins51 little richards onstage antics often included running on and off the stage lifting his leg while playing his piano and jumping up and down onstage and atop the piano bringing audiences into a frenzy52 fans reacted in similar and sometimes extreme ways during little richards show at baltimores royal theatre in june 1956 several fans had to be restrained from jumping off the balcony cops stopped the show twice to prevent fans who had rushed the stage from ripping souvenirs off of little richard53 during the same show a woman threw a pair of her undergarments onstage at little richard leading other female fans to repeat the action53 little richard had nine hits in the us in 1956 and five in britain with recordings such as slippin

electrifying moviestar looks little richard accepted brief roles in movies such as dont knock the rock mister rock and roll and the girl cant help it54 his success continued in 1957 with international hits such as jenny jenny and keep aknockin little richard scored further hit singles such as good golly miss molly eventually scoring 18 hit singles in less than three years5556 good golly miss molly

wanted61 after a performance at the apollo theater and a recording session with specialty later that month little richard enrolled at oakwood college in huntsville alabama to study theology6263
