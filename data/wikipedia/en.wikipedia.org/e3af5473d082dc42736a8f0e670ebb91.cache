architectureedit main article von neumann architecture von neumann architecture scheme the template for all modern computers is the von neumann architecture detailed in a 1945 paper by hungarian mathematician john von neumann this describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with subdivisions of a processing unit consisting of an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter a memory to store both data and instructions external mass storage and input and output mechanisms2 the meaning of the term has evolved to mean a storedprogram computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus this is referred to as the von neumann bottleneck and often limits the performance of the system3 salesedit for the third consecutive year us businesstobusiness channel sales sales through distributors and commercial resellers increased ending 2013 up nearly 6 percent at 617 billion the impressive growth was the fastest sales increase since the end of the recession sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year peaking in fourth quarter with a 69 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 20124 different systemsedit there are a number of different types of computer system in use today personal computeredit basic hardware components of a modern personal computer including a monitor a motherboard a cpu a ram two expansion cards a power supply an optical disc drive a hard disk drive a keyboard and a mouse inside a custombuilt computer power supply at the bottom has its own cooling fan the personal computer also known as the pc is one of the most common types of computer due to its versatility and relatively low price laptops are generally very similar although they may use lowerpower or reduced size components thus lower performance caseedit main article computer case the computer case encloses most of the components of the system it provides mechanical support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard disk drives and power supplies and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components the case is also part of the system to control electromagnetic interference radiated by the computer and protects internal parts from electrostatic discharge large tower cases provide extra internal space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals and usually stand on the floor while desktop cases provide less expansion room allinone style designs from apple namely the imac and similar types include a video display in the same case portable and laptop computers require cases that provide impact protection for the unit a current development in laptop computers is a detachable keyboard which allows the system to be configured as a touchscreen tablet hobbyists may decorate the cases with colored lights paint or other features in an activity called case modding power supplyedit main article power supply unit computer a power supply unit psu converts alternating current ac electric power to lowvoltage dc power for the internal components of the computer laptops are capable of running from a builtin battery normally for a period of hours5 motherboardedit main article motherboard the motherboard is the main component of a computer it is a board with integrated circuitry that connects the other parts of the computer including the cpu the ram the disk drives cd dvd hard disk or any others as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the expansion slots components directly attached to or to part of the motherboard include the cpu central processing unit which performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function and is sometimes referred to as the brain of the computer it is usually cooled by a heatsink and fan or watercooling system most newer cpus include an ondie graphics processing unit gpu the clock speed of cpus governs how fast it executes instructions and is measured in ghz typical values lie between 1 ghz and 5 ghz many modern computers have the option to overclock the cpu which enhances performance at the expense of greater thermal output and thus a need for improved cooling the chipset which includes the north bridge mediates communication between the cpu and the other components of the system including main memory randomaccess memory ram which stores the code and data that are being actively accessed by the cpu for example when a web browser is opened on the computer it takes up memory this is stored in the ram until the web browser is closed ram usually comes on dimms in the sizes 2gb 4gb and 8gb but can be much larger readonly memory rom which stores the bios that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution a process known as bootstrapping or booting or booting up the bios basic input output system includes boot firmware and power management firmware newer motherboards use unified extensible firmware interface uefi instead of bios buses that connect the cpu to various internal components and to expand cards for graphics and sound the cmos battery which powers the memory for date and time in the bios chip this battery is generally a watch battery the video card also known as the graphics card which processes computer graphics more powerful graphics cards are better suited to handle strenuous tasks such as playing intensive video games expansion cardsedit main article expansion card an expansion card in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus expansions cards can be used to obtain or expand on features not offered by the motherboard storage devicesedit main article computer data storage a storage device is any computing hardware and digital media that is used for storing porting and extracting data files and objects it can hold and store information both temporarily and permanently and can be internal or external to a computer server or any similar computing device data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers fixed mediaedit data is stored by a computer using a variety of media hard disk drives are found in virtually all older computers due to their high capacity and low cost but solidstate drives are faster and more power efficient although currently more expensive than hard drives in terms of dollar per gigabyte6 so are often found in personal computers built post20077 some systems may use a disk array controller for greater performance or reliability removable mediaedit to transfer data between computers a usb flash drive or optical disc may be used their usefulness depends on being readable by other systems the majority of machines have an optical disk drive and virtually all have at least one usb port input and output peripheralsedit main article peripheral input and output devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis the following are either standard or very common to many computer systems inputedit input devices allow the user to enter information into the system or control its operation most personal computers have a mouse and keyboard but laptop systems typically use a touchpad instead of a mouse other input devices include webcams microphones joysticks and image scanners output deviceedit output devices display information in a human readable form such devices could include printers speakers monitors or a braille embosser mainframe computeredit main article mainframe computer a mainframe computer is a much larger computer that typically fills a room and may cost many hundreds or thousands of times as much as a personal computer they are designed to perform large numbers of calculations for governments and large enterprises an ibm system z9 mainframe departmental computingedit main article minicomputer in the 1960s and 1970s more and more departments started to use cheaper and dedicated systems for specific purposes like process control and laboratory automation supercomputeredit main article supercomputer a supercomputer is superficially similar to a mainframe but is instead intended for extremely demanding computational tasks as of june 2016update the fastest supercomputer in the world is the sunway taihulight in jiangsu china8 the term supercomputer does not refer to a specific technology rather it indicates the fastest computations available at any given time in mid 2011 the fastest supercomputers boasted speeds exceeding one petaflop or 1 quadrillion 1015 or 1000 trillion floating point operations per second super computers are fast but extremely costly so they are generally used by large organizations to execute computationally demanding tasks involving large data sets super computers typically run military and scientific applications although they cost millions of dollars they are also being used for commercial applications where huge amounts of data must be analyzed for example large banks employ supercomputers to calculate the risks and returns of various investment strategies and healthcare organizations use them to analyze giant databases of patient data to determine optimal treatments for various diseases and problems incurring to the country hardware upgradeedit when using computer hardware an upgrade means adding new hardware to a computer that improves its performance adds capacity or new features for example a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the hard drive with a ssd to get a boost in performance or increase the amount of files that may be stored also the user could increase the ram so the computer may run more smoothly the user could add a usb 30 expansion card in order to fully use usb 30 devices or could upgrade the gpu for extra rendering power performing such hardware upgrades may be necessary for older computers to meet a programs system requirements recyclingedit because computer parts contain hazardous materials there is a growing movement to recycle old and outdated parts9 computer hardware contain dangerous chemicals such as lead mercury nickel and cadmium according to the epa these ewastes have a harmful effect on the environment unless they are disposed of properly making hardware requires energy and recycling parts will reduce air pollution water pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions10 disposing unauthorized computer equipment is in fact illegal legislation makes it mandatory to recycle computers through the government approved facilities recycling a computer can be made easier by taking out certain reusable parts for example the ram dvd drive the graphics card hard drive or ssd and other similar removable parts can be reused toxic computer componentsedit the central processing unit contains many toxic materials it contains lead and chromium in the metal plates resistors semiconductors infrared detectors stabilizers cables and wires contain cadmium the circuit boards in a computer contain mercury and chromium11 when these types of materials and chemicals are disposed improperly will become hazardous for the environment environmental effectsedit according to the united states environmental protection agency only around 15 of the ewaste actually is recycled when ewaste byproducts leach into ground water are burned or get mishandled during recycling it causes harm health problems associated with such toxins include impaired mental development cancer and damage to the lungs liver and kidneys12 thats why even wires have to be recycled different companies have different techniques to recycle a wire the most popular one is the grinder that separates the copper wires form the plasticrubber casing when the processes is done there are two different piles left one containing the copper powder and the other containing plasticrubber pieces13 computer monitors mice and keyboards all have a similar way of being recycled for example first each of the parts are taken apart then all of the inner parts get separated and placed into its own bin14 national servicesedit recycling a computer is made easier by a few of the national services such as dell and apple both companies will take back the computer of their make or any other make otherwise a computer can be donated to computer aid international which is an organization that recycles and refurbishes old computers for hospitals schools universities etc15 see alsoedit information technology portal computer architecture electronic hardware glossary of computer hardware terms
