recording stars had come true13 in 1973 wanting to reassert his role of control jackson had his family including youngest son randy and daughters rebbie la toya and janet perform at casinos and resorts in las vegas inspired by the success of fellow family act the osmonds14 joseph had also opened his own record label ivory tower international records and signed artists under his management in which they toured internationally with the jackson 5 as opening acts in 197415 in 1975 the jackson 5 with the exception of jermaine left motown and signed a lucrative deal with epic records after

joseph fathered a child with another woman named cheryl terrell their daughter johvonnie jackson was born on august 30 197421 this led joseph and cheryl to a 25yearlong affair while raising their

1966 jackson also has a daughter johvonnie jackson who was born on august 30 1974 during jacksons 25yearlong affair with cheryl terrell26 public imageedit in the late 1980s josephs image as a father became tarnished as the media reported stories told by his children that he was abusive towards them when he managed his family he allegedly ordered each of them to call him joseph which contributed to several siblings being estranged from him michael jackson claimed that from a young age he was physically and emotionally abused by his father enduring incessant rehearsals whippings and namecalling but also admitting that his fathers strict discipline played a large part in his success27 michael first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in a 1993 interview with oprah winfrey he said that during his childhood he often cried from loneliness28293031 michael recalled that joseph sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as michael and his siblings rehearsed and that if you didnt do it the right way he would tear you up really get you32 joseph admitted to whipping his children with switches and belts as punishment but said he did not do so at random and claimed never to have used any hard object as he felt was implied by the word beating33 despite the abuse allegations michael honored his father with an annual joseph jackson day at neverland ranch34 and ultimately forgave him noting that josephs deepsouth upbringing during the great depression and the jim crow years and workingclass adulthood hardened him emotionally and made him push his children to succeed as entertainers35 both joe and katherine have denied the characterization of abuse katherine has said that while the whippings may be viewed as abuse by current generations such methods were normal ways to discipline children for misbehavior in those days363738 other siblings jackie tito jermaine and marlon have denied that their father had been abusive3940 joseph jackson was portrayed by lawrence
