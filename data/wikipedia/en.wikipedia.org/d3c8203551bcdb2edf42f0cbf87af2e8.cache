camden area the current local authority was first elected in 1964 a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the london borough of camden on 1 april 1965 camden london borough council replaced hampstead metropolitan borough council holborn metropolitan borough council and st pancras metropolitan borough council all three had been created in 1900 in hamptead and st pancras the borough councils replaced the parish vestries and in holborn the metropolitan borough council replaced the holborn district board of works and the st giles district board of works it was envisaged through the london government act 1963 that camden as a london local authority would share power with the greater london council the split of powers and functions meant that the greater london council was responsible for wide area services such as fire ambulance flood prevention and refuse disposal with the local authorities responsible for personal services such as social care libraries cemeteries and refuse collection this arrangement lasted until 1986 when camden london borough council gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the greater london council such as waste disposal camden became an education authority in 1990 since 2000 the greater london authority has taken some responsibility for highways and planning control from the council but within the english local government system the council remains a most purpose authority in terms of the available range of powers and functions in 2012 it was revealed that camden local authority has been permanently banned from accessing information from the driver and vehicle licensing agency this information is normally made available to local authorities for purposes such as enforcing parking fines but access can be withdrawn if they are found to be misusing the service the big brother watch organisation which obtained the information about the ban under a freedom of information request claimed that the public are right to be worried that their privacy is at risk across a range of government services1 wardsedit a map showing the wards of camden since 2002 since may 2002 the electoral
