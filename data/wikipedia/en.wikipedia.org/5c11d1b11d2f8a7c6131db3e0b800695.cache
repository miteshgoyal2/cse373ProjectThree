initial public offering from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search ipo redirects here for other uses see ipo disambiguation initial public offering ipo or stock market launch is a type of public offering in which shares of a company usually are sold to institutional investors1 that in turn sell to the general public on a securities exchange for the first time through this process a privately held company transforms into a public company initial public offerings are mostly used by companies to raise the expansion of capital possibly to monetize the investments of early private investors and to become publicly traded enterprises a company selling shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors after the ipo when shares trade freely in the open market money passes between public investors although ipo offers many advantages there are also significant disadvantages chief among these are the costs associated with the process and the requirement to disclose certain information that could prove helpful to competitors the ipo process is colloquially known as going public details of the proposed offering are disclosed to potential purchasers in the form of a lengthy document known as a prospectus most companies undertake an ipo with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter underwriters provide several services including help with correctly assessing the value of shares share price and establishing a public market for shares initial sale alternative methods such as the dutch auction have also been explored in terms of size and public participation the two most notable examples of this method is the google ipo2 and snapchats parent company snap inc3 china has

hendrick de keyser in dutch by emanuel de witte 1653 modernday ipos have their roots in the 17thcentury dutch republic the birthplace of the worlds first formally listed public company5 first formal stock exchange6 and market78910 the dutch east india company also known by the abbreviation “voc” in dutch the first formally listed public company in history1112 in 1602 the voc undertook the worlds first recorded ipo in its modern sense going public enabled the company to raise the vast sum of 65 million guilders the earliest form of a company which issued public shares was the case of the publicani during the roman republic like modern jointstock companies the publicani were legal bodies independent of their members whose ownership was divided into shares or partes there is evidence that these shares were sold to public investors and traded in a type of overthecounter market in the forum near the temple of castor and pollux the shares fluctuated in value encouraging the activity of speculators or quaestors mere evidence remains of the prices for which partes were sold the nature of initial public offerings or a description of stock market behavior publicani lost favor with the fall of the republic and the rise of the empire13 in the early modern period the dutch were financial innovators who helped lay the foundations of modern financial system1415 the first modern ipo occurred in march 1602 when the dutch east india company offered shares of the company to the public in order to raise capital the dutch east india company voc became the first company in history to issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public in other words the voc was officially the first publicly traded company because it was the first company to be ever actually listed on an official stock exchange while the italian citystates produced the first transferable government bonds they did not develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged capital market corporate shareholders as edward stringham 2015 notes companies with transferable shares date back to classical rome but these were usually not enduring endeavors and no considerable secondary market existed neal 1997 p 6116 in the united states the first ipo was the public offering of bank of north america around 178317 advantages and disadvantagesedit advantagesedit when a company lists its securities on a public exchange the money paid by the investing public for then newly issued shares goes directly to the company primary offering as well as to any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings secondary offerings as part of the larger ipo an ipo therefore allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth repayment of debt or working capital a company selling common shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of the open market to price and trade their shares after the ipo when shares trade freely in the open market money passes between public investors for early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of the ipo process the ipo represents an opportunity to monetize their investment after the ipo once shares trade in the open market investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in the open market or sell a large block of shares directly to the public at a fixed price through a secondary market offering this type of offering is not dilutive since no new shares are being created once a company is listed it is able to issue additional common shares in a number of different ways one of which is the followon offering this method provides capital for various corporate purposes through the issuance of equity see stock dilution without incurring any debt this ability to quickly raise potentially large amounts of capital from the marketplace is a key reason many companies seek to go public an ipo accords several benefits to the previously private company enlarging and diversifying equity base enabling cheaper access to capital increasing exposure prestige and public image attracting and retaining better management and employees through liquid equity participation facilitating acquisitions potentially in return for shares of stock creating multiple financing opportunities equity convertible debt cheaper bank loans etc disadvantagesedit there are several disadvantages to completing an initial public offering significant legal accounting and marketing costs many of which are ongoing requirement to disclose financial and business information meaningful time effort and attention required of management risk that required funding will not be raised public dissemination of information which may be useful to competitors suppliers and customers loss of control and stronger agency problems due to new shareholders increased risk of litigation including private securities class actions and shareholder derivative actions18 procedureedit ipo procedures are governed by different laws in different countries in the united states ipos are regulated by the united states securities and exchange commission under the securities act of 193319 in the united kingdom the uk listing authority reviews and approves prospectuses and operates the listing regime20 advance planningedit planning is crucial to a successful ipo one book21 suggests the following 7 advance planning steps develop an impressive management and professional team grow the companys business with an eye to the public marketplace obtain audited financial statements using ipoaccepted accounting principles clean up the companys act establish antitakeover defences develop good corporate governance create insider bailout opportunities and take advantage of ipo windows retention of underwritersedit ipos generally involve one or more investment banks known as underwriters the company offering its shares called the issuer enters into a contract with a lead underwriter to sell its shares to the public the underwriter then approaches investors with offers to sell those shares a large ipo is usually underwritten by a syndicate of investment banks the largest of which take the position of lead underwriter upon selling the shares the underwriters retain a portion of the proceeds as their fee this fee is called an underwriting spread the spread is calculated as a discount from the price of the shares sold called the gross spread components of an underwriting spread in an initial public offering ipo typically include the following on a per share basis managers fee underwriting fee—earned by members of the syndicate and the concession—earned by the brokerdealer selling the shares the manager would be entitled to the entire underwriting spread a member of the syndicate is entitled to the underwriting fee and the concession a broker dealer who is not a member of the syndicate but sells shares would receive only the concession while the member of the syndicate who provided the shares to that broker dealer would retain the underwriting fee22 usually the managinglead underwriter also known as the bookrunner typically the underwriter selling the largest proportions of the ipo takes the highest portion of the gross spread up to 8 in some cases multinational ipos may have many syndicates to deal with differing legal requirements in both the issuers domestic market and other regions for example an issuer based in the eu may be represented by the main selling syndicate in its domestic market europe in addition to separate syndicates or selling groups for uscanada and for asia usually the lead underwriter in the main selling group is also the lead bank in the other selling groups because of the wide array of legal requirements and because it is an expensive process ipos also typically involve one or more law firms with major practices in securities law such as the magic circle firms of london and the white shoe firms of new york city financial historians richard sylla and robert e wright have shown that before 1860 most early us corporations sold shares in themselves directly to the public without the aid of intermediaries like investment banks23 the direct public offering or dpo as they term it24 was not done by auction but rather at a share price set by the issuing corporation in this sense it is the same as the fixed price public offers that were the traditional ipo method in most nonus countries in the early 1990s the dpo eliminated the agency problem associated with offerings intermediated by investment banks allocation and pricingedit the sale allocation and pricing of shares in an ipo may take several forms common methods include best efforts contract firm commitment contract allornone contract bought deal public offerings are sold to both institutional investors and retail clients of the underwriters a licensed securities salesperson registered representative in the usa and canada selling shares of a public offering to his clients is paid a portion of the selling concession the fee paid by the issuer to the underwriter rather than by his client in some situations when the ipo is not a hot issue undersubscribed and where the salesperson is the clients advisor it is possible that the financial incentives of the advisor and client may not be aligned the issuer usually allows the underwriters an option to increase the size of the offering by up to 15 under certain circumstance known as the greenshoe or overallotment option this option is always exercised when the offering is considered a hot issue by virtue of being oversubscribed in the usa clients are given a preliminary prospectus known as a red herring prospectus during the initial quiet period the red herring prospectus is so named because of a bold red warning statement printed on its front cover the warning states that the offering information is incomplete and may be changed the actual wording can vary although most roughly follow the format exhibited on the facebook ipo red herring25 during the quiet period the shares cannot be offered for sale brokers can however take indications of interest from their clients at the time of the stock launch after the registration statement has become effective indications of interest can be converted to buy orders at the discretion of the buyer sales can only be made through a final prospectus cleared by the securities and exchange commission the final step in preparing and filing the final ipo prospectus is for the issuer to retain one of the major financial printers who print and today also electronically file with the sec the registration statement on form s1 typically preparation of the final prospectus is actually performed at the printer where in one of their multiple conference rooms the issuer issuers counsel attorneys underwriters counsel attorneys the lead underwriters and the issuers accountantsauditors make final edits and proofreading concluding with the filing of the final prospectus by the financial printer with the securities and exchange commission26 before legal actions initiated by new york attorney general eliot spitzer which later became known as the global settlement enforcement agreement some large investment firms had initiated favorable research coverage of companies in an effort to aid corporate finance departments and retail divisions engaged in the marketing of new issues the central issue in that enforcement agreement had been judged in court previously it involved the conflict of interest between the investment banking and analysis departments of ten of the largest investment firms in the united states the investment firms involved in the settlement had all engaged in actions and practices that had allowed the inappropriate influence of their research analysts by their investment bankers seeking lucrative fees27 a typical violation addressed by the settlement was the case of csfb and salomon smith barney which were alleged to have engaged in inappropriate spinning of hot ipos and issued fraudulent research reports in violation of various sections within the securities exchange act of 1934 pricingedit a company planning an ipo typically appoints a lead manager known as a bookrunner to help it arrive at an appropriate price at which the shares should be issued there are two primary ways in which the price of an ipo can be determined either the company with the help of its lead managers fixes a price fixed price method or the price can be determined through analysis of confidential investor demand data compiled by the bookrunner book building historically many ipos have been underpriced the effect of underpricing an ipo is to generate additional interest in the stock when it first becomes publicly traded flipping or quickly selling shares for a profit can lead to significant gains for investors who were allocated shares of the ipo at the offering price however underpricing an ipo results in lost potential capital for the issuer one extreme example is theglobecom ipo which helped fuel the ipo mania of the late 1990s internet era underwritten by bear stearns on 13 november 1998 the ipo was priced at 9 per share the share price quickly increased 1000 on the opening day of trading to a high of 97 selling pressure from institutional flipping eventually drove the stock back down and it closed the day at 63 although the company did raise about 30 million from the offering it is estimated that with the level of demand for the offering and the volume of trading that took place they might have left upwards of 200 million on the table the danger of overpricing is also an important consideration if a stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will pay the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to sell shares even if they sell all of the issued shares the stock may fall in value on the first day of trading if so the stock may lose its marketability and hence even more of its value this could result in losses for investors many of whom being the most favored clients of the underwriters perhaps the best known example of this is the facebook ipo in 2012 underwriters therefore take many factors into consideration when pricing an ipo and attempt to reach an offering price that is low enough to stimulate interest in the stock but high enough to raise an adequate amount of capital for the company when pricing an ipo underwriters use a variety of key performance indicators and nongaap measures28 the process of determining an optimal price usually involves the underwriters syndicate arranging share purchase commitments from leading institutional investors some researchers friesen swift 2009 believe that the underpricing of ipos is less a deliberate act on the part of issuers andor underwriters and more the result of an overreaction on the part of investors friesen swift 2009 one potential method for determining underpricing is through the use of ipo underpricing algorithms dutch auctionedit a dutch auction allows shares of an initial public offering to be allocated based only on price aggressiveness with all successful bidders paying the same price per share2930 one version of the dutch auction is openipo which is based on an auction system designed by nobel memorial prizewinning economist william vickrey this auction method ranks bids from highest to lowest then accepts the highest bids that allow all shares to be sold with all winning bidders paying the same price it is similar to the model used to auction treasury bills notes and bonds since the 1990s before this treasury bills were auctioned through a discriminatory or paywhatyoubid auction in which the various winning bidders each paid the price or yield they bid and thus the various winning bidders did not all pay the same price both discriminatory and uniform price or dutch auctions have been used for ipos in many countries although only uniform price auctions have been used so far in the us large ipo auctions include japan tobacco singapore telecom baa plc and google ordered by size of proceeds a variation of the dutch auction has been used to take a number of us companies public including morningstar interactive brokers group overstockcom ravenswood winery clean energy fuels and boston beer company31 in 2004 google used the dutch auction system for its initial public offering32 traditional us investment banks have shown resistance to the idea of using an auction process to engage in public securities offerings the auction method allows for equal access to the allocation of shares and eliminates the favorable treatment accorded important clients by the underwriters in conventional ipos in the face of this resistance the dutch auction is still a little used method in us public offerings although there have been hundreds of auction ipos in other countries in determining the success or failure of a dutch auction one must consider competing objectives3334 if the objective is to reduce risk a traditional ipo may be more effective because the underwriter manages the process rather than leaving the outcome in part to random chance in terms of who chooses to bid or what strategy each bidder chooses to follow from the viewpoint of the investor the dutch auction allows everyone equal access moreover some forms of the dutch auction allow the underwriter to be more active in coordinating bids and even communicating general auction trends to some bidders during the bidding period some have also argued that a uniform price auction is more effective at price discovery although the theory behind this is based on the assumption of independent private values that the value of ipo shares to each bidder is entirely independent of their value to others even though the shares will shortly be traded on the aftermarket theory that incorporates assumptions more appropriate to ipos does not find that sealed bid auctions are an effective form of price discovery although possibly some modified form of auction might give a better result in addition to the extensive international evidence that auctions have not been popular for ipos there is no us evidence to indicate that the dutch auction fares any better than the traditional ipo in an unwelcoming market environment a dutch auction ipo by whiteglove health inc announced in may 2011 was postponed in september of that year after several failed attempts to price an article in the wall street journal cited the reasons as broader stockmarket volatility and uncertainty about the global economy have made investors wary of investing in new stocks3536 quiet periodedit main article quiet period under american securities law there are two time windows commonly referred to as quiet periods during an ipos history the first and the one linked above is the period of time following the filing of the companys s1 but before sec staff declare the registration statement effective during this time issuers company insiders analysts and other parties are legally restricted in their ability to discuss or promote the upcoming ipo us securities and exchange commission 2005 the other quiet period refers to a period of 10 calendar days following an ipos first day of public trading37 during this time insiders and any underwriters involved in the ipo are restricted from issuing any earnings forecasts or research reports for the company when the quiet period is over generally the underwriters will initiate research coverage on the firm a threeday waiting period exists for any member that has acted as a manager or comanager in a secondary offering37 delivery of sharesedit not all ipos are eligible for delivery settlement through the dtc system which would then either require the physical delivery of the stock certificates to the clearing agent banks custodian or a delivery versus payment dvp arrangement with the selling group brokerage firm stag profit flippingedit stag profit is a situation in the stock market before and immediately after a companys initial public offering or any new issue of shares a stag is a party or individual who subscribes to the new issue expecting the price of the stock to rise immediately upon the start of trading thus stag profit is the financial gain accumulated by the party or individual resulting from the value of the shares rising this term is more popular in the united kingdom than in the united states in the us such investors are usually called flippers because they get shares in the offering and then
