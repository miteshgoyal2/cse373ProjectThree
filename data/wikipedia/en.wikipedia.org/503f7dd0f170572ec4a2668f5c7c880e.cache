dropping their best actress award for that year they defended this position citing a lack of meaningful roles for black women5 in 1990 they were criticized once again for not awarding best actress6 this was the fourth time it could not find enough nominees for best actress6 sandra eversmanly president of the organizations beverly hillshollywood branch said the film industry has yet to show diversity or present realistic leading roles for africanamerican women6 the naacp image awards have been the subject of controversy due to prior claims that certain nominees were undeserving of naacp attention in response parties have argued that the quality of an artists work is the salient issue with factors such as criminal charges inconsequential in this regard for example in 1994 tupac shakur was a nominee for outstanding actor in a motion picture for the film poetic justice following sexual assault charges in december 19937 more specifically shakur was accused of felony counts of forcible sodomy and unlawful detainment in new york city when a woman alleged that shakur and two other men held her down in a hotel room while a fourth man sodomized her8 shakur was also indicted with two counts of aggravated assault in an unrelated incident in which he supposedly shot and wounded two offduty police officers8 in the same year martin lawrence was criticized for winning outstanding actor in a comedy series and iutstanding comedy series and the show was criticized for its sexual controversy8 in 2004 r kellys chocolate factory was nominated for outstanding album9 while he was under indictment for charges related to child pornography10 other nominees have faced controversy due to their portrayals of major civil rights figures in 2003 the movie barbershop received five nominations including outstanding motion picture and outstanding supporting actor for cedric the entertainers performance in the film cedrics character makes pejorative remarks about rosa parks martin luther king jr michael jackson and jesse jackson content that elicited criticism including a boycott of the awards event by parks herself11 the rap group outkast received six nominations in 2004 but faced criticism because they had previously recorded a song titled rosa parks which had resulted in them being sued by parks over the use of her name10 award categoriesedit these are the major categories
