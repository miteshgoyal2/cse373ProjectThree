acquired preston north end football club pne and began the redevelopment of deepdale stadium a chance conversation between bryan gray chairman of pne and the football league led to a meeting with harry langton the man who over thirty years put together what is now called the fifa museum collection fifa recognised the importance of the collection and acquired it from harry langton with a view to finding a permanent home fifa saw the proposed museum at preston as an ideal permanent location for the fifa museum collection bryan gray formed a small team of people to work on the project including keith cooper of fifa david fleming director of tyne and wear museums brian booth formerly vice chancellor of the university of central lancashire and chris newbery director of the royal marines museum in portsmouth the football association was represented by david davies the national football museum was incorporated as a private limited company in june 1995 and became a registered
