commentary and controversies according to the washington post hannity repeatedly embraces storylines that prove to be inaccurate and takes positions that change over time35 during the bush years hannity loyally supported the president’s policies35 during the obama administration hannity leaned more heavily on stories he believed were being given short shrift by the liberal media — stories about where obama was born and who deserved blame for the attack on the us compound in benghazi libya35 in 2017 the washington post wrote that what hannity has stood for — at least for the past couple of years — is trump35 birtherism though he said that he believed that president barack obama was born in the united states hannity brought up the issue of whether obama was born in the united states and repeatedly called on obama to release his birth certificate3637 hannity also defended and promoted those who questioned obamas citizenship of the united states such as donald trump after obama in 2008 produced what the state of hawaii certified as a legitimate birth certificate hannity kept calling on obama to release his birth certificate asking if there was a birth certificate why did not the white house just produce it and we move on38 in october 2016 hannity offered to purchase a oneway ticket to kenya for obama harking back to the controversy39 2016 presidential campaign candidacy of donald trump hannity is notable for his protrump coverage35 according to the washington post hannity’s comeback coincided with his early eager embrace of his fellow new yorker trump attacked the gold star father and hannity stood by him trump went after a federal judge of mexican descent and hannity backed him even after the “access hollywood” tape emerged of trump boasting about grabbing women hannity defended his guy “king david had 500 concubines for crying out loud” after the inauguration the first interview the new president gave to a cable news channel went to hannity35 hannity also defended the trump administrations false claim that trump’s inauguration crowd was the biggest ever35 hannity was criticized by some conservatives especially supporters of ted cruzs 2016 presidential campaign as being overly favorable to the candidacy of donald trump and granting trump more airtime than other presidential candidates during the 2016 primaries hannity for instance let donald trump promote the false conspiracy theory that ted cruzs father was involved in the john f kennedy assassination35 during interviews hannity frequently cites areas where he agrees with trump or where he thinks trump was right about something then asks him to expand on it and often ignores or defends trump from criticism according to a cnn report40 tensions between cruz and hannity appeared to reach a boiling point during a contentious april 2016 radio interview during which cruz implied hannity was a hardcore donald trump supporter and hannity responded by accusing cruz of throwing this in my face every time he asked a legitimate question41 jim rutenberg reported in august 2016 that hannity is not only mr trump’s biggest media booster he also veers into the role of adviser citing sources who said hannity spent months offering suggestions to trump and his campaign on strategy and messaging hannity responded to the report by saying i’m not hiding the fact that i want donald trump to be the next president of the united states i never claimed to be a journalist42 hannity has feuded with several conservatives who oppose trump including national reviews jonah goldberg4344 wall street journal foreign affairs columnist bret stephens45 and national review editor rich lowry46 in 2017 trump was reported to often call hannity after his nightly fox program47 conspiracy theories about hillary clinton during the 2016 presidential election hannity periodically promoted conspiracy theories regarding hillary clinton and the democratic party48495051 hannity promoted conspiracy theories that clinton had serious medical problems and that the media was covering them up48525335 he misrepresented photos of clinton to give the impression that she had secret medical problems4850 he also shared a photo from the fringe news site gateway pundit and falsely claimed that it showed her secret service agent holding a diazepam pen intended to treat seizures when he in fact was holding a small flashlight48 furthermore he booked medical pundits on his show to discuss these baseless theories these pundits despite never having personally examined clinton made alarmist statements about her state of health4850 at one point hannity promoted a conspiracy theory that clinton was drunk at a rally at another point he suggested that clinton was drunk and that her campaign needed to sober her up54 in october 2016 hannity claimed that wikileaks has revealed that everything that conspiracy theorists have said over the years about hillary clinton is true55 murder of seth rich conspiracy theories in may 2017 hannity became a prominent promoter of the conspiracy theory that hillary clinton and the democratic party had a dnc staffer killed565758596035 shortly afterward he faced backlash from both left and rightwing sources and lost several advertisers including crowne plaza hotels carscom leesa mattress usaa peloton and casper sleep deciding to pull their marketing from his program on fox news616263 however usaa decided to return to the show shortly after following a negative outcry against its decision to pull out64 conservative magazine national review compared the story to a flat earth video called it a disgrace that hannity and other conspiracy theorists were hyping the story and called for them to stop65 false claims about election fraud hannity came under criticism during the 2016 presidential election for false claims about election rigging during interviews hannity responded to this by citing mitt romneys failure in 2012 to obtain any votes in 59 of 1687 philadelphia voting districts as proof of election rigging however factcheckorg and politifact found that it was not unusual at all for this to occur as those districts are heavily africanamerican philadelphia elections inspector ryan godfrey also refuted hannitys claim6667 russian interference hannity has expressed skepticism of the us intelligence communitys view that russia hacked the dnc emails during the 2016 election68 wikileaks in 2010 sean hannity said that assange waged a war on the united states and that wikileaks put american lives in jeopardy and danger around the world he also criticized the obama administration for failing to apprehend assange6970 in 2016 after wikileaks published leaked emails from the democratic national committee hannity praised assange for showing how corrupt dishonest and phony our government is7071 he told assange in a september 2016 interview i do hope you get free one day i wish you the best72 in may 2017 hannity made an offer to assange to guest host his fox news tv show73 in february 2017 hannity retweeted a wikileaks tweet linking to an article by gateway pundit claiming that john mccain was a globalist war criminal mccains spokeswoman called hannity out on it asking him to correct the record hannity later deleted the tweet74 deep state hannity promoted the idea that there is a deep state – a network of individuals within government that is working to hinder the trump administration he has described the deep state as a shadow government and deep state swamp of obama holdovers and dc lifers75 however the ideas possibility has been disputed76 in march 2017 he called for a purge of obamaera bureaucrats and appointees in government77 in an oped for the wall street journal conservative columnist bret stephens disputed sean hannitys deep state allegations saying they were an example of the paranoid style in politics78 later that month hannity said that nbc news was part of the deep state79 in may 2017 he reiterated that deep stateintelligence operatives were trying to destroy the trump presidency80 comments on sexual harassment in april 2017 hannity came to the defense of fox news copresident

alleged that he sexual harassed them hannity hosted oreilly on his show858687 some fox news employees criticized the decision86 in the interview oreilly attacked liberal media watchdog groups and said that he should have fought harder when those groups targeted his advertisers86 according to cnn during the interview hannity found kinship with oreilly as he appeared to feel that he and oreilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them86 hannity came under criticism in october 2017 when he attacked democrats after it was revealed that a large number of women had accused harvey weinstein a prominent hollywood producer and donor to democratic causes of sexual harassment88 critics noted that hannity had weeks earlier defended and hosted his coworker bill oreilly who was fired following a number of sexual harassment allegations8889 lgbt rights in 1989 hannity was fired from a radio job after making antigay comments9081 he called aids a gay disease and said that the media was hiding salient information from the public8135 furthermore hannity said anyone listening to this show that believes homosexuality is just a normal lifestyle has been brainwashed… these disgusting people35 hannity egged on an antigay activist when he said that aids spread when gay men consumed each others faeces35 said that homosexuality was a lower form of behaviour compared homosexual sex lives to “playing in a sewer and gay people of being “filled with hatred and bigotry”90 when a lesbian woman called into the show hannity said i feel sorry for your child90 the aclu opposed his firing and petitioned the station to reverse their decision hannity demanded a formal apology and double the airtime while the station did offer to allow hannity to return they would not meet hannitys

path to citizenship before he opposed that idea35 islam hannity has warned of sharia law coming to the united states91 hannity opposed the building of a mosque two blocks from the world trade center site91 hannity promoted the idea of islamic training camps right here in america which were based on an unsubstantiated “documentary” by the christian action network92 in 2006 hannity was critical of keith ellison the first muslim elected to us congress being sworn into office with an oath on a quran hannity equated the quran with mein kampf asking a guest on his show whether he would have allowed ellison to choose you know hitler’s mein kampf which is the nazi bible9394 climate change in 2001 sean hannity described the scientific consensus on climate change as phony science from the left95 in 2004 he falsely alleged scientists still can’t agree on whether the global warming is scientific fact or fiction95 in 2010 hannity said that socalled climategate the leaking of emails by climate scientist that climate change skeptics claimed demonstrated scientific misconduct but which all subsequent enquiries have found no evidence of misconduct or wrongdoing a scandal that exposed global warming as a myth cooked up by alarmists96 hannity frequently invites contrarian fringe scientists and critics of climate change to his shows97 death panels hannity promoted the falsehood that the affordable care act would create socalled death panels9899100 according to a study by dartmouth political scientist brendan nyhan hannitys show along with the laura ingraham show were the first major conservative media personalities to latch onto the false claim of betsy mccaughey a former lieutenant governor of new york that the affordable care act contained death panels99 when sarah palin stirred controversy by promoting the death panels myth and argued her case in a facebook post hannity defended her and said i agree with everything that she wrote101 hannity also claimed that he found the specific pages in the affordable care act containing provisions on death panels101 a 2016 study found that hannity promoted a number of falsehoods about the affordable care act101 for instance hannity falsely alleged several times that democratic senate finance committee chairman max baucus had said social security could be “insolvent in two years” due to the affordable care act101 according to the study hannity unlike other fox news hosts such as bill oreilly and greta van susteren took a more direct approach aggressively supporting republicans and conservatives and attacking democrats and liberals endorsing the more spurious claims long after they were proven incorrect and putting advocacy above accurate reporting to further the network’s themes opposing reform101 false claims about cnns jake tapper in november 2017 fox news distorted a statement by jake tapper to make it appear as if he had said that allahu akbar can be used under the most beautiful circumstances in the immediate aftermath of the 2017 lower manhattan terrorist attack wherein a terrorist shouted allahu akbar102 fox news omitted that jake tapper had said that the use of allahu akbar in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances102 a headline on foxnewscom was preceded by a tag reading outrageous102 the fox news twitter account distorted the statement even more saying jake tapper says allahu akbar is beautiful right after nyc terror attack in a tweet that was later deleted102 even after the deletion of the discredited smear sean hannity repeated it to his
