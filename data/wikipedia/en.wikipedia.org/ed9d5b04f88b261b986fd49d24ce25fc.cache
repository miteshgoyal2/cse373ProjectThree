dragon 6 personal life 7 published works 8 references 9 external links 91 interviews early lifeedit derbyshire attended the northampton school for boys and graduated from university college london of the university of london where he studied mathematics before turning to writing fulltime he worked on wall street as a computer programmer careeredit national reviewedit derbyshire worked as a writer at national review until he was terminated in 2012 because of an allegedly racist article published in taki’s magazine in which derbyshire wrote about the dangers potentially posed by africanamericans to whites678 derbyshire then worked at vdare9 viewsedit derbyshire writes in general from a conservative or classically liberal perspective he notably ridiculed george w bushs ittybitty tax cut paid for by dumping a slew of federal debt on your children and grandchildren10 derided bush as too sure of his religious convictions and for his richkidness11 he has noted that smallgovernment conservatism is unlikely to ever take hold in the united states although he is personally sympathetic to it called for immediate us withdrawal from iraq but favored the invasion opposed market reforms or any other changes in social security supported legal access to abortion supported euthanasia in a fairly wide range of circumstances and suggested that he might in a time of international crisis vote for hillary clinton as president12 derbyshire wrote about american schooling in his book we are doomed education is a vast sea of lies waste corruption crackpot theorizing and careerist logrolling he further argued that people had better brace ourselves for the catastrophe coming as a result13 derbyshire once argued that america would be better off if women did not have the right to vote14 in 2005 in a monthly column containing a series of miscellaneous musings he controversially stated that womens physical attractiveness peaks between ages 15–201516 future of americaedit in an august 2012 article derbyshire summed up his view of american society by saying that it is slipping into totalitarianism into a state of affairs where to hold certain opinions is to be excluded from normal society to be unemployable he also stated that given enough advance warning i can probably get my own wife and kids out to the comparative sanity and freedom of china he wrote the thought came upon me as it has done quite a lot this past few years that i shall likely end up in a labor camp i cant keep my mouth shut i cant clap along with the kumbaya and i cant pretend assent to propositions that seem to me to be false in the world we are fast heading into that makes me camp fodder for sure9 race and multiculturalismedit in april 2012 derbyshire wrote an article for takis magazine titled the talk nonblack version the article was a response to reports in the news media about talks given by africanamerican parents to their children warning them to be careful with police and to avoid arousing suspicion the article which he presented in terms of advice he had given his own children on dealing with african americans made the point that members of any race could theoretically warn their children about the dangers posed by other ethnic groups derbyshire presented multiple statistics regarding disparities in iq test scores and rates of violent crime between blacks and whites and described about five percent of black people as being ferociously hostile to whites relying solely on personal anecdotal experience to make the latter claim he then advised his readers to avoid settling in black neighborhoods avoid events that draw large numbers of black people and refrain from helping black people who appear to be in distress he advised white readers to scrutinize black politicians more heavily than white ones and to cultivate friendships with the minority of intelligent and well socialized blacks for reasons of both ordinary pleasures of friendship and for gaining an amulet against potentially careerdestroying accusations of prejudice17 in response to the commentary provoked by his piece derbyshire wrote a more extensive explanation of the points made in the article on his home page18 derbyshire also defended his position in an interview with alex kurtagić for american renaissance magazine19 a 2012 statement by him on vdare attracted more media attention leaving aside the intended malice i actually think white supremacist is not bad semantically white supremacy in the sense of a society in which key decisions are made by white europeans is one of the better arrangements history has come up with there have of course been some blots on the record but i dont see how it can be denied that netnet white europeans have made a better job of running fair and stable societies than has any other group20 he responded to the controversy by arguing that africanamericans implicitly agree given that they have been willing to live in the majoritywhite us21 after 2012 derbyshire spoke at three american renaissance conferences222324 vs national reviewedit derbyshire differed from other writers at national review magazine on many subjects for example derbyshire supported michael schiavos position in the terri schiavo case derbyshires views on the schiavo case attracted criticism from colleagues such as ramesh ponnuru25 the derbyshire–ponnuru dispute arose again over ponnurus recently published book party of death derbyshire reviewed the book harshly in the new english review26 and ponnuru replied on national review online27 though derbyshire broadly agreed with other writers at national review online on immigration he encountered strong opposition from former nro blogger john podhoretz who described derbyshires comments on restricting immigration to maintain ethnic balance in severe terms but maintaining ethnic balance is not fine it is chillingly horrifyingly not fine28 in response fellow corner contributor jonah goldberg who described himself as philosophically in the middle of the two noted i should say that i think jpod is getting too hung up on the phrase ethnic balance as a codeword for all sorts of unlovely things it seems to me that if youre going to sit down and have any immigration policy at all its unavoidable that youre going to address the issue of ethnic balance in one way or another no matter what you call it ultimately you have to choose where people come from if you have an immigration policy even if you emphasize other factors like skills or family unification so you can either look at it directly or you can skirt around it but you cant avoid it29 mathematicsedit derbyshires book prime obsession bernhard riemann and the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics was first published in hardcover in 2003 and then paperback in 2004 it focuses on the riemann hypothesis one of the millennium problems30 the book is aimed as derbyshire puts it in his prologue at the intelligent and curious but nonmathematical reader prime obsession explores such topics as complex numbers field theory the prime number theorem the zeta function the harmonic series and others the biographical sections give relevant information about the lives of mathematicians who worked in these areas including euler gauss lejeune dirichlet lobachevsky chebyshev valléepoussin hadamard as well as riemann himself in 2006 joseph henry press published another derbyshire book of popular mathematics unknown quantity a real and imaginary history of algebra role in way of the dragonedit derbyshire had an uncredited role in way of the dragon released in the united states as return of the dragon a 1972 martial arts film directed by and starring bruce lee31 of landing the part derbyshire said the casting director had obviously just trawled around the lowclass guesthouses for unemployed foreigners of a sufficiently thuggish appearance32 personal lifeedit in 1986 derbyshire married lynette rose or rosie née qi 齐红玫 qi hongmei who was raised in peoples republic of china and later became a naturalized us citizen33 they have two children a daughter and a son he lives on long island new york34 he often recounted observations from his personal life in his former monthly column the straggler in national review derbyshire said of his family our two children are as they are already tired of being told half english coal miner half chinese peasant 100 percent american35 in early 2012 he underwent treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia36 published worksedit seeing calvin coolidge in a dream
