stephen poyntz denning 1823 victorias father was prince edward duke of kent and strathearn the fourth son of the reigning king of the united kingdom george iii until 1817 edwards niece princess charlotte of wales was the only legitimate grandchild of george iii her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the duke of kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children in 1818 he married princess victoria of saxecoburgsaalfeld a widowed german princess with two children—carl 1804–1856 and feodora 1807–1872—by her first marriage to the prince of leiningen her brother leopold was princess charlottes widower the duke and duchess of kents only child victoria was born at 415 am on 24 may 1819 at kensington palace in london1 victoria was christened privately by the archbishop of canterbury charles mannerssutton on 24 june 1819 in the cupola room at kensington palace2 she was baptised alexandrina after one of her godparents emperor alexander i of russia and victoria after her mother additional names proposed by her parents—georgina or georgiana charlotte and augusta—were dropped on the instructions of the dukes eldest brother george the prince regent3 at birth victoria was fifth in the line of succession after the four eldest sons of george iii george the prince regent later george iv frederick the duke of york william the duke of clarence later william iv and victorias father edward the duke of kent4 the prince regent had no surviving children and the duke of york had no children further both were estranged from their wives who were both past childbearing age so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children the duke of clarence and the duke of kent married on the same day in 1818 but both of clarences daughters born in 1819 and 1820 died as infants victorias father died in january 1820 when victoria was less than a year old a week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son george iv the duke of york died in 1827 when george iv died in 1830 he was succeeded by his next surviving brother william iv and victoria became heir presumptive the regency act 1830 made special provision for the duchess of kent victorias mother to act as regent in case william died while victoria was still a minor5 king william distrusted the duchesss capacity to be regent and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until victorias 18th birthday so that a regency could be avoided6 heir presumptive portrait of victoria with her spaniel dash by george hayter 1833 victoria later described her childhood as rather melancholy7 her mother was extremely protective and victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the socalled kensington system an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller sir john conroy who was rumoured to be the duchesss lover8 the system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and conroy deemed undesirable including most of her fathers family and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them9 the duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of king williams illegitimate children10 and perhaps prompted the emergence of victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety11 victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night studied with private tutors to a regular timetable and spent her playhours with her dolls and her king charles spaniel dash12 her lessons included french german italian and latin13 but she spoke only english at home14 selfportrait 1835 in 1830 the duchess of kent and conroy took victoria across the centre of england to visit the malvern hills stopping at towns and great country houses along the way15 similar journeys to other parts of england and wales were taken in 1832 1833 1834 and 1835 to the kings annoyance victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops16 william compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive17 victoria disliked the trips the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill and there was little time for her to rest18 she objected on the grounds of the kings disapproval but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy and forced victoria to continue the tours19 at ramsgate in october 1835 victoria contracted a severe fever which conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence20 while victoria was ill conroy and the duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make conroy her private secretary21 as a teenager victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and conroy to appoint him to her staff22 once queen she banned him from her presence but he remained in her mothers household23 by 1836 the duchesss brother leopold who had been king of the belgians since 1831 hoped to marry his niece to his nephew prince albert of saxecoburg and gotha24 leopold victorias mother and alberts father ernest i duke of saxecoburg and gotha were siblings leopold arranged for victorias mother to invite her coburg relatives to visit her in may 1836 with the purpose of introducing victoria to albert25 william iv however disapproved of any match with the coburgs and instead favoured the suit of prince alexander of the netherlands second son of the prince of orange26 victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes27 according to her diary she enjoyed alberts company from the beginning after the visit she wrote albert is extremely handsome his hair is about the same colour as mine his eyes are large and blue and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth but the charm of his countenance is his expression which is most delightful28 alexander on the other hand was very plain29 victoria wrote to her uncle leopold whom victoria considered her best and kindest adviser30 to thank him for the prospect of great happiness you have contributed to give me in the person of dear albert  he possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy he is so sensible so kind and so good and so amiable too he has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see31 however at 17 victoria though interested in albert was not yet ready to marry the parties did not undertake a formal engagement but assumed that the match would take place in due time32 early reign see also coronation of queen victoria victoria receives the news of her accession from lord conyngham left and the archbishop of canterbury engraving after painting by henry tanworth wells 1887 victoria turned 18 on 24 may 1837 and a regency was avoided less than a month later on 20 june 1837 william iv died at the age of 71 and victoria became queen of the united kingdom33 in her diary she wrote i was awoke at 6 oclock by mamma who told me the archbishop of canterbury and lord conyngham were here and wished to see me i got out of bed and went into my sittingroom only in my dressing gown and alone and saw them lord conyngham then acquainted me that my poor uncle the king was no more and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning and consequently that i am queen34 official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as alexandrina victoria but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again35 since 1714 britain had shared a monarch with hanover in germany but under salic law women were excluded from the hanoverian succession while victoria inherited all the british dominions hanover passed instead to her fathers younger brother her unpopular uncle the duke of cumberland and teviotdale who became king of hanover he was her heir presumptive until she married and had a child36 coronation portrait by george hayter at the time of her accession the government was led by the whig prime minister lord melbourne the prime minister at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced queen who relied on him for advice37 charles greville supposed that the widowed and childless melbourne was passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one and victoria probably saw him as a father figure38 her coronation took place on 28 june 1838 at westminster abbey over 400000 visitors came to london for the celebrations39 she became the first sovereign to take up residence at buckingham palace40 and inherited the revenues of the duchies of lancaster and cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £385000 per year financially prudent she paid off her fathers debts41 at the start of her reign victoria was popular42 but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mothers ladiesinwaiting lady flora hastings developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an outofwedlock pregnancy by sir john conroy43 victoria believed the rumours44 she hated conroy and despised that odious lady flora45 because she had conspired with conroy and the duchess of kent in the kensington system46 at first lady flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination until in midfebruary she eventually agreed and was found to be a virgin47 conroy the hastings family and the opposition tories organised a press campaign implicating the queen in the spreading of false rumours about lady flora48 when lady flora died in july the postmortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen49 at public appearances victoria was hissed and jeered as mrs melbourne50 in 1839 melbourne resigned after radicals and tories both of whom victoria detested voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of jamaica the bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery51 the queen commissioned a tory sir robert peel to form a new ministry at the time it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the royal household who were usually his political allies and their spouses many of the queens ladies of the bedchamber were wives of whigs and peel expected to replace them with wives of tories in what became known as the bedchamber crisis victoria advised by melbourne objected to their removal peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the queen and consequently resigned his commission allowing melbourne to return to office52 marriage marriage of victoria and albert painted by george hayter see also wedding dress of queen victoria though victoria was now queen as an unmarried young woman she was required by social convention to live with her mother despite their differences over the kensington system and her mothers continued reliance on conroy53 her mother was consigned to a remote apartment in buckingham palace and victoria often refused to see her54 when victoria complained to melbourne that her mothers close proximity promised torment for many years melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage which victoria called a schocking sic alternative55 she showed interest in alberts education for the future role he would have to play as her husband but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock56 victoria continued to praise albert following his second visit in october 1839 albert and victoria felt mutual affection and the queen proposed to him on 15 october 1839 just five days after he had arrived at windsor57 they were married on 10 february 1840 in the chapel royal of st jamess palace london victoria was besotted she spent the evening after their wedding lying down with a headache but wrote ecstatically in her diary i never never spent such an evening my dearest dearest dear albert  his excessive love affection gave me feelings of heavenly love happiness i never could have hoped to have felt before he clasped me in his arms we kissed each other again again his beauty his sweetness gentleness – really how can i ever be thankful enough to have such a husband  to be called by names of tenderness i have never yet heard used to me before – was bliss beyond belief oh this was the happiest day of my life58 albert became an important political adviser as well as the queens companion replacing lord melbourne as the dominant influential figure in the first half of her life59 victorias mother was evicted from the palace to ingestre house in belgrave square after the death of princess augusta in 1840 victorias mother was given both clarence and frogmore houses60 through alberts mediation relations between mother and daughter slowly improved61 contemporary lithograph of edward oxfords attempt to assassinate victoria 1840 during victorias first pregnancy in 1840 in the first few months of the marriage 18yearold edward oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with prince albert on her way to visit her mother oxford fired twice but either both bullets missed or as he later claimed the guns had no shot62 he was tried for high treason found not guilty on the grounds of insanity and committed to an insane asylum indefinitely63 in the immediate aftermath of the attack victorias popularity soared mitigating residual discontent over the hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis64 her daughter also named victoria was born on 21 november 1840 the queen hated being pregnant65 viewed breastfeeding with disgust66 and thought newborn babies were ugly67 nevertheless over the following seventeen years she and albert had a further eight children albert edward prince of wales b 1841 alice b 1843 alfred b 1844 helena b 1846 louise b 1848 arthur b 1850 leopold b 1853 and beatrice b 1857 victorias household was largely run by her childhood governess baroness louise lehzen from hanover lehzen had been a formative influence on victoria68 and had supported her against the kensington system69 albert however thought lehzen was incompetent and that her mismanagement threatened his daughters health after a furious row between victoria and albert over the issue lehzen was pensioned off in 1842 and victorias close relationship with her ended70 1842–1860 portrait by franz xaver winterhalter 1843 on 29 may 1842 victoria was riding in a carriage along the mall london when john francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire he escaped the following day victoria drove the same route though faster and with a greater escort in a deliberate attempt to provoke francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act as expected francis shot at her but he was seized by plainclothes policemen and convicted of high treason on 3 july two days after franciss death sentence was commuted to transportation for life john william bean also tried to fire a pistol at the queen but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge71 edward oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840 bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail72 in a similar attack in 1849 unemployed irishman william hamilton fired a powderfilled pistol at victorias carriage as it passed along constitution hill london73 in 1850 the queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane exarmy officer robert pate as victoria was riding in a carriage pate struck her with his cane crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead both hamilton and pate were sentenced to seven years transportation74 melbournes support in the house of commons weakened through the early years of victorias reign and in the 1841 general election the whigs were defeated peel became prime minister and the ladies of the bedchamber most associated with the whigs were replaced75 earliest known photograph of victoria here with her eldest daughter c 184576 in 1845 ireland was hit by a potato blight77 in the next four years over a million irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the great famine78 in ireland victoria was labelled the famine queen7980 she personally donated £2000 equivalent to about £257 million in 2016 terms81 to the british relief association more than any other individual famine relief donor82 and also supported the maynooth grant to a roman catholic seminary in ireland despite protestant opposition83 the story that she donated only £5 in aid to the irish and on the same day gave the same amount to battersea dogs home was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century84 by 1846 peels ministry faced a crisis involving the repeal of the corn laws many tories—by then known also as conservatives—were opposed to the repeal but peel some tories the peelites most whigs and victoria supported it peel resigned in 1846 after the repeal narrowly passed and was replaced by lord john

between france and britain86 she made and hosted several visits between the british royal family and the house of orleans who were related by marriage through the coburgs in 1843 and 1845 she and albert stayed with king louis philippe i at château deu in normandy she was the first british or english monarch to visit a french one since the meeting of henry viii of england and francis i of france on the field of the cloth of gold in 152087 when louis philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844 he became the first french king to visit a british sovereign88 louis philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848 and fled to exile in england89 at the height of a revolutionary scare in the united kingdom in april 1848 victoria and her family left london for the greater safety of osborne house90 a private estate on the isle of wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped91 demonstrations by chartists and irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support and the scare died down without any major disturbances92 victorias first visit to ireland in 1849 was a public relations success but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of irish nationalism93 russells ministry though whig was not favoured by the queen94 she found particularly offensive the foreign secretary lord palmerston who often acted without consulting the cabinet the prime minister or the queen95 victoria complained to russell that palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge but palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative despite her repeated remonstrances it was only in 1851 that palmerston was removed after he announced the british governments approval of president louisnapoleon bonapartes coup in france without consulting the prime minister96 the following year president bonaparte was declared emperor napoleon iii by which time russells administration had been replaced by a shortlived minority government led by lord derby albert victoria and their nine children 1857 left to right alice arthur albert edward leopold louise victoria with beatrice alfred victoria and helena in 1853 victoria gave birth to her eighth child leopold with the aid of the new anaesthetic chloroform victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child beatrice despite opposition from members of the clergy who considered it against biblical teaching and members of the medical profession who thought it dangerous97 victoria may have suffered from postnatal depression after many of her pregnancies98 letters from albert to victoria intermittently complain of her loss of selfcontrol for example about a month after leopolds birth albert complained in a letter to victoria about her continuance of hysterics over a miserable trifle99 in early 1855 the government of lord aberdeen who had replaced derby fell amidst recriminations over the poor management of british troops in the crimean war victoria approached both derby and russell to form a ministry but neither had sufficient support and victoria was forced to appoint palmerston as prime minister100 napoleon iii since the crimean war britains closest ally98 visited london in april 1855 and from 17 to 28 august the same year victoria and albert returned the visit101 napoleon iii met the couple at boulogne and accompanied them to paris102 they visited the exposition universelle a successor to alberts 1851 brainchild the great exhibition and napoleon is tomb at les invalides to which his remains had only been returned in 1840 and were guests of honour at a 1200guest ball at the palace of versailles103 portrait by winterhalter 1859 on 14 january 1858 an italian refugee from britain called felice orsini attempted to assassinate napoleon iii with a bomb made in england104 the ensuing diplomatic crisis destabilised the government and palmerston resigned derby was reinstated as prime minister105 victoria and albert attended the opening of a new basin at the french military port of cherbourg on 5 august 1858 in an attempt by napoleon iii to reassure britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere on her return victoria wrote to derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the royal navy in comparison to the french one106 derbys ministry did not last long and in june 1859 victoria recalled palmerston to office107 eleven days after orsinis assassination attempt in france victorias eldest daughter married prince frederick william of prussia in london they had been betrothed since september 1855 when princess victoria was 14 years old the marriage was delayed by the queen and prince albert until the bride was 17108 the queen and albert hoped that their daughter and soninlaw would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging prussian state109 victoria felt sick at heart to see her daughter leave england for germany it really makes me shudder she wrote to princess victoria in one of her frequent letters when i look round to all your sweet happy unconscious sisters and think i must give them up too – one by one110 almost exactly a year later princess victoria gave birth to the queens first grandchild wilhelm who would become the last german kaiser widowhood victoria photographed by j j e mayall 1860 in march 1861 victorias mother died with victoria at her side through reading her mothers papers victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply111 she was heartbroken and blamed conroy and lehzen for wickedly estranging her from her mother112 to relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief113 albert took on most of her duties despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble114 in august victoria and albert visited their son the prince of wales who was attending army manoeuvres near dublin and spent a few days holidaying in killarney in november albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in ireland115 appalled albert travelled to cambridge where his son was studying to confront him116 by the beginning of december albert was very unwell117 he was diagnosed with typhoid fever by william jenner and died on 14 december 1861 victoria was devastated118 she blamed her husbands death on worry over the prince of waless philandering he had been killed by that dreadful business she said119 she entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life she avoided public appearances and rarely set foot in london in the following years120 her seclusion earned her the nickname widow of windsor121 victorias selfimposed isolation from the public diminished the popularity of the monarchy and encouraged the growth of the republican movement122 she did undertake her official government duties yet chose to remain secluded in her royal residences—windsor castle osborne house and the private estate in scotland that she and albert had acquired in 1847 balmoral castle in march 1864 a protester stuck a notice on the railings of buckingham palace that announced these commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupants declining business123 her uncle leopold wrote to her advising her to appear in public she agreed to visit the gardens of the royal horticultural society at kensington and take a drive through london in an open carriage124 victoria and john brown at balmoral 1863 photograph by g w wilson through the 1860s victoria relied increasingly on a manservant from scotland john brown125 slanderous rumours of a romantic connection and even a secret marriage appeared in print and the queen was referred to as mrs brown126 the story of their relationship was the subject of the 1997 movie mrs brown a painting by sir edwin henry landseer depicting the queen with brown was exhibited at the royal academy and victoria published a book leaves from the journal of our life in the highlands which featured brown prominently and in which the queen praised him highly127 palmerston died in 1865 and after a brief ministry led by russell derby returned to power in 1866 victoria attended the state opening of parliament for the first time since alberts death128 the following year she supported the passing of the reform act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men129 though she was not in favour of votes for women130 derby resigned in 1868 to be replaced by benjamin disraeli who charmed victoria everyone likes flattery he said and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel131 with the phrase we authors maam he complimented her132 disraelis ministry only lasted a matter of months and at the end of the year his liberal rival william ewart gladstone was appointed prime minister victoria found gladstones demeanour far less appealing he spoke to her she is thought to have complained as though she were a public meeting rather than a woman133 in 1870 republican sentiment in britain fed by the queens seclusion was boosted after the establishment of the third french republic134 a republican rally in trafalgar square demanded victorias removal and radical mps spoke against her135 in august and september 1871 she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm which joseph lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray136 in late november 1871 at the height of the republican movement the prince of wales contracted typhoid fever the disease that was believed to have killed his father and victoria was fearful her son would die137 as the tenth anniversary of her husbands death approached her sons condition grew no better and victorias distress continued138 to general rejoicing he pulled through139 mother and son attended a public parade through london and a grand service of thanksgiving in st pauls cathedral on 27 february 1872 and republican feeling subsided140 on the last day of february 1872 two days after the thanksgiving service 17yearold arthur oconnor greatnephew of irish mp feargus oconnor waved an unloaded pistol at victorias open carriage just after she had arrived at buckingham palace brown who was attending the queen grabbed him and oconnor was later sentenced to 12 months imprisonment141 as a result of the incident victorias popularity recovered further142 empress of india wikisource has original text related to this article queen victorias proclamation indian rupee 1862 with bust of queen victoria on the obverse left after the indian rebellion of 1857 the british east india company which had ruled much of india was dissolved and britains possessions and protectorates on the indian subcontinent were formally incorporated into the british empire the queen had a relatively balanced view of the conflict and condemned atrocities on both sides143 she wrote of her feelings of horror and regret at the result of this bloody civil war144 and insisted urged on by albert that an official proclamation announcing the transfer of power from the company to the state should breathe feelings of generosity benevolence and religious toleration145 at her behest a reference threatening the undermining of native religions and customs was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom145 victoria admired heinrich von angelis 1875 portrait of her for its honesty total want of flattery and appreciation of character146 in the 1874 general election disraeli was returned to power he passed the public worship regulation act 1874 which removed catholic rituals from the anglican liturgy and which victoria strongly supported147 she preferred short simple services and personally considered herself more aligned with the presbyterian church of scotland than the episcopal church of england148 he also pushed the royal titles act 1876 through parliament so that victoria took the title empress of india from 1 may 1876149 the new title was proclaimed at the delhi durbar of 1 january 1877150 on 14 december 1878 the anniversary of alberts death victorias second daughter alice who had married louis of hesse died of diphtheria in darmstadt victoria noted the coincidence of the dates as almost incredible and most mysterious151 in may 1879 she became a greatgrandmother on the birth of princess feodora of saxemeiningen and passed her poor old 60th birthday she felt aged by the loss of my beloved child152 between april 1877 and february 1878 she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring disraeli to act against russia during the russoturkish war but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the congress of berlin153 disraelis expansionist foreign policy which victoria endorsed led to conflicts such as the anglozulu war and the second angloafghan war if we are to maintain our position as a firstrate power she wrote we must  be prepared for attacks and wars somewhere or other continually154 victoria saw the expansion of the british empire as civilising and benign protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers it is not in our custom to annexe countries she said unless we are obliged forced to do so155 to victorias dismay disraeli lost the 1880 general election and gladstone returned as prime minister156 when disraeli died the following year she was blinded by fast falling tears157 and erected a memorial tablet placed by his grateful sovereign and friend victoria ri158 later years victorian farthing 1884 on 2 march 1882

college struck him with their umbrellas until he was hustled away by a policeman160 victoria was outraged when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity161 but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack that she said it was worth being shot at—to see how much one is loved162 on 17 march 1883 she fell down some stairs at windsor which left her lame until july she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter163 brown died 10 days after her accident and to the consternation of her private secretary sir henry ponsonby victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of brown164 ponsonby and randall davidson dean of windsor who had both seen early drafts advised victoria against publication on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair165 the manuscript was destroyed166 in early 1884 victoria did publish more leaves from a journal of a life in the highlands a sequel to her earlier book which she dedicated to her devoted personal attendant and faithful friend john brown167 on the day after the first anniversary of browns death victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son leopold had died in cannes he was the dearest of my dear sons she lamented168 the following month victorias youngest child beatrice met and fell in love with prince henry of battenberg at the wedding of victorias granddaughter princess victoria of hesse and by rhine to henrys brother prince louis of battenberg beatrice and henry planned to marry but victoria opposed the match at first wishing to keep beatrice at home to act as her companion after a year she was won around to the marriage by henry and beatrices promise to remain living with and attending her169 victoria was pleased when gladstone resigned in 1885 after his budget was defeated170 she thought his government was the worst i have ever had and blamed him for the death of general gordon at khartoum171 gladstone was replaced by lord salisbury salisburys government only lasted a few months however and victoria was forced to recall gladstone whom she referred to as a half crazy really in many ways ridiculous old man172 gladstone attempted to pass a bill granting ireland home rule but to victorias glee it was defeated173 in the ensuing election gladstones party lost to salisburys and the government switched hands again golden jubilee main article golden jubilee of queen victoria victoria and the munshi abdul karim in 1887 the british empire celebrated victorias golden jubilee victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 june with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited the following day she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in westminster abbey174 by this time victoria was once again extremely popular175 two days later on 23 june176 she engaged two indian muslims as waiters one of whom was abdul karim he was soon promoted to munshi teaching her hindustani and acting as a clerk177 her family and retainers were appalled and accused abdul karim of spying for the muslim patriotic league and biasing the queen against the hindus178 equerry frederick ponsonby the son of sir henry discovered that the munshi had lied about his parentage and reported to lord elgin viceroy of india the munshi occupies very much the same position as john brown used to do179 victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice180 abdul karim remained in her service until he returned to india with a pension on her death181 victorias eldest daughter became empress consort of germany in 1888 but she was widowed within the year and victorias grandchild wilhelm became german emperor as wilhelm ii under wilhelm victoria and alberts hopes of a liberal germany were not fulfilled he believed in autocracy victoria thought he had little heart or zartgefühl tact – and  his conscience intelligence have been completely wharped sic182 gladstone returned to power after the 1892 general election he was 82 years old victoria objected when gladstone proposed appointing the radical mp henry labouchère to the cabinet so gladstone agreed not to appoint him183 in 1894 gladstone retired and without consulting the outgoing prime minister victoria appointed lord rosebery as prime minister184 his government was weak and the following year lord salisbury replaced him salisbury remained prime minister for the remainder of victorias reign185 diamond jubilee victoria in her official diamond jubilee photograph by w d downey on 23 september 1896 victoria surpassed her grandfather george iii as the longestreigning monarch in english scottish and british history the queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897 to coincide with her diamond jubilee186 which was made a festival of the british empire at the suggestion of colonial secretary joseph chamberlain187 the prime ministers of all the selfgoverning dominions were invited to london for the festivities188 one reason for including the prime ministers of the dominions and excluding foreign heads of state was to avoid having to invite victorias grandson wilhelm ii of germany who it was feared might cause trouble at the event189 the queens diamond jubilee procession on 22 june 1897 followed a route six miles long through london and included troops from all over the empire the procession paused for an openair service of thanksgiving held outside st pauls cathedral throughout which victoria sat in her open carriage to avoid her having to climb the steps to enter the building the celebration was marked by vast crowds of spectators and great outpourings of affection for the 78yearold queen190 play media queen victoria in dublin 1900 victoria visited mainland europe regularly for holidays in 1889 during a stay in biarritz she became the first reigning monarch from britain to set foot in spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit191 by april 1900 the boer war was so unpopular in mainland europe that her annual trip to france seemed inadvisable instead the queen went to ireland for the first time since 1861 in part to acknowledge the contribution of irish regiments to the south african war192 in july her second son alfred affie died oh god my poor darling affie gone too she wrote in her journal it is a horrible year nothing but sadness horrors of one kind another193 death and succession queen victoria aged 80 1899 following a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood victoria spent the christmas of 1900 at osborne house on the isle of wight rheumatism in her legs had rendered her lame and her eyesight was clouded by cataracts194 through early january she felt weak and unwell195 and by midjanuary she was drowsy  dazed and confused196 she died on tuesday 22 january 1901 at half past six in the evening at the age of 81197 her son and successor king edward vii and her eldest grandson emperor wilhelm ii of germany were at her deathbed198 her favourite pet pomeranian turi was laid upon her deathbed as a last request199 poster proclaiming a day of mourning in toronto on the day of victorias funeral in 1897 victoria had written instructions for her funeral which was to be military as befitting a soldiers daughter and the head of the army98 and white instead of black200 on 25 january edward vii the kaiser and prince arthur duke of connaught helped lift her body into the coffin201 she was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil202 an array of mementos commemorating her extended family friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her at her request by her doctor and dressers one of alberts dressing gowns was placed by her side with a plaster cast of his hand while a lock of john browns hair along with a picture of him was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers98203 items of jewellery placed on victoria included the wedding ring of john browns mother given to her by brown in 188398 her funeral was held on saturday 2 february in st georges chapel windsor castle and after two days of lyinginstate she was interred beside prince albert in frogmore mausoleum at windsor great park204 with a reign of 63 years seven months and two days victoria was the longestreigning british monarch and the longestreigning queen regnant in world history until her greatgreatgranddaughter elizabeth ii surpassed her on 9 september 2015205 she was the last monarch of britain from the house of hanover her son and successor edward vii belonged to her husbands house of saxecoburg and gotha legacy see also cultural depictions of queen victoria victoria amused206 the remark we are not amused is attributed to her but there is no direct evidence that she ever said it98207 and she denied doing so208 according to one of her biographers giles st aubyn victoria wrote an average of 2500 words a day during her adult life209 from july 1832 until just before her death she kept a detailed journal which eventually encompassed 122 volumes210 after victorias death her youngest daughter princess beatrice was appointed her literary executor beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering victorias accession onwards and burned the originals in the process211 despite this destruction much of the diaries still exist in addition to beatrices edited copy lord esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before beatrice destroyed them212 part of victorias extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by a c benson hector bolitho george earle buckle lord esher roger fulford and richard hough among others213 victoria was physically unprepossessing—she was stout dowdy and only about five feet tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image214 she experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure215 only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public98216 biographies of victoria written before much of the primary material became available such as lytton stracheys queen victoria of 1921 are now considered out of date217 the biographies written by elizabeth longford and cecil woodhamsmith in 1964 and 1972 respectively are still widely admired218 they and others conclude that as a person victoria was emotional obstinate honest and straighttalking219 through victorias reign the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in britain continued reforms of the voting system increased the power of the house of commons at the expense of the house of lords and the monarch220 in 1867 walter bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained the right to be consulted the right to encourage and the right to warn221 as victorias monarchy became more symbolic than political it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values in contrast to the sexual financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the house of hanover and which had discredited the monarchy the concept of the family monarchy with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify was solidified222 the victoria memorial in kolkata india the victoria memorial in front of buckingham palace was erected as part of the remodelling of the façade of the palace a decade after her death victorias links with europes royal families earned her the nickname the grandmother of europe223 victoria and albert had 42 grandchildren of whom 34 survived to adulthood their descendants include elizabeth ii prince philip duke of edinburgh harald v of norway carl xvi gustaf of sweden margrethe ii of denmark and felipe vi of spain victorias youngest son leopold was affected by the bloodclotting disease haemophilia b and two of her five daughters alice and beatrice were carriers royal haemophiliacs descended from victoria included her greatgrandsons alexei nikolaevich tsarevich of russia alfonso prince of asturias and infante gonzalo of spain224 the presence of the disease in victorias descendants but not in her ancestors led to modern speculation that her true father was not the duke of kent but a haemophiliac225 there is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with victorias mother and as male carriers always suffer the disease even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill226 it is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because victorias father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers227 spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases228 around the world places and memorials are dedicated to her especially in the commonwealth nations places named after her include africas largest lake victoria falls the capitals of british columbia victoria and saskatchewan regina and two australian states victoria and queensland the victoria cross was introduced in 1856 to reward acts of valour during the crimean war and it remains the highest british
