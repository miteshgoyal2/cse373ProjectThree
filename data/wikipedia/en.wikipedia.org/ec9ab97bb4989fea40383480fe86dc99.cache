many of the articles are short under 2000 words and argumentdriven around 2010 the magazine also began running longform journalism many of the longer stories are an outgrowth of the fresca fellowships socalled because former editor plotz liked the soft drink fresca the idea is that every writer and editor on staff has to spend a month or six weeks a year not doing their regular job but instead working on a long ambitious project of some sort plotz said in an interview15 in 1998 slate introduced a paywallbased business model that attracted up 20000 subscribers but was abandoned afterwards16 a similar subscription model would later be implemented by slates independently owned competitor saloncom in april 2001 on november 30 2005 slate started a daily feature ”todays pictures” featuring

usbased sales team sells primarily to domestic advertisers many of whom only want to reach a domestic audience the end result is that outside the united states we are not covering our costs21 at the same time it was stated that there were no plans for a domestic paywall10 reputation for counterintuitive arguments slate pitchesedit since at least 200613 slate has been known for publishing contrarian pieces arguing against commonly held views about a subject giving rise to the slatepitches twitter hashtag in 200914 the columbia journalism review has defined slate pitches as an idea that sounds wrong or counterintuitive proposed as though it were the tightest logic ever and explained their success as follows readers want to click on slate pitches because they want to know what a writer could possibly say that would support their logic22 in 2014 slates editorinchief julia turner acknowledged that a reputation for counterintuitive arguments forms part of slates distinctive brand but argued that the hashtag misrepresents the sites journalism we are not looking to argue that up is down and black is white for the sake of being contrarian against all logic or intellectual rigor but journalism is more interesting when it surprises you either with the conclusions that it reaches or the ways that it reaches them9 podcastsedit see also panoply media according to niemanlab
