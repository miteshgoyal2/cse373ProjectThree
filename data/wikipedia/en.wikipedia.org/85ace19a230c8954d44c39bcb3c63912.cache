opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage supporters of the minimum wage say it increases the standard of living of workers reduces poverty reduces inequality and boosts morale1 in contrast opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty increases unemployment particularly among unskilled or inexperienced workers and is damaging to businesses because excessively high minimum wages require businesses to raise the prices of their product or service to accommodate the extra expense of paying a higher wage234 modern minimum wage laws were first passed in new zealand and australia in the 1890s the movement for minimum wages was first motivated as a way to stop the exploitation of workers in sweatshops by employers who were thought to have unfair bargaining power

that any class of his majestys subjects should receive less than a living wage in return for their utmost exertions it was formerly supposed that the working of the laws of supply and demand would naturally regulate or eliminate that evil and ultimately produce a fair price where you have a powerful organisation on both sides there you have a healthy bargaining but where you have what we call sweated trades you have no organisation no parity of bargaining the good employer is undercut by the bad and the bad employer is undercut by the worst where those conditions prevail you have not a condition of progress but a condition of progressive degeneration winston churchill mp trade boards bill hansard house of commons 28 april 1909 vol 4 col 388 modern minimum wage laws trace their origin to the ordinance of labourers 1349 which was a decree by king edward iii that set a maximum wage for laborers in medieval england67 king edward iii who was a wealthy landowner was dependent like his lords on serfs to work the land in the autumn of 1348 the black plague reached england and decimated the population8 the severe shortage of labor caused wages to soar and encouraged king edward iii to set a wage ceiling subsequent amendments to the ordinance such as the statute of labourers 1351 increased the penalties for paying a wage above the set rates6 while the laws governing wages initially set a ceiling on compensation they were eventually used to set a living wage an amendment to the statute of labourers in 1389 effectively fixed wages to the price of food as time passed the justice of the peace who was charged with setting the maximum wage also began to set formal minimum wages the practice was eventually formalized with the passage of the act fixing a minimum wage in 1604 by king james i for workers in the textile industry6 by the early 19th century the statutes of labourers was repealed as increasingly capitalistic england embraced laissezfaire policies which disfavored regulations of wages whether upper or lower limits6 the subsequent 19th century saw significant labor unrest affect many industrial nations as trade unions were decriminalized during the century attempts to control wages through collective agreement were made however this meant that a uniform minimum wage was not possible in principles of political economy in 1848 john stuart mill argued that because of the collective action problems that workers faced in organisation it was a justified departure from laissezfaire policies or freedom of contract to regulate peoples wages and hours by law it was not until the 1890s that the first modern legislative attempts to regulate minimum wages were seen in new zealand and australia9 the movement for a minimum wage was initially focused on stopping sweatshop labor and controlling the proliferation of sweatshops in manufacturing industries10 the sweatshops employed large numbers of women and young workers paying them what were considered to be substandard wages the sweatshop owners were thought to have unfair bargaining power over their employees and a minimum wage was proposed as a means to make them pay fairly over time the focus changed to helping people especially families become more selfsufficient11 minimum wage lawsedit hourly minimum wages in select developed economies in 2013 for a complete list of global wages see list of minimum wages by country wages are given in us exchange rates12 main articles minimum wage law and list of minimum wages by country the first modern national minimum wage law was enacted by the government of new zealand in 1894 followed by australia in 1896 and the united kingdom in 19099 in the united states statutory minimum wages were first introduced nationally in 193813 and they were reintroduced and expanded in the united kingdom in 199814 there is now legislation or binding collective bargaining regarding minimum wage in more than 90 percent of all countries155 in the european union 22 member states out of 28 currently have national minimum wages16 other countries such as sweden finland denmark switzerland austria and italy have no minimum wage laws but rely on employer groups and trade unions to set minimum earnings through collective bargaining1718 minimum wage rates vary greatly across many different jurisdictions not only in setting a particular amount of money—for example 725 per hour 14500 per year under certain us state laws or 213 for employees who receive tips which is known as the tipped minimum wage 947 in the us state of washington19 or £750 for those aged 25 in the united kingdom20—but also in terms of which pay period for example russia and china set monthly minimum wages or the scope of coverage currently the american federal minimum wage rests at seven dollars twentyfive cents 725 per hour however some states do not recognize the minimum wage law such as louisiana and tennessee21 other states operate below the federal minimum wage such as georgia and wyoming some jurisdictions even allow employers to count tips given to their workers as credit towards the minimum wage levels india was one of the first developing countries to introduce minimum wage policy it also has one of the most complicated systems with more than 1200 minimum wage rates22 informal minimum wagesedit customs and extralegal pressures from governments or labor unions can produce a de facto minimum wage so can international public opinion by pressuring multinational companies to pay third world workers wages usually found in more industrialized countries the latter situation in southeast asia and latin america was publicized in the 2000s but it existed with companies in west africa in the middle of the twentieth century23 setting minimum wageedit among the indicators that might be used to establish an initial minimum wage rate are ones that minimize the loss of jobs while preserving international competitiveness24 among these are general economic conditions as measured by real and nominal gross domestic product inflation labor supply and demand wage levels distribution and differentials employment terms productivity growth labor costs business operating costs the number and trend of bankruptcies economic freedom rankings standards of living and the prevailing average wage rate in the business sector concerns include the expected increased cost of doing business threats to profitability rising levels of unemployment and subsequent higher government expenditure on welfare benefits raising tax rates and the possible knockon effects to the wages of more experienced workers who might already be earning the new statutory minimum wage or slightly more25 among workers and their representatives political consideration weigh in as labor leaders seek to win support by demanding the highest possible rate26 other concerns include purchasing power inflation indexing and standardized working hours in the united states the minimum wage promulgated by the fair labor standards act of 1938 according to the economic policy institute the minimum wage in the united states would have been 1828 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity27 to adjust for increased rates of worker productivity in the united states raising the minimum wage to 22 or more an hour has been presented28293031 economic modelsedit see also labour economics supply and demand modeledit graph showing the basic supply and demand model of the minimum wage in the labor market main article supply and demand according to the supply and demand model of the labor market shown in many economics textbooks increasing the minimum wage decreases the employment of minimumwage workers32 one such textbook states33 if a higher minimum wage increases the wage rates of unskilled workers above the level that would be established by market forces the quantity of unskilled workers employed will fall the minimum wage will price the services of the least productive and therefore lowestwage workers out of the market … the direct results of minimum wage legislation are clearly mixed some workers most likely those whose previous wages were closest to the minimum will enjoy higher wages others particularly those with the lowest prelegislation wage rates will be unable to find work they will be pushed into the ranks of the unemployed a firms cost is an increasing function of the wage rate the higher the wage rate the fewer hours an employer will demand of employees this is because as the wage rate rises it becomes more expensive for firms to hire workers and so firms hire fewer workers or hire them for fewer hours the demand of labor curve is therefore shown as a line moving down and to the right34 since higher wages increase the quantity supplied the supply of labor curve is upward sloping and is shown as a line moving up and to the right34 if no minimum wage is in place wages will adjust until quantity of labor demanded is equal to quantity supplied reaching equilibrium where the supply and demand curves intersect minimum wage behaves as a classical price floor on labor standard theory says that if set above the equilibrium price more labor will be willing to be provided by workers than will be demanded by employers creating a surplus of labor ie unemployment34 the basic economic model of markets predicts the same of other commodities like milk and wheat for example artificially raising the price of the commodity tends to cause the supply of it to increase and the demand for it to lessen the result is a surplus of the commodity when there is a wheat surplus the government buys it since the government does not hire surplus labor the labor surplus takes the form of unemployment which tends to be higher with minimum wage laws than without them23 the basic supply and demand model implies that by mandating a price floor above the equilibrium wage minimum wage laws should cause unemployment3536 this is because a greater number of people are willing to work at the higher wage while a smaller number of jobs will be available at the higher wage companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded an imposition or increase of a minimum wage will generally only affect employment in the lowskill labor market as the equilibrium wage is already at or below the minimum wage whereas in higher skill labor markets the equilibrium wage is too high for a change in minimum wage to affect employment37 monopsonyedit modern economics suggests that a moderate minimum wage may increase employment as labor markets are monopsonistic and workers lack bargaining power main article monopsony the basic supply and demand theory predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised and hurts people who are not hired or lose their jobs when companies cut back on employment but proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the basic theory can account for one complicating factor is possible monopsony in the labor market whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment when affected employees spend more in other sectors of the economy though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets in the sense of the traditional company town asymmetric information imperfect mobility and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wagesetting power to most firms38 modern economic theory predicts that although an excessive minimum wage may raise unemployment as it fixes a price above most demand for labor a minimum wage at a more reasonable level can increase employment and enhance growth and efficiency this is because labor markets are monopsonistic and workers persistently lack bargaining power when poorer workers have more to spend it stimulates effective aggregate demand for goods and services3940 criticisms of the supply and demand modeledit the argument that a minimum wage decreases employment is based on a simple supply and demand model of the labor market a number of economists for example pierangelo garegnani41 robert l vienneau42 and arrigo opocher ian steedman43 building on the work of piero sraffa argue that that model even given all its assumptions is logically incoherent michael anyadikedanes and wynne godley44 argue based on simulation results that little of the empirical work done with the textbook model constitutes a potentially falsifiable theory and consequently empirical evidence hardly exists for that model graham white45 argues partially on the basis of sraffianism that the policy of increased labor market flexibility including the reduction of minimum wages does not have an intellectually coherent argument in economic theory minimum wage levels in oecd countries as a share of average fulltime wage 201346 gary fields professor of labor economics and economics at cornell university argues that the standard textbook model for the minimum wage is ambiguous and that the standard theoretical arguments incorrectly measure only a onesector market fields says a twosector market where the selfemployed service workers and farm workers are typically excluded from minimumwage coverage and with one sector with minimumwage coverage and the other without it and possible mobility between the two is the basis for better analysis through this model fields shows the typical theoretical argument to be ambiguous and says the predictions derived from the textbook model definitely do not carry over to the twosector case therefore since a noncovered sector exists nearly everywhere the predictions of the textbook model simply cannot be relied on47 an alternate view of the labor market has lowwage labor markets characterized as monopsonistic competition wherein buyers employers have significantly more market power than do sellers workers this monopsony could be a result of intentional collusion between employers or naturalistic factors such as segmented markets search costs information costs imperfect mobility and the personal element of labor marketscitation needed in such a case a simple supply and demand graph would not yield the quantity of labor clearing and the wage rate this is because while the upward sloping aggregate labor supply would remain unchanged instead of using the upward labor supply curve shown in a supply and demand diagram monopsonistic employers would use a steeper upward sloping curve corresponding to marginal expenditures to yield the intersection with the supply curve resulting in a wage rate lower than would be the case under competition also the amount of labor sold would also be lower than the competitive optimal allocation such a case is a type of market failure and results in workers being paid less than their marginal value under the monopsonistic assumption an appropriately set minimum wage could increase both wages and employment with the optimal level being equal to the marginal product of labor48 this view emphasizes the role of minimum wages as a market regulation policy akin to antitrust policies as opposed to an illusory free lunch for lowwage workers another reason minimum wage may not affect employment in certain industries is that the demand for the product the employees produce is highly inelastic49 for example if management is forced to increase wages management can pass on the increase in wage to consumers in the form of higher prices since demand for the product is highly inelastic consumers continue to buy the product at the higher price and so the manager is not forced to lay off workers economist paul krugman argues this explanation neglects to explain why the firm was not charging this higher price absent the minimum wage50 three other possible reasons minimum wages do not affect employment were suggested by alan blinder higher wages may reduce turnover and hence training costs raising the minimum wage may render moot the potential problem of recruiting workers at a higher wage than current workers and minimum wage workers might represent such a small proportion of a businesss cost that the increase is too small to matter he admits that he does not know if these are correct but argues that the list demonstrates that one can accept the new empirical findings and still be a cardcarrying economist51 empirical studiesedit estimated minimum wage effects on employment from a metastudy of 64 other studies showed insignificant employment effect both practically and statistically from minimumwage raises the most precise estimates were heavily clustered at or near zero employment effects elasticity 052 economists disagree as to the measurable impact of minimum wages in practice this disagreement usually takes the form of competing empirical tests of the elasticities of supply and demand in labor markets and the degree to which markets differ from the efficiency that models of perfect competition predict economists have done empirical studies on different aspects of the minimum wage including11 employment effects the most frequently studied aspect effects on the distribution of wages and earnings among lowpaid and higherpaid workers effects on the distribution of incomes among lowincome and higherincome families effects on the skills of workers through job training and the deferring of work to acquire education effects on prices and profits effects on onthejob training until the mid1990s a general consensus existed among economists both conservative and liberal that the minimum wage reduced employment especially among younger and lowskill workers32 in addition to the basic supplydemand intuition there were a number of empirical studies that supported this view for example gramlich 1976 found that many of the benefits went to higher income families and that teenagers were made worse off by the unemployment associated with the minimum wage53 brown et al 1983 noted that time series studies to that point had found that for a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage there was a decrease in teenage employment of 1–3 percent however the studies found wider variation from 0 to over 3 percent in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment teenagers without a job and looking for one in contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations using ordinary least squares vs generalized least squares regression procedures and linear vs logarithmic specifications they found that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment and no change in the teenage unemployment rate the study also found a small but statistically significant increase in unemployment for adults aged 20–2454 cbo table illustrating projections of the effects of minimum wage increases on employment and income under two scenarios wellington 1991 updated brown et als research with data through 1986 to provide new estimates encompassing a period when the real ie inflationadjusted value of the minimum wage was declining because it had not increased since 1981 she found that a 10 increase in the minimum wage decreased the absolute teenage employment by 06 with no effect on the teen or young adult unemployment rates55 some research suggests that the unemployment effects of small minimum wage increases are dominated by other factors56 in florida where voters approved an increase in 2004 a followup comprehensive study after the increase confirmed a strong economy with increased employment above previous years in florida and better than in the us as a whole57 when it comes to onthejob training some believe the increase in wages is taken out of training expenses a 2001 empirical study found that there is no evidence that minimum wages reduce training and little evidence that they tend to increase training58 some empirical studies have tried to ascertain the benefits of a minimum wage beyond employment effects in an analysis of census data joseph sabia and robert nielson found no statistically significant evidence that minimum wage increases helped reduce financial housing health or food insecurity59 this study was undertaken by the employment policies institute a think tank funded by the food beverage and hospitality industries in 2012 michael reich published an economic analysis that suggested that a proposed minimum wage hike in san diego might stimulate the citys economy by about 190 million60 the economist wrote in december 2013 a minimum wage providing it is not set too high could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobsamericas federal minimum wage at 38 of median income is one of the rich worlds lowest some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages others see a small one but none finds any serious damage high minimum wages however particularly in rigid labour markets do appear to hit employment france has the rich world’s highest wage floor at more than 60 of the median for adults and a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young this helps explain why france also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment 26 for 15 to 24yearolds61 card and kruegeredit in 1992 the minimum wage in new jersey increased from 425 to 505 per hour an 188 increase while in the adjacent state of pennsylvania it remained at 425 david card and alan krueger gathered information on fast food restaurants in new jersey and eastern pennsylvania in an attempt to see what effect this increase had on employment within new jersey a basic supply and demand model predicts that relative employment should have decreased in new jersey card and krueger surveyed employers before the april 1992 new jersey increase and again in november–december 1992 asking managers for data on the fulltime equivalent staff level of their restaurants both times62 based on data from the employers responses the authors concluded that the increase in the minimum wage slightly increased employment in the new jersey restaurants62 card and krueger expanded on this initial article in their 1995 book myth and measurement the new economics of the minimum wage63 they argued that the negative employment effects of minimum wage laws are minimal if not nonexistent for example they look at the 1992 increase in new jerseys minimum wage the 1988 rise in californias minimum wage and the 1990–91 increases in the federal minimum wage in addition to their own findings they reanalyzed earlier studies with updated data generally finding that the older results of a negative employment effect did not hold up in the larger datasets64 research subsequent to card and kruegers workedit a 2010 study published in the review of economics and statistics compared 288 pairs of contiguous us counties with minimum wage differentials from 1990 to 2006 and found no adverse employment effects from a minimum wage increase contiguous counties with different minimum wages are in purple all other counties are in white65 in 1996 david neumark and william wascher reexamined card and kruegers result using administrative payroll records from a sample of large fast food restaurant chains and reported that minimum wage increases were followed by decreases in employment an assessment of data collected and analyzed by neumark and wascher did not initially contradict the card and krueger results66 but in a later edited version they found a four percent decrease in employment and reported that the estimated disemployment effects in the payroll data are often statistically significant at the 5 or 10percent level although there are some estimators and subsamples that yield insignificant—although almost always negative employment effects6768 neumark and waschers conclusions were subsequently rebutted in a 2000 paper by card and krueger69 a 2011 paper has reconciled the difference between card and kruegers survey data and neumark and waschers payrollbased data the paper shows that both datasets evidence conditional employment effects that are positive for small restaurants but are negative for large fastfood restaurants70 a 2014 analysis based on panel data found that the minimum wage reduces employment among teenagers71 in 1996 and 1997 the federal minimum wage was increased from 425 to 515 thereby increasing the minimum wage by 090 in pennsylvania but by just 010 in new jersey this allowed for an examination of the effects of minimum wage increases in the same area subsequent to the 1992 change studied by card and krueger a study by hoffman and trace found the result anticipated by traditional theory a detrimental effect on employment72 further application of the methodology used by card and krueger by other researchers yielded results similar to their original findings across additional data sets73 a 2010 study by three economists arindrajit dube of the university of massachusetts amherst william lester of the university of north carolina at chapel hill and michael reich of the university of california berkeley compared adjacent counties in different states where the minimum wage had been raised in one of the states they analyzed employment trends for several categories of lowwage workers from 1990 to 2006 and found that increases in minimum wages had no negative effects on lowwage employment and successfully increased the income of workers in food services and retail employment as well as the narrower category of workers in restaurants7374 however a 2011 study by baskaya and rubinstein of brown university found that at the federal level a rise in minimum wage have sic an instantaneous impact on wage rates and a corresponding negative impact on employment stating minimum wage increases boost teenage wage rates and reduce teenage employment75 another 2011 study by sen rybczynski and van de waal found that a 10 increase in the minimum wage is significantly correlated with a 3−5 drop in teen employment76 a 2012 study by sabia hansen and burkhauser found that minimum wage increases can have substantial adverse labor demand effects for lowskilled individuals with the largest effects on those aged 16 to 2477 a 2013 study by meer and west concluded that the minimum wage reduces net job growth primarily through its effect on job creation by expanding establishments most pronounced for younger workers and in industries with a higher proportion of lowwage workers78 this study by meer and west was later critiqued for its trends of assumption in the context of narrowly defined lowwage groups79 the authors replied to the critiques and released additional data which addressed the criticism of their methodology but did not resolve the issue of whether their data showed a causal relationship8081 another 2013 study by suzana laporšek of the university of primorska on youth unemployment in europe claimed there was a negative statistically significant impact of minimum wage on youth employment82 a 2013 study by labor economists tony fang and carl lin which studied minimum wages and employment in china found that minimum wage changes have significant adverse effects on employment in the eastern and central regions of china and result in disemployment for females young adults and lowskilled workers8384 statistical metaanalysesedit several researchers have conducted statistical metaanalyses of the employment effects of the minimum wage in 1995 card and krueger analyzed 14 earlier timeseries studies on minimum wages and concluded that there was clear evidence of publication bias in favor of studies that found a statistically significant negative employment effect they point out that later studies which had more data and lower standard errors did not show the expected increase in tstatistic almost all the studies had a tstatistic of about two just above the level of statistical significance at the 05 level85 though a serious methodological indictment opponents of the minimum wage largely ignored this issue as thomas leonard noted the silence is fairly deafening86 in 2005 td stanley showed that card and kruegers results could signify either publication bias or the absence of a minimum wage effect however using a different methodology stanley concluded that there is evidence of publication bias and that correction of this bias shows no relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment87 in 2008 hristos doucouliagos and td stanley conducted a similar metaanalysis of 64 us studies on disemployment effects and concluded that card and kruegers initial claim of publication bias is still correct moreover they concluded once this publication selection is corrected little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains88 in 2013 a metaanalysis of 16 uk studies found that the minimum wage has no significant effects on employment89 debate over consequencesedit minimum wage laws affect workers in most lowpaid fields of employment11 and have usually been judged against the criterion of reducing poverty90 minimum wage laws receive less support from economists than from the general public despite decades of experience and economic research debates about the costs and benefits of minimum wages continue today11 various groups have great ideological political financial and emotional investments in issues surrounding minimum wage laws for example agencies that administer the laws have a vested interest in showing that their laws do not create unemployment as do labor unions whose members finances are protected by minimum wage laws on the other side of the issue lowwage employers such as restaurants finance the employment policies institute which has released numerous studies opposing the minimum wage9192 the presence of these powerful groups and factors means that the debate on the issue is not always based on dispassionate analysis additionally it is extraordinarily difficult to separate the effects of minimum wage from all the other variables that affect employment23 the following table summarizes the arguments made by those for and against minimum wage laws arguments in favor of minimum wage laws arguments against minimum wage laws supporters of the minimum wage claim it has these effects positive impact on small business owners and industry93 removes financial stress94 and encourages education95 resulting in better paying jobs increased job growth and creation9697 increases the standard of living for the poorest and most vulnerable class in society and raises average98 increases incentives to take jobs as opposed to other methods of transferring income to the poor that are not tied to employment such as food subsidies for the poor or welfare payments for the unemployed99 stimulates consumption by putting more money in the hands of lowincome people who spend their entire paychecks hence increases circulation of money through the economy98 encourages efficiency and automation of industry100 removes low paying jobs forcing workers to train for and move to higher paying jobs101102 increases technological development costly technology that increases business efficiency is more appealing as the price of labor increases103 increases the work ethic of those who earn very little as employers demand more return from the higher cost of hiring these employees98 decreases the cost of government social welfare programs by increasing incomes for the lowestpaid98 encourages people to join the workforce rather than pursuing money through illegal means eg selling illegal drugs104105 opponents of the minimum wage claim it has these effects minimum wage alone is not effective at alleviating poverty and in fact produces a net increase in poverty due to disemployment effects106 as a labor market analogue of politicaleconomic protectionism it excludes low cost competitors from labor markets and hampers firms in reducing wage costs during trade downturns this generates various industrialeconomic inefficiencies107 hurts small business more than large business108 reduces quantity demanded of workers either through a reduction in the number of hours worked by individuals or through a reduction in the number of jobs109110 may cause price inflation as businesses try to compensate by raising the prices of the goods being sold111112 benefits some workers at the expense of the poorest and least productive113 encourages employers to replace lowskilled workers with computers such as selfcheckout machines114 increases property crime and misery in poor communities by decreasing legal markets of production and consumption in those communities115 can result in the exclusion of certain groups ethnic gender etc from the labor force116 small firms with limited payroll budgets cannot offer their most valuable employees fair and attractive wages above unskilled workers paid the artificially high minimum and see a rising hurdlecost of adding workers108 is less effective than other methods eg the earned income tax credit at reducing poverty and is more damaging to businesses than those other methods117 discourages further education among the poor by enticing people to enter the job market117 discriminates against through pricing out less qualified workers including newcomers to the labor market eg young workers by keeping them from accumulating work experience and qualifications hence potentially graduating to higher wages later3 slows growth in the creation of lowskilled jobs78 results in jobs moving to other areas or countries which allow lowercost laborcitation needed results in higher longterm unemployment118 results in higher prices for consumers where products and services are produced by minimumwage workers119 though nonlabor costs represent a greater proportion of costs to consumers in industries like fast food and discount retail120121 a widely circulated argument that the minimum wage was ineffective at reducing poverty was provided by george stigler in 1949 employment may fall more than in proportion to the wage increase thereby reducing overall earnings as uncovered sectors of the economy absorb workers released from the covered sectors the decrease in wages in the uncovered sectors may exceed the increase in wages in the covered ones the impact of the minimum wage on family income distribution may be negative unless the fewer but better jobs are allocated to members of needy families rather than to for example teenagers from families not in poverty forbidding employers to pay less than a legal minimum is equivalent to forbidding workers to sell their labor for less than the minimum wage the legal restriction that employers cannot pay less than a legislated wage is equivalent to the legal restriction that workers cannot work at all in the protected sector unless they can find employers willing to hire them at that wage90 in 2006 the international labour organization ilo argued that the minimum wage could not be directly linked to unemployment in countries that have suffered job losses5 in april 2010 the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd released a report arguing that countries could alleviate teen unemployment by lowering the cost of employing lowskilled youth through a subminimum training wage122 a study of us states showed that businesses annual and average payrolls grow faster and employment grew at a faster rate in states with a minimum wage123 the study showed a correlation but did not claim to prove causation although strongly opposed by both the business community and the conservative party when introduced in the uk in 1999 the conservatives reversed their opposition in 2000124 accounts differ as to the effects of the minimum wage the centre for economic performance found no discernible impact on employment levels from the wage increases125 while the low pay commission found that employers had reduced their rate of hiring and employee hours employed and found ways to cause current workers to be more productive especially service companies126 the institute for the study of labor found prices in the minimum wage sector rose significantly faster than prices in nonminimum wage sectors in the four years following the implementation of the minimum wage127 neither trade unions nor employer organizations contest the minimum wage although the latter had especially done so heavily until 1999 in 2014 supporters of minimum wage cited a study that found that job creation within the united states is faster in states that raised their minimum wages96128129 in 2014 supporters of minimum wage cited news organizations who reported the state with the highest minimumwage garnered more job creation than the rest of the united states9697130131132133134 in 2014 in seattle washington liberal and progressive business owners who had supported the citys new 15 minimum wage said they might hold off on expanding their businesses and thus creating new jobs due to the uncertain timescale of the wage increase implementation135 however subsequently at least two of the business owners quoted did expand136137 the dollar value of the minimum wage loses purchasing power over time due to inflation minimum wage laws for instance proposals to index the minimum wage to average wages have the potential to keep the dollar value of the minimum wage relevant and predictable138 with regard to the economic effects of introducing minimum wage legislation in germany in january 2015 recent developments have shown that the feared increase in unemployment has not materialized however in some economic sectors and regions of the country it came to a decline in job opportunities particularly for temporary and parttime workers and some lowwage jobs have disappeared entirely139 because of this overall positive development the deutsche bundesbank revised its opinion and ascertained that “the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage on the total volume of work appears to be very limited in the present business cycle”140 surveys of economistsedit according to a 1978 article in the american economic review 90 of the economists surveyed agreed that the minimum wage increases unemployment among lowskilled workers141 by 1992 the survey found 79 of economists in agreement with that statement142 and by 2000 456 were in full agreement with the statement and 279 agreed with provisos 735 total143144 the authors of the 2000 study also reweighted data from a 1990 sample to show that at that time 624 of academic economists agreed with the statement above while 195 agreed with provisos and 175 disagreed they state that the reduction on consensus on this question is likely due to the card and krueger research and subsequent debate145 a similar survey in 2006 by robert whaples polled phd members of the american economic association aea whaples found that 468 respondents wanted the minimum wage eliminated 377 supported an increase 143 wanted it kept at the current level and 13 wanted it decreased146 another survey in 2007 conducted by the university of new hampshire survey center found that 73 of labor economists surveyed in the united states believed 150 of the thencurrent minimum wage would result in employment losses and 68 believed a mandated minimum wage would cause an increase in hiring of workers with greater skills 31 felt that no hiring changes would result147 surveys of labor economists have found a sharp split on the minimum wage fuchs et al 1998 polled labor economists at the top 40 research universities in the united states on a variety of questions in the summer of 1996 their 65 respondents were nearly evenly divided when asked if the minimum wage should be increased they argued that the different policy views were not related to views on whether raising the minimum wage would reduce teen employment the median economist said there would be a reduction of 1 but on value differences such as income redistribution148 daniel b klein and stewart dompe conclude on the basis of previous surveys the average level of support for the minimum wage is somewhat higher among labor economists than among aea members149 in 2007 klein and dompe conducted a nonanonymous survey of supporters of the minimum wage who had signed the raise the minimum wage statement published by the economic policy institute 95 of the 605 signatories responded they found that a majority signed on the grounds that it transferred income from employers to workers or equalized bargaining power between them in the labor market in addition a majority considered disemployment to be a moderate potential drawback to the increase they supported149 in 2013 a diverse group of 37 economics professors was surveyed on their view of the minimum wages impact on employment 34 of respondents agreed with the statement raising the federal minimum wage to 9 per hour would make it noticeably harder for lowskilled workers to find employment 32 disagreed and the remaining respondents were uncertain or had no opinion on the question 47 agreed with the statement the distortionary costs of raising the federal minimum wage to 9 per hour and indexing it to inflation are sufficiently small compared with the benefits to lowskilled workers who can find employment that this would be a desirable policy while 11 disagreed150 alternativesedit economists and other political commentators have proposed alternatives to the minimum wage they argue that these alternatives may address the issue of poverty better than a minimum wage as it would benefit a broader population of low wage earners not cause any unemployment and distribute the costs widely rather than concentrating it on employers of low wage workers basic incomeedit main article basic income a basic income or negative income tax is a system of social security that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on frugally it is argued that recipients of the basic income would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer as there would be no risk of destitution for not taking the employment as a result the jobseeker could spend more time looking for a more appropriate or satisfying job or they could wait until a higherpaying job appeared alternatively they could spend more time increasing their skills in university which would make them more suitable for higherpaying jobs as well as provide numerous other benefits experiments on basic income and nit in canada and the usa show that people spent more time studying while the program was running151 proponents argue that a basic income that is based on a broad tax base would be more economically efficient as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers causing losses in efficiencycitation needed guaranteed minimum incomeedit a guaranteed minimum income is another proposed system of social welfare provision it is similar to a basic income or negative income tax system except that it is normally conditional and subject to a means test some proposals also stipulate a willingness to participate in the labor market or a willingness to perform community services152 refundable tax creditedit a refundable tax credit is a mechanism whereby the tax system can reduce the tax owed by a household to below zero and result in a net payment to the taxpayer beyond their own payments into the tax system examples of refundable tax credits include the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit in the us and working tax credits and child tax credits in the uk such a system is slightly different from a negative income tax in that the refundable tax credit is usually only paid to households that have earned at least some income this policy is more targeted against poverty than the minimum wage because it avoids subsidizing lowincome workers who are supported by highincome households for example teenagers still living with their parents153 in the united states earned income tax credit rates also known as eitc or eic vary by state—some are refundable while other states do not allow a refundable tax credit154 the federal eitc program has been expanded by a number of presidents including jimmy carter ronald reagan george hw bush and bill clinton155 in 1986 president reagan described the eitc as the best anti poverty the best profamily the best job creation measure to come out of congress156 the ability of the earned income tax credit to deliver larger monetary benefits to the poor workers than an increase in the minimum wage and at a lower cost to society was documented in a 2007 report by the congressional budget office157 the adam smith institute prefers cutting taxes on the poor and middle class instead of raising wages as an alternative to the minimum wage158 collective bargainingedit italy sweden norway finland and denmark are examples of developed nations where there is no minimum wage that is required by legislation1618 such nations particularly the nordics have very high union participation rates159 instead minimum wage standards in different sectors are set by collective bargaining160 wage subsidiesedit some economists such as scott sumner161 and edmund phelps162 advocate a wage subsidy program a wage subsidy is a payment made by a government for work people do it is based either on an hourly basis or by income earned advocates argue that the primary deficiencies of the eitc and the minimum wage are best avoided by a wage subsidy163164 however the wage subsidy in america suffers from a lack of political support from either major political party165166 us movementedit main article minimum wage in the united states in january 2014 seven nobel economists—kenneth arrow peter diamond eric maskin thomas schelling robert solow michael spence and joseph stiglitz—and 600 other economists wrote a letter to the us congress and the us president urging that by 2016 the us government should raise the minimum wage to 1010 they endorsed the minimum wage fairness act which was introduced by us senator tom harkin in 2013167168 us senator bernie sanders introduced a bill in 2015 that would raise the minimum wage to 15 and in his 2016 campaign for president ran on a platform of increasing it169170 although sanders did not become the nominee the democratic national committee adopted his 15 minimum wage push in their 2016 party platform171 reactions from former mcdonalds usa ed rensi about raising minimum wage to 15 is to completely push humans out of the picture when it comes to labor if they are to pay minimum wage at 15 they would look into replacing humans with machines as that would be the more costeffective than having employees that are ineffective during an interview on fox business network’s mornings with maria he stated that he believes an increase to 15 an hour would cause job loss at an extraordinary level rensi also believes it does not only affect the fast food industry franchising he sees as the best business model in the united states it is dependent on people that have low job skills that have to grow and if you cannot pay them a reasonable wage then they are going to be replaced with machines172 in late march 2016 governor of california jerry brown reached a deal to raise the minimum wage to 15 by 2022 for big businesses and 2023 for smaller businesses173 in contrast the relatively high minimum wage in puerto rico has been blamed by various politicians and commentators as a highly significant factor in the puerto rican governmentdebt crisis174175176 one study concluded that employers are disinclined to hire workers because the us federal minimum wage is very high relative to the local average177 as of december 2014 unions were exempt from recent minimum wage increases in chicago illinois seatac washington and milwaukee county wisconsin as well as the california cities of los angeles san francisco long beach san jose richmond and oakland178 online
