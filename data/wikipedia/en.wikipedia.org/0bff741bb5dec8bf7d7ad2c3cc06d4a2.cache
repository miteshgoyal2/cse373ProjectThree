suddenly of a heart attack in 1990 at the age of 53 holmes à court was one of the worlds most feared corporate raiders through the 1980s having built his empire singlehandedly from virtually nothing

melbourne cup 5 events after his death 6 notes 7 references 8 further reading early lifeedit holmes à court was born in johannesburg but spent much of his early life in southern rhodesia now zimbabwe he was educated at cordwalles preparatory school and michaelhouse school in natal south africa there he earned money selling his schoolmates photographs he had taken of them and by driving them home in exchange for their travel allowances6 holmes à court studied forestry at the university of auckland and massey university where he graduated with a bachelor of agricultural science in 1962 he then moved to perth western australia in 1961 to study law at the university of western australia where he graduated with a bachelor of laws in 1965 he married science teacher janet ranford on 18 may 1966 holmes à court was admitted to practise on 17 april 1968 he then worked as a barrister and solicitor his law practice in perth was sometimes in partnership with nicholas hasluck business careeredit holmes à court entered the corporate stage by accident in 1970 when his law firm was asked to act as administrative receiver of a small publicly listed company western australian worsted woollen mills later albany woollen mills also known as awm or wa wool the company was the single largest employer in the regional city of albany in what he later described as his most challenging takeover probably because it was his first he found a way to invest 500000 in the ailing business on the proviso that the state minister for industry sir charles court would persuade the government of western australia to forgive the 500000 in loans they had made the source of funds for his initial investment in wa wool were never made clear since the 75000 deposit for the purchase price of wa wool shares came from a bank account that he shared with the partners in his law firm at the time and his partners asked for these funds to be repaid7 nevertheless since holmes à court had no other apparent source of income at the time a possibility is that his mother ethnee financed his first foray into business since she had stood to inherit from her mother florence who in turn had stood to inherit from her second husband hr cumming a wealthy rhodesian land owner businessman and colleague of cecil rhodes himself cumming had helped raise ethnee during her childhood on his estate outside gweru as an adult and while living in rhodesia and south africa ethnee had also established and sold both a riding school and a game lodge in chobe and eventually sold several properties that she owned as investments giving the funds to robert to manage on her migration to australia in 19678 after acquiring wa wool holmes à court made it more competitive by reducing production costs mainly by installing the latest wool milling and weaving machinery this was acquired on favourable terms from a leading belgian equipment manufacturer which was keen to enter the australian market at that time he now controlled a company listed on the australian stock exchange and from there he began to gain control of a string of small businesses including westate electrical industries by 1990 holmes à court had died of a heart attack and leaving his business affairs in disarray as he had died intestate the bell groupedit in 1973 holmes à courts awm acquired bell brothers a well known west australian transport and contracting group for 96 million through a reverse takeover bell brothers would ultimately become his flagship company as bell resources ltd bell acquired media interests including the albany advertiser the katanning weekly the great southern herald the collie mail and radio station 6va it also made unsuccessful bids for companies such as griffin coal greenbushes tin and emu wines these bids while unsuccessful earned significant profits mainly by aggressive defences from owners resulting in inflated share prices held by the bidder in 1977 holmes à courts brother simon disappeared in mysterious circumstances in africa9 his abandoned car was found more than 1000 km from his home and where he was last seen in botswana author geoff elliott wrote a book about the disappearance10 during 1979 bell made an unsuccessful bid for ansett transport industries but was defeated by rupert murdoch and roadfreight group tnt logisticstnt however a profit of 11 million was made by bell for future bids bell group made an unsuccessful bid for the times in 1980 and at the same time launched a new perth newspaper the western mail challenging the herald and weekly times which owned the west australian by the end of 1980 bell resources ltd had accumulated cash reserves of 100 million in 1981 it made a bid for elders goldsbrough mort for 120 million bid and failed but earned a profit of 165 million on the deal during 1982 bell took stakes in rolls royce and portland cement and made an unsuccessful bid for the herald and weekly times group later that year it acquired perth television station tvw7 bell subsequently acquired a television station in adelaide and a handful of small regional radio stations unsuccessful bids were made for carlton united breweries and elders ixl but as usual holmes à courts strategic corporate planning let him walk away with a profit in 1983 bell bought perth mining equipment company wigmores and was renamed bell resources ltd through the acc group bell gained control of bass strait oil and gas explorer weeks petroleum which owned a 25 royalty share in the essobhp consortium in 1985 bell acquired 13 of us mining company asarco for 140 million and made an unsuccessful bid for perth utility fremantle gas coke in 1982 board room coup it acquired lord grades ukbased associated communications corporation acc111 and then sold off accs stake in central independent television and atv music publishing interests including northern songs a company set up by the beatles to control copyright of their music atv music publishing was bought by michael jackson and as part of the deal holmes à court persuaded jackson to make a brief visit to perth in order to appear on channel 7s annual telethon1213 also in 1985 bell resources ltd made its biggest and most daring bid to date for control of resources and steelmaking giant bhp which was australias largest company before the deal was finalised the following year elders ixl took a 20 stake in bhp for 2 billion in turn bhp purchased 1 billion of elders preference shares the deal later resulted in action against elders executives including chairman john elliott by the corporate regulator bell acted as a white knight in defeating a £19 billion hostile bid from lloyds bank for its competitor standard chartered bank in 1987 bell purchased a stake in pioneer concrete and made a second unsuccessful bid for the herald and weekly times group the bid went to takeover competitor rupert murdoch for 18 billion bell took ownership of the west australian perths main daily newspaper bell also spent us800 million to acquire 96 of texaco stock by the time of the october 1987 international stockmarket crash bell group ltd had accumulated assets that were valuable but not generating revenue sufficient to cover debts holmes à courts family company heytesbury holdings at the time owned 43 of bell group ltd which in turn owned 40 of the cash rich bell resources ltd however bell resources ltd was not able to buy its parent due to share raids being made on bell resources ltd by kerry packer adelaide steamship company under john spalvins and iel ron brierley merrill lynch withdrew its 1 billion line of credit facility meaning that the parent couldnt acquire its subsidiary and thereby access the money takeover by bond corporation and sgioedit holmes à court initially disposed of some perth properties before accepting a joint takeover by bond corporation and the state government insurance commission sgic in which both parties took a 199 stake in bell group ltd holmes a court retained 6 of bell group ltd and received 340 million from the sale bond corp was subsequently forced to bid for other shares in bell with the result that it ended up with a majority shareholding of 68 of bell group bond corp then proceeded to strip 500 million from bell resources ltd in an effort to prop up its own debts the asset stripping included transferring cash from bell resources ltd for its own purposes thus breaching the company code and ultimately sending its chairman alan bond to jail transfer of ownership of newspaper holdings into bond media and disposal of certain assets including tvw7 during 1988 holmes à court concentrated on the rebuilding and expansion of his heytesbury subsidiaries acquiring stoll moss theatres in london sherwin pastoral co owner of vast cattle stations in northern australia and the vasse felix winery in margaret river in 1989 heytesbury bought the victoria river downs and major sherwin pastoral co cattle and pastoral stations
