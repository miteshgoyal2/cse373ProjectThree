european union vs google from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search european union vs google is an investigation and enforcement action by the european commission against google for alleged unfair competition the investigation against google started on 15 april 2015 after margrethe vestager european commissioner for competition accused google of using android os to promote its mobile services eus claimsedit on april 15 2015 the european commission started an official investigation against google the commission released its statement of objections to google1 – a formal claim against the companys actions in the market of mobile devices and accused the company of abusing its dominant position by means of android having recalled that about 80 of smart phones and tablet pcs sold in eu run on android the european commission stated numerous complaints from the companies creating mobile apps based on this platform after conducting its own investigation that lasted for a year the commission initiated a court trial to clarify the following whether google actions impede development of the market of mobile devices and access of competitors thereto by demanding or encouraging smart phone manufacturers to preinstall google apps and services on their devices whether google suppressed attempts of smart phone and tablet pc manufacturers willing to install google apps on their devices to run on modified and potentially competitive versions of android whether google unlawfully impeded the market development by way of tacking the installation of certain google apps with the use of other apps of this company or its software interface a year after on april 20 2016 the european commission announced the issue of the second statement of objections to google and alphabet inc the consortium google is a part of2 which concerned google search engine being imposed in the commissions opinion by the company to the manufacturers of mobile devices along with google chrome browser along with the direct prohibition for the manufacturers of mobile devices to preinstall other browsers those restrictions were set in mobile applications distribution agreements mada the european commission emphasized that about 80 of smart phones sold in the european market use android and with its actions google violates the antitrust law margrethe vestager european commissioner for competition said3 a competitive mobile internet sector is increasingly important for consumers and businesses in europe based on our investigation thus far we believe that googles behavior denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stands in the way of innovation by other players in breach of eu antitrust rules these rules apply to all companies active in europe google now has the opportunity to reply to the commissions concerns in their statement of objections the european commission accused google of the breach of eu antitrust rules in three ways by requiring mobile manufacturers to preinstall google search and google chrome browser and requiring them to set google search as default search service on their devices as a condition to license certain google proprietary apps by preventing manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the android open source code by giving financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively preinstall google search on their devices in both cases the antitrust body gave google 12 weeks to reply the damage inflicted by the companys actions was estimated by the european commission at 10 of the companys annual revenue which amounts to 74 billion4 on july 12 ricardo cardoso ec spokesperson said that the company asked the commission for additional time to study the violations data and received consent as mr cardoso said the meeting on merits is to be held on september 75 see alsoedit russia antitrust
