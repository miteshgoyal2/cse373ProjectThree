external links early life and educationedit landon was born in 1887 in west middlesex pennsylvania the son of anne mossman and john manuel landon4 landon grew up in marietta ohio5 he moved with his family to kansas at age 17 and graduated from the university of kansas in 1908 alfred first pursued a career in banking but in 1912 he became an independent petroleum producer in independence kansas during world war i landon served in the army as a first lieutenant in chemical warfare by 1929 the oil industry had made alf a millionaire and he was instrumental in the establishment of the kansasoklahoma division of the united states oil and gas association then known as the midcontinent oil and gas association a petroleum lobbying organization6 careeredit landon supported theodore roosevelt’s progressive party in 1912 and by 1922 was private secretary to the governor of kansas he later became known as the leader of the liberal republicans in the state he was elected chairman of the republican state central committee in 1928 and directed the republican successful presidential and gubernatorial campaigns in kansas in that year landon was elected governor of kansas in 1932 he was reelected governor in 1934 being alongside gov frank merriam of california the only republican governors in the nation to be reelected that year as governor landon gained a reputation for reducing taxes and balancing the budget landon is often described as a fiscal conservative who nevertheless believed that government must also address certain social issues he supported parts of the new deal and labor unions in the 1932 presidential campaign a coolness developed between landon and then us president herbert hoover osro cobb of arkansas a friend of both men tried to bring about a reconciliation as he explains in his memoirs for reasons i never understood some friction developed between president hoover and my friend governor landon who had a summer place in evergreen coloradoi was in and out of colorado during the summers and visited frequently with governor landon i was eager to get him and the president together in hopes of bringing about a reconciliation that would benefit them personally and the republican party all of us were at the broadmoor hotel in colorado springs for a meeting which i saw as an opportunity to get them together for dinner but whatever undercurrent existed remained and they continued to be cool toward each other president hoover was one of the great americans of this century he was competent compassionate and a man of unequaled qualifications the country paid an awful price when he was sacrificed by political caprice7 during his gubernatorial years landon attempted to address the needs of his depressionbattered state while still advancing the republican party after his speech at the cleveland convention in 1936 landon stated “my chief concern in this crisis is to see the republican party name its strongest possible candidate and a man that would be a good president”8 during the election year landon called for a “special session of the legislature to enact measures to bring kansas within the requirements of the federal social security program”9 1936 presidential electionedit main article united states presidential election 1936 cover of time magazine 18 may 1936 in 1936 landon sought the republican presidential nomination opposing the reelection of fdr at the 1936 republican national convention landon’s campaign manager john hamilton mobilized the younger elements of the party against the faction led by herbert hoover landon won the nomination on the first ballot the convention selected chicago newspaper publisher and fdr’s future secretary of the navy frank knox as his running mate landon proved to be an ineffective campaigner who rarely traveled most of the attacks on fdr and social security were developed by republican campaigners rather than landon himself in the two months after his nomination he made no campaign appearances as columnist westbrook pegler lampooned “considerable mystery surrounds the disappearance of alfred m landon of topeka kansas the missing persons bureau has sent out an alarm bulletin bearing mr landons photograph and other particulars and anyone having information of his whereabouts is asked to communicate direct with the republican national committee”10 landon respected and admired roosevelt and accepted much of the new deal but objected that it was hostile to business and involved too much waste and inefficiency late in the campaign landon accused roosevelt of corruption – that is of acquiring so much power that he was subverting the constitution landon said “the president spoke truly when he boasted we have built up new instruments of public power he spoke truly when he said these instruments could provide shackles for the liberties of the people and enslavement for the public these powers were granted with the understanding that they were only temporary but after the powers had been obtained and after the emergency was clearly over we were told that another emergency would be created if the power was given up in other words the concentration of power in the hands of the president was not a question of temporary emergency it was a question of permanent national policy in my opinion the emergency of 1933 was a mere excuse national economic planning—the term used by this administration to describe its policy—violates the basic ideals of the american system the price of economic planning is the loss of economic freedom and economic freedom and personal liberty go hand in hand”11 the 1936 presidential election was extraordinarily lopsided although landon gained nearly seventeen million votes and obtained the endorsement of track star jesse owens he lost the popular vote by more than 10 million votes he lost his home state kansas and carried only maine and vermont for a total of eight electoral votes to roosevelt’s 523 in fact on the same day kansas rejected landon for the presidency the state also elected democrat walter a huxman as his successor as governor fdr’s win was the most crushing electoral victory since the 1820 election the overwhelming roosevelt victory prompted democratic party boss james farley to joke “as maine goes so goes vermont” later lifeedit following his defeat landon finished out his term as governor of kansas and returned to the oil industry landon did not seek elected office again the republicans defeats in 1932 and 1936 plunged their party into a period of bitter intraparty strife landon played an important role in ending this internal bickering in 1938 in helping to prepare a new group of leaders for the presidential campaign of 1940 and in trying to bring about a compromise between the isolationist and internationalist viewpoints in foreign policy landon declined a position in franklin roosevelts cabinet because he made his acceptance contingent upon the presidents renunciation of a third term12 after war broke out in europe in 1939 landon fought against isolationists such as america first who supported the neutrality act he feared it would mislead nazi germany into thinking the united states was unwilling to fight in 1941 however he joined isolationists in arguing against lendlease although he did urge that britain be given 5 billion outright instead after the war he backed the marshall plan while opposing high domestic spending after the communist revolution in china he was one of the first to advocate recognition of mao zedongs communist government and its admission to the united nations when this was still a very unpopular position among the leadership and followers of both major parties in 1961 landon urged the us to join the european common market1 in november 1962 when he was asked to describe his political philosophy landon said i would say practical progressive which means that the republican party or any political party has got to recognize the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilization and i dont think the republican party is really wide awake to that1 later in the 1960s landon backed president lyndon johnson on medicare and other great society programs on december 13 1966 landon gave the first landon lecture at kansas state university in manhattan kansas landons lecture titled new challenges in international relations was the first in a series of public issues lectures that continues to this day and has featured numerous world leaders and political figures including seven us presidents richard nixon gerald ford jimmy carter ronald reagan george h w bush bill clinton and george w bush landon addressed the republican national convention in 1976 in kansas city13
