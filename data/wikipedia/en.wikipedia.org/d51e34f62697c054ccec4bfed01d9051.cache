robotics from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the shadow robot hand system robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering electrical engineering computer science and others robotics deals with the design construction operation and use of robots1 as well as computer systems for their control sensory feedback and information processing these technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans robots can be used in any situation and for any purpose but today many are used in dangerous environments including bomb detection and deactivation manufacturing processes or where humans cannot survive robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance this is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people such robots attempt to replicate walking lifting speech cognition and basically anything a human can do many of todays robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bioinspired robotics the concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century2 throughout history it has been frequently assumed that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a humanlike fashion today robotics is a rapidly growing field as technological advances continue researching designing and building new robots serve various practical purposes whether domestically commercially or militarily many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people such as defusing bombs finding survivors in unstable ruins and exploring mines and shipwrecks robotics is also used in stem science technology engineering and mathematics as a teaching aid contents 1 etymology 2 history 3 robotic aspects 4 applications 5

word robot which was introduced to the public by czech writer karel čapek in his play rur rossums universal robots which was published in 19203 the word robot comes from the slavic word robota which means labour the play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids karel čapek himself did not coin the word he wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the oxford english dictionary in which he named his brother josef čapek as its actual originator3 according to the oxford english dictionary the word robotics was first used in print by isaac asimov in his science fiction short story liar published in may 1941 in astounding science fiction asimov was unaware that he was coining the term since the science and technology of electrical devices is electronics he assumed robotics already referred to the science and technology of robots in some of asimovs other works he states that the first use of the word robotics was in his short story runaround astounding science fiction march 194245 however the original publication of liar predates that of runaround by ten months so the former is generally cited as the words origin historyedit see also history of robots in 1942 the science fiction writer isaac asimov created his three laws of robotics in 1948 norbert wiener formulated the principles of cybernetics the basis of practical robotics fully autonomous only appeared in the second half of the 20th century the first digitally operated and programmable robot the unimate was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them commercial and industrial robots are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply more accurately and more reliably than humans they are also employed in some jobs which are too dirty dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans robots are widely used in manufacturing assembly packing and packaging mining transport earth and space exploration surgery weaponry laboratory research safety and the mass production of consumer and industrial goods6 date significance robot name inventor

victor scheinman 1978 first objectlevel robot programming language allowing robots to handle variations in object position shape and sensor noise freddy i and ii rapt robot programming language patricia ambler and robin popplestone robotic aspectsedit robotic construction electrical aspect a level of programming there are many types of robots they are used in many different environments and for many different uses although being very diverse in application and form they all share three basic similarities when it comes to their construction robots all have some kind of mechanical construction a frame form or shape designed to achieve a particular task for example a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud might use caterpillar tracks the mechanical aspect is mostly the creators solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it form follows function robots have electrical components which power and control the machinery for example the robot with caterpillar tracks would need some kind of power to move the tracker treads that power comes in the form of electricity which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery a basic electrical circuit even petrol powered machines that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol powered machines like cars have batteries the electrical aspect of robots is used for movement through motors sensing where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat sound position and energy status and operation robots need some level of electrical energy supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations all robots contain some level of computer programming code a program is how a robot decides when or how to do something in the caterpillar track example a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move programs are the core essence of a robot it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction but if its program is poorly constructed its performance will be very poor or it may not perform at all there are three different types of robotic programs remote control artificial intelligence and hybrid a robot with remote control programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source typically a human being with a remote control it is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both ai and rc functions applicationsedit as more and more robots are designed for specific tasks this method of classification becomes more relevant for example many robots are designed for assembly work which may not be readily adaptable for other applications they are termed as assembly robots for seam welding some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot ie the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables etc as an integrated unit such an integrated robotic system is called a welding robot even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation and are labelled as heavy duty robots current and potential applications include military robots caterpillar plans to develop remote controlled machines and expects to develop fully autonomous heavy robots by 202120 some cranes already are remote controlled it was demonstrated that a robot can perform a herding21 task robots are increasingly used in manufacturing since the 1960s in the auto industry they can amount for more than half of the labor there are even lights off factories such as an ibm keyboard manufacturing factory in texas that is 100 automated22 robots such as hospi23 are used as couriers in hospitals hospital robot other hospital tasks performed by robots are receptionists guides and porters helpers24 robots can serve as waiters2526 and cooks27 also at home boris is a robot that can load a dishwasher28 robot combat for sport – hobby or sport event where two or more robots fight in an arena to disable each other this has developed from a hobby in the 1990s to several tv series worldwide cleanup of contaminated areas such as toxic waste or nuclear facilities29 agricultural robots agrobots3031 domestic robots cleaning and caring for the elderly medical robots performing lowinvasive surgery household robots with full use nanorobots swarm robotics componentsedit power sourceedit further information power supply and energy storage at present mostly lead–acid batteries are used as a power source many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots they range from lead–acid batteries which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver–cadmium batteries that are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive designing a batterypowered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety cycle lifetime and weight generators often some type of internal combustion engine can also be used however such designs are often mechanically complex and need a fuel require heat dissipation and are relatively heavy a tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely this has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere however this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot which can be difficult to manage32 potential power sources could be pneumatic compressed gases solar power using the suns energy and converting it into electrical power hydraulics liquids flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion nuclear actuationedit main article actuator a robotic leg powered by air muscles actuators are the muscles of a robot the parts which convert stored energy into movement by far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories there are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators powered by electricity chemicals or compressed air electric motorsedit main article electric motor the vast majority of robots use electric motors often brushed and brushless dc motors in portable robots or ac motors in industrial robots and cnc machines these motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads and where the predominant form of motion is rotational linear actuatorsedit main article linear actuator various types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning and often have quicker direction changes particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics they are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air pneumatic actuator or an oil hydraulic actuator series elastic actuatorsedit a flexure is designed as part of the motor actuator to improve safety and provide robust force control energy efficiency shock absorption mechanical filtering while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components the resultant lower reflected inertia can improve safety when a robot is interacting with humans or during collisions it has been used in various robots particularly advanced manufacturing robots and33 walking humanoid robots34 air musclesedit main article pneumatic artificial muscles pneumatic artificial muscles also known as air muscles are special tubes that expandtypically up to 40 when air is forced inside them they are used in some robot applications353637 muscle wireedit main article shape memory alloy muscle wire also known as shape memory alloy nitinol® or flexinol® wire is a material which contracts under 5 when electricity is applied they have been used for some small robot applications3839 electroactive polymersedit main article electroactive polymers eaps or epams are a newwhen plastic material that can contract substantially up to 380 activation strain from electricity and have been used in facial muscles and arms of humanoid robots40 and to enable new robots to float41 fly swim or walk42 piezo motorsedit main article piezoelectric motor recent alternatives to dc motors are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors these work on a fundamentally different principle whereby tiny piezoceramic elements vibrating many thousands of times per second cause linear or rotary motion there are different mechanisms of operation one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line43 another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw the advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution speed and available force for their size44 these motors are already available commercially and being used on some robots4546 elastic nanotubesedit further information nanotube elastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in earlystage experimental development the absence of defects in carbon nanotubes enables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent with energy storage levels of perhaps 10 jcm3 for metal nanotubes human biceps could be replaced with an 8 mm diameter wire of this material such compact muscle might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans47 sensingedit main article robotic sensing sensors allow robots to receive information about a certain measurement of the environment or internal components this is essential for robots to perform their tasks and act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response they are used for various forms of measurements to give the robots warnings about safety or malfunctions and to provide realtime information of the task it is performing touchedit main article tactile sensor current robotic and prosthetic hands receive far less tactile information than the human hand recent research has developed a tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips4849 the sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedancemeasuring device within the core when the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object the researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting robotic grip on held objects scientists from several european countries and israel developed a prosthetic hand in 2009 called smarthand which functions like a real one—allowing patients to write with it type on a keyboard play piano and perform other fine movements the prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feeling in its fingertips50 visionedit main article computer vision see also vision processing unit computer vision is the science and technology of machines that see as a scientific discipline computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images the image data can take many forms such as video sequences and views from cameras in most practical computer vision applications the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common computer vision systems rely on image sensors which detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either visible light or infrared light the sensors are designed using solidstate physics the process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using optics sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment like human eyes robots eyes must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest and also adjust to variations in light intensities there is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological system at different levels of complexity also some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision have their background in biology otheredit other common forms of sensing in robotics use lidar radar and sonarcitation needed manipulationedit kuka industrial robot operating in a foundry puma one of the first industrial robots baxter a modern and versatile industrial robot developed by rodney brooks further information mobile manipulator robots need to manipulate objects pick up modify destroy or otherwise have an effect thus the hands of a robot are often referred to as end effectors51 while the arm is referred to as a manipulator52 most robot arms have replaceable effectors each allowing them to perform some small range of tasks some have a fixed manipulator which cannot be replaced while a few have one very general purpose manipulator for example a humanoid hand53 learning how to manipulate a robot often requires a close feedback between human to the robot although there are several methods for remote manipulation of robots54 mechanical grippersedit one of the most common effectors is the gripper in its simplest manifestation it consists of just two fingers which can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects fingers can for example be made of a chain with a metal wire run through it55 hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the shadow hand and the robonaut hand56 hands that are of a midlevel complexity include the delft hand5758 mechanical grippers can come in various types including friction and encompassing jaws friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction encompassing jaws cradle the object in place using less friction vacuum grippersedit vacuum grippers are very simple astrictive59 devices that can hold very large loads provided the prehension surface is smooth enough to ensure suction pick and place robots for electronic components and for large objects like car windscreens often use very simple vacuum grippers general purpose effectorsedit some advanced robots are beginning to use fully humanoid hands like the shadow hand manus60 and the schunk hand61 these are highly dexterous manipulators with as many as 20 degrees of freedom and hundreds of tactile sensors62 locomotionedit main articles robot locomotion and mobile robot rolling robotsedit segway in the robot museum in nagoya for simplicity most mobile robots have four wheels or a number of continuous tracks some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels these can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a fourwheeled robot would not be able to twowheeled balancing robotsedit balancing robots generally use a gyroscope to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum63 many different balancing robots have been designed64 while the segway is not commonly thought of as a robot it can be thought of as a component of a robot when used as such segway refer to them as rmp robotic mobility platform an example of this use has been as nasas robonaut that has been mounted on a segway65 onewheeled balancing robotsedit main article selfbalancing unicycle a onewheeled balancing robot is an extension of a twowheeled balancing robot so that it can move in any 2d direction using a round ball as its only wheel several onewheeled balancing robots have been designed recently such as carnegie mellon universitys ballbot that is the approximate height and width of a person and tohoku gakuin universitys ballip66 because of the long thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people67 spherical orb robotsedit main article spherical robot several attempts have been made in robots that are completely inside a spherical ball either by spinning a weight inside the ball6869 or by rotating the outer shells of the sphere7071 these have also been referred to as an orb bot72 or a ball bot7374 sixwheeled robotsedit using six wheels instead of four wheels can give better traction or grip in outdoor terrain such as on rocky dirt or grass tracked robotsedit talon military robots used by the united states army tank tracks provide even more traction than a sixwheeled robot tracked wheels behave as if they were made of hundreds of wheels therefore are very common for outdoor and military robots where the robot must drive on very rough terrain however they are difficult to use indoors such as on carpets and smooth floors examples include nasas urban robot urbie75 walking applied to robotsedit walking is a difficult and dynamic problem to solve several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs however none have yet been made which are as robust as a human there has been much study on human inspired walking such as amber lab which was established in 2008 by the mechanical engineering department at texas am university76 many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs due to these robots being significantly easier to construct7778 walking robots can be used for uneven terrains which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods hybrids too have been proposed in movies such as i robot where they walk on two legs and switch to four armslegs when going to a sprint typically robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up stairs none can walk over rocky uneven terrain some of the methods which have been tried are zmp techniqueedit main article zero moment point the zero moment point zmp is the algorithm used by robots such as hondas asimo the robots onboard computer tries to keep the total inertial forces the combination of earths gravity and the acceleration and deceleration of walking exactly opposed by the floor reaction force the force of the floor pushing back on the robots foot in this way the two forces cancel out leaving no moment force causing the robot to rotate and fall over79 however this is not exactly how a human walks and the difference is obvious to human observers some of whom have pointed out that asimo walks as if it needs the lavatory808182 asimos walking algorithm is not static and some dynamic balancing is used see below however it still requires a smooth surface to walk on hoppingedit several robots built in the 1980s by marc raibert at the mit leg laboratory successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking initially a robot with only one leg and a very small foot could stay upright simply by hopping the movement is the same as that of a person on a pogo stick as the robot falls to one side it would jump slightly in that direction in order to catch itself83 soon the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs a bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performing somersaults84 a quadruped was also demonstrated which could trot run pace and bound85 for a full list of these robots see the mit leg lab robots page86 dynamic balancing controlled fallingedit a more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm which is potentially more robust than the zero moment point technique as it constantly monitors the robots motion and places the feet in order to maintain stability87 this technique was recently demonstrated by anybots dexter robot88 which is so stable it can even jump89 another example is the tu delft flame passive dynamicsedit main article passive dynamics perhaps the most promising approach utilizes passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency it has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope using only gravity to propel themselves using this technique a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a hill this technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than zmp walkers like asimo9091 other methods of locomotionedit flyingedit two robot snakes left one has 64 motors with 2 degrees of freedom per segment the right one 10 a modern passenger airliner is essentially a flying robot with two humans to manage it the autopilot can control the plane for each stage of the journey including takeoff normal flight and even landing92 other flying robots are uninhabited and are known as unmanned aerial vehicles uavs they can be smaller and lighter without a human pilot on board and fly into dangerous territory for military surveillance missions some can even fire on targets under command uavs are also being developed which can fire on targets automatically without the need for a command from a human other flying robots include cruise missiles the entomopter and the epson micro helicopter robot robots such as the air penguin air ray and air jelly have lighterthanair bodies propelled by paddles and guided by sonar snakingedit several snake robots have been successfully developed mimicking the way real snakes move these robots can navigate very confined spaces meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings93 the japanese acmr5 snake robot94 can even navigate both on land and in water95 skatingedit a small number of skating robots have been developed one of which is a multimode walking and skating device it has four legs with unpowered wheels which can either step or roll96 another robot plen can use a miniature skateboard or rollerskates and skate across a desktop97 capuchin a climbing robot climbingedit several different approaches have been used to develop robots that have the ability to climb vertical surfaces one approach mimics the movements of a human climber on a wall with protrusions adjusting the center of mass and moving each limb in turn to gain leverage an example of this is capuchin98 built by dr ruixiang zhang at stanford university california another approach uses the specialized toe pad method of wallclimbing geckoes which can run on smooth surfaces such as vertical glass examples of this approach include wallbot99 and stickybot100 chinas technology daily reported on november 15 2008 that dr li hiu yeung and his research group of new concept aircraft zhuhai co ltd had successfully developed a bionic gecko robot named speedy freelander according to dr li the gecko robot could rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls navigate through ground and wall fissures and walk upsidedown on the ceiling it was also able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass rough sticky or dusty walls as well as various types of metallic materials it could also identify and circumvent obstacles automatically its flexibility and speed were comparable to a natural gecko a third approach is to mimic the motion of a snake climbing a polecitation needed swimming piscineedit it is calculated that when swimming some fish can achieve a propulsive efficiency greater than 90101 furthermore they can accelerate and maneuver far better than any manmade boat or submarine and produce less noise and water disturbance therefore many researchers studying underwater robots would like to copy this type of locomotion102 notable examples are the essex university computer science robotic fish g9103 and the robot tuna built by the institute of field robotics to analyze and mathematically model thunniform motion104 the aqua penguin105 designed and built by festo of germany copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front flippers of penguins festo have also built the aqua ray and aqua jelly which emulate the locomotion of manta ray and jellyfish respectively robotic fish isplashii in 2014 isplashii was developed by phd student richard james clapham and prof huosheng hu at essex university it was the first robotic fish capable of outperforming real carangiform fish in terms of average maximum velocity measured in body lengths second and endurance the duration that top speed is maintained106 this build attained swimming speeds of 116bls ie 37 ms107 the first build isplashi 2014 was the first robotic platform to apply a fullbody length carangiform swimming motion which was found to increase swimming speed by 27 over the traditional approach of a posterior confined waveform108 sailingedit the autonomous sailboat robot vaimos sailboat robots have also been developed in order to make measurements at the surface of the ocean a typical sailboat robot is vaimos109 built by ifremer and enstabretagne since the propulsion of sailboat robots uses the wind the energy of the batteries is only used for the computer for the communication and for the actuators to tune the rudder and the sail if the robot is equipped with solar panels the robot could theoretically navigate forever the two main competitions of sailboat robots are wrsc which takes place every year in europe and sailbot environmental interaction and navigationedit main article robotic mapping radar gps and lidar are all combined to provide proper navigation and obstacle avoidance vehicle developed for 2007 darpa urban challenge this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed july 2009 learn how and when to remove this template message though a significant percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment these robots require some combination of navigation hardware and software in order to traverse their environment in particular unforeseen events eg people and other obstacles that are not stationary can cause problems or collisions some highly advanced robots such as asimo and meinü robot have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software also selfcontrolled cars ernst dickmanns driverless car and the entries in the darpa grand challenge are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information most of these robots employ a gps navigation device with waypoints along with radar sometimes combined with other sensory data such as lidar video cameras and inertial guidance systems for better navigation between waypoints humanrobot interactionedit main article humanrobot interaction kismet can produce a range of facial expressions the state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuumcleaning the floors if robots are to work effectively in homes and other nonindustrial environments the way they are instructed to perform their jobs and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance the people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech gestures and facial expressions rather than a commandline interface although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate it is unnatural for the robot it will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional c3po or data of star trek next generation speech recognitionedit main article speech recognition interpreting the continuous flow of sounds coming from a human in real time is a difficult task for a computer mostly because of the great variability of speech110 the same word spoken by the same person may sound different depending on local acoustics volume the previous word whether or not the speaker has a cold etc it becomes even harder when the speaker has a different accent111 nevertheless great strides have been made in the field since davis biddulph and balashek designed the first voice input system which recognized ten digits spoken by a single user with 100 accuracy in 1952112 currently the best systems can recognize continuous natural speech up to 160 words per minute with an accuracy of 95113 robotic voiceedit other hurdles exist when allowing the robot to use voice for interacting with humans for social reasons synthetic voice proves suboptimal as a communication medium114 making it necessary to develop the emotional component of robotic voice through various techniques115116 gesturesedit further information gesture recognition one can imagine in the future explaining to a robot chef how to make a pastry or asking directions from a robot police officer in both of these cases making hand gestures would aid the verbal descriptions in the first case the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human and perhaps repeating them for confirmation in the second case the robot police officer would gesture to indicate down the road then turn right it is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots117 a great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures118 facial expressionedit further information facial expression facial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots robotic faces have been constructed by hanson robotics using their elastic polymer called frubber allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors servos119 the coating and servos are built on a metal skull a robot should know how to approach a human judging by their facial expression and body language whether the person is happy frightened or crazylooking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot likewise robots like kismet and the more recent addition nexi120 can produce a range of facial expressions allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans121 artificial emotionsedit artificial emotions can also be generated composed of a sequence of facial expressions andor gestures as can be seen from the movie final fantasy the spirits within the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation to simplify this programming in the movie presets were created together with a special software program this decreased the amount of time needed to make the film these presets could possibly be transferred for use in reallife robots personalityedit many of the robots of science fiction have a personality something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future122 nevertheless researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality123124 ie they use sounds facial expressions and body language to try to convey an internal state which may be joy sadness or fear one commercial example is pleo a toy robot dinosaur which can exhibit several apparent emotions125 social intelligenceedit the socially intelligent machines lab of the georgia institute of technology researches new concepts of guided teaching interaction with robots the aim of the projects is a social robot that learns task and goals from human demonstrations without prior knowledge of highlevel concepts these new concepts are grounded from lowlevel continuous sensor data through unsupervised learning and task goals are subsequently learned using a bayesian approach these concepts can be used to transfer knowledge to future tasks resulting in faster learning of those tasks the results are demonstrated by the robot curi who can scoop some pasta from a pot onto a plate and serve the sauce on top126 controledit puppet

robot must be controlled to perform tasks the control of a robot involves three distinct phases – perception processing and action robotic paradigms sensors give information about the environment or the robot itself eg the position of its joints or its end effector this information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators motors which move the mechanical the processing phase can range in complexity at a reactive level it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands sensor fusion may first be used to estimate parameters of interest eg the position of the robots gripper from noisy sensor data an immediate task such as moving the gripper in a certain direction is inferred from these estimates techniques from control theory convert the task into commands that drive the actuators at longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks the robot may need to build and reason with a cognitive model cognitive models try to represent the robot the world and how they interact pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects mapping techniques can be used to build maps of the world finally motion planning and other artificial intelligence techniques may be used to figure out how to act for example a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles falling over etc autonomy levelsedit topio a humanoid robot played ping pong at tokyo irex 2009127 control systems may also have varying levels of autonomy direct interaction is used for haptic or teleoperated devices and the human has nearly complete control over the robots motion operatorassist modes have the operator commanding mediumtohighlevel tasks with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them an autonomous robot may go without human interaction for extended periods of time higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex cognitive capabilities for example robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous but operate in a fixed pattern another classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions teleoperation a human controls each movement each machine actuator change is specified by the operator supervisory a human specifies general moves or position changes and the machine decides specific movements of its actuators tasklevel autonomy the operator specifies only the task and the robot manages itself to complete it full autonomy the machine will create and complete all its tasks without human interaction researchedit further information opensource robotics evolutionary robotics areas of robotics and robotics simulator much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks but on investigations into new types of robots alternative ways to think about or design robots and new ways to manufacture them other investigations such as mits cyberflora project are almost wholly academic a first particular new innovation in robot design is the open sourcing of robotprojects to describe the level of advancement of a robot the term generation robots can be used this term is coined by professor hans moravec principal research scientist at the carnegie mellon university robotics institute in describing the near future evolution of robot technology first generation robots moravec predicted in 1997 should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a lizard and should become available by 2010 because the first generation robot would be incapable of learning however moravec predicts that the second generation robot would be an improvement over the first and become available by 2020 with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of a mouse the third generation robot should have the intelligence comparable to that of a monkey though fourth generation robots robots with human intelligence professor moravec predicts would become possible he does not predict this happening before around 2040 or 2050128 the second is evolutionary robots this is a methodology that uses evolutionary computation to help design robots especially the body form or motion and behavior controllers in a similar way to natural evolution a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way or their ability to perform a task is measured using a fitness function those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set which have new behaviors based on those of the winners over time the population improves and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear this happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers researchers use this method both to create better robots129 and to explore the nature of evolution130 because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated131 this technique may be run entirely or mostly in simulation then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough132 currently there are about 10 million industrial robots toiling around the world and japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industrycitation needed dynamics and kinematicsedit further information kinematics and dynamics mechanics external video how the bb8 sphero toy works the study of motion can be divided into kinematics and dynamics133 direct kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position orientation velocity and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values as done in path planning some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy different possibilities of performing the same movement collision avoidance and singularity avoidance once all relevant positions velocities and accelerations have been calculated using kinematics methods from the field of dynamics are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known direct dynamics is used in computer simulations of the robot inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed endeffector acceleration this information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot in each area mentioned above researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies improve existing ones and improve the interaction between these areas to do this criteria for optimal performance and ways to optimize design structure and control of robots must be developed and implemented bionics and biomimeticsedit bionics and biomimetics apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots for example the design of bionickangaroo was based on the way kangaroos jump education and trainingedit main article educational robotics the scorboter 4u educational robot robotics engineers design robots maintain them develop new applications for them and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics134 robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools particularly in parts of the usa135 as well as in numerous youth summer camps raising interest in programming artificial intelligence and robotics among students firstyear computer science courses at some universities now include programming of a robot in addition to traditional software engineeringbased coursework54 career trainingedit universities offer bachelors masters and doctoral degrees in the field of robotics136 vocational schools offer robotics training aimed at careers in robotics certificationedit the robotics certification standards alliance rcsa is an international robotics certification authority that confers various industry and educationalrelated robotics certifications summer robotics campedit several national summer camp programs include robotics as part of their core curriculum in addition youth summer robotics programs are frequently offered by celebrated museums and institutions robotics competitionsedit main article robot competition there are lots of competitions all around the globe one of the most important competitions is the fll or first lego league the idea of this specific competition is that kids start developing knowledge and getting into robotics while playing with legos since they are 9 years old this competition is associated with ni or national instruments robotics afterschool programsedit many schools across the country are beginning to add robotics programs to their after school curriculum some major programs for afterschool robotics include first robotics competition botball and best robotics137 robotics competitions often include aspects of business and marketing as well as engineering and design the lego company began a program for children to learn and get excited about robotics at a young age138 employmentedit a robot technician builds small allterrain robots courtesy mobilerobots inc main article technological unemployment robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing environments as factories increase their use of robots the number of robotics–related jobs grow and have been observed to be steadily rising139 the employment of robots in industries has increased productivity and efficiency savings and is typically seen as a long term investment for benefactors occupational safety and health implicationsedit a discussion paper drawn up by euosha highlights how the spread of robotics presents both opportunities and challenges for occupational safety and health osh140 the greatest osh benefits stemming from the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments in space defence security or the nuclear industry but also in logistics maintenance and inspection autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty dull or unsafe tasks thus avoiding workers exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical ergonomic and psychosocial risks for example robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres in the future many other highly repetitive risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture construction transport healthcare firefighting or cleaning services141 despite these advances there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills the advantages of robotics include heavyduty jobs with precision and repeatability whereas the advantages of humans include creativity decisionmaking flexibility and adaptability this need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the manrobot merger some european countries are including robotics in their national programmes and trying to promote a safe and flexible cooperation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity for example the german federal institute for occupational safety and health baua organises annual workshops on the topic humanrobot collaboration in future cooperation between robots and humans will be diversified with robots increasing their autonomy and humanrobot collaboration reaching completely new forms current approaches and technical standards142143 aiming to protect employees from the risk of working with collaborative robots will have to be revised see alsoedit robotics portal anderson powerpole connector artificial intelligence
