such as the lorax and curious george criticismedit radio show hostcomedian adam carolla took umbrage with the ad council on his former terrestrial radio programs before his move to podcasting the adam carolla show and loveline stating that the announcements provide little value and that the topics they choose to provide statements on are not real issues that affect americans such as airplane turbulence or are issues that an ad on public radio could not possibly do anything about such as housing discrimination furthermore carolla has stated that this valuable time taken up could be used to enlighten americans on topics such as teen pregnancy and options or illiteracy topics that have a much more significant impact on society39 given the ad councils historically close collaboration with the president of the united states and the federal government it has been labeled by historian robert griffith as little more than a domestic propaganda arm of the federal government4041 the ad council has been further criticized for distracting the public by focusing on individual lifestyle changes rather than on the need to fix social problems by changing institutions such as the ad councils many corporate sponsors or the government and military whose campaigns the ad council has also promoted42 ad council spots are used to fill unsold air time by stations and networks political talk shows often have advertising time either controlled by the local station or a programs syndicating network that goes unsold this is often filled by promotions for other programming on a station short segments and public service announcements including from the ad council activists unfamiliar with the ad model of these programs or that of the ad council often complain to the ad council itself along with the organizations which coordinate their messages with the ad council such as the aarp leading the ad council and the organizations to disclaim they do not share the views of the hosts where their announcements air and have little to no control about where they may be scheduled to air43 notes and referencesedit a b c d e f g h form 990 return of organization exempt from income tax
