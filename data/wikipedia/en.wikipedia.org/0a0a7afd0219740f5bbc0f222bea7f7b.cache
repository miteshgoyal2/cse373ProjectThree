overviewedit following the huge success of the bad world tour jacksons first solo world tour where he earned over 125 million the star claimed that he would not tour again and would instead concentrate on making films and records on february 3 1992 in a pepsi press conference it was announced that jackson would be touring again the announcement coincided with a new deal between jackson and pepsi with a reported 20 million deal to sponsor the tour in an interview jackson stated the only reason i am going on tour is to raise funds for the newly formed heal the world foundation an international childrens charity that i am spearheading to assist children and the ecology my goal is to gross 100 million by christmas 1993 i urge every corporation and individual who cares about this planet and the future of the children to help raise money for the charity the heal the world foundation will contribute funds to paediatric aids in honour of my friend ryan white i am looking forward to this tour because it will allow me to devote time to visiting children all around the world as well as spread the message of global love in the hope that others will be moved to do their share to help heal the world1 preparations and set designsedit rehearsals were rumored to be at his neverland ranch the stage used for the tour required more time to set up than before equipment which in total weighed over 100 tons required two boeing 747 jet aircraft and multiple lorries to transport to each venue for the tours design jackson was influenced by the uniform worn by the military for jam the first performance on the set list jackson wore two variations of a fauxmilitary uniform during the 1992 leg the uniform was a greygreen jacket with a one bolted strap which sparkled with multicolour for the tokyo and 1993 leg jackson wore a black uniform with three gold bolted straps one going from his collar to his waist in one direction and the other two in another he also used similar costume at the first dangerous tour concert in munich the super bowl xxvii halftime show in 1993 the tour also incorporated several stage illusions each concert began with a montage shown on the big screens showing clips of the victory tour and bad world tour the concert also began with an illusionlike the toaster in which following the ringing of bells and the roar of a panther jackson catapults on to the stage through a trap door in the front sending off pyrotechnics that electrified the crowd that opening was kickass admired janet jackson im sitting in the sound tower and all the kids are everywhere and when he jumped out of whatever the hell that thing was i was yelling so loud the kids in front of me were looking back and i didnt even know it my friend tina is saying jan theyre looking at you because i was going yeah mike that was the to me that was so badass why didnt i think of that when he thought of that he hit it2 a similar version of the toaster stunt was used in the beginning of jacksons super bowl xxvii halftime show performance in 1993 during the 1992 leg the transition from thriller to billie jean was another stage trick when jackson walks into two pillars he secretly switches with a werewolfmasked backup dancer while he changes for billie jean the backup dancer posing as jackson is placed into a coffin which disappears when dancers posing as skeletons and zombies drape a cloth over the coffin and pull it out jackson appears fully dressed for billie jean in the upper stage level as it lowers down the coffin portion of this stage illusion was removed in some of the 1992 leg shows and the entire 1993 leg of the tour and replaced with the jackson impersonator and the backup dancers performing an encore of the monster breakdown the dance sequence in thriller the showedit the original set list for the 1992 leg featured the way you make me feel and bad but these were taken out after the eighth concert in oslo norway however these two songs were returned for the first six performances in tokyo japan during the europe leg in 1992 mtv was allowed to film backstage and broadcast six fifteenminute episodes of the tour the show was called the dangerous diaries and was presented by sonya saul mtv released footage of billie jean and black or white at the first show in munich billie jean was released with 2 different versions one by mtv as a special and the other on the dangerous diaries documentary both versions have placed a snippet of jacksons original a cappella recording for billie jean over the live vocals when jackson throws his fedora jackson sold the film rights to his october 1 1992 concert in bucharest romania to hbo for 21 million the deal was the highest ever paid for a live concert the concert was broadcast live on radio and shown on television across 61 countries and received the highest tv ratings in the history of the hbo network in which jackson was honoured with a cableace award in 2004 the concert was released on dvd as part of jacksons the ultimate collection box set it was released again in 2005 as the separate dvd live in bucharest the dangerous tour the footage used on the released version is actually a mixture of footage from bucharest – the bbc broadcast hbo live telecast pay per view and the hbo tv version3 the toulouse france concert performed on september 16 1992 featured a special instrumental performance of the first half of the song in the closet as an interlude between the songs heal the world and man in the mirror princess stéphanie of monaco who was the mystery girl in the actual song was in attendance at this concert this concert marked the first and only time that this song was performed during this tour on december 31 1992 during the new years eve concert in tokyo japan slash made a special guest appearance for the performance of black or white slash also made a special appearance for black or white at the concert in oviedo spain in september 1992 when the third leg begins the news broke out when he was accused from the allegations towards him causing him to cancelled the remained tour on 29 august jackson performed in front of 47000 on his 35th birthday in singapore during his visit to moscow in september jackson came up with the song stranger in moscow which would be released on his 1995 album history past present and future book i it was during a time when jackson felt very alone far away from his family and friends yet every night throughout his tours fans would stay by his hotel and support him4 super bowl xxvii halftime showedit unlike many previous years jackson was the only performer in the entire super bowl xxvii halftime show5 the show started with jackson dancing on certain jumbotrons followed by impersonators that posed on top of the screen which gave the illusion of jackson moving from one side of the stadium to the other then jackson himself catapulted on stage and simply stood frozen in front of the audience jacksons set consist of a medley jam with the beginning being an excerpt from why you wanna trip on me billie jean and black or white the finale featured an audience card stunt a video montage showing jackson participating in various humanitarian efforts around the world and a choir of 3500 local los angeles area children singing we are the world later joining jackson as he sang his single heal the world it was the first super bowl where the audience figures actually increased during the halftime show the selection of jackson for the halftime show was in response to sagging interest in recent performances notably in the two years immediately prior the nfl and fox network officials decided it was necessary to sign top acts for the halftime in future years to boost future viewership and interest the nfl donated 100000 to jacksons heal the world foundation6 set listedit 1992 rehearsals  jam wanna be startin somethin human nature smooth criminal i just cant stop loving you duet with
