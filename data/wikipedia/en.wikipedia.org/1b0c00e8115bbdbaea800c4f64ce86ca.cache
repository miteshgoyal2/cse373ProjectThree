intelligence ex officio53 speaker of the houseedit hastert presiding over the house of representatives during the 109th congress electionedit in the aftermath of the 1998 midterm elections where the gop lost five house seats and failed to make a net gain of seats in the senate house speaker newt gingrich of georgia stood down for the speakership and declined to take his seat for an 11th term in middecember representative robert l livingston of louisiana—the former chairman of the house appropriations committee and the speakerdesignate—stated in a dramatic surprise announcement on the house floor that he would not become speaker following widely publicized revelations of his extramarital affairs345455 although he reportedly had no warning of livingstons decision to step aside hastert began lobbying on the house floor within moments of livingstons announcement and by the afternoon of that day had secured the public backing of the house republican leadership including gingrich delay who was viewed as too partisan to step into the role of speaker and dick armey who was viewed as too weak and was damaged by party infighting3455 on that day hastert was endorsed by about a hundred republican representatives ranging from conservatives such as steve largent to moderates such as mike castle for the speakership55 representative christopher cox of california viewed as a potential rival decided by evening not to challenge hastert for the speakership55 hastert became known as the accidental speaker5657 tenure and controversiesedit in accepting the position hastert broke the tradition that the new speaker delivers his first address from the speakers chair instead delivering his seventeenminute acceptance speech from the floor58 hastert adopted a conciliatory tone and pledged to work for bipartisanship saying that solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness5859 nevertheless in november 2004 hastert instituted what became known as the hastert rule or majority of the majority rule which was an informal selfimposed political practice of allowing the house to vote on only those bills that were supported by the majority of its republican members the practice received criticism as an unduly partisan measure both at the time it was adopted and in the subsequent years6061 the same year the hastert aide who coined the phrase also stated that the stricture was not workable62 in any case a number of bills subsequently passed the house without the support of a majority of the majority party in the house as shown by a list compiled by the new york times63 in 2013 after leaving office hastert disowned the policy saying that there is no hastert rule and that the rule was more of a principle that the majority party should follow its own policies64 congressional expert norm ornstein writes that hastert blew up the houses regular order which is a mix of rules and norms that allows debate deliberation and amendments in committees and on the house floor that incorporates and does not shut out the minority even if it still loses most of the time that takes bills that pass both houses to a conference committee to reconcile differences and that allows time for members and staff to read digest and analyze bills65 ornstein commented that no speaker did more to relegate the regular order to the sidelines than hastert the house is a very partisan institution with rules structured to give even tiny majorities enormous leverage but hastert took those realities to a new and more tribalized partisan plane65 despite this shift hastert was widely seen as affable and lowkey he did not seek the limelight become a regular on sunday talk shows or anything close to a household word or figure or openly exhibit the kind of snarling or mean partisan demeanor that made tom delay such a mark of hatred for democrats65 although by tradition hastert was the leader of the house republicans he adopted a much lower profile in the media than conventional wisdom would suggest for a speaker this led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for delay66 in 2005 delay was indicted by a texas grand jury on charges of campaignfinance violations delay stepped down as majority leader and was replaced in that post by roy blunt delay resigned from congress the following year6768 throughout his term hastert was a strong supporter of the george w bush administrations foreign and domestic policies hastert was described as a bush loyalist who worked closely with the white house to shepherd the presidents agenda through congress2169 the two frequently praised each other expressed mutual respect and had a close working relationship even during the controversy over representative mark foley republican of florida7071 hastert even provided dick cheney office space inside the house in the united states capitol72 in 2003 hastert and bush met privately at the white house about twice a month to discuss congressional developments71 earmarks—lineitem projects inserted into appropriations bills at the request of individual members and often referred to as porkbarrel spending—exploded under hasterts leadership growing from 12 billion in 1999 at the beginning of hasterts term to an alltime high of 29 billion in 2006 hasterts last year as speaker56 hastert himself made earmarks a personal trademark from 1999 to may 2005 hastert obtained 24 million in federal earmarked grant funds to groups and institutions in aurora illinois hasterts birthplace and his districts largest city73 106th congressedit in march 1999 soon after hasterts elevation to the speakership the washington post in a frontpage story reported that hastert has begun offering industry lobbyists the kind of deal they like private audiences where for a price they can voice their views on what kind of agenda the 106th congress should pursue74 hasterts style and extensive fundraising led common cause to critique the paytoplay system in congress74 hastert was known as a frequent critic of bill clinton and immediately upon assuming the speakership he played a lead role in the impeachment of the president5 nevertheless hastert and the clinton administration did work together on several initiatives including the new markets tax credit program and plan colombia34 in 2000 hastert announced he would support an armenian genocide resolution analysts noted that at the time there was a tight congressional race in california in which the large armenian community might be important in favor of the republican incumbent the resolution vehemently opposed by turkey had passed the human rights subcommittee of the house and the international relations committee but hastert although first supporting it withdrew the resolution on the eve of the full house vote he explained this by saying that he had received a letter from bill clinton asking him to withdraw it because it would harm us interests75 even though there is no evidence that a payment was made an official at the turkish consulate is said to have claimed in one recording that was translated by sibel edmonds that the price for hastert to withdraw the armenian genocide resolution would have been at least 5000007677 107th congressedit hastert top right during president george w bushs 2003 state of the union address hastert and the senior republican leadership in the house were able to maintain party discipline to a great degree which allowed them to regularly enact legislation despite a narrow majority less than twelve seats in the 106th and 107th congresses78 hastert was a strong supporter of the iraq war resolution and the ensuing 2003 invasion of iraq and the iraq war hastert stated in the house in october 2002 that he believed there was a direct connection between iraq and alqaeda and that the us should do all that we can to disarm saddam husseins regime before they provide alqaeda with weapons of mass destruction79 in a february 2003 interview with the chicago tribune hastert launched into a lengthy and passionate denunciation of frances resistance to the iraq war and stated that he wanted to go nosetonose with the country80 in 2006 hastert visited iraq at bushs request and supported a supplemental iraq war spending bill81 as speaker hastert shepherded the usa patriot act in october 2001 to passage in the house on a 35766 vote82 in a 2011 interview hastert claimed credit for its passage over the misgivings of many members82 fourteen years later federal prosecutors used the patriot acts expansion of currency transaction reporting requirements to indict hastert on federal charges82 as speaker hastert also oversaw the passage of the no child left behind act of 2001 a major education bill the bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 legislation and the homeland security act of 2002 which reorganized the government and created the department of homeland security78 although hastert was successful in implementing bush policy priorities during his tenure the house also regularly passed conservative bills only to have them blocked in the more moderate senate78 one such bill was an energy bill backed by the bush administration which would have authorized drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge this provision was killed in the senate78 hastert opposed the bipartisan campaign reform act mccainfeingold the landmark campaign finance reform law39 in 2001 during the debate on the bill hastert criticized republican senator john mccain of arizona saying that mccain had bullied house republicans by sending them letters in support of his campaignfinance reform proposals83 hastert called the legislation the worst thing that ever happened to congress84 and expressed the view that there were constitutional flaws in the legislation85 supporters of campaignfinance reform circumvented hastert by means of a discharge petition a seldomused procedural mechanism in which a measure may be brought to a floor vote over the objections of the speaker if an absolute majority of representatives sign a petition in support of doing so56 the discharge petition was not successfully used again86 until 201587 108th congressedit in 2004 hastert again feuded with mccain amid conflict between the house and the senate over the 2005 budget88 after mccain gave a speech excoriating both political parties for refusing to sacrifice their tax cutting and spending agendas in wartime hastert publicly questioned mccains credentials as a republican and suggested that the decorated vietnam war veteran did not understand the meaning of sacrifice88 hastert was key to the passage in november 2003 of key medicare legislation which created medicare part d a prescriptiondrug benefit89 hasterts push to pass the legislation—culminating in a threehour house vote in which the speaker an imposing former wrestling coach was literally leaning on recalcitrant lawmakers to win their support—raised the speakers profile and contributed to a shift of his image from amiable and lowkey to more forceful89 the extension of the vote for hours and the armtwisting of members brought condemnation of hastert from democrats with house minority whip steny h hoyer saying they are corrupting the practices of the house89 the bill passed on a narrow vote of 220 to 21590 in 2004 hoyer called upon hastert to initiate a house ethics committee investigation into statements by representative nick smith a republican of michigan who stated that groups and lawmakers had offered support for his sons campaign for congress in exchange for smiths support of the medicare bill90 in october 2004 the house ethics committee admonished delay for pressuring smith on the medicare prescriptiondrug bill but stated that delay did not break the law or house ethics rules91 hastert issued a statement supporting delay but the admonishment was viewed as harming delays chances of succeeded hastert as speaker91 109th congressedit on october 27 2005 hastert became the first speaker to author a blog92 on speakers journal on his official house website hastert wrote in his first post this is denny hastert and welcome to my blog this

elected as the republican nominee and fermilab scientist bill foster was elected as the democratic nominee in the special election in march 2008 to fill the rest of hasterts unexpired term foster

2013 hastert and gephardt traveled with eight members of congress to turkey with all expenses paid by the turkish government122123 while members of congress are generally prohibited from corporatefunded travel abroad with lobbyists a rule enacted after the abramoff scandal the law permits lobbyists to plan and attend trips overseas if paid for by foreign countries122 hastert defended the trip saying that he had meticulously followed the rules and that the involvement of himself and gephardt allowed those members of congress who were there to have a fuller experience122 a national journal investigation highlighted the trip as an example of loopholes creating a situation in which lobbyists who cant legally buy a lawmaker a sandwich can still escort members on trips all around the world123 in march 2015 hastert along with his associate accompanied by several lobbyist associates including former representative william d delahunt of massachusetts took advantage of his privilege as a former lawmaker to be present in the senate reception room near the senate chamber lingering and bantering with senators and other passersby during a vote on whether to retain the fuel standard mandating the blending of ethanol and other alternative fuels with gasoline as advocated by hasterts client fuels america the ethanol industry trade group124 hastert and delahunt were criticized by watchdog groups who questioned whether hastert was violating these rules125 but allies of hastert and delahunt said they made a point of not lobbying lawmakers in the senate reception room but that they and members of their team used the lobby area as a temporary base where they could greet lawmakers while they were holding meetings in private rooms124 the day the 2015 indictment was unsealed hastert resigned his lobbyist position at dickstein shapiro and his biography was removed from the firms website126127128 in addition to his lobbyist job hastert established his own

immediately130 publicly funded postspeakership officeedit a controversy arose in 2009 regarding hasterts receipt of federal funds while a lobbyist131132 under a 1975 federal law hastert as a former house speaker was entitled to a public allowance about 40000 a month for a fiveyear period to allow him to maintain an office131 hastert accepted the funds which went toward office space in farwest suburban yorkville illinois salaries for three staffers secretary lisa post and administrative assistants bryan harbin and tom jarman each paid an annual salary of more than 100000 over 2½ years lease payments on a 2008 gmc yukon sport utility vehicle a satellite tv subscription office equipment and legal fees121131132 jarman later left the office and harbins salary was cut substantially121 hasterts governmentfunded office closed in late 2012 at the end of the maximum five years for which public funds were provided121 the total amount of public funds spent on hasterts postspeakership office was nearly 19 million not including federal benefits such as health care to which the employees were entitled of which the majority about 145 million went toward staff salaries121 the federally funded benefits were legally required to be completely separate from hasterts simultaneous lobbying activities for dickstein shapiro131132 the arrangement was criticized as really concerning by steve ellis vice president of taxpayers for common sense because the exact nature of the two roles was not transparent a hastert spokesman stated that the two offices were completely separate131132 in 2012 however a chicago tribune investigation found that a secretary in the exspeakers government office used email to coordinate some of his private business meetings and travel and conducted research on one proposed venture and that a suburban chicago businessman who was involved in the business ventures with hastert said he met with hastert at least three times in the government office to discuss the projects133 hastert denied that he had engaged in any improper conduct133 civil lawsuit against hastert alleging personal use of publicly funded officeedit in 2013 hasterts former business partner j david john filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the northern district of illinois alleging that hastert misappropriated federal funds for his postspeakership office in yorkville for personal use including private lobbying and business projects134135 this suit was filed under the qui tam provision of the false claims act fca an antifraud statute that allows a private party to pursue a case on behalf of the federal government134135136 in the suit john asserts that he told the fbi in 2011 that he had knowledge that hastert was using federally funded offices staff office supplies and vehicles for personal business ventures134 john a businessman from the chicago suburb of burr ridge illinois133136 also said that he traveled with hastert and collaborated with him on a planned grand prix racetrack in southern california and sports events to be organized in the middle east as well as other projects134 hastert denies any wrongdoing135 the allegations about the use of the former speakers officer first drew the attention of federal investigators in 2013 leading to the federal indictment in 2015137 hastert was initially represented in the civil case by his son attorney ethan hastert and then by christian poland a bryan cave partner in chicago138 us district judge charles kocoras twice dismissed the suit but allowed johns attorneys to redraft the complaint135136 in july 2015 kocoras reinstated the suit finding that johns second amended complaint was sufficient to allow the suit to go forward and proceed to discovery134 john claimed in court filings to have had at least three conversations with an fbi agent about hasterts use of the postspeakership office139 in september 2015 hasterts attorneys issued subpoenas for records of conversations between john and fbi agents139 johns attorneys moved to quash the subpoenas arguing that they were overly broad and sought information unrelated to the present case or hastert139 in october 2015 judge kocoras said that he would review the records in camera privately before deciding what information should be turned over saying this case has more than its share of sensitivity and unusual aspects139 in april 2017 judge kocoras dismissed the suit finding that john did not qualify as a whistleblower under the fca140 johns attorney said that an appeal was possible140 the dismissal did not turn on whether hastert actually misused the speakers office but rather whether john met a prerequisite for a false claims act suit that he brought the allegations to the government’s attention before anyone else and before they were made public141 kocoras held that john had falsely claims that he had told the fbi about possible misuse of federal resources by hastert141 other activitiesedit after retiring from congress hastert made occasional public appearances on political programs5 he also made some endorsements of political candidates in the 2012 republican presidential primaries he endorsed mitt romney instead of his predecessor as speaker newt gingrich142 child sexual abuse and hushmoney schemeedit sexual abuse allegations emergeedit on may 29 2015 after hastert had been indicted for illicitly structuring financial transactions see below two people briefed on the evidence from the case stated that individual a—the man to whom hastert was making payments—had been sexually abused by hastert during hasterts time as a teacher and coach at yorkville high school and that hastert had paid 17 million out of the total 35 million in promised payment11 on the same day the los angeles times reported that investigators had spoken with a second former student not the person who was receiving payments from hastert who made similar allegations that corroborated what the first student said12 he admitted to sexual abuse during sentencing on unrelated crimes18143 on june 5 2015 abc news good morning america aired an interview with jolene reinboldt burdge the sister of steve reinboldt who was the student equipment manager of the wrestling team at yorkville high school when hastert was the wrestling coach10144145 hastert also ran an explorers group of which steve reinboldt was a member and led the group on a diving trip to the bahamas10 in the interview burdge stated that in 1979 eight years after reinboldts high school graduation in 1971 her brother had told her that he had been sexually abused by hastert throughout his four years of high school10 burdge said that she was stunned by this news and that her brother said that he had never told anyone before because he did not think he would be believed10 a message from hastert appears in steve reinboldts 1970 high school yearbook10 in the interview burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation jolene said that hastert damaged steve i think more than any of us will ever know10 reinboldt died of an aidsrelated illness in 199510 hastert attended his viewing which angered burdge she said i was just there just trying to bite my tongue thinking that blood was coming out because i was just so after he had gone through the line i followed him out into the parking lot of the funeral home i said i want to know why you did what you did to my brother and he just stood there and stared at me he didnt say what are you talking about’ you know or what i dont know what youre talking about’ he just stood there and stared at me then i just continued to say i want you to know your secret didnt die in there with my brother and i want you to remember that i’m out here and that i know’ and again he just stood there and he did not say a word10 hastert then got in his car and left burdge said hasterts lack of a response ‘said everything’10 following reinboldts death around the time that the mark foley scandal broke in 2006 burdge unsuccessfully attempted to bring the charges against hastert to light she contacted abc news and the associated press on an offtherecord basis and also contacted some advocacy groups10144 abc news and the ap could not corroborate jolenes allegation at the time and hastert denied the accusation to abc news at the time so the claim was not published10144146 abc news reported that for years jolene watched helplessly as hastert basked in fame and power seated to the left of the president for years in the early 2000s for the nationallytelevised state of the union address10 several days before the indictment was unsealed burdge was interviewed by fbi agents who asked her about her brother and informed her hastert was about to be indicted on federal charges10 neither reinboldt nor burdge are individual a named in the indictment but burdge believes that individual a is familiar with what happened with her brother10 the statements by burdge marked the first time that a person has been publicly identified as a possible victim of mr hastert9 reactionsedit the emergence of the sexual abuse allegations against hastert brought renewed attention to the 2006 mark foley scandal and the criticism of hastert that he failed to take appropriate action in that case147148 in the wake of the sexual abuse allegations journalists noted that hastert was a supporter of measures which sought to enhance punishments for child sexual abuse such as the adam walsh child protection and safety act and the child abuse prevention and enforcement act of 2000149150 in 2003 hastert publicly called for legislation to put repeat child molesters into jail for the rest of their lives150 hastert resigned his lobbyist position at the law and lobbying firm dickstein shapiro the day the indictment was unsealed126127128 his biography was quickly removed from the firms website and the firm purged all mentions of him from its previously posted press releases125 hasterts resignation left the firm reeling according to a report in politico125 following the hastert indictment dickstein shapiros biggest domestic client fuels america terminated its lobbying contract with the firm125 on may 29 2015 yorkville community unit school district 115 released a statement reading the district was first made aware of any

time31 on may 29 2015 senator mark kirk republican of illinois who served in the house throughout hasterts tenure as speaker released a statement reading anyone who knows denny is shocked and confused

keep our mission pac152 kirks announcement was made following the democratic senatorial campaign committee dsccs call upon the senator to return or donate denny hasterts money immediately153 the dscc also called upon republican senators john boozman of arkansas and roy blunt of missouri who received 11000 and 5000 respectively from hasterts pac in recent years to return or donate the funds152 on may 30 2015 illinoiss other senator dick durbin a democrat stated it seems so out of character for denny i just never could imagine that hed be involved in anything like this we had our political differences as you might expect but i respected him as a colleague in the illinois delegation and as speaker154 on may 29 2015 white house press secretary josh earnest stated in response to a reporters question that there is nobody here at the white house who derives any pleasure from reading about the former speakers legal troubles at this point155156 on the same day house speaker john

2015 current federal housing finance agency director and former us representative mel watt democrat of north carolina released a statement saying over 15 years ago i heard an unseemly rumor from someone who contrary to what has been reported was not an intermediary or advocate for the alleged victims family it would not be the first nor last time that i as a member of congress would hear rumors or innuendoes about colleagues i had no direct knowledge of any abuse by former speaker hastert and therefore took no action158 the hastert scandal was named by msnbc as top political sex scandals of 2015159 by the associated press as one of top 10 illinois stories of 2015160 and by abc news as one of the biggest moments on capitol hill in 2015161 hasterts sentencing was also named by the associated press as one of top 10 illinois stories of 2016162 investigation and prosecutionedit federal investigation into hushmoney schemeedit according to a 2017 interview with the two special agents leading the investigations — one from the fbi and the other from the irs criminal investigation division — hastert had been on the fbi’s radar as early as november 2012 — even before the fbi and irs began investigating the suspicious cash withdrawals that were hasterts downfall137 the inquiry was first prompted by allegations that hastert had used his taxpayerfunded office of the former speaker to further his private business ventures something that hastert was never charged with137 in 2013 the fbi and irs began investigating hasterts cash withdrawals and in early 2015 they had learned about the hush money agreement between individual a and hastert137 in a december 8 2014 interview hastert lied to the federal agents about the purpose of the withdrawals leading to his federal prosecution137 indictmentedit on may 28 2015 a sevenpage indictment of hastert by a federal grand jury was unsealed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois in chicago23163164 the indictment charged hastert with unlawfully structuring the withdrawal of 952000 in cash in order to evade the requirement that banks report cash transactions over us10000 title 31 united states code section 5324a3 and making false statements to the fbi about the purpose of his withdrawals title 18 united states code section 1001a2 the indictment alleges that hastert agreed to make payments of 35 million to an unnamed subject identified in the indictment only as an individual a from yorkville illinois who was known to hastert for most of individual as life the indictment states that the payments were to compensate for and conceal hasterts prior misconduct yorkville is the town where hastert was a high school teacher for 16 years3163165 federal authorities began investigating his withdrawals in 2013166 in late 2014 after being questioned about the withdrawals hastert said that he did not trust banks shortly afterward hastert changed his story saying that he was the victim of extortion by individual a for false molestation accusations18 the indictment itself did not specify the exact nature of the past misconduct referred to28 the us attorneys office limited details in the indictment of hastert in part because of a request from hasterts attorneys167168169 in june 2015 the new york times reported that hastert had approached a business associate j david john in 2010 to look for a financial adviser to come up with an annuity plan that would generate a substantial cash payout each year170 this request was the same year that prosecutors say he agreed to start paying hush money to the person he allegedly committed misconduct against171 john told the new york times that i did not think much about it at the time but looking back at it it does seem strange he just said he needed to generate some cash170 on may 29 hastert was released on his own recognizance on a preliminary bail of 4500 set by a magistrate judge130168 arraignment and pretrial proceedingsedit the case was assigned to us district judge thomas m durkin28 hastert was scheduled to be arraigned on june 4 2015172 the arraignment was then postponed to june 9173 in between the unsealing of the indictment and the arraignment hastert made no public appearances and did not release any public statement174175 however on may 29 2015 cbs chicago reported that hastert had privately told close friends that i am a victim too and that he was sorry they had to go through the ordeal176 the criminal defense attorney barry william levine a partner at hasterts former firm of dickstein shapiro appeared as hasterts lawyer on a notice of arraignment filed with the us district court177 however levine did not enter an appearance on hasterts behalf125177 hastert subsequently hired attorney thomas c green to provide his legal defense green entered an appearance with the court on june 8 the day before the arraignment7 green is a whitecollar criminal defense lawyer and senior counsel at the washington dc office of the law firm sidley austin178179 green has represented clients in several national controversies including several government officials in the whitewater scandal richard v secord in the irancontra scandal and robert mardian in the watergate scandal178179 the prosecutors assigned to the case were originally assistant united states attorneys steven block and carrie hamilton180 hamilton left the us attorneys office in july 2015 after being appointed as a judge of the circuit court of cook county diane macarthur replaced hamilton on the hastert prosecution team180 the arraignment was held on june 9 2015 the arraignment generated a degree of media interest at the illinois federal courthouse not seen since the proceedings against illinois governors rod blagojevich and george ryan on corruption charges181182 the chicago tribune reported hasterts entrance and exit from the courthouse touched off a wild scene as federal homeland security agents escorted hastert and his attorneys to and from a waiting vehicle amid a crush of television news crews and photographers183 on that day before the hearing prosecutors filed a bail report and supplementary document under seal such reports are often filed under seal because they include financial information about a defendant and sometimes unreleased details relating to the investigation7 before the arraignment hastert arrived at the loop offices of sidley austin his attorneys law firm and at the courthouse met with the pretrial services office78 at the twentyminute arraignment hearing at the dirksen federal courthouse before durkin hastert entered a plea of not guilty78184 durkin set a 4500 unsecured bond as well as various other conditions of pretrial release and hastert surrendered his passport185 much of the arraignment was spent on durkins disclosure of his connections with hastert durkin contributed 500 in 2002 and 1000 in 2004 to the hastert for congress campaign the contributions were made while durkin was a partner at the law firm mayer brown before he was appointed to the federal bench in 2012186 and hasterts son ethan is a partner at mayer brown186 at the arraignment durkin stated he had never met hastert and that i have no doubt i can be impartial in this matter but also said that i am not naive enough to think that a reasonable person would not question my impartiality and gave the parties time to decide whether to object and thus trigger the reassignment of the case to a different judge184185187 on june 11 federal prosecutors and hasterts lawyers filed notices waiving any objection to durkin presiding over the case188189 in separate court filings on june 11 abc news chief investigative correspondent brian ross and nbc nightly news reporter gabe gutierrez were cited for violating dirksen us courthouse general orders during the arraignment for attempting to interview hastert in an unauthorized area in the lobby court rules allow interviews only in a ropedoff media bullpen area183190 in court filings posted on june 30 chief us district judge ruben castillo dismissed the contempt filings after accepting apologies offered by their attorneys on their behalf191 on june 12 federal prosecutors with the agreement of hasterts attorneys filed a motion for a protective order seeking to bar the public disclosure of the identity of individual a and other sensitive information192 the motion states that the discovery to be provided by the government in this case includes sensitive information the unrestricted dissemination of which could adversely affect law enforcement interests and the privacy interests of third parties192 the proposed order would direct the parties to file under seal any such sensitive information192 on june 15 hastert canceled a scheduled appearance at an illinois broadcasters association event193 on june 16 judge durkin granted the motion for a protective order194195 but did not yet sign an order196 at a status hearing on june 18 which hastert did not attend hasterts attorney green stated that something has to be done to stop these leaks theyre unconscionable and they have to stop196 assistant us attorney steven block told durkin that prosecutors were also troubled by the leaks and that the government is doing everything we can to stop them196 at the same status conference durkin told the attorneys that he plans to modify the protective order to make it less restrictive196 rather than having all material that might be considered sensitive filed under seal durkin said that he might grant a motion directing lawyers to file a motion requesting that the material be filed under seal first196 if durkin granted such a motion the attorneys would file both a complete copy under seal and a redacted copy that would be publicly available196 at a status hearing on july 14 which hastert again did not attend the parties updated the court on preparations for trial197 at the hearing green again condemned leaks stating in court the indictment has effectively been amended by leaks from the government it is now an 800pound gorilla in this case it has been injected in this case i think impermissibly the question is whether i wrestle with that gorilla or i dont wrestle with that gorilla198 green also said that the defense would file a motion to dismiss the indictment possibly under seal198 judge durkin cautioned that even if he allows part or all of the motion to be hidden from the public his ruling would be public and likely would disclose sealed portions of the motion198 at the same hearing the prosecution said that they expected a trial to last about two weeks198 hastert shut down his keep our mission leadership pac at the end of june 2015 and transferred 10000 the vast majority of the pacs remaining funds to a new legal defense fund the j dennis hastert defense trust199200 a federal elections commission report lists the defense funds address as a sunapee new

motion requesting another twoweek extension from september 28 to october 13 the motion said that the parties were discussing issues that hastert may raise in pretrial motions but provided no details202 at a hearing on september 28 hasterts attorneys and the government confirmed that they were discussing a possible plea agreement judge durkin said that if no plea agreement was reached he wanted the case to go to trial in march or april 2016203 pretrial motions were due on october 13 but none were filed indicating that hastert and the government were nearing a plea deal164 on october 15 2015 it was announced at a court hearing that hastert and federal prosecutors had reached a plea agreement164 on october 28 2015 under the plea agreement hastert appeared in court the only time

said in court i didnt want them bank officials to know how i intended to spend the money i withdrew the money in less than 10000 increments204 possible sentences within a preliminary federal sentencing guidelines calculation ranged from probation to six months in prison15206207 the plea agreement allowed hastert to avoid a potentially long and embarrassing trial and was thought to enable him to keep secret information that he has hidden for years15164204 admission of sexual abuse and sentencing proceedingsedit soon after pleading guilty hastert suffered a stroke and was hospitalized from november 2015 to january 15 2016207 hastert remained free on bail pending sentencing205 sentencing was originally set for february 29 2016204 however in late january 2016 hasterts attorneys asked the court to delay sentencing due to hasterts ongoing health problems207 and judge durkin postponed sentencing until april 8 2016208 in march 2016 judge durkin ordered the appointment of a medical expert to review hasterts health in preparation for sentencing209 later in march 2016 judge durkin postponed the sentencing hearing over the objection of hasterts attorneys to april 27 so that a man

detailed specific graphic incidents of sexual acts16212 prosecutors asked for a sixmonth sentence as called for under federal sentencing guidelines16 prosecutors also requested the court to order hastert to undergo a sex offender evaluation and comply with any recommended treatment16 while hasterts health problems had the possibility to help him avoid prison213 prosecutors noted in their court filing that he could receive medical treatment while incarcerated if necessary16 sixty letters asking for leniency for hastert were submitted to the court ahead of sentencing but nineteen of these letters were withdrawn after judge durkin said that he would not consider any letters that were not made public214 of the fortyone letters that were made public several were from current or former members of congress john t doolittle david dreier thomas w ewing and porter goss who also is a former cia director215 the chicago tribune noted that delay and doolittle had have had legal troubles of

sexual abuse because the statute of limitations has expired for his conduct decades earlier217 reactions to hastert caseedit following the sentence the chicago tribune editorial board praised the bravery of the victims and their families who confronted the man who was once second in line to be president and wrote of the sentence the enduring impact is that the truth has been revealed and for as long as the name dennis hastert is recalled the man once respected as a leader will be known as a criminal a scoundrel a child molester218 the washington post editorial board hailed the sentence writing that hasterts victims should not have had to struggle with what mr hastert did to them all the while they watched him rise in stature and power219 the post called for extending statutes of limitations in sexabuse cases to give victims more time to come forward and prosecutors more time to pursue perpetrators219 new york times columnist frank bruni wrote that hasterts case underscored the danger that comes with the quickness and frequency with which so many of us equate displays of religious devotion with actual rectitude noting that hasterts public displays of christian faith during his time in office were a factor in his colleagues assessments of him as safe uncontroversial220 bruni also critiqued the testimonials that prominent republicans submitted on hasterts behalf before sentencing saying that these affirm the degree to which pacts rather than principle govern partisan politics today220 jacob sullum of reason magazine opined that the financial structuring offense of which hastert was convicted should not be a crime even if it occasionally provides the means for punishing actual criminals who would otherwise escape justice221 conor friedersdorf of the atlantic expressed similar views writing the alarming aspect of this case is the fact that an american is ultimately being prosecuted for the crime of evading federal government surveillance222 the hastert scandal was one motivation for the advance of legislation in the illinois general assembly to eliminate the statute of limitations for all felony child abuse and sexual assault offenses223 the measure unanimously passed the state senate in march 2017224 civil lawsuits against hastertedit individual a james brown lawsuitedit in april 2016 individual a commenced an action against hastert for breach of contract in illinois state court in kendall county individual a suing under pseudonym james brown seeks to collect the remaining 18 million in hush money allegedly promised to him by hastert225226 in the complaint individual a alleges that he was molested at age 14 by hastert and that he confronted hastert after having a conversation in 2008 with another person who said they had been abused by hastert225 individual a alleges that he suffered panic attacks and other problems for years as a result of the abuse225 in july 2016 hastert through his attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the case arguing that the statute of limitations had expired and that individual a violated a verbal agreement with hastert by disclosing the sexual abuse to federal authorities226 in november 2016 the court denied the motion227 in march 2017 the attorney for individual a suggested that the case would likely be resolved by an outofcourt settlement228 richard doe lawsuit and related police reportedit in may 2016 a second man filed a lawsuit against hastert in his complaint the man alleges that hastert sexually assaulting him in the bathroom of a community building in yorkville in the summer of either 1973 or 1974 when the man was nine or ten years old and in the fourth grade the complaint gives details of the alleged violent assault—and the mans threats if he reported what occurred—and says that the boy only recognized hastert as the assailant after hastert appeared at yorkville grade school in gym class229230 a kendall county granted the mans motion to proceed anonymously as plaintiff under the richard doe pseudonym229 in the complaint the man states that when he was 20 or 21 years old he comprehended what had occurred and reported the crime to the kendall county states attorneys office but that thenstates attorney dallas c ingemunson threatened to charge him with a crime and accused him of slandering hasterts name229 ingemunson denies this allegation calling it bogus229 in may 2016 richard doe filed a report with the kendall county sheriffs office but the states attorneys office determined that the statute of limitations barred a complaint against anyone229 nbc chicago obtained a redacted version of the sheriffs office police report230 imprisonment and life postsentencingedit prisonedit hastert did not appeal his conviction or sentence231 shortly after being sentenced hastert paid the 250000 fine232 and was ordered to report to prison on june 22 2016233 on that date hastert reported to the federal medical center rochester in minnesota to begin his prison term234 in july 2017 after serving about 13 months of a 15month sentence hastert was released from federal prison and returned to chicago under residential reentry management supervision19235 effect on pensionsedit soon after sentencing the illinois teachers retirement system announced that hastert would forfeit future teachers pension benefits effective immediately due to a state law depriving pension benefits from educators who are convicted of felonies relating to their employment236 hastert is challenging the systems decision to terminate his pension which amounted to about 16000 a year on the ground that the specific federal crimes of which he was convicted was not directly related to his time as a teacher237 hasterts pension for his service in the illinois general assembly — about 28000 a year237 — was originally unaffected236 however in october 2016 the general assembly retirement system board of trustees unanimously voted to suspend hasterts pension237 and in april 2017 the board voted 52 to terminate the pension238 the decision came after an earlier recommendation from the state attorney generals office that the board reduce hasterts pension to 9000 per year239 board member michael j zalewski voted to terminate the pension while state representative david harris voted against termination saying that he preferred reducing the pension instead as recommended by the state attorney generals office240 notwithstanding his conviction hastert continues to receive his congressional pension241 which amounts to about 73000 a year237
