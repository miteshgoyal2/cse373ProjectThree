against youtube main article viacom international inc v youtube inc in february 2007 viacom sent upwards of 100000 digital millennium copyright act takedown notices to the videosharing site youtube of the 100000 notices approximately 60–70 noninfringing videos were removed under the auspices of copyright infringement8 on march 13 2007 viacom filed a us1 billion legal claim viacom international inc v youtube inc against google and youtube alleging massive copyright infringement alleging that users frequently uploaded copyrighted material to youtube—enough to cause a hit in revenue for viacom and a gain in advertisement revenue for youtube31 the complaint contended that almost 160000 unauthorized clips of viacoms programming were made available on youtube and that these clips had collectively been viewed more than 15 billion times in july 2008 the case generated controversy when district judge louis stanton ruled that youtube was required to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site32 judge stanton rejected viacoms request for youtube to hand over the source code of its search engine system saying that the code was a trade secret33 google and viacom later agreed to allow google to anonymize all the data before handing it over to viacom34 on june 23 2010 judge stanton ruled in googles favor in a motion for summary judgment holding that google was protected by provisions of the digital millennium copyright act notwithstanding evidence of intentional copyright infringement viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling35 on april 5 2012 the ruling was overturned by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit36 writing for a twojudge panel because judge roger miner had died while the trial was pending of the second circuit judge josé a cabranes concluded that a reasonable jury could find that youtube had actual knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its website eric goldman a professor at the santa clara university school of law expressed concern that the ruling would negatively affect startups by making them more hairtrigger on taking down news or content for fear that failure to do so will be held against them by content providers37 viacom international main article viacom international as with the old viacom the current company owns viacom international
