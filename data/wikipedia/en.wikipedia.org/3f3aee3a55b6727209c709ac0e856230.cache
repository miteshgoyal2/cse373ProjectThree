nashua debate between ronald reagan left and george h w bush right with the other candidates in single digits the nashua telegraph offered to host a debate between reagan and bush worried that a newspapersponsored debate might violate electoral regulations reagan subsequently arranged to fund the event with his own campaign money inviting candidates john anderson howard baker phil crane and bob dole to participate at short notice the bush camp did not learn of reagans decision to include the other candidates until the debate was due to commence bush refused to participate which led to an impasse on the stage as reagan attempted to explain his decision the editor of the nashua telegraph ordered the sound man to mute reagans microphone a visibly angry reagan responded i am paying for this microphone mr green sic referring to the editor jon breen123 eventually the other candidates agreed to leave and the debate proceeded between reagan and bush reagans quote was often repeated as i
