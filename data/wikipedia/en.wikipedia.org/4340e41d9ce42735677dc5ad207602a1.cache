in both chicago and boston21 world war i participation and the nobel peace prizeedit gen charles dawes during world war i dawes helped support the first anglofrench loan to the entente powers of 500 million dawes support was important because the house of morgan needed public support from a nonmorgan banker the morgan banker thomas lamont said that dawes support would make a position for him in

the beginning of my service as i am of the senate at the end — charles g dawes28 at the 1924 republican national convention president calvin coolidge was quickly selected almost without opposition to be the republican presidential nominee29 the vice presidential nominee was more contested illinois governor frank lowden was nominated but declined coolidges next choice was idaho senator william borah but he also declined the nomination the republican national chairman william butler pledged to nominate then commerce secretary herbert hoover but he was not sufficiently popular29 eventually the delegates chose dawes to be the vice presidential nominee coolidge quickly accepted the delegates choice and felt that dawes would be loyal to him and make a strong addition to his campaign29 dawes traveled throughout the country during the campaign giving speeches to bolster the republican ticket he frequently attacked progressive nominee robert m la follette sr as a dangerous radical who sympathized with the bolsheviks9 dawes was elected vice president of the united states on november 4 1924 with more popular votes than the candidates from the democratic and progressive parties combined30 the inauguration was held on march 4 192531 on march 10 the presidents nomination of charles b warren to be united states attorney general was being debated in the wake of the teapot dome

warrens nomination desiring to take a break for a nap dawes consulted the majority and minority leaders who assured him that no vote would be taken that afternoon after dawes left the senate however all but one of the scheduled speakers decided against making formal remarks and a vote was taken when it became apparent that the vote would be tied republican leaders hastily called dawes at the willard hotel and he immediately left while waiting for dawes to arrive the only democratic senator who had voted for warren switched his vote the nomination had failed by a single vote resulting in the first such rejection of a presidents nominee in nearly 60 years28 this incident was chronicled in a derisive poem based on the longfellow poem paul reveres ride it began with the line come gather round children and hold your applause for the afternoon ride of charlie dawes the choice of poem was based on charles dawes being descended from william dawes who rode with paul reverecitation needed

the convention chose herbert hoover9 rumors circulated about dawes serving as the vice presidential candidate on the ticket with hoover coolidge made it known that he would consider an affront the

office and head the newly created reconstruction finance corporation rfc but after a few months dawes resigned from the rfc as a board member of the failing city national bank and trust company of chicago he felt obligated to work for its rescuecitation needed political opponents alleged that under dawes leadership the rfc had given his bank preferential treatmentcitation needed this marked the
