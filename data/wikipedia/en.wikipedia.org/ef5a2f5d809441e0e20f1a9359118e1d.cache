click fraud from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search click fraud is a type of fraud that occurs on the internet in payperclick ppc online advertising in this type of advertising the owners of websites that post the ads are paid an amount of money determined by how many visitors to the sites click on the ads fraud occurs when a person automated script or computer program imitates a legitimate user of a web browser clicking on such an ad without having an actual interest in the target of the ads link1 click fraud is the subject of some controversy and increasing litigation due to the advertising networks being a key beneficiary of the fraud media entrepreneur and journalist john battelle describes click fraud as the intendedlymalicious decidedly black hat practice of publishers illegitimately gaming paid search advertising by employing robots or lowwage workers to repeatedly click on each adsense ad on their sites thereby generating money to be paid by the advertiser to the publisher and to google2 contents 1 payperclick advertising 2 noncontracting parties 3 organization 31 hit inflation attack 4 manipulation of organic search results 5 legal cases 51 lawsuits 52 michael anthony bradley 53 fabio gasperini 6 solutions 7 research 8 see also 9 references 10 external links payperclick advertisingedit main article payperclick ppc advertising is an arrangement in which webmasters operators of websites acting as publishers display clickable links from advertisers in exchange for a charge per click as this industry evolved a number of advertising networks developed which acted as middlemen between these two groups publishers and advertisers each time a believed to be valid web user clicks on an ad the advertiser pays the advertising network which in turn pays the publisher a share of this money this revenuesharing system is seen as an incentive for click fraud the largest of the advertising networks googles adwordsadsense and yahoo search marketing act in a dual role since they are also publishers themselves on their search engines3 according to critics this complex relationship may create a conflict of interest this is because these companies lose money to undetected click fraud when paying out to the publisher but make more money when collecting fees from the advertiser because of the spread between what they collect and pay out unfettered click fraud would create shortterm profits for these companiescitation needed noncontracting partiesedit a secondary source of click fraud is noncontracting parties who are not part of any payperclick agreement this type of fraud is even harder to police because perpetrators generally cannot be sued for breach of contract or charged criminally with fraud examples of noncontracting parties are competitors of advertisers these parties may wish to harm a competitor who advertises in the same market by clicking on their ads the perpetrators do not profit directly but force the advertiser to pay for irrelevant clicks thus weakening or eliminating a source of competition competitors of publishers these persons may wish to frame a publisher it is made to look as if the publisher is clicking on its own ads the advertising network may then terminate the relationship many publishers rely exclusively on revenue from advertising and could be put out of business by such an attack other malicious intent as with vandalism there are many motives for wishing to cause harm to either an advertiser or a publisher even by people who have nothing to gain financially motives include political and personal vendettas these cases are often the hardest to deal with since it is difficult to track down the culprit and if found there is little legal action that can be taken against them friends of the publisher sometimes upon learning a publisher profits from ads being clicked a supporter of the publisher like a fan family member political party supporter charity patron or personal friend will click on the ads to help this can be considered patronage however this can backfire when the publisher not the friend is accused of click fraud advertising networks may try to stop fraud by all parties but often do not know which clicks are legitimate unlike fraud committed by the publisher it is difficult to know who should pay when past click fraud is found publishers resent having to pay refunds for something that is not their fault however advertisers are adamant that they should not have to pay for phony clicks organizationedit click fraud can be as simple as one person starting a small web site becoming a publisher of ads and clicking on those ads to generate revenue often the number of clicks and their value is so small that the fraud goes undetected publishers may claim that small amounts of such clicking is an accident which is often the casecitation needed much largerscale fraud also occurs4 those engaged in largescale fraud will often run scripts which simulate a human clicking on ads in web pages5 however huge numbers of clicks appearing to come from just one or a small number of computers or a single geographic area look highly suspicious to the advertising network and advertisers clicks coming from a computer known to be that of a publisher also look suspicious to those watching for click fraud a person attempting largescale fraud from one computer stands a good chance of being caught one type of fraud that circumvents detection based on ip patterns uses existing user traffic turning this into clicks or impressions6 such an attack can be camouflaged from users by using 0size iframes to display advertisements that are programmatically retrieved using javascript it could also be camouflaged from advertisers and portals by ensuring that socalled reverse spiders are presented with a legitimate page while human visitors are presented with a page that commits click fraud the use of 0size iframes and other techniques involving human visitors may also be combined with the use of incentivized traffic where members of paid to read ptr sites are paid small amounts of money often a fraction of a cent to visit a website andor click on keywords and search results sometimes hundreds or thousands of times every day7 some owners of ptr sites are members of ppc engines and may send many email ads to users who do search while sending few ads to those who do not they do this mainly because the charge per click on search results is often the only source of revenue to the site this is known as forced searching a practice that is frowned upon in the get paid to industry organized crime can handle this by having many computers with their own internet connections in different geographic locations often scripts fail to mimic true human behavior so organized crime networks use trojan code to turn the average persons machines into zombie computers and use sporadic redirects or dns cache poisoning to turn the oblivious users actions into actions generating revenue for the scammer it can be difficult for advertisers advertising networks and authorities to pursue cases against networks of people spread around multiple countries impression fraud is when falsely generated ad impressions affect an advertisers account in the case of clickthrough rate based auction models the advertiser may be penalized for having an unacceptably low clickthrough for a given keyword this involves making numerous searches for a keyword without clicking of the ad such ads are disabled8 automatically enabling a competitors lowerbid ad for the same keyword to continue while several high bidders on the first page of the search results have been eliminated hit inflation attackedit a hit inflation attack is a kind of fraudulent method used by some advertisement publishers to earn unjustified revenue on the traffic they drive to the advertisers’ web sites it is more sophisticated and harder to detect than a simple inflation attack this process involves the collaboration of two counterparts a dishonest publisher p and a dishonest web site s web pages on s contain a script that redirects the customer to ps web site and this process is hidden from the customer so when user u retrieves a page on s it would simulate a click or request to a page on ps site ps site has two kinds of webpages a manipulated version and an original version the manipulated version simulates a click or request to the advertisement causing p to be credited for the clickthrough p selectively determines whether to load the manipulated and thus fraudulent script to us browser by checking if it was from s this can be done through the referrer field which specifies the site from which the link to p was obtained all requests from s will be loaded with the manipulated script and thus the automatic and hidden request will be sent9 this attack will silently convert every innocent visit to s to a click on the advertisement on ps page even worse p can be in collaboration with several dishonest web sites each of which can be in collaboration with several dishonest publishers if the advertisement commissioner visits the web site of p the nonfraudulent page will be displayed and thus p cannot be accused of being fraudulent without a reason for suspecting that such collaboration exists the advertisement commissioner has to inspect all the internet sites to detect such attacks which is infeasible9 another proposed method for detection of this type of fraud is through use of association rules10 manipulation of organic search resultsedit one major factor that affects the ranking of websites in organic search results is the ctr clickthrough rate that is the ratio of clicks to impressions or in other words how many times a search result is clicked on as compared to the number of times the listing appears in search results in contrast to ppc fraud where a competitor leverages the services of a botnet or low cost labour to generate false clicks in this case the objective is to beggar thy competitor by making their ctr rate as low as possible thereby diminishing their ranking factor position from the top of search results bad actors will therefore generate false clicks on organic search results that they wish to promote while avoiding search results they wish to demote this technique can effectively create a cartel of business services controlled by the same bad actor or be used to promote a certain political opinion etc the scale of this issue is unknown but is certainly evident to many website developers who pay close attention to the statistics in webmaster tools legal casesedit lawsuitsedit disputes over the issue have resulted in a number of lawsuits in one case google acting as both an advertiser and advertising network won a lawsuit against a texas company called auction experts acting as a publisher which google accused of paying people to click on ads that appeared on auction experts site costing advertisers 5000011 despite networks efforts to stop it publishers are suspicious of the motives of the advertising networks because the advertising network receives money for each click even if it is fraudulent in july 2005 yahoo settled a classaction lawsuit against it by plaintiffs alleging it did not do enough to prevent click fraud yahoo paid 45 million in legal bills for the plaintiffs and agreed to settle advertiser claims dating back to 200412 in july 2006 google settled a similar suit for 90 million1314 on march 8 2006 google agreed to a 90 million settlement fund in the classaction lawsuit filed by lanes gifts collectibles15 the classaction lawsuit was filed in miller county arkansas by dallas attorneys steve malouf joel fineberg and dean gresham16 the expert witness for the plaintiffs in the case was jessie stricchiola an internet search expert who first identified instances of ppc fraud in 200117 michael anthony bradleyedit in 2004 california resident michael anthony bradley created google clique a software program that he claimed could let spammers defraud google out of millions of dollars in fraudulent clicks which ultimately led to his arrest and indictment18 bradley used technology that he created for his other companies that took him five years to develop using this technology he was able to demonstrate that fraud was possible and was impossible for google to detect bradley notified google of this security flaw and was willing to work with them to close up some of these holes however bradley was offered 500000 for his software and technology by some of the worlds top spammers with this information bradley thought he could put a price of 100000 on his technology and offered to sell google all rights to his technology and they could make the internet a better and safer place when bradley showed up to googles offices he demonstrated the software for them and when they asked what he wanted he had stated that he would consult for free if they wanted to purchase the rights to his technology he explained the prior offer of 500000 and said he knew he could get it but would settle for 100000 if they wanted to work together bradley returned to googles offices and was met by united states secret service officers who were undercover they kept asking him what he wanted and they even pushed a check for 100000 to him bradley stated that this felt like blackmail and was not comfortable with this and pushed the money away just then the secret service came in and arrested him authorities said he was arrested while trying to extort 100000 from google in exchange for handing over the program19 charges were dropped without explanation on november 22 2006 both the us attorneys office and google declined to comment business week suggests that google was unwilling to cooperate with the prosecution as it would be forced to disclose its click fraud detection techniques publicly20 fabio gasperiniedit in 2017 fabio gasperini an italian citizen was extradited to the united states on click fraud charges the indictment charged gasperini with  two counts of computer intrusion one count of wire fraud one count of wire fraud conspiracy and one count of money laundering according to the us government gasperini set up and operated a botnet of over 140000 computers around the world this was the first click fraud trial in the united states if convicted of all counts gasperini risked up to 70 years in jail simone bertollini an italianamerican lawyer represented gasperini at trial the jury acquitted gasperini of all the felony charges of the indictment gasperini was convicted of one misdemeanor count of obtaining information without a financial gain gasperini was sentenced to time served and sent back to italy an appeal is currently pending solutionsedit proving click fraud can be very difficult since it is hard to know who is behind a computer and what their intentions are often the best an advertising network can do is to identify which clicks are most likely fraudulent and not charge the account of the advertiser even more sophisticated means of detection are used21 but none are foolproof the tuzhilin report22 produced as part of a click fraud lawsuit settlement has a detailed and comprehensive discussion of these issues in particular it defines the fundamental problem of invalid fraudulent clicks there is no conceptual definition of invalid clicks that can be operationalized except for certain obviously clear cases an operational definition cannot be fully disclosed to the general public because of the concerns that unethical users will take advantage of it which may lead to a massive click fraud however if it is not disclosed advertisers cannot verify or even dispute why they have been charged for certain clicks the ppc industry is lobbying for tighter laws on the issue many hope to have laws that will cover those not bound by contracts a number of companies are developing viable solutions for click fraud identification and are developing intermediary relationships with advertising networks such solutions fall into two categories forensic analysis of advertisers web server log files this analysis of the advertisers web server data requires an indepth look at the source and behavior of the traffic as industry standard log files are used for the analysis the data is verifiable by advertising networks the problem with this approach is that it relies on the honesty of the middlemen in identifying fraud thirdparty corroboration third parties offer webbased solutions that might involve placement of singlepixel images or javascript on the advertisers web pages and suitable tagging of the ads the visitor may be presented with a cookie visitor information is then collected in a thirdparty data store and made available for download the better offerings make it easy to highlight suspicious clicks and they show the reasons for such a conclusion since an advertisers log files can be tampered with their accompaniment with corroborating data from a third party forms a more convincing body of evidence to present to the advertising network however the problem with thirdparty solutions is that such solutions see only part of the traffic of the entire network hence they can be less likely to identify patterns that span several advertisers in addition due to the limited amount of traffic they receive when compared to middlemen they can be overly or less aggressive when judging traffic to be fraud in a 2007 interview in forbes google click fraud czar shuman ghosemajumder said that one of the key challenges in click fraud detection by thirdparties was access to data beyond clicks notably ad impression data23 click fraud is less likely in cost per action models researchedit the fact that the middlemen search engines have the upper hand in the operational definition of invalid clicks is the reason for the conflict of interest between advertisers and the middlemen as described above this is manifested in the tuzhilin report22 as described above the tuzhilin report did not publicly define invalid clicks and did not describe the operational definitions in detail rather it gave a highlevel picture of the frauddetection system and argued that the operational definition of the search engine under investigations is reasonable one aim of the report was to preserve the privacy of the frauddetection system in order to maintain its effectiveness this prompted some researchers to conduct public research on how the middlemen can fight click fraud24 since such research is presumably not tainted by market forces there is hope that this research can be adopted to assess how rigorous a middleman is in detecting click fraud in future law cases the fear that this research can expose the internal frauddetection system of middlemen still applies an example of such research is that done by metwally agrawal and el abbadi at ucsb other work by majumdar kulkarni and ravishankar at uc riverside proposes protocols for the identification of
