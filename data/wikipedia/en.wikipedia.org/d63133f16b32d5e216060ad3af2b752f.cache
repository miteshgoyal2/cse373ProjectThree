in 1957 he joined in with editors from magazines of several other colleges and universities for an editorial project to investigate issues in higher education in perspective the meeting occurred on the day the first sputnik circled the earth october 4 1957 so the moonshooter project was formed as a supplement on higher education for the college magazines the college magazine editors promised 60 percent of one issue of their magazine to finance the supplement the first moonshooter report was 32 pages long and titled american higher education 1958 they sold 135 million copies to 15 colleges and universities by the projects third year circulation was over three million for the supplement67 in 1959 gwaltney left johns hopkins magazine to become the first fulltime employee of the newly created editorial projects for education epe later renamed editorial projects in education starting in an office in his apartment in baltimore and later moving to an office near the johns hopkins campus8 he realized that higher education would benefit from a news publication6 he and other board members of epe met to plan a new publication which would be called the chronicle of higher education6 the chronicle of higher education was officially founded in 1966 by corbin gwaltney678 and its first issue was launched in november 1966910 although it was meant for those involved in higher education one of the founding ideas was that the general public had very little knowledge about what was going on in higher education and the real issues involved8 originally it didnt accept any advertising and didnt have any staffwritten editorial opinions it was supported by grants from the carnegie foundation and the ford foundation11 later on in its history advertising would be accepted especially for jobs in higher education and this would allow the newspaper to be financially independent811 by the 1970s the chronicle was attracting enough advertising to become selfsufficient and in 1978 the board of epe agreed to sell the newspaper to its editors12 epe sold the chronicle to the editors for 2000000 in cash and 500000 in services that chronicle would provide to epe8 chronicle went from a legal nonprofit status to a forprofit company this sale shifted the focus of nonprofit epe to k12 education inspired by the model established by the chronicle and with the support of the carnegie corporation and other philanthropies epe founded education week in september 1981912 in 1993 the chronicle was one of the first newspapers to appear on the internet as a gopher service it released an ipad version in 2011 the chronicle grossed 33 million in advertising revenues and 7 million in circulation revenues in 20031 awardsedit over the years the paper has been a finalist and winner of many journalism awards in 2005 two special reports – on diploma mills and plagiarism – were selected as finalists in the reporting category for a national magazine award it was a finalist for the award in general excellence every year from 2001 to 2005 in 2007 the chronicle won an utne reader independent press award for political coverage13 in its award citation utne called the chronicle review a fearless freethinking section where academias best and brightest can take their gloves off and swing with abandon at both sides of the increasingly predictable political divide the new republic the nation reason and the american prospect were among the finalists in the category referencesedit a b c miller lia new web site for academics roils education journalism the
