order and used supervisors and military controllers to handle the nations commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained134 a leading reference work on public administration

1982137138139 reagan implemented policies based on supplyside economics advocating a laissezfaire philosophy and freemarket fiscal policy140 seeking to stimulate the economy with large acrosstheboard tax cuts141142 he also supported returning the united states to some sort of gold standard and successfully urged congress to establish the us gold commission to study how one could be implemented citing the economic theories of arthur laffer reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation a theory that entered political discussion as the laffer curve reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt143 his policy of peace through strength resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40 real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985144 during reagans presidency federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the economic recovery tax act of 1981145 which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70 to 50 and the lowest bracket from 14 to 11 other tax increases passed by congress and signed by reagan ensured however that tax revenues over his two terms were 182 of gdp as compared to 181 over the 40year period of 1970–2010146 then in 1982 the job training partnership act of 1982 was signed into law initiating one of the

depression—then dropped during the rest of reagans presidency153 sixteen million new jobs were created while inflation significantly decreased154 the tax reform act of 1986 another bipartisan effort championed by reagan simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks the top rate was dropped to 28 but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20 to 28 the increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11 to 15 was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption standard deduction and earned income tax credit the net result was the removal of six million poor americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels155156 the net effect of all reaganera tax bills was a 1 decrease in government revenues when compared to treasury department revenue estimates from the administrations first postenactment january budgets157 however federal income tax receipts increased from 1980 to 1989 rising from 3087 billion to 549 billion158 or an average annual rate of 82 25 attributed to higher social security receipts and federal outlays grew at an annual rate of 71159160 addressing congress on the program for economic recovery april 28 1981 a few weeks after surviving an assassination attempt reagans policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment which would then lead to higher employment and wages critics labeled this trickledown economics—the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a trickledown effect to the poor161 questions arose whether reagans policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty162 and many poor and minority citizens viewed reagan as indifferent to their struggles162 these views were exacerbated by the fact that reagans economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at 335 an hour slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60 cutting the budget for public housing and section 8 rent subsidies in half and eliminating the antipoverty community development block grant program163 the widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before reagans economic policies took effect164 along with reagans 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20165 reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages with both topping out at 28166 reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency all in the name of fiscal responsibility167 according to paul krugman over all the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut as a share of gdp the increase was substantially larger than mr clintons 1993 tax increase168 according to historian and domestic policy adviser bruce bartlett reagans tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut169 further following his opposition to government intervention reagan cut the budgets of nonmilitary170 programs171 including medicaid food stamps federal education programs170 and the epa172 while he protected entitlement programs such as social security and medicare173 his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the social security disability rolls174 the administrations stance toward the savings and loan industry contributed to the savings and loan crisis it is also suggested by a minority of reaganomics critics that the policies partially influenced the stock market crash of 1987175 but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash176 in order to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits the united states borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad raising the national debt from 997 billion to 285 trillion177 reagan described the new debt as the greatest disappointment of his presidency154 he reappointed paul volcker as chairman of the federal reserve and in 1987 he appointed monetarist alan greenspan to succeed him reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil which had contributed to energy crises in the early 1970s178179 the price of oil subsequently dropped and the 1980s did not see the fuel shortages that the 1970s had179 reagan also fulfilled a 1980 campaign promise to repeal the windfall profits tax in 1988 which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil180 some economists such as nobel prize winners milton friedman and robert mundell argue that reagans tax policies invigorated americas economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s181 other economists such as nobel prize winner robert solow argue that reagans deficits were a major reason his successor george h w bush reneged on a campaign promise and resorted to raising taxes181 during reagans presidency a program was initiated within the united states intelligence community to ensure americas economic strength the program project socrates developed and demonstrated the means required for the united states to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage—automated innovation to ensure that the united states acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation reagan during his second term had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the project socrates results on a nationwide basis however reagans term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed and the incoming bush administration labeling project socrates as industrial policy had it terminated182183 escalation of the cold war see also cold war 1979–85 as the first us president invited to speak before the british parliament june 8 1982 reagan predicted marxism would end up on the ash heap of history184 reagan escalated the cold

new policies towards the soviet union reviving the b1 lancer program that had been canceled by the carter administration and producing the mx missile186 in response to soviet deployment of the ss20 reagan oversaw natos deployment of the pershing missile in west germany187 in 1984 journalist nicholas lemann interviewed secretary of defense caspar weinberger and summarized the strategy of the reagan administration to roll back the soviet union their society is economically weak and it lacks the wealth education and technology to enter the information age they have thrown everything into military production and their society is starting to show terrible stress as a result they cant sustain military production the way we can eventually it will break them and then there will be just one superpower in a safe world—if only if we can keep spending188 lemann notes that when he wrote that in 1984 he thought the reaganites were living in a fantasy world but by 2016 lemann stated that the passage represents a fairly uncontroversial description of what reagan actually did meeting with leaders of the afghan mujahideen in the oval office 1983 together with the united kingdoms prime minister margaret thatcher reagan denounced the soviet union in ideological terms189 in a famous address on june 8 1982 to the parliament of the united kingdom in the royal gallery of the palace of

to the incident by suspending all soviet passenger air service to the united states and dropped several agreements being negotiated with the soviets wounding them financially194 as a result of the shootdown and the cause of kal 007s going astray thought to be inadequacies related to its navigational system reagan announced on september 16 1983 that the global positioning system would be made

resistance movements in an effort to rollback sovietbacked communist governments in africa asia and latin america197 reagan deployed the cias special activities division to afghanistan and pakistan they were instrumental in training equipping and leading mujahideen forces against the soviet army198199 president reagans covert action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the soviet occupation of afghanistan200 though some of the united states funded armaments introduced then would later pose a threat to us troops in the 2001 war in afghanistan201 however in a break from the carter policy of arming taiwan under the taiwan relations act reagan also agreed with the communist government in china to reduce the sale of arms to taiwan202 in march 1983 reagan introduced the strategic defense initiative a defense project203 that would have used ground and spacebased systems to protect the united states from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles204 reagan believed that this defense shield could make nuclear war impossible203205 there was much disbelief surrounding the programs scientific feasibility leading opponents to dub sdi star wars and argue that its technological objective was unattainable203 the soviets became concerned about the possible effects sdi would have206 leader yuri andropov said it would put the entire world in jeopardy207 for those reasons david gergen former aide to president reagan believes that in retrospect sdi hastened the end of the cold war208 critics labeled reagans foreign policies as aggressive imperialistic and chided them as warmongering though they were supported by leading american conservatives who argued that they were necessary to protect us security interests206 the reagan administration also backed anticommunist leaders accused of severe human rights violations such as efraín ríos montt of guatemala and hissène habré of chad209210211 and helped iranian leader ruhollah khomeini identify and purge

unfold in the united states in 1981 the same year reagan took office aids research was chronically underfunded during reagans administration and requests for more funding by doctors at the centers for disease control cdc were routinely denied by the end of the first 12 months of the epidemic when more than 1000 people had died of aids in the us the cdc had spent less than 1 million on aids research in contrast funding had been made amply available to the cdc in their efforts to stop legionnaires disease after an outbreak in 1976 the cdc had spent 9 million in fighting legionnaires disease though

contentious beginning with the gulf of sidra incident in 1981 by 1982 libyan leader muammar gaddafi was considered by the cia to be along with ussr leader leonid brezhnev and cuban leader fidel castro part of a group known as the unholy trinity and was also labeled as our international public enemy number one by a cia official242 these tensions were later revived in early april 1986 when a bomb exploded in a berlin discothèque resulting in the injury of 63 american military personnel and death of one serviceman stating that there was irrefutable proof that libya had directed the terrorist bombing reagan authorized the use of force against the country in the late evening of april 15 1986 the united states launched a series of airstrikes on ground targets in libya243244 britains prime minister margaret thatcher allowed the us air force to use britains air bases to launch the attack on the justification that the uk was supporting americas right to selfdefense under article 51 of the

immigration status and granted amnesty to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the united states before january 1 1982 and had lived in the country continuously critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration246 upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished statue of liberty reagan said the legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and ultimately if they choose they may become americans247 reagan also said the employer sanctions program is the keystone and

law and breached treaties in nicaragua in various ways252253 president reagan professed that he was unaware of the plots existence he opened his own investigation and appointed two republicans and one democrat john tower brent scowcroft and edmund muskie known as the tower commission to investigate the scandal the commission could not find direct evidence that reagan had prior knowledge of the program but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff making the diversion of funds possible254 a separate report by congress concluded that if the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing he should have254 reagans popularity declined from 67 to 46 in less than a week the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president255 the scandal

weapons to essentially frighten the soviets but the gap had been narrowed258 although the soviet union did not accelerate military spending after president reagans military buildup259 their large military expenses in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing were a heavy burden for the soviet economy260 at the same time saudi arabia increased oil production261 which resulted in a drop of oil prices in 1985 to onethird of the previous level oil was the main source of soviet export revenues260 these factors contributed to a stagnant soviet economy during gorbachevs tenure260 reagan recognized the change in the direction of the soviet leadership with mikhail gorbachev and shifted to diplomacy with a view to encourage the soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements262 reagans personal mission was to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons which he regarded as totally irrational totally inhumane good for nothing but killing

the levels of conventional forces nuclear weapons and policy in eastern europe268 he and reagan signed the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty inf treaty at the white house which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons269 the two leaders laid the framework for the strategic arms reduction treaty or start i reagan insisted that the name of the treaty be changed from strategic arms

pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with reagans views on social and civil rights policy during his tenure from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988 pendleton

informed the nation through a handwritten letter308 writing in part i have recently been told that i am one of the millions of americans who will be afflicted with alzheimers disease  at the moment i feel just fine i intend to live the remainder of the years god gives me on this earth doing the things i have always done  i now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life i know that for america there will always be a bright dawn ahead thank you my friends may god always bless you310 after his diagnosis letters of support from wellwishers poured into his california home311 the reagans with a model of uss ronald reagan may 1996 at left is newport news shipbuilding chairman and ceo bill fricks but there was also speculation over how long reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration312 not long after the attempted assassination of ronald reagan at a reception for mayors reagan greeted his secretary of housing and urban development samuel pierce in 1981 by saying how are you mr mayor how are things in your city313314 former cbs white house correspondent lesley stahl recounted that in her final meeting with the president in 1986 reagan did not seem to know who stahl was and that she came close to reporting that reagan was senile but at the end of the meeting reagan had regained his alertness315 however dr lawrence k altman a physician employed as a reporter for the new york times noted that the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of alzheimers can be fuzzy316 and all four of reagans white house doctors said that they saw no evidence of alzheimers while he was president316 dr john e hutton reagans primary physician from 1984 to 1989 said the president absolutely did not show any signs of dementia or alzheimers316 his former chief of staff james baker considered ludicrous the idea that reagan slept during cabinet meetings317 other staff members former aides and friends said they saw no indication of alzheimers while he was president316 reagan did experience occasional memory lapses though especially with names316 reagans doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992318 or 1993316 several years after he had left office for example reagan repeated a toast to margaret thatcher with identical words and gestures at his 82ndbirthday party on february 6 1993319 complicating the picture reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in july 1989 five years before his diagnosis after being thrown from a horse in mexico a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year308309 nancy reagan citing what doctors told her asserted that her husbands 1989 fall hastened the onset of alzheimers disease309 although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate alzheimers or dementia320321 reagans onetime physician daniel ruge has said it is possible but not certain that the horse accident affected the course of reagans memory318 progression 1994–2004 as the years went on the disease slowly destroyed reagans mental capacity316 he was only able to recognize a few people including his wife nancy316 he remained active however he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches played golf regularly and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby century city316 reagan suffered a fall at his bel air home on january 13 2001 resulting in a broken hip322 the fracture was repaired the following day323 and the 89yearold reagan returned home later that week although he faced difficult physical therapy at

later reaching 90325 reagans public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease and as a result his family decided that he would live in quiet semiisolation with his wife nancy nancy reagan told cnns larry king in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that ronnie would want people to remember him as he was326 after her husbands diagnosis and death nancy reagan became a stemcell research advocate urging congress and president george w bush to support federal funding for embryonic stemcell research something bush opposed in

reagan standing in the capitol rotunda a part of the national statuary hall collection since reagan left office in 1989 substantial debate has occurred among scholars historians and the general public surrounding his legacy340 supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of reagans economic policies341 foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the cold war342 and a restoration of american pride and morale118 proponents also argue reagan restored faith in the american dream with his unabated and passionate love for the united states343 after a decline in american confidence and selfrespect under jimmy carters perceived weak leadership particularly during the iran hostage crisis as well as his gloomy dreary outlook for the future of the united states during the 1980 election344 critics contend that reagans economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits154 a wider gap in wealth and an increase in homelessness163 and that the iran–contra affair lowered american credibility345 opinions of reagans legacy among the countrys leading policy makers and journalists differ as well edwin feulner president of the heritage foundation said that reagan helped create a safer freer world and said of his economic policies he took an america suffering from malaise and made its citizens believe again in their destiny346 however mark weisbrot codirector of the center for economic and policy research contended that reagans economic policies were mostly a failure347 while howard kurtz of the washington post opined that reagan was a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest348 despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy many conservative and liberal scholars agree that reagan has been the most influential president since franklin d roosevelt leaving his imprint on american politics diplomacy culture and economics through his effective communication dedicated patriotism and pragmatic compromising349 since he left office historians have reached a consensus350 as summarized by british historian m j heale who finds that scholars now concur that reagan rehabilitated conservatism turned the nation to the right practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics revived faith in the presidency and in american exceptionalism and contributed to victory in the cold war351 cold war president reagan and general secretary gorbachev meet 1985 the cold war was a major political economic and military endeavor for over four decades but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically by the end of reagans presidency352 the significance of reagans role in ending the cold war has spurred contentious and opinionated debate353354355 that reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the soviet union is agreed but the extent of this role is continuously debated262 with many believing that reagans defense policies economic policies military policies and hard line rhetoric against the soviet union and communism as well as summits with general secretary gorbachev played a significant part in ending the cold war162262 president reagan and mikhail gorbachev at the geneva summit in 1985 he was first among post–world war ii presidents to put into practice the concept that the soviet union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with a postdétente strategy262 a conviction that was vindicated by gennadi gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman under gorbachev who said that the strategic defense initiative was very successful blackmail the soviet economy couldnt endure such competition356 reagans aggressive rhetoric toward the ussr had mixed effects jeffery w knopf observes that being labeled evil probably made no difference to the soviets but gave encouragement to the easteuropean citizens opposed to communism262 general secretary gorbachev said of his former rivals cold war role he was a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the cold war357 and deemed him a great president357 gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war but rather a peaceful end he said he was not intimidated by reagans harsh rhetoric358 margaret thatcher former prime minister of the united kingdom said of reagan he warned that the soviet union had an insatiable drive for military power but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform359 she later said ronald reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the cold war for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired360 said brian mulroney former prime minister of canada he enters history as a strong and dramatic player in the cold war361 former president lech wałęsa of poland acknowledged reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communisms collapse362 that reagan had little or no effect in ending the cold war is argued with equal weight that communisms internal weakness had become apparent and the soviet union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power262 president harry s trumans policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the ussr and the soviet invasion of afghanistan undermined the soviet system itself354

united states363 more men voted republican under reagan and reagan tapped into religious voters363 the socalled reagan democrats were a result of his presidency363 after leaving office reagan became an iconic influence within the republican party364 his policies and beliefs have been frequently invoked by republican presidential candidates since 198821 the 2008 republican presidential candidates were no exception for they aimed to liken themselves to him during the primary debates even imitating his campaign strategies365 republican nominee john mccain frequently said that he came to office as a foot soldier in the reagan revolution366 reagans most famous statement regarding the role of smaller government was that government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem367 reagan has become an iconic figure in the republican party with praise for his accomplishments part of the standard gop rhetoric a quarter century after his retirement washington post reporter carlos lozada notes how in the 2016 presidential race the main republican contenders adopted standard gop gipper worship including even donald trump who previously had been skeptical368 the period of american history most dominated by reagan and his policies concerning taxes welfare defense the federal judiciary and the cold war is known today as the reagan era and emphasizes that the conservative reagan revolution led by reagan had a permanent impact on the united states in domestic and foreign policy the bill clinton administration is often treated as an extension of the reagan era as is the george w bush administration369 historian eric foner noted that the obama candidacy in 2008 aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those yearning for a change after nearly thirty years of reaganism370 cultural and political image according to columnist chuck raasch reagan transformed the american presidency in ways that only a few have been able to371 he redefined the political agenda of the times advocating lower taxes a conservative economic philosophy and a stronger military372 his role in the cold war further enhanced his image as a different kind of leader373374 reagans

tarnished by the controversies that arose during his administration391 according to colorado congresswoman patricia schroeder who coined the phrase and reporter howard kurtz the epithet referred to

an alliance that shifted many of them to the republican party393 reagan did not fare well with minority groups especially africanamericans222 this was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies394 however his support of israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many jews395 he emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency although he was the first president to have been divorced396 the combination of reagans speaking style unabashed patriotism negotiation skills as well as his savvy use of the media played an important role in
