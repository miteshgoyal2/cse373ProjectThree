investigationedit at some point in the early morning hours of may 21 2001 a device which consisted of a digital alarm clock wired to a 9volt battery and a modelrocket igniter was placed in a filing cabinet in the offices of professor toby bradshaw tubs of gasoline were then placed near the cabinet and the timer on the firebomb was set around 300 am a university security officer reported seeing billowing smoke and flames rising from the horticultural centers roof and the fire department was summoned it took firefighters two hours to put out the conflagration after which it was found that the office in which the blaze started was burnt down to the studs and significant damage had been done to the central hall of the building as well as several botany labs3 the earth liberation front claimed responsibility for the fire ten days after it transpired3 activists lacey phillabaum jennifer kolar bill rodgers briana waters and justin solondz eventually admitted their guilt in setting the fire prosecutors alleged they were part of elf cell known as the family14 the motivation for the arson was rooted in suspicions by the elf that professor bradshaw a plant geneticist was engaging in experiments funded by the industry to produce geneticallyengineered trees4 in their statement the elf claimed that bradshaw continues to unleash mutant genes into the environment that is certain to cause irreversible harm to forest ecosystems as long as universities continue to pursue this reckless science they run the risk of suffering severe losses our message remains clear we are determined to stop genetic engineering5 bradshaw states that while he had considered doing genetic research at the time he was doing experiments on transgenic tissue samples from poplar trees a fastgrowth species which he hopes could conceivably be used to reduce the need to log natural forests if raised privately on plantations to produce pulp23 bradshaw was quoted in the university of washington alumni magazine as saying i have never genetically engineered a tree much less released one into the environment and further explained that of the eighty samples of poplar he had been working with since 1995 none had ever left the laboratory2 the office of professor bradshaw contained little in the way of actual research material relating to the poplar trees and the bulk of what was destroyed in the office fire turned out to be bradshaws personal possessions and books4 the fire did however destroy research materials relating to plant regeneration on mount st helens after the volcanic eruption materials relating to the restoration of wetlands and prairies and a cache of stickweed plants which were intended to be transplanted to the cascade mountains to replenish dwindling wild stocks34 with little of his research damaged bradshaw affirmed that he would continue his research in the face of the attack he wrote in a letter to the los angeles times that elf firebombings are hate crimes against those of us whose missions in life are to increase human knowledge and bring a sense of wonder to the classes we teach2 a new horticultural center was later rebuilt in 2004 costing approximately 72 million4 operation backfireedit main article operation backfire fbi the investigation into the incident was eventually merged into an fbiled affair known as operation backfire which also covered six other investigations into radical environmentalist activity3 perpetrators and alleged perpetratorsedit lacey phillabaum and jennifer kolaredit lacey phillabaum a former editor of

prosecutors in exchange for reduced sentences346 phillabaum admitted to being on scene during in the arson whereas kolar confessed only to using a knife to cut through the window to bradshaws office1

was alleged to have helped set the fire bombs inside the horticulture center he was taken into custody on december 7 2005 and was subsequently charged with one count of arson relating to a 1998 fire1 he later committed suicide in his jail cell in flagstaff arizona3 by asphyxiating himself with a plastic bag7 briana watersedit briana waters a violin teacher and the director of the environmental documentary watch was convicted of involvement in the crime in 2008 and admitted her involvement in a 2011 plea deal8 the original conviction was vacated by the ninth us circuit court of appeals on september 15 2010 the appeals court found that prosecutors in the original trial were improperly allowed to introduce a folder of anarchist literature that waters was said to have given to another participant in the bombing judge a wallace tashima stated that the articles repugnant and selfabsorbed embrace of destruction is likely to have swayed jurors emotions9 in june 2011 while awaiting a retrial waters entered a plea agreement with federal prosecutors she admitted to charges of conspiracy and arson in the firebombing incident and to involvement in a separate 2001 arson at the litchfield wild burro and horse corrals in susanville california she also agreed to provide testimony against other alleged conspirators if called upon by the government in exchange prosecutors said they would recommend that she not serve any more time in prison given she provides full and complete cooperation with ongoing investigations any additional time in prison will ultimately be determined by a federal judge10 at her original trial she was charged with two counts of arson one count of conspiracy and two charges relating to the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence she pleaded innocent to all the chargers111 waters was found guilty of the two arson counts by a tacoma jury on march 6 2008 and was sentenced at that time to six years in a federal prison and to pay 6 million in restitution by us district court judge franklin d burgess1 in her 2011 plea deal waters admitted to arson conspiracy to use a destructive device possessing an unregistered destructive device and the use of an explosive device in a crime of violence she also admitted to perjury when she declared her innocence while under oath at her 2008 trial waters agreed to testify against justin solondz who is expected to be returned home for trial by china in the late summer the state of california agreed not to press charges in the litchfield arson contingent on her full cooperation with federal prosecutors12 during waters trial her defense attorneys robert bloom and neil fox contested the testimony of kolar and phillabaum and sought to have us assistant attorney andrew friedman removed for the case for misconduct in creating a misleading summary they failed in that attempt111 justin solondzedit justin franchi solondz who previously dated briana waters while attending evergreen state college at the time of the arson evaded charges for several years he was indicted for arson and conspiracy in absentia in 2006 and was eventually arrested in dali china on charges of
