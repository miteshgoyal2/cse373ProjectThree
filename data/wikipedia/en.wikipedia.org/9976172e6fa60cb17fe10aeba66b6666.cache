aim software from wikipedia the free encyclopedia   redirected from aol instant messenger jump to navigation search aim aims new logo introduced in december 2011 replacing the earlier running man mascot developers aol initial release may 1997 20 years ago 199705 written in c adobe flash operating system windows windows mobile macos android ios blackberry os type instant messaging license proprietary website wwwaimcom aim aol instant messenger is an instant messaging and presence computer program created by aol which uses the proprietary oscar instant messaging protocol and the toc protocol to allow registered users to communicate in real time aim was popular from the late 1990s to mid2000s in north america and was the leading instant messaging application in that region aims popularity declined steeply in the late 2000s and its fall has often been compared with other oncepopular internet services such as myspace1 on october 5 2017 aims owner oath inc announced that it would discontinue aim as a service on december 15 20172 contents 1 history 11 usage decline and product sunset 2 the running man 3 protocol 4 privacy 5 chat robots 6 uri scheme 7 vulnerabilities 8

phoneline 92 aim call out 10 security 11 references 12 external links historyedit aol instant messenger was initially integrated into aol desktop and later also released as a standalone download by america online aol in may 1997 for microsoft windows3 the software maintained by aol inc at one time had the largest share of the instant messaging market in north america especially in the united states with 52 of the total reported as of 2006update4 this does not include other instant messaging software related to or developed by aol such as icq and ichat its main competitors during its heyday were icq yahoo messenger and msn messenger aol particularly had a rivalry or chat war with rival microsoft starting in 1999 there were several attempts from microsoft to simultaneously log into their own and aims protocol servers aol were not happy about this and started blocking msn messenger from being able to access aim56 aim went officially mobile in early 2008 when the application was released for windows mobile devices and allowed for all devices to send ims via sms7 however aim could already be used on various devices beforehand with thirdparty applications and as early as 2002 on a sidekick8 since 2012 standalone official aim client software includes advertisements and is available for microsoft windows windows mobile classic mac os macos android ios blackberry os9 usage decline and product sunsetedit around 2011 aim started to lose popularity rapidly partly due to the quick rise of gmail and its builtin realname google chat instant messenger integration in 2011 and because many people started purely moving onto sms text messaging and later social networking websites in particular facebook messenger which was released as a standalone app the same year for instant messaging as of june 2011update one source reported aol instant messenger market share had collapsed to 07310 however this number only reflects installed im applications and not active users the engineers responsible for aim claimed that they were unable to convince aol management that free was the future11 on march 3 2012 aol ended employment of aims development staff while leaving it active and with help support still provided12 on october 5 2017 it was announced that the aim service will be discontinued on december 1513214 the running manedit the running man the aim mascot was designed by joroan lazaro and was implemented in the first release in 1997 this was a yellow stickmanlike figure often called the running man the mascot appeared on all aim logos and most wordmarks and always appeared at the top of the buddy list aims incredible popularity in the late 1990s and the 2000s led to the running man becoming a familiar brand on the internet after over 14 years the iconic logo was finally disappeared as part of the aim rebranding in 2011 however in august 2013 the running man once again returned15 in 2014 a complex editor called it a symbol of america16 in april 2015 the running man was officially featured in the virgin london marathon dressed by a person for the aolpartnered free the children charity17 protocoledit the standard protocol that aim clients use to communicate is called open system for communication in realtime oscar most aolproduced versions of aim and popular third party aim clients use this protocol however aol also created a simpler protocol called toc that lacks many of oscars features but is sometimes used for clients that only require basic chat functionality the toctoc2 protocol specifications were made available by aol while oscar is a closed protocol that third parties have had to reverseengineer in january 2008 aol introduced experimental extensible messaging and presence protocol xmpp support for aim18 allowing aim users to communicate using the standardized opensource xmpp however in march 2008 this service was discontinuedcitation needed in may 2011 aol started offering limited xmpp support19 on march 1 2017 aol announced via xmpplogintime messages20 that the aol xmpp gateway would be desupported effective march 28 2017 privacyedit for privacy regulations aim has strict age restrictions aim accounts are available only for people over the age of 13 children younger than that are not permitted access to aim21 under the aim privacy policy aol has no rights to read or monitor any private communications between users the profile of the user has no privacy21 if public content is accessed it can be used for online print or even broadcast advertising etc this is outlined in the policy and terms of service you grant aol its parent affiliates subsidiaries assigns agents and licensees the irrevocable perpetual worldwide right to reproduce display perform distribute adapt and promote this content in any medium this allows anything one posts to be used without a separate request for permission21 the issue of aims security has been called into question aol states that it has taken great steps to insure that personal information will not be accessed by unauthorized members but that it cannot guarantee that that will not happen21 aim is different from other clients such as yahoo messenger in that it does not require approval from one buddy to be added to anothers buddy list as a result it is possible for users to keep other unsuspecting users on their buddy list to see when they are online read their status and away messages and read their profiles in fact there is a web api to display ones status and away message as a widget on ones web page22 however one can block another user from communicating and seeing ones status but this does not prevent the user from creating a new account that is not blocked and therefore can still track the first users status a more complete privacy option is to select a menu option allowing communication only with those on ones buddy list this causes blocking thus appearing offline to all users who are not on ones buddy list chat robotsedit aol and various other companies supply robots on aim that can receive messages and send a response based on the bots purpose for example bots can help with studying like studybuddy some are made to relate to children and teenagers like spleak others give advice and others are for more general purposes such as smarterchild the more useful chat bots have features like the ability to play games get sport scores weather forecasts or financial stock information users were able to talk to automated chat bots that could respond to natural human language they were primarily put into place as a marketing strategy and for unique advertising options it was used by advertisers to market products or build better consumer relations23 before the inclusions of such bots the other bots doormanbot and aimoffline provided features that are provided today by aol for those who needed it zolaonaol and zoeonaol were short lived bots that ultimately retired their features in favor of smarterchild as of november 18 2008 the smarterchild bot for aim was retired and is no longer offering any servicescitation needed uri schemeedit aol instant messengers installation process automatically installs an extra uri scheme protocol handler into some web browsers so uris beginning aim can open a new aim window with specified parameters this is similar in function to the mailto uri scheme which creates a new email message using the systems default mail program for instance a web page might include a link like the following in its html source to open a window for sending a message to the aim user notarealuser a hrefaimgoimscreennamenotarealusersend messagea to specify a message body the message parameter is used so the link location might look like this aimgoimscreennamenotarealusermessagethisismymessage to specify an away message the message parameter is used so the link location might look like this aimgoawaymessagehellomynameisbill when placing this inside a url link an aim user could click on the url link and the away message hello my name is bill would instantly become their away message to add a buddy the addbuddy message is used with the screenname parameter aimaddbuddyscreennamenotarealuser this type of link is commonly found on forum profiles to easily add contacts vulnerabilitiesedit aim has security weaknesses that have enabled exploits to be created that use thirdparty software to perform malicious acts on users computers24 although most are relatively harmless such as being kicked off the aim service others perform potentially dangerous actions such as sending viruses some of these exploits rely on social engineering to spread by automatically sending instant messages that contain a url accompanied by text suggesting the receiving user click on it an action which leads to infection ie a trojan these messages can easily be mistaken as coming from a friend and contain a link to a web address that installs software on the users computer to restart the cycle users have also reported sudden additions of toolbars and advertisements from third parties in the newer version of aim multiple complaints about the lack of control of third party involvement have caused many users to stop using the service24 extra featuresedit iphone applicationedit on march 6 2008 during apple incs iphone sdk event aol announced that they would be releasing an aim application for iphone and ipod touch users the application is available for free from the app store but the company also provides a paid version which displays no advertisements both are available from the app store the aim client for iphone and ipod touch supports standard aim accounts as well as mobileme accounts there is also an express version of aim accessible through the safari browser on the iphone and ipod touch25 in 2011 aol launched a massive overhaul of their instant messaging service included in the update was a brand new ios application for iphone and ipod touch which incorporated all the latest features a brand new icon was used for the application featuring the new cursive logo for aim the userinterface was entirely redone for the features including a new buddy list group messaging inline photos and videos as well as improved filesharing26 currently the application is in version 505 which was updated as of march 2012 in the latest iteration it supports more social stream features much like facebook and twitter as well as the ability to send voice messages up to 60 seconds long27 ipad applicationedit on april

specialized userinterface for the device it supports geo location facebook status updates and chat myspace twitter youtube foursquare and many social networking platforms28 aim expressedit aim express ran in a popup browser window it was intended for use by people who are unwilling or unable to install a standalone application or those at computers that lack the aim application aim express supported many of the standard features included in the standalone client but did not provide advanced features like file transfer audio chat video conferencing or buddy info it was implemented in adobe flash29 it was an upgrade to the prior aol quick buddy which was later available for older systems that cannot handle express before being discontinued express and quick buddy were similar to msn web messenger and yahoo web messenger this web version has evolved into aimcoms webbased messenger aim pagesedit main article aim pages aim pages was released in may 2006 allowing the 63 million aim users to create an online dynamic profile the buddy list serves as the basis for the aim page social networking service an aim page is built using modules following the modulet microformat aim

incoming calls33 the service allowed users to make calls to landlines and mobile devices through the use of a computer the service however was only free for receiving and aol charged users 1495 a month for unlimited calling plan34 in order to use aim phoneline users had to install the latest free version of aim triton software and needed a good set of headphones with a boom microphone it could take several days after a user signed up before it started working34 the service provided users with many interfaces such as auto action apis ringback tone apis and screen name services api that made the aim phoneline a great service35 on january 13 2009 the service was officially closed the closing of the free service caused the number associated with the service to be disabled and not
