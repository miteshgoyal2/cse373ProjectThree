september 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message in addition to the online newspaper the times of israel hosts an open blog platform for any writer who applies and is approved to become a blogger on the site20 the website generally does not edit blog posts submitted by approved writers and accordingly it takes no responsibility for such blogs which are not necessarily in line with the websites editorial stance21 on 1 august 2014 a blogger posted a piece entitled when genocide is permissible22 in which he argued that the war between israel and gaza was being misunderstood and misrepresented by the global media23 he put the nub of his argument as it related to the headline this way hamas has stated forthrightly that it idealizes death as much as israel celebrates life what other way is there to deal with an enemy of this nature other than obliterate them completely within minutes the times reacted by removing the post and discontinuing the writers blog saying the post had breached the websites editorial guidelines and that they will not countenance blog posts that incite to violence or criminal acts the writer soon issued a public apology24 on 8 march 2015 an article was posted on the times of israel titled america desperately needs a hate speech law arguing at great length that the united states needed to outlaw hate speech in accordance with international human rights law the article was posted by an unknown individual using the bogus name dinah silverstein and a picture of columnist nancy goldstein the article was deleted and the blogger banned but the incident led to the times of israel being criticized for not verifying the identities of its bloggers2526 on 9 april 2015 an article titled understanding the idea of israeli land under talmudic law was posted on the times of israels blog platform the article described in great detail how israel should exterminate the palestinians who were described as cockroaches and vermin27 the article was submitted by a person who had impersonated australian lawyer josh bornstein28 the article sparked outrage across social media and since it was posted under bornsteins name it led to his receiving a large amount of abuse and death threats with at least one of them coming from an individual appearing to be associated with the islamic state of iraq and the levant isis militant group2930 the times of israel later scrubbed the article and issued an apology3132 bornstein would later write an article in the guardian describing the affair33 it later emerged that the hoax article was
