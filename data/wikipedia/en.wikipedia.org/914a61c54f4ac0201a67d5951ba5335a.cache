updatesedit as with all alexa devices the functionality of echo smart speakers periodically evolves as amazon releases new software for it most new releases will fix bugs in addition to including enhanced functionality new releases are pushed to the devices on a gradual basis so it may take several days to a week or more for a particular device to be updated because much of echos intelligence lies in the cloud significant functional enhancements can be made to echo without updating the software version it is running for example in april 2015 the echo added the ability to give live sports

incorporates 7 secondgeneration far field microphones and noise cancellation while also supporting dolby sound accessoriesedit along with the secondgeneration echo amazon announced two new accessories the echo buttons can be used while playing games on echo devices such as jeopardy47 the echo connect is a small adapter that plugs into any echo and a home phone line allowing the echo to make voice calls through your home phone number48 privacy concernsedit there are concerns about the access echo has to private conversations in the home or other nonverbal indications that can identify who is present in the home and who is not—based on audible cues such as footstepcadence or radiotelevision programming4950 amazon responds to these concerns by stating that echo only streams recordings from the users home when the wake word activates the device though the device is technically capable of streaming voice recordings at all times and in fact will always be listening to detect if a user has uttered the word echo uses past voice recordings the user has sent to the cloud service to improve response to future questions the user may pose to address privacy concerns the user can delete voice recordings that are currently associated with the users account but doing so may degrade the users experience using voice search to delete these recordings the user can visit the manage my device page on amazoncom or contact amazon customer service echo uses an address set in the alexa companion app when it needs a location51 amazon and thirdparty apps and websites use location information to provide locationbased services and store this information to provide voice services the maps app find your device and to monitor the performance and accuracy of location services for example echo voice services use the users location to respond to the users requests for nearby restaurants or stores similarly echo uses the users location to process the users mappingrelated requests and improve the maps experience all information collected is subject to the amazoncom privacy notice52 amazon retains digital recordings of users audio spoken after the wake up word and while the audio recordings are subject to demands by law enforcement government agents and other entities via subpoena amazon publishes some information about the warrants it receives the subpoenas it receives and some of the warrantless demands it receives allowing customers some indication as to the percentage of illegal demands for customer information it receives53 echo as criminal evidenceedit police have been investigating the death of victor collins which occurred on november 22 2015 in the home of james andrew bates in bentonville arkansas citing privacy concerns amazon refused to supply echo data to authorities5455 this standoff was resolved when bates consented to the release of his personal information that was held by amazon5657 limitationsedit purchasing merchandise in the categories of apparel shoes jewelry and watches is not available58 in addition amazon fresh amazon prime pantry prime now or addon items are not supported by alexas ordering function59 while the shopping list function allows no more than one item to be added at a time60 echo has provided inconsistent responses when asked common questions to which users would expect better answers echo sometimes confuses certain homophones words that sound the same but have different meanings such as wherewearware61 the current location of the device is set to seattle amazon headquarters by default and must be changed manually but can only be set to a location within the united states united kingdom or germany this varies from smartphonebased voice assistants that are able to identify the current location via builtin gps receivers this lack of automatic location determination can result in seemingly wrong results for questions that assume the location such as what is the weather around here or set an alarm for 1000am which assumes that the echo device is set to local time there have been several attempts to circumvent the united states only restriction particularly by users in europe australia and new zealand one of these involves setting the echo to a timezone that is exactly 12 hours different from the local time for example if the current time in london is 1130 am the user can set echo to hawaii standard time which would be 1130 pm this would enable echo to report the correct time this attempt to bypass amazons restrictions results in two undesirable side effects incorrect ampm notation and incorrect date a more sophisticated means of relocating an echo device outside of its intended geographic limitations involves manipulating the data that is transmitted and received by amazons servers this is described by user stonewater on the unofficial amazon echo forum62 this method produces accurate results but requires technological expertise using request maker for chrome interaction and
