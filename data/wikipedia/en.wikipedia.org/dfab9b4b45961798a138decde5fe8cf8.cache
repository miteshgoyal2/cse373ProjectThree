exchange paul reuter worked at a bookpublishing firm in berlin and was involved in distributing radical pamphlets at the beginning of the revolutions in 1848 these publications brought much attention to reuter who in 1850 developed a prototype news service in aachen using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy from 1851 on in order to transmit messages between brussels and aachen2 upon moving to england he founded reuters telegram company in 1851 headquartered in london the company initially covered commercial news serving banks brokerage houses and business firms2 the first newspaper client to subscribe was the london morning advertiser in 185823 afterwards more newspapers signed up with britannica encyclopedia writing that the value of reuters to newspapers lay not only in the financial news it provided but in its ability to be the first to report on stories of international importance2 reuters agency built a reputation in europe and the rest of the world as the first to report news scoops from abroad4 reuters was the first to report abraham lincolns assassination in europe for instance in 186524 in 1872 reuters expanded into the far east followed by south america in 1874 both expansions were made possible by advances in overland telegraphs and undersea cables4 in 1883 reuters began transmitting messages electrically to london newspapers4 1900sedit in 1923 reuters began using radio to transmit news internationally a pioneering act4 in 1925 the press association pa of great britain acquired a majority interest in reuters and became full owner some years later2 during the world wars the guardian reported that reuters came under pressure from the british government to serve national interests in 1941 reuters deflected the pressure by restructuring itself as a private company the new owners formed the reuters trust4 in 1941 the pa sold half of reuters to the newspaper proprieters association and coownership was expanded in 1947 to associations that represented daily newspapers in new zealand and australia2 the reuters trust principles were put in place to maintain the companys independence1 at that point reuters had become one of the worlds major news agencies supplying both text and images to newspapers other news agencies and radio and television broadcasters2 also at that point it directly or through national news agencies provided service to most countries reaching virtually all the worlds leading newspapers and many thousands of smaller ones according to brittanica2 in 1961 reuters scooped news of the erection of the berlin wall5 becoming one of the first news agencies to transmit financial data over oceans via computers in the 1960s2 in 1973 reuters began making computerterminal displays of foreignexchange rates available to clients2 in 1981 reuters began making electronic transactions on its computer network and afterwards developed a number of electronic brokerage and trading services2 reuters was floated as a public company in 19845 when reuters trust was listed on the stock exchanges4 such as the london stock exchange lse and nasdaq2 reuters published the first story of the berlin wall being breached in 19895 2000sedit share price grew during the dotcom boom then fell after the banking troubles in 20014 in 2002 brittanica wrote that most news throughout the world came from three major agencies the associated press reuters and agence francepresse6 reuters merged with thomson corporation in canada in 2008 forming thomson reuters2 in 2009 thomson reuters withdrew from the lse and the nasdaq instead listing its shares on the toronto stock exchange and the new york stock exchange2 the last surviving member of the reuters family founders marguerite baroness de reuter died at age 96 on 25 january 20097 as of 2010 reuters was headquartered in new york city and provided financial information to clients while also maintaining its traditional newsagency business2 in 2012 thomson reuters appointed jim smith as ceo1 almost every major news outlet in the world subscribed to reuters as of 2014 reuters operated in more than 200 cities in 94 countries in about 20 languages as of 2014citation needed in july 2016 thomson reuters agreed to sell its intellectual property and science operation for 355 billion to private equity firms8 in october 2016 thomson reuters announced expansions and relocations to toronto8 as part of cuts and restructuring in november 2016 thomson reuters corp eliminated 2000 worldwide jobs out of its around 50000 employees8 journalistsedit the reuters news agency employs some 2500 journalists and 600 photojournalists in about 200 locations worldwide reuters journalists use the reuters handbook of journalism9 as a guide for fair presentation

objective languageedit reuters building entrance in new york city reuters has a policy of taking a valueneutral approach which extends to not using the word terrorist in its stories a practice which has attracted criticism following the 11 september 2001 attacks16 reuters editorial policy states we are committed to reporting the facts and in all situations avoid the use of emotive terms the only exception is when we are quoting someone directly or in indirect speech17 the associated press by contrast does use the term terrorist in reference to nongovernmental organizations who carry out attacks on civilian populations16 following the 11 september attacks reuters global head of news stephen jukes reiterated the policy in an internal memo and later explained to media columnist howard kurtz who criticized the policy we all know that one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter and that reuters upholds the principle that we do not use the word terroristwere trying to treat everyone on a level playing field however tragic its been and however awful and cataclysmic for the american people and people around the world were there to tell the story were not there to evaluate the moral case16 in early october 2001 ceo tom glocer and editorinchief geert linnebank and jukes later released a statement acknowledging that jukes memo had caused deep offence among members of our staff our readers and the public at large and wrote our policy is to avoid the use of emotional terms and not make value judgments concerning the facts we attempt to report accurately and fairly we apologize for the insensitive manner in which we characterized this policy and extend our sympathy to all those who have been affected by these tragic events18 in september 2004 the new york times reported that reuters global managing editor david a schlesinger objected to canadian newspapers editing of reuters articles to insert the word terrorist schlesinger said my goal is to protect our reporters and protect our editorial integrity19 climate change reportingedit in july 2013 david fogarty former reuters climate change correspondent in asia resigned after a career of almost 20 years with the company and wrote about a climate of fear which resulted in progressively getting any climate changethemed story published got harder following comments from then deputy editorinchief paul ingrassia that he was a climate change sceptic in his comments fogarty stated that some desk editors happily subbed and pushed the button others agonised and asked a million questions debate on some story ideas generated endless bureaucracy by editors frightened to take a decision reflecting a different type of climate within reuters—the climate of fear and that by midoctober i was informed that climate change just wasnt a big story for the present …very soon after that conversation i was told my climate change role was abolished2021 ingrassia currently reuters managing editor formerly worked for the wall street journal and dow jones for 31 years22 reuters responded to fogartys piece by stating that reuters has a number of staff dedicated to covering this story including a team of specialist reporters at point carbon and a columnist there has been no change in our editorial policy23 subsequently climate blogger joe romm cited a reuters article on climate as employing false balance and quoted dr stefan rahmstorf cochair of earth system analysis at the potsdam institute that simply a lot of unrelated climate skeptics nonsense has been added to this reuters piece in the words of the late steve schneider this is like adding some nonsense from the flat earth society to a report about the latest generation of telecommunication satellites it is absurd romm opined that we cant know for certain who insisted on cramming this absurd and nongermane climate sceptics nonsense into the piece but we have a strong clue if it had been part of the reporters original reporting you would have expected direct quotes from actual skeptics because that is journalism 101 the fact that the blather was all inserted without attribution suggests it was added at the insistence of an editor24 photograph controversiesedit according to ynetnews reuters was accused of bias against israel in its coverage of the 2006 israel–lebanon conflict after the wire service used two doctored photos by a lebanese freelance photographer adnan hajj25 in august 2006 reuters announced it had severed all ties with hajj and said his photographs would be removed from its database26 in 2010 reuters was criticised again by haaretz for antiisraeli bias when it cropped the edges of photos removing commandos knives held by activists and a naval commandos blood from photographs taken aboard the mavi marmara during the gaza flotilla raid a raid that left nine turkish activists dead it has been alleged that in two separate photographs knives held by the activists were cropped out of the versions of the pictures published by reuters27 reuters said it is standard operating procedure to crop photos at the margins and replaced the cropped images with the original ones after it was brought to the agencys attention27 accusations of profernando henrique cardoso biasedit in march 2015 the brazilian affiliate of reuters released a text containing an interview with brazilian expresident fernando henrique cardoso about the ongoing petrobrás scandal one of the paragraphs mentioned a comment by a former petrobrás manager in which he suggests corruption in that company may date back to cardosos presidency attached to it there was a comment between parenthesis podemos tirar se achar melhor we can take it out if you think its better28 which is now absent from the current version of the text29 the agency later issued a text in which they confirm the mistake explaining it was a question by one of the brazilian editors to the journalist who wrote the original text in english and that it was not supposed to be published30 see alsoedit journalism portal united kingdom portal media of the united kingdom list of news agencies interbank market competitor press
