massachusetts cities and towns in december 1630 the site of what would become cambridge was chosen because it was safely upriver from boston harbor making it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships thomas dudley his daughter anne bradstreet and her husband simon were among the towns first settlers the first houses were built in the spring of 1631 the settlement was initially referred to as the newe towne1011 official massachusetts records show the name rendered as newe towne by 1632 and as newtowne by 16381112 located at the first convenient charles river crossing west of boston newe towne was one of a number of towns including boston dorchester watertown and weymouth founded by the 700 original puritan colonists of the massachusetts bay colony under governor john winthrop its first preacher was thomas hooker who led many of its original inhabitants west to found the connecticut colony before leaving they sold their plots to more recent immigrants from england10 the original village site is in the heart of todays harvard square the marketplace where farmers brought crops from surrounding towns to sell survives today as the small park at the corner of john f kennedy and winthrop streets then at the edge of a salt marsh since filled the town comprised a much larger area than the present city10 with various outlying parts becoming independent towns over the years cambridge village later newtown and now newton in 168813 cambridge farms now lexington in 171210 or 171314 and little or south cambridge now brightona and menotomy or west cambridge now arlington in 18071015b in the late 19th century various schemes for annexing cambridge to boston were pursued and rejected1617 in 1636 the newe college later renamed harvard college after benefactor john harvard was founded by the colony to train ministers according to cotton mather newe towne was chosen for the site of the college by the great and general court the massachusetts legislature primarily for its proximity to the popular and highly respected puritan preacher thomas shepard in may 16381819 the settlements name was changed to cambridge in honor of the university in cambridge england1020 hooker and shepard newtownes ministers and the colleges first president major benefactor and first schoolmaster were all cambridge alumni as was the colonys governor john winthrop in 1629 winthrop had led the signing of the founding document of the city of boston which was known as the cambridge agreement after the university21 in 1650 governor thomas dudley signed the charter creating the corporation that still governs harvard college2223 george washington in cambridge 1775 cambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village eight miles 13 km by road from boston the colonys capital by the american revolution most residents lived near the common and harvard college with most of the town comprising farms and estates most inhabitants were descendants of the original puritan colonists but there was also a small elite of anglican worthies who were not involved in village life made their livings from estates investments and trade and lived in mansions along the road to watertown todays brattle street still known as tory row coming up from virginia george washington took command of the volunteer american soldiers camped on cambridge common on july 3 177510 now reckoned the birthplace of the us army24 most of the tory estates were confiscated after the revolution on january 24 1776 henry knox arrived with artillery captured from fort ticonderoga which enabled washington to drive the british army out of boston map of cambridge from 1873 between 1790 and 1840 cambridge grew rapidly with the construction of the west boston bridge in 1792 connecting cambridge directly to boston so that it was no longer necessary to travel eight miles 13 km through the boston neck roxbury and brookline to cross the charles river a second bridge the canal bridge opened in 1809 alongside the new middlesex canal the new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and marshland into prime industrial and residential districts in the mid19th century cambridge was the center of a literary revolution it was home to some of the famous fireside poets—so called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires the fireside poets—henry wadsworth longfellow james russell lowell and oliver wendell holmes—were highly popular and influential in their day soon after turnpikes were built the cambridge and concord turnpike todays broadway and concord ave the middlesex turnpike hampshire st and massachusetts ave northwest of porter square and what are todays cambridge main and harvard streets connected various areas of cambridge to the bridges in addition the town was connected to the boston maine railroad25 leading to the development of porter square as well as the creation of neighboring somerville from the formerly rural parts of charlestown 1852 map of boston area showing cambridge and regional rail lines and highlighting the course of the middlesex canal cambridge is toward the bottom of the map and outlined in yellow and should not be confused with the pinkoutlined and partially cropped west cambridge now arlington cambridge was incorporated as a city in 184610 despite persistent tensions between east cambridge cambridgeport and old cambridge stemming from differences in culture sources of income and the national origins of the residents26 the citys commercial center began to shift from harvard square to central square which became the citys downtown around this time between 1850 and 1900 cambridge took on much of its present character—streetcar suburban development along the turnpikes with workingclass and industrial neighborhoods focused on east cambridge comfortable middleclass housing on the old cambridgeport and midcambridge estates and upperclass enclaves near harvard university and on the minor hills the coming of the railroad to north cambridge and northwest cambridge led to three major changes the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between massachusetts ave concord ave and alewife brook the icecutting industry launched by frederic tudor on fresh pond and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to house the thousands of immigrants who arrived to work in the new industries for many decades the citys largest employer was the new england glass company founded in 1818 by the middle of the 19th century it was the worlds largest and most modern glassworks in 1888 edward drummond libbey moved all production to toledo ohio where it continues today under the name owens illinois the companys flint glassware with heavy lead content is prized by antique glass collectors there is none on public display in cambridge but the toledo museum of art has a large collection the museum of fine arts boston and the sandwich glass museum on cape cod also have a few pieces by 1920 cambridge was one of new englands main industrial cities with nearly 120000 residents among the largest businesses in cambridge during the period of industrialization was carters ink company whose neon sign long adorned the charles river and which was for many years the worlds largest ink manufacturer next door was the atheneum press confectionery and snack manufacturers in the cambridgeportarea 4kendall corridor included the kennedy biscuit factory later part of nabisco and originator of the fig newton27 necco squirrel brands28 george close

confectionery company and james o welch 1927–1963 originator of junior mints sugar daddies sugar mamas and sugar babies now part of tootsie roll industries32 only the cambridge brands subsidiary of tootsie roll industries remains in town still manufacturing junior mints in the old welch factory on main street32 the blake and knowles steam pump company 1886 the kendall boiler and tank company 1880 now in chelmsford massachusetts and the new england glass company 1818–1878 were among the industrial manufacturers in what are now kendall square and east cambridge as industry in new england began to decline during the great depression and after world war ii cambridge lost much of its industrial base it also began to become an intellectual rather than an industrial center harvard university had always been important as both a landowner and an institution but it began to play a more dominant role in the citys life and culture when radcliffe college was established in 1879 the town became a mecca for some of the nations most academically talented female students the massachusetts institute of technologys move from boston in 1916 reinforced cambridges status as an intellectual center of the united states after the 1950s the citys population began to decline slowly as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples the 1980s brought a wave of hightechnology startups creating software such as visicalc and lotus 123 and advanced computers but many of these companies fell into decline with the fall of the minicomputer and dosbased systems the city continues to be home to many startups kendall square was a major software hub through the dotcom boom and today hosts offices of such major technology companies as google microsoft amazon and akamai headquarters in 1976 harvards plans to start experiments with recombinant dna led to a threemonth moratorium and a citizen review panel in the end cambridge decided to allow such experiments but passed safety regulations in 1977 this led to regulatory certainty and acceptance when biogen opened a lab in 1982 in contrast to the hostility that caused the genetic institute a harvard spinoff to abandon somerville and boston for cambridge33 the biotech and pharmaceutical industries have since thrived in cambridge which now includes headquarters for biogen and genzyme laboratories for novartis teva takeda alnylam ironwood catabasis moderna therapeutics editas medicine support companies such as cytel and many smaller companies by the end of the 20th century cambridge had one of the most expensive housing markets in the northeastern united states34 while considerable class race and age diversity persisted it became harder for those who grew up in the city to afford to stay the end of rent control in 1994 prompted many cambridge renters to move to more affordable housing in somerville and other communities until recently cambridges mix of amenities and proximity to boston kept housing prices relatively stable despite the bursting of the united states housing bubble35 cambridge has been a sanctuary city since 1985 and reaffirmed its status as such in 20063637
