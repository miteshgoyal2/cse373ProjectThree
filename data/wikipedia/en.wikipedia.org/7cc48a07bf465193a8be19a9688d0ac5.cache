using search results from inktomi it consisted of a search engine index and web crawler in early 1999 msn search launched a version which displayed listings from looksmart blended with results from inktomi except for a short time in 1999 when results from altavista were used instead since then microsoft upgraded msn search to provide its own selfbuilt search engine results the index of which was updated weekly and sometimes daily the upgrade started as a beta program in november 2004 and came out of beta in february 2005 image search was powered by a third party picsearch the service also

name15 as an effort to create a new identity for microsofts search services live search was officially replaced by bing on june 3 200916 the bing name was chosen through focus groups and microsoft decided that the name was memorable short easy to spell and that it would function well as a url around the world the word would remind people of the sound made during the moment of discovery and decision making17 microsoft was assisted by branding consultancy interbrand in their search for the best name for the new search engine18 the name also has strong similarity to the word bingo which is used to mean that something sought has been found or realized as is interjected when winning the game bingo microsoft advertising strategist david webster originally proposed the name bang for the same reasons the name bing was ultimately chosen easy to spell one syllable and easy to remember he noted its there its an exclamation point its the opposite of a question mark this name was ultimately not chosen because it could not be properly used as a verb in the context of an internet search webster commented oh i banged it is very different than i binged it19 according to the

search results9293 performance issues bing has been criticized for being slower to index websites than google it has also been criticized for not indexing some websites at all9495 copying googles results bing has been criticized by competitor google for utilizing user input via internet explorer the bing toolbar or suggested sites to add results to bing after discovering in october 2010 that bing appeared to be imitating googles autocorrect results for a misspelling despite not actually fixing the spelling of the term google set up a honeypot configuring the google search engine to return specific unrelated results for 100 nonsensical queries such as hiybbprqag96 over the next couple of weeks google engineers entered the search term into google while using microsoft internet explorer with the bing toolbar installed and the optional suggested sites enabled in 9 out of the 100 queries bing later started returning the same results as google despite the only apparent connection between the result and search term being that googles results connected the two9798 microsofts response to this issue coming from a company spokesperson was we do not copy googles results bings vice president harry shum later reiterated that the search result data google claimed that bing copied had in fact come from bings very own users shum wrote that we use over 1000 different signals and features in our ranking algorithm a small piece of that is clickstream data we get from some of our customers who opt into sharing anonymous data as they navigate the web in order to help us improve the experience for all users 99 microsoft stated that bing was not intended to be a duplicate of any existing search engines100 see also microsoft portal internet portal list of search engines by
