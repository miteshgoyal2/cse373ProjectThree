on february 254 by combining andrew carnegies carnegie steel company with garys federal steel company and william henry judge moores national steel company56 for 492 million 1416 billion today at one time us steel was the largest steel producer and largest corporation in the world it was capitalized at 14 billion 4030 billion today3 making it the worlds first billiondollar corporation7 the company headquarters was established in 1901 in the empire building in new york city purchased from the estate of orlando b potter for 5 million8 in 1907 us steel bought its largest competitor the tennessee coal iron and railroad company which was headquartered in birmingham alabama tennessee coal was replaced in the dow jones industrial average by the general electric company the federal government attempted to use federal antitrust laws to break up us steel in 1911 but that effort ultimately failed in its first full year of operation us steel made 67 percent of all the steel produced in the united states one hundred years later its shipments accounted for only about 8 percent of domestic consumption3 according to author douglas blackmon the growth of us steel and its subsidiaries was highly dependent in the south on the labor of black workers and convicts the company could obtain and exploit black labor at a fraction of the cost of white labor by taking advantage of the black codes and discriminatory laws passed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by southern states after the reconstruction era us steel had agreements with more than twenty counties in alabama to obtain the labor of its prisoners often paying locales nine dollars a month for workers who would be forced into their mines through a system of convict leasing this practice continued until at least the late 1920s hundreds of thousands of forced laborers particularly poor black men though also children built the company into the titan for which it became known while these individuals were seldom guilty of anything these workers did not receive payment or recognition for their work and thousands died from abuse malnutrition and dire working and living conditions 9 the corporation as it was known on wall street3 was distinguished by its size rather than for its efficiency or creativeness during its heyday in 1901 it controlled twothirds of steel production3 and through its pittsburgh steamship company developed the largest commercial fleet on the great lakes10 because of heavy debts taken on at the companys formation—carnegie insisted on being paid in gold bonds for his stake—and fears of antitrust litigation us steel moved cautiously competitors often innovated faster especially bethlehem steel run by us steels former first president charles m schwab us steels share of the expanding market slipped to 50 percent by 19113 james a farrell was named president in 1911 and served until 1932 mid centuryedit us steel ranked 16th among united states corporations in the value of world war ii production contracts11 production peaked at more than 35 million tons in 1953 its employment was greatest in 1943 when it had more than 340000 employees3 the federal government intervened to try to control us steel president harry s truman attempted to take over its steel mills in 1952 to resolve a crisis with its union the united steelworkers of america the supreme court blocked the takeover by ruling that the president did not have the constitutional authority to seize the mills see youngstown sheet tube co v sawyer12 president john f kennedy was more successful in 1962 when he pressured the steel industry into reversing price increases that kennedy considered dangerously inflationary13 in the postwar years the steel industry and heavy manufacturing went through restructuring that caused a decline in us steels need for labor production and portfolio many jobs moved offshore by 2000 the company employed 52500 people3 the us steel tower in downtown pittsburgh the usx periodedit in the early days of the reagan administration steel firms won substantial tax breaks in order to compete with imported goods but instead of modernizing their mills steel companies shifted capital out of steel and into more profitable areas in march 1982 us steel took its concessions and paid 14 billion in cash and 47 billion in loans for marathon oil saving approximately 500 million in taxes through the merger the architect of tax concessions to steel firms senator arlen specter rpa complained that we go out on a limb in congress and we feel they should be putting it in steel14 the events are the subject of a song by folk singer anne feeney in 1984 the federal government prevented us steel from acquiring national steel and political pressure from the united states congress as well as the united steelworkers usw forced the company to abandon plans to import british steel corporation slabs3 us steel finally acquired national steels assets in 2003 after national steel went bankrupt as part of its diversification plan us steel had acquired marathon oil on january 7 1982 as well as texas oil and gas several years later recognizing its new scope it reorganized its holdings as usx corporation in 1986 with us steel renamed uss inc as a major subsidiary15 about 22000 usx employees stopped work on august 1 1986 after the united steelworkers of america and the company could not agree on new employee contract terms this was characterized by the company as a strike and by the union as a lockout this resulted in most usx facilities becoming idle until february 1 1987 seriously degrading the steel divisions market share a compromise was brokered and accepted by the union membership on january 31 198716 on february 4 1987 three days after the agreement had been reached to end the work stoppage usx announced that four usx plants would remain closed permanently eliminating about 3500 union jobs16 the closure of many plants created the term rust belt for a region of idle and derelict factories corporate raider carl icahn launched a hostile takeover of the steel giant in late 1986 in the midst of the work stoppage he conducted separate negotiations with the union and with management and proceeded to have proxy battles with shareholders and management but he abandoned all efforts to buy out the company on january 8 1987 a few weeks before union employees returned to work16 recent historyedit the us steel tower in new york city now one liberty plaza at the end of the twentieth century the corporation was deriving much of its revenue and net income from its energy operations led by ceo thomas usher us steel spun off marathon and other nonsteel assets except railroad company transtar in october 2001 it expanded internationally for the

steel sold its serbian mills outside belgrade to the serbian government as their operations had been running at an economic loss19 on may 2 2014 us steel announced an undisclosed number of layoffs affecting employees worldwide20 on july 2 2014 us steel was removed from sp 500 index and placed in the sp midcap 400 index in light of its declining market capitalization21 railroad ownershipedit us steel once owned the northampton bath railroad22 the nb was an 11kilometer 68 mi shortline railroad built in 1904 that served atlas cement in northampton pennsylvania and keystone cement in bath pennsylvania23 by 1979 cement shipments had dropped off such that the railroad was no longer economically viable and us steel abandoned the line a 15kilometer 093 mi section of track was retained to serve atlas cement the remainder of the rightofway was transformed into the norbath trail24 through its transtar subsidiary us steel also owned other railroads that served its mines and mills those properties included the duluth missabe iron range railway in the ironmining region of northeast minnesota the elgin joliet eastern that served its gary works in northwest indiana the birmingham southern serving the us steel mill in birmingham alabama and the bessemer lake erie and union railroads in western pennsylvania that delivered iron ore and provided plantswitching services at its mill complex in braddock pennsylvania and coke works in clairton pennsylvania us steel also owned a large great lakes commercial freighter fleet under the pittsburgh steamship company that transported its raw materials from the duluth area to ashtabula gary and conneaut ohio the laker fleet the ble and the dmir were acquired by canadian national after us steel sold most of transtar to that company the ships are leased out to a different domestic operator because of united states cabotage law inclusion in the dow jones industrial average 1901–1991edit us steel is a former dow jones industrial average component listed from april 1 1901 to may 3 1991 it was removed under its usx corporation name with navistar international and primerica25 an original member of the sp 500 since 1957 us steel

was reduced to 005 per share27 dividends may be paid by mailed check direct electronic deposit into a bank account or be reinvested in additional shares of us steel common stock28 legal issuesedit laboredit us steel maintained the labor policies of andrew carnegie which called for low wages and opposition to unionization the amalgamated association of iron and steel workers union that represented workers at the homestead pennsylvania plant was for many years broken after a violent strike in 1892 us steel defeated another strike in 1901 the year it was founded us steel built the city of gary indiana in 1906 and 100 years later it remained the location of the largest integrated steel mill in the northern hemisphere us steel reached a détente with unions during world war i when under pressure from the wilson administration it relaxed its opposition to unions enough to allow some to operate in certain factories it returned to its previous policies as soon as the war ended however and in a 1919 strike defeated unionorganizing efforts by william z foster of the afl29 heavy pressure from public opinion forced the company to give up its 12hour day and adopt the standard eighthour day30 during the 1920s us steel like many other large employers coupled paternalistic employment practices with employee representation plans erps which were company unions sponsored by management these erps eventually became an important factor leading to the organization of the united steelworkers of america the company dropped its hardline antiunion stance in 1937 when myron taylor then president of us steel agreed to recognize the steel workers organizing committee an arm of the congress of industrial organizations cio led by john l lewis taylor was an outsider brought in during the great depression to rescue us steel and had no emotional investment in the companys long history of opposition to unions watching the upheaval caused by the united auto workers successful sitdown strike in flint michigan and convinced that lewis was someone he could deal with on a businesslike basis taylor sought stability through collective bargaining3132 the steelworkers continue to have a contentious relationship with us steel but far less so than the relationship that other unions had with employers in other industries in the united states they launched a number of long strikes against us steel in 1946 and a 116day strike in 1959 but those strikes were over wages and benefits and not the more fundamental issue of union recognition that led to violent strikes elsewhere3334 the steelworkers union attempted to mollify the problems of competitive foreign imports by entering into a socalled experimental negotiation agreement ena in 1974 this was to provide for arbitration in the event that the parties were not able to reach agreement on any new collective bargaining agreements thereby preventing disruptive strikes the ena failed to stop the decline of the steel industry in the us35 us steel and the other employers terminated the ena in 1984 in 1986 us steel employees stopped work after a dispute over contract terms characterized by the company as a strike and by the union as a lockout in a letter to striking employees in 1986 johnston warned there are not enough seats in the steel lifeboat for everybody36 in addition to reducing the role of unions the steel industry had sought to induce the federal government to take action to counteract dumping of steel by foreign producers at belowmarket prices neither the concessions nor antidumping laws have restored the industry to the health and prestige it once had37 environmental recordedit during the 1948 donora smog an air inversion trapped industrial effluent air pollution from the american steel and wire plant and us steels donora zinc works in donora pennsylvania in three days 20 people died after the inversion lifted another 50 died including lukasz musial the father of baseball great stan musial hundreds more lived the rest of their lives with damaged lungs and hearts but another 40 years would pass before the whole truth about donoras bad air made publichealth history 38 today the donora smog museum in that city tells of the influence that the hazardous donora smog had on the air quality standards enacted by the federal government in subsequent years researchers at the political economy research institute have ranked us steel as the eighthgreatest corporate producer of air pollution in the united states down from their 2000 ranking as the secondgreatest39 in 2008 the company released more than one million kg 22 million pounds of toxins chiefly ammonia hydrochloric acid ethylene zinc compounds methanol and benzene but including manganese cyanide and chromium compounds40 in 2004 the city of river rouge michigan and the residents of river rouge and the nearby city of ecorse filed a classaction lawsuit against the company for

illegally released pollutants into ohio waters44 us steels gary indiana facility has been repeatedly charged with discharging polluted wastewater into lake michigan and the grand calumet river in 1998 the company agreed to payment of a 30 million settlement to clean up contaminated sediments from a fivemile 8 km stretch of the river45 with the exception of the fairless hills and gary facilities the
