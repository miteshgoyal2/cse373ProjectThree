official expert on the parliamentary investigatory committee created to uncover the communist background and alleged counterespionage of the new hungarian prime minister péter medgyessy2425 gorka failed to obtain the necessary security clearance from the constitution protection office to serve on the committee apparently because he was widely regarded as a spy working for british counterintelligence gorka defended himself against the charge by saying his service in the british army was merely as a uniformed member of its counterterrorist unit tasked with assessing threats from groups such as the ira314 in 2004 gorka became an adjunct to the faculty of the new us initiative for the program for terrorism and security studies ptss a defense departmentfunded program based in

media gorka on a panel at the conservative political action conference in february 2017 in january 2017 gorka was appointed deputy assistant to the president in the trump white house2032 he was a member of a white house team known as the strategic initiatives group which was set up by white house advisors steve bannon and jared kushner32 the strategic initiatives group never got off the ground and gorka failed to obtain the security clearance necessary for work on national security issues3334 questions were raised as to what the precise roles and duties of gorka were within the trump administration3536 in april 2017 the washington examiner reported that the trump administration was planning to move gorka to a role outside the white house37 however in may 2017 the daily beast reported that trump and bannon had intervened to retain gorka in his position38 on august 25 2017 gorkas white house tenure ended one week after bannons departure3940 gorka stated that he had resigned because white house officials were undermining the make america great again maga platform41 the white house disputed his claim that he resigned and confirmed he was no longer employed there and did not have further access to the white house grounds424344 controversy credentials shortly after taking a position in the trump administration in early 2017 gorka drew criticism from multiple commentators in academia and politics who characterized him as a fringe figure in academic and policymaking circles45945464748 business insider politics editor pamela engel has described gorka as being widely disdained within his own field549 a number of academics and policymakers questioned gorkas knowledge of foreign policy issues his academic credentials and his professional behavior454547504851 andrew reynolds professor of political science at the university of north carolina at chapel hill questioned the validity of gorkas doctoral degree noting discrepancies between how doctorates are normally awarded and how gorkas was awarded reynolds said that the evaluations of each referee on gorkas phd committee was a page of generalized comments – completely at odds with the detailed substantive and methodological evaluations that ive seen at every phd defence ive been on over the last twenty years according to reynolds no less than two of the three referees only had bachelor of arts degrees and one of the referees had published with gorka previously in violation of the academic expectation that reviewers have no personal or other form of interest in the success of a candidates thesis52 note 1 georgetown university associate professor daniel nexon reviewed gorkas phd thesis describing it as inept and saying it does not deploy evidence that would satisfy the most basic methodological requirements for a phd in the us47 the journal terrorism and political violence had never used gorka as a reviewer because according to the associate editor he is not considered a terrorism expert by the academic or policy community”53 in august 2017 gorka falsely asserted that the obama administration invented the term lonewolf terrorism when in fact the term had been widely used in the academic literature media and by governments long before barack obama took office54 responding to his academic critics gorka said that there was an ongoing proxy war and that others were attacking him as a way to attack president trump55 in february 2017 stephen walt a professor of international affairs at the harvard kennedy school of government voiced his reservations about gorka influencing policy in the white house saying gorka does not have much of a reputation in serious academic or policymaking circles he has never published any scholarship of significance and his views on islam and us national security are extreme even by washington standards his only real qualification was his prior association with breitbart news which would be a demerit in any other administration56 according to buzzfeed gorka was unable to obtain a security clearance to work in the hungarian parliament57 views on islam gorka testifying to the house armed services committee subcommittee on emerging threats and capabilities regarding terrorism on june 22 2011 gorkas view on islam and radicalization have drawn controversy585960 gorka sees islamic terrorism as essentially ideologically motivated and rooted in a totalitarian religious mindset in his view violence is a fundamental part of islam and he rejects other scholars assessments that islamic militancy stems primarily from poverty poor governance and war58 he vigorously backed president trumps two executive orders that temporarily banned entry to the united states from seven predominantly muslim countries and trumps usage of the phrase radical islamic terrorism46162 according to washington post reporter greg jaffe most counterterrorism experts dismiss gorkas ideas as a dangerous oversimplification that could alienate muslim allies and boost support for terrorist groups religious scholars are equally withering4 additionally according to jaffe gorka’s views signal a radical break from the discourse defined by the citys republican and democratic foreign policy elite of the last 16 years for gorka the terrorism problem has nothing to do with repression alienation torture tribalism poverty or america’s foreign policy blunders and a messy and complex middle east but is rooted in islam and the martial parts of the koran4 in february 2017 former state department counterterrorism coordinator daniel benjamin and former national security council senior director steven simon took issue with gorkas claim that the obama and george w bush administrations had failed to understand the importance of ideology and they gave examples of how government analysts going back nearly 40 years had examined ideologys role in islamic militancy they argued that by rejecting the role of poor governance repression poverty and war and failing to realize that religious doctrine is not their sole or even primary driver gorka subscribed to an islamophobic approach of seeing islam as the problem rather than the uses to which islam has been put by violent extremists63 others have noted additional nuance in gorkas views about islam freelance investigative journalist richard miniter attests that gorka has been emphatic that the enemy is not islam and that there is an ideological war among muslims a small fraction of which side with al qaeda and its ilk against the vast majority of muslims who are among the terrorists’ most numerous victims64 andrew c mccarthy says the notion that he is racist islamophobic as opposed to antijihadist or uninformed is absurd65 mccarthy a columnist for the national review describes gorka’s defeating jihad as a good primer on the islamic doctrinal and scholarly roots of jihadist terror particularly takfiri jihad targeting fellow muslims gorka believes that the jihadi threat is an ideological one that has to be addressed in manners similar to past totalitarian ideologies of the cold war6667 according to him it is crucial to empower muslim allies as this is a battle within islam65 the historical order of vitéz the order of vitéz was a hungarian order of merit founded in 1920 to reward heroic soldiers it entitled the bearer to the title vitéz as well as a grant of land the title was inheritable passing from father to son like all such orders in hungary it was disbanded at the end of world war ii the us state department lists this order among organizations having been under the direction of the nazi government of germany during world war ii 68 since then a number of private associations have worked to restore the order the most notable of these is the historical order of vitéz this order granted gorkas father paul gorka their title in 1979 in recognition of his resistance to the postwar soviet occupation of hungary697071 paul gorkas memoir budapest elárulva budapest betrayed identifies him on its cover as v gorka pál where the v is an abbreviation for the title vitéz72 sebastian gorka has adopted the title in this way in a number of his publications notably his phd thesis and his writings for the gatestone institute2127 he also used the title in his june 2011 testimony before the house armed services committee7371 in 2017 gorka appeared on fox news on the evening of the us presidential inauguration wearing a badge tunic and ring of the order of vitéz7475 this has given rise to claims that gorka himself is a nazi sympathizer7677 new york times reporter maggie haberman wrote in april 2017 that gorka has been accused of having links to farright groups in europe58 guardian newspaper staff have accused gorka of supporting the genocide carried out by nazi germany due to his fathers membership in the hungarian historical order of vitéz78 his father paul gorka was never a member of the original order and received a vitéz literally valiant medal from hungarian exiles for his resistance to dictatorship in 197970 gorka himself stated that he wears this medal in remembrance of his father who was awarded the decoration for his efforts to create an anticommunist prodemocracy organization at the university he attended in hungary79 robert kerepeszki hungarian expert of the order of vitéz has confirmed that there were ruptures in the organization of the order of vitéz on the question of nazism during the war many of them died fighting against hungarian nazis and gorkas medal had nothing to do with the war period but was awarded for his resistance to dictatorship807781 the tunic that gorka wore was just a traditional hungarian jacket known as a bocskai7781note 2 people who have worked with gorka have said that he is not antisemitic in february 2017 congressman and israel allies caucus cochair trent franks called gorka the staunchest friend of israel and the jewish people82 the forwards nathan guttman responded to franks remarks with a statement that cochair franks did not offer any evidence to refute the reports on gorka’s ties with the hungarian groups the hungarian national committee and the new democratic coalition—as well as former members of jobbik83 michael rubin of the american enterprise institute has said gorka is about as antisemitic as israel prime minister benjamin netanyahu that is not at all84 tibor navracsics an eu commissioner member of the hungarian fidesz political party and former colleague of gorka also defended gorka stating that gorka has spent his life battling fascists and antisemites of all sorts85 writing in the jerusalem post bruce abramson and jeff ballabon argue that the forwards articles are partisan attacks with no merit86 sarah n stern of the endowment for middle east truth has called gorka a true friend to israel and the jewish people adding it is folly to cry wolf about antisemitism at a time like this when there are already too many wolves in the fold87 peter beinart writing in the forward says the evidence does not support the magazines charges of antisemitism88 on march 16 2017 leaders of one of two successor organisations of the vitézi rend stated that gorka was an official member of the historical vitézi rend faction to which he is said to have taken a lifelong oath of loyalty gorka denied the allegations89 the anne frank center for mutual respect the national jewish democratic council and the interfaith alliance have called for gorkas resignation over his ties to hungarian farright groups90 the antidefamation league has asked gorka to disavow the hungarian national committee and the new democratic coalition91 democratic senators ben cardin dick durbin and richard blumenthal sent a letter to the department of justice and the department of homeland security requesting that the dhs look into whether gorka illegally procured his citizenship by omitting membership in historical vitézi rend which could have been grounds for keeping him out of the country92 march 17 2017 gorka issued a statement in which he denied that he is a sworn member of hungarian groups with nazi past93 support for the hungarian guard statements of support for gorka which have challenged the description of him as an antisemite all predated a 2017 story that connected him with another extreme farright antisemitic group in a 2007 video gorka declared his support for the magyar gárda hungarian guard a paramilitary group described by various sources as neofascist and antisemitic94 gorka said that if we look at the swiss or israeli example when it is about a country that is small and doesnt have a massive military then a system can be based on a territorial defense in america the state supports them giving old arms after the disturbances of hungary last year a need has risen to supplement the official military because the country’s military is sick and totally reflects the state of hungarian society this country cannot defend itself” he also added that “we support the establishment of the hungarian guard despite the personalities involved”9495 the guard was formally banned in hungary two years after gorka left the country in 2009 which decision was upheld by the european court of human rights due to its racist activities9697 2016 airport gun incident gorka was detained january 31 2016 at the ronald reagan airport in washington dc for attempting to board a plane with a 9mm handgun in his luggage the gun was confiscated by transportation security administration officers and gorka after being detained and issued with a criminal summons was permitted to board his plane98 gorka said that he had packed the carryon bag without remembering that it contained a gun a judge dismissed the charge on february 3 2017 since he had stayed out of legal trouble for six months in an arrangement agreed with the prosecutor99 personal life gorka married pennsylvania native katharine fairfax cornell in
