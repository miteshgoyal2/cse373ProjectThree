people are treating google like their most trusted friend should they be he replied i think judgment matters if you have something that you dont want anyone to know maybe you shouldnt be doing it in the first place but if you really need that kind of privacy the reality is that search engines including google do retain this information for some time and its important for example that we are all

neutrality i want to be clear what we mean by net neutrality what we mean is if you have one data type like video you dont discriminate against one persons video in favor of another but its okay to
