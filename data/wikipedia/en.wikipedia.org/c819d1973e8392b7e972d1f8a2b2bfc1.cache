massachusetts137 it was signed into law by bush in early 2002138 many contend that the initiative has been successful as cited by the fact that students in the us have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since bush signed no child left behind into law139 critics argue that it is underfunded140 and that nclbas focus on highstakes testing and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive141 after being reelected bush signed into law a medicare drug benefit program that according to jan crawford resulted in the greatest expansion in americas welfare state in forty years the bills costs approached 7 trillion142 in 2007 bush opposed and vetoed state childrens health insurance program schip legislation which was added by the democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by congress the schip legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some lowincome families from about six million to ten million

personal social security accounts and options to permit americans to divert a portion of their social security tax fica into secured investments147 democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system147 bush embarked on a 60day national tour campaigning for his initiative in media events known as conversations on social security in an attempt to gain public support148 nevertheless public support for the proposal declined149 and the house republican leadership decided not to put social security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda150 the proposals legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from hurricane katrina151 after the democrats gained control of both houses of congress as a result of the 2006 midterm elections there was no prospect of further congressional action on the bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office environmental policies main article domestic policy of the george w bush administration § environment upon taking office in 2001 bush stated his opposition to the kyoto protocol an amendment to the united nations framework convention on climate change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the worlds population152 and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year153 he also cited that the senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol in may 2001 bush signed an executive order to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects154 and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues155 in 2002 bush announced the clear skies act of 2003156 aimed at amending the clean air act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal157 the initiative was introduced to congress but failed to make it out of committee later in 2006 bush declared the northwestern hawaiian islands a national monument creating the largest marine reserve to date the papahānaumokuākea marine national monument comprises 84 million acres 340000 km2 and is home to 7000 species of fish birds and other marine animals many of which are specific to only those islands158 the move was hailed by conservationists for its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area159 bush has said that he

emissions and deter global warming163 energy policies in his 2006 state of the union address bush declared america is addicted to oil and announced his advanced energy initiative to increase energy development research164 president bush delivering a statement on energy urging congress to end offshore oil drill ban june 18 2008 in his 2007 state of the union address bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production165 amid high gasoline prices in 2008 bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling166 however the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling bush said this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil reserves is action from the us congress166 bush had said in june 2008 in the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies my administration has worked with congress to invest in gassaving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells in the short run the american economy will continue to rely largely on oil and that means we need to increase supply especially here at home so my administration has repeatedly called on congress to expand domestic oil production167 in his 2008 state of the union address

2001 bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing lines of stem cells171 but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines172 on july 19 2006 bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the stem cell research enhancement act the bill would have repealed the

enforcement measures a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a pointbased merit system for green cards elimination of chain migration and of the diversity immigrant visa and other measures bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of us laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor180 bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty181 a heated public debate followed which resulted in a substantial rift within the republican party most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions182 the bill was eventually defeated in the senate on june 28 2007 when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote183 bush
