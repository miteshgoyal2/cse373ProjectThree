bellevue college currently offers several bachelor’s degree programs radiation and imaging sciences interior design and healthcare technology and management two additional degrees in nursing and in information systems and technology began enrolling students in fall quarter of 2013 in 2005 the washington state legislature authorized a limited pilot program that allowed community and technical colleges which historically have granted only certificates and twoyear associate degrees to offer fouryear bachelors degrees the major impetus for this legislation was studies concluding that washington state needed to produce more graduates with bachelors degrees to meet the needs of the growing economy both now and in the future proponents of the pilot program cited several reasons many community college students are placebound and cannot move elsewhere to attend a university many of the state’s residents live in areas without access to universities particular programs may not be offered at nearby universities increased competition for fewer slots at universities were shutting out many students and some careeroriented bachelor programs were not offered anywhere in the state bellevue college was one of four schools – along with south seattle community college peninsula college and olympic college – chosen to participate in the pilot program the bachelors degrees were to be “applied” in nature meaning they would be directed at people already working in specialized fields and who want to advance their careers in order to participate colleges had to demonstrate the following sufficient student and employer demand similar degrees were not offered elsewhere the college had the expertise to offer the degree and an independent accrediting agency had to approve the degree in 2007 bellevue college began enrolling students in its first fouryear program a bachelor of applied science in radiation and imaging sciences currently the only degree of its kind offered in the state in 2009 bc proposed legislation that would have allowed it to award a range of bachelor of arts or science degrees creating a hybrid communitycollege model but the measure failed to pass in committee in the legislature yet public comment and community response to the colleges request for expanded fouryear programs has been overwhelmingly positive despite this setback bc announced the addition of its second fouryear program that year a bachelor of applied arts in interior design also in 2009 bc changed its name from bellevue community college to bellevue college to reflect the evolving nature of the institution which now offered bachelors degrees in addition to associate degrees and certificates in 2010 the legislature made permanent the pilot program allowing the state’s community and technical colleges to offer bachelors degrees and any community or technical college could now develop a fouryear degree program that same year the northwest commission on colleges and universities accredited bellevue college as a baccalaureate degreegranting institution bc added its third degree in 2012 a bachelor of applied science in healthcare technology and management in late 2012 bellevue college won approval from the washington state board for community and technical colleges to offer two additional degrees in nursing and in information systems and technology the college
