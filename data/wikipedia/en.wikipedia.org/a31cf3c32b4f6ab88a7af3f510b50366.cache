was produced by newspaper publishing plc and created by andreas whittam smith stephen glover and matthew symonds all three partners were former journalists at the daily telegraph who had left the paper towards the end of lord hartwells ownership marcus sieff was the first chairman of newspaper publishing and whittam smith took control of the paper9 the paper was created at a time of a fundamental change in british newspaper publishing rupert murdoch was challenging longaccepted practices of the print unions and ultimately defeated them in the wapping dispute consequently production costs could be reduced which it was said at the timeby whom created openings for more competition as a result of controversy around murdochs move to wapping the plant was effectively having to function under siege from sacked print workers picketing outside the independent attracted some of the staff from the two murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to his companys new headquarters launched with the advertising slogan it is are you and challenging both the guardian for centreleft readers and the times as the newspaper of record the independent reached a circulation of over 400000 by 1989 competing in a moribund market the independent sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as within a few years a price war in the market sectorcitation needed when the independent launched the independent on sunday in 1990 sales were less than anticipated partly due to the launch of the sunday correspondent four months prior although this direct rival closed at the end of november 1990 some aspects of production merged with the main paper although the sunday paper retained a largely distinct editorial staff since 1990edit in the 1990s the independent was faced with price cutting by the murdoch titles and started an advertising campaign accusing the times and the daily telegraph of reflecting the views of their proprietors rupert murdoch and conrad black it featured spoofs of the other papers mastheads with the words the rupert murdoch or the conrad black with the independent below the main title newspaper publishing had financial problems a number of other media companies were interested in the paper tony oreillys media group and mirror group newspapers mgn had bought a stake of about a third each by mid1994 in march 1995 newspaper publishing was restructured with a rights issue splitting the shareholding into oreillys independent news media 43 mgn 43 and prisa publisher of el país 1210 in april 1996 there was another refinancing and in march 1998 oreilly bought the other 54clarification needed of the company for £30 million and assumed the companys debt brendan hopkins headed independent news andrew marr was appointed editor of the independent and rosie boycott became editor of the independent on sunday marr introduced a dramatic if shortlived redesign which won critical favour but was a commercial failure partly as a result of a limited promotional budget marr admitted his changes had been a mistake in his book my trade11 boycott left in april 1998 to join the daily express and marr left in may 1998 later becoming the bbcs political editor simon kelner was appointed as the editor by this time the circulation had fallen below 200000 independent news spent heavily to increase circulation and the paper went through several redesigns while circulation increased it did not approach the level which had been achieved in 1989 or restore profitability job cuts and financial controls reduced the morale of journalists and the quality of the product ivan fallon on the board since 1995 and formerly a key figure at the sunday times replaced hopkins as head of independent news media in july 2002 by mid2004 the newspaper was losing £5 million per year a gradual improvement meant that by 2006 circulation was at a nineyear high12 in november 2008 following further staff cuts production was moved to northcliffe house in kensington high street the headquarters of associated newspapers13 the two newspaper groups editorial management and commercial operations remained separate but they shared services including security information technology switchboard and payroll on 25 march 2010 independent news media sold the newspaper to russian oligarch alexander lebedev for a nominal £1 fee and £925m over the next 10 months choosing this option over closing the independent and the independent on sunday which would have cost £28m and £40m respectively due to longterm contracts314 in 2009 lebedev had bought a controlling stake in the london evening standard two weeks later editor roger alton resigned15 in july 2011 the independents columnist johann hari was stripped of the orwell prize he had won in 2008 after claims which hari later admitted to16 of plagiarism and inaccuracy17 in january 2012 chris blackhurst editor of the independent told the leveson inquiry that the scandal had severely damaged the newspapers reputation he nevertheless told the inquiry that hari would return as a columnist in four to five weeks18 hari later announced that he would not return to the independent19 jonathan foreman contrasted the independents reaction to the scandal unfavourably with the reaction of american newspapers to similar incidents such as the jayson blair case which led to resignations of editors deep soulsearching and new standards of exactitude being imposed20 the historian guy walters suggested that haris fabrications had been an open secret amongst the newspapers staff and that their internal inquiry was a facesaving exercise21 contentedit format and designedit the independents front page 15 february 2014 the independent began publishing as a broadsheet in a series of celebrated designs the final version was designed by carroll dempsey and thirkell following a commission by nicholas garland who along with alexander chancellor was unhappy with designs produced by raymond hawkey and michael mcguiness – on seeing the proposed designs chancellor had said i thought we were joining a serious paper the first edition was designed and implemented by michael crozier who was executive editor design and picture from prelaunch in 1986 to 1994 from september 2003 the paper was produced in both broadsheet and tabloidsized versions with the same content in each the tabloid edition was termed compact to distance itself from the more sensationalist reporting style usually associated with tabloid newspapers in the uk22 after launching in the london area and then in north west england23 the smaller format appeared gradually throughout the uk soon afterwards rupert murdochs times followed suit introducing its own tabloidsized version24 prior to these changes the independent had a daily circulation of around 217500 the lowest of any major national british daily a figure that climbed by 15 as of march 2004 to 250000 throughout much of 2006 circulation stagnated at a quarter of a million on 14 may 2004 the independent produced its last weekday broadsheet having stopped producing a saturday broadsheet edition in january the independent on sunday published its last simultaneous broadsheet on 9 october 2005 and has since followed a compact design on 12 april 2005 the independent redesigned its layout to a more european feel similar to frances libération the redesign was carried out by a barcelonabased design studio the weekday second section was subsumed within the main paper doublepage feature articles became common in the main news sections and there were revisions to the front and back covers25 a new second section extra was introduced on 25 april 2006 it is similar to the guardians g2 and the timess times2 containing features reportage and games including sudoku in june 2007 the independent on sunday consolidated its content into a news section which included sports and business and a magazine focusing on life and culture26 on 23 september 2008 the main newspaper became fullcolour and extra was replaced by an independent life supplement focusing on different themes each day27 three weeks after the acquisition of the paper by alexander lebedev and evgeny lebedev in 2010 the paper was relaunched with another redesign on 20 april the new format featured smaller headlines and a new pullout viewspaper section which contained the papers comment and feature articles28 from 26 october 2010 the same day as its sister paper i was launched the independent was printed on slightly thicker paper than before and ceased to be fullcolour throughout with many photographs and pictures though none of those used in adverts being printed in black and white only on 11 october 2011 the independent unveiled yet another new look featuring a red sansserif masthead in november 2013 the whole newspaper was overhauled again including new custom fonts and a vertical masthead in black front pagesedit following the 2003 switch in format the independent became known for its unorthodox and campaigning front pages which frequently relied on images graphics or lists rather than traditional headlines and written news content for example following the kashmir earthquake in 2005 it used its front page to urge its readers to donate to its appeal fund and following the publication of the hutton report into the death of british government scientist david kelly its front page simply carried the word whitewash29 in 2003 the papers editor simon kelner was named editor of the year at the what the papers say awards partly in recognition of according to the judges his often arresting and imaginative frontpage designs30 in 2008 however as he was stepping down as editor he stated that it was possible to overdo the formula and that the style of the papers front pages perhaps needed reinvention31 under the subsequent editorship of chris blackhurst the campaigning posterstyle front pages were scaled back in favour of more conventional news stories sectionsedit the weekday saturday and sunday editions of the independent all included supplements and pullout subsections daily monday to friday the independent

access to the blog service priority on image and video content and additional areas of the site including art architecture fashion gadgets and health the paper launched podcast programmes such as the independent music radio show the independent travel guides the independent sailing podcasts and the independent video travel guides since 2009 the website has carried short video news bulletins provided by the al jazeera english news channel36 in 2014 the independent launched a sister website i100 a shareable journalism site with similarities to reddit and upworthy37 political viewsedit when the paper was established in 1986 the founders intended its political stance to reflect the centre of the british political spectrum and thought that it would attract readers primarily from the times and the daily telegraph it has been seen as leaning to the left making it more a competitor to the guardian although both also feature conservative columnists the independent tends to take a classical liberal promarket stance on economic issues6 in an editorial on 27 january 2013 the independent on sunday referred to itself as a proudly liberal newspaper38 the paper took a strong editorial position against the 2003 invasion of iraq the iraq war and aspects of us and uk foreign policy related to the war on terrorism following the 11 september attacks it has been a strong supporter of electoral reform39 the paper has also taken strong positions on environmental issues campaigned against the introduction of id cards and campaigned against the restriction of mass immigration to the uk in 1997 the independent on sunday launched a campaign for the decriminalisation of cannabis ten years later it reversed itself claiming that the cannabis strain skunk smoked by the majority of young britons in 2007 had become 25 times stronger than resin sold a decade ago40 in addition the independent has highlighted what it refers to as war crimes being committed by progovernment forces in the darfur region of sudan41 originally it avoided royal stories whittam smith later saying he thought the british press was unduly besotted with the royal family and that a newspaper could manage without stories about the monarchy42 in 2007 alan rusbridger editor of the guardian said of the independent the emphasis on views not news means that the reporting is rather thin and it loses impact on the front page the more you do that43 in a 12 june 2007 speech british prime minister tony blair called the independent a viewspaper saying it was started as an antidote to the idea of journalism as views not news that was why it was called the independent today it is avowedly a viewspaper not merely a newspaper44 the independent criticised blairs comments the following day4546 but later changed format to include a viewspaper insert in the centre of the regular newspaper designed to feature most of the opinion columns and arts reviews a leader published on the day of the 2008 london mayoral election compared the candidates and said that if the newspaper had a vote it would vote first for the green party candidate sian berry noting the similarity between her priorities and those of the independent and secondly with rather heavy heart for the incumbent ken livingstone47 an ipsos mori poll estimated that in the 2010 general election 44 of regular readers voted liberal democrat 32 voted labour48 and 14 voted conservative compared to 23 29 and 36 respectively of the overall electorate49 on the eve of the 2010 general election the independent supported the liberal democrats arguing that they are longstanding and convincing champions of civil liberties sound economics international cooperation on the great global challenges and of course fundamental electoral reform these are all principles that this newspaper has long held dear that is why we argue that there is a strong case for progressively minded voters to lend their support to the liberal democrats wherever there is a clear opportunity for that party to win39 however the weekend before the 2015 general election saw the independent on sunday claim it would not be advising its readers how to vote in 2015 the editorial piece claimed that this does not mean that we are a bloodless valuefree newssheet we have always been committed to social justice but the paper recognised that it was up the readers to make up your own mind about whether you agree with us or not rather than support a particular party the paper urged all its reader to vote as a responsibility of common citizenship50 on 4 may 2015 the weekday version of the independent said that a continuation of the conservative–liberal democrat coalition after the general election would be a positive outcome51 personneledit editorsedit the
