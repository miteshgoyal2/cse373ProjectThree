his recovery was slow interrupted by blood clots and a lifethreatening infection after large doses of penicillin had not succeeded he overcame the infection with the administration of streptomycin which at the time was still an experimental drug10 he remained despondent not ready to accept the fact that my life would be changed forever he was encouraged to see hampar kelikian an orthopedist in chicago who had been working with veterans returning from war although during their first meeting kelikian told dole that he would never be able to recover fully the encounter changed doles outlook on life who years later wrote of kelikian a survivor of the armenian genocide kelikian inspired me to focus on what i had left and what i could do with it rather than complaining what had been lost dr k as dole later came to affectionately call him operated on him seven times free of charge and had in doles words an impact on my life second only to my family11 dole recovered from his wounds at the

very tough new hampshire bush commercial which accused dole of straddling on taxescitation needed this remark prompted some members of the media to perceive him as angry about the loss contributing to doles hatchet man image earned during his tenure as rnc chairman and the 76 campaign despite two big wins in south dakota and minnesota a week after new hampshire dole was not able to recover dole was viewed by many as a micromanager who could not effectively oversee a presidential campaign while serving as a senatorcitation needed dole did not hire a fulltime campaign manager former tennessee senator bill brock until late 1987 well after bushs team had been in place despite raising almost as much money as the bush campaign the dole campaign spent its money faster and was vastly outspent in

second time in october 1995 a year before the presidential election dole and speaker of the house newt gingrich led the republicancontrolled congress to pass a spending bill that president clinton vetoed leading to the federal government shutdown from 1995–96 on november 13 republican and democratic leaders including vice president al gore dick armey and dole met to try to resolve the budget and were unable to reach an agreement1516 due to doles need to campaign for the republican presidential nomination he wanted to solve the budget crisis in january 1996 despite the willingness of other republicans to continue the shutdown unless their demands were met in particular as gingrich and dole had been seen as potential rivals for the 1996 presidential nomination they had a tense working relationship17 the shutdown was cited as having a role in clintons successful 1996 reelection by clinton aide george stephanopoulos18 the popularity of the incumbent president bill clinton had improved greatly from 1994 to 1996 thanks to a booming economy as well as winning public opinion in the 1995 budget shutdown so clinton and vice president al gore faced no serious opposition in the democratic primaries19 a few months before his death in april 1994 richard nixon warned dole if the economys good youre not going to beat clinton20 dole was the early front runner for the gop nomination in the 1996 presidential race at least eight candidates ran for the nomination dole was expected to win the nomination against underdog candidates such as the more conservative senator phil gramm of texas and more moderate senator arlen specter of pennsylvania pat buchanan upset dole in the early new hampshire primary however with dole finishing second and former tennessee governor lamar alexander finishing third speechwriter kerry tymchuk remarked dole was on the ropes because he wasnt conservative enough19 dole eventually won the nomination becoming the oldest firsttime presidential

as well as the first kansas native to become president as dwight eisenhower was born in texas dole found the initial draft of the acceptance speech written by mark helprin as too hardline so kerry tymchuk who was part of the let dole be dole crowd revised the speech to cover the themes of honor decency and straight talk it included the following line a swat at the allornothing rookie republicans who had been swept into congress in the 1994 midterm gop wave in politics honorable compromise is no sin it is what protects us from absolutism and intolerance19 in his acceptance speech dole stated let me be the bridge to an america that only the unknowing call myth let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity faith and confidence in action21 to which incumbent president bill clinton responded we do not need to build a bridge to the past we need to build a bridge to the future22 dole was the first sitting senate party leader to receive his partys nomination for president he hoped to use his long experience in senate procedures to maximize publicity from his rare positioning as senate majority leader against an incumbent president but was stymied by senate democrats on june 11 1996 dole resigned his seat to focus on the campaign saying he was either heading for the white house or home23 as told in the doles joint biography unlimited partners speechwriter and biographer kerry tymchuk wrote that he was going to make a statement he was going to risk it all for the white house he knew his time as leader was over it would have been tough to come back to the senate as leader if he lost in november he knew it was time to move up or move out19 dole promised a 15 acrosstheboard reduction in income tax rates and made former congressman and supply side advocate jack kemp his running mate for vice president dole found himself criticized from both the left and the right within the republican party over the convention platform one of the major issues being the inclusion of the human life amendment clinton framed the narrative against dole early painting him as a mere clone of unpopular thenhouse speaker newt gingrich warning america that dole would work in concert with the republican congress to slash popular social programs like medicare and social security dubbed by clinton as dolegingrich24 doles taxcut plan found itself under attack from the white house who said it would blow a hole in the deficit25 with the infancy of the internet dolekemp was the first presidential campaign to set up a website edging out clintongore which was set up by arizona state college students rob kubasko and vince salvato19 concerns over doles age and lagging campaign were exemplified by a memorable incident on september 18 1996 at a rally in chico california dole was reaching down to shake the hand of a supporter when the railing on the stage gave way and he tumbled four feet while dole suffered only minor injuries in the fall the televised image of his painful grimace underscored the age difference between him and clinton and proved an ominous sign for republican hopes of retaking the white house262728 during the latter half of october 1996 dole made a campaign appearance with heather whitestone the first deaf miss america where both of them signed i love you to the crowd around that time dole and his advisers knew that they would lose the election but in the last four days of the campaign they went on the 96hour victory tour to help republican congressional candidates29 dole lost as pundits had long expected to incumbent president bill clinton in the 1996 election clinton won in a 379–159 electoral college landslide capturing 492 of the vote against doles 407 and ross perots 8430 as richard nixon had predicted to dole a few months before his death in april 1994 clinton was able to ride a booming economy to a second term in the white house20 dole is the only person in the history of the two major us political parties to have been a partys nominee for both president and vice president but who was never elected to either office it is a virtual reversal to the situation of his former running mate gerald r ford who had served both as vice president and as president without being elected to either office the span of 20 years between his participation in the 1976 vicepresidential debate and the 1996 presidential debates is the longest for any candidate since televised debates in presidential election years were instituted in 1960citation needed dole is the last world war ii veteran to have been the presidential nominee of a major party during the campaign doles advanced age was brought up with critics stating that he was too old to be president however dole was still alive in august 2017

dont have anything to do29 dole later wrote i was wrong seventytwo hours after conceding the election i was swapping wisecracks with david letterman on his latenight show20 during the immediate aftermath of his 1996 loss to clinton dole recalled that his critics thought that i didnt loosen up enough i didnt show enough leg they said i was too serious it takes several months to stop fretting about it and move on but i did dole remarked that his decisive defeat to clinton made it easier for him to be magnanimous on his decision to leave politics for good after the 1996 presidential election campaign despite his guaranteed stature as a former senate leader dole stated people were urging me to be a hatchet man against clinton for the next four years i couldnt see the point maybe after all those partisan fights you look for more friendships one of the nice things ive discovered is that when youre out of politics you have more credibility with the other side and youre out among all kinds of people and that just doesnt happen often for an expresident he doesnt have the same freedom so it hasnt been all bad32 postpolitical careeredit 2005 dole speaking at the 60th anniversary
