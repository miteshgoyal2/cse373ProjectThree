editor of philadelphias largest newspaper the aurora gazette an editorial in the first issue of the pennsylvania inquirer promised that the paper would be devoted to the right of a minority to voice their opinion and the maintenance of the rights and liberties of the people equally against the abuses as the usurpation of power they pledged support to thenpresident andrew jackson and home industries american manufactures and internal improvements that so materially contribute to the agricultural commercial and national prosperity5 founded on june 1 1829 the philadelphia inquirer is the thirdoldest surviving daily newspaper in the united states however in 1962 an inquirercommissioned historian traced the inquirer to john dunlaps the pennsylvania packet which was founded on october 28 1771 in 1850 the packet was merged with another newspaper the north american which later merged with the philadelphia public ledger2 finally the public ledger merged with the philadelphia inquirer in the 1930s and between 1962 and 1975 a line on the inquirers front page claimed that the newspaper is the united states oldest surviving daily newspaper5 six months after the inquirer was founded with competition from eight established daily newspapers lack of funds forced norvell and walker to sell the newspaper to publisher and united states gazette associate editor jesper harding after harding acquired the pennsylvania inquirer it was briefly published as an afternoon paper before returning to its original morning format in january 1830 under harding in 1829 the inquirer moved from its original location between front and second streets to between second and third streets when harding bought and merged the morning journal in january 1830 the newspaper was moved to south second street ten years later the inquirer again was moved this time to its own building at the corner of third street and carters alley harding expanded the inquirers content and the paper soon grew into a major philadelphian newspaper the expanded content included the addition of fiction and in 1840 harding gained rights to publish several charles dickens novels for which dickens was paid a significant amount at the time the common practice was to pay little or nothing for the rights of foreign authors works5 civil war to 1920sedit harding retired in 1859 and was succeeded by his son william white harding who had become a partner three years earlier william harding changed the name of the newspaper to its current name the philadelphia inquirer harding in an attempt to increase circulation cut the price of the paper began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street in 1859 circulation had been around 7000 by 1863 it had increased to 70000 part of the increase was due to the interest in news during the american civil war twentyfive to thirty thousand copies of the inquirer were often distributed to union soldiers during the war and several times the us government asked the philadelphia inquirer to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers the philadelphia inquirer supported the union but harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral confederate generals often sought copies of the paper believing that the newspapers war coverage was accurate5 inquirer journalist uriah hunt painter was at the first battle of bull run in 1861 a battle which ended in a confederate victory initial reports from the government claimed a union victory but the inquirer went with painters firsthand account crowds threatened to burn the inquirers building down because of the report another report this time about general george meade angered meade enough that he punished edward crapsey the reporter who wrote it crapsey and other war correspondents later decided to attribute any victories of the army of the potomac meades command to ulysses s grant commander of the entire union army any defeats of the army of the potomac would be attributed to meade5 during the war the inquirer continued to grow with more staff being added and another move into a larger building on chestnut street however after the war economic hits combined with harding becoming ill hurt the inquirer despite philadelphias population growth distribution fell from 70000 during the civil war to 5000 in 1888 beginning in 1889 the paper was sold to publisher james elverson to bring back the paper elverson moved the inquirer to a new building with the latest printing technology and an increased staff the new philadelphia inquirer premiered on march 1 and was successful enough that elverson started a sunday edition of the paper in 1890 in an attempt to increase circulation further the price of the inquirer was cut and the papers size was increased mostly with classified advertisements after five years the inquirer had to move into a larger building on market street and later expanded into adjacent property5 the inquirer building formerly the elverson building the home of the newspaper from 1924–2011 after elversons death in 1911 his son by his wife sallie duvall james elverson jr took charge under elverson jr the newspaper continued to grow eventually needing to move again elverson jr bought land at broad and callowhill streets and built the eighteenstory elverson building now known as the inquirer building the first inquirer issue printed at the building came out on july 13 1925 elverson jr died a few years later in 1929 and his sister eleanor elverson mrs jules patenôtre took over5 see also inquirer building annenberg yearsedit eleanor elverson patenôtre ordered cuts throughout the paper but was not really interested in managing it and ownership was soon put up for sale cyrus curtis and curtismartin newspapers inc bought the newspaper on march 5 19306 curtis died a year later and his stepsoninlaw john charles martin took charge martin merged the inquirer with another paper the public ledger but the great depression hurt curtismartin newspapers and the company defaulted in payments of maturity notes subsequently ownership of the inquirer returned to the patenôtre family and elverson corp7 charles a taylor was elected president of the inquirer co and ran the paper until it was sold to moses l annenberg in 1936 during the period between elverson jr and annenberg the inquirer stagnated its editors ignoring most of the poor economic news of the depression the lack of growth allowed j david sterns newspaper the philadelphia record to surpass the inquirer in circulation and become the largest newspaper in pennsylvania28 under moses annenberg the inquirer turned around annenberg added new features increased staff and held promotions to increase circulation by november 1938 inquirers weekday circulation increased to 345422 from 280093 in 1936 during that same period the records circulation had dropped to 204000 from 328322 in 1939 annenberg was charged with income tax evasion annenberg pleaded guilty before his trial and was sent to prison where he died in 1942 upon moses annenbergs death his son walter annenberg took over not long after in 1947 the record went out of business and the philadelphia inquirer became philadelphias only major daily morning newspaper while still trailing behind philadelphias largest newspaper the evening bulletin the inquirer continued to be profitable in 1948 walter annenberg expanded the inquirer building with a new structure that housed new printing presses for the inquirer and during the 1950s and 1960s annenbergs other properties seventeen and tv guide5 in 1957 annenberg bought the philadelphia daily news and combined the daily news facilities with the inquirers a thirtyeightday strike in 1958 hurt the inquirer and after the strike ended so many reporters had accepted buyout offers and left that the newsroom was noticeably empty furthermore many current reporters had been copyclerks just before the strike and had little experience one of the few star reporters of the 1950s and 1960s was investigative reporter harry karafin during his career harry karafin exposed corruption and other exclusive stories for the inquirer but also extorted money out of individuals and organizations karafin would claim he had harmful information and would demand money in exchange for the information not being made public8 this went on from the late 1950s into the early 1960s before karafin was exposed in 1967 and convicted of extortion a year later by the end of the 1960s circulation and advertising revenue was in decline and the newspaper had become according to time magazine uncreative and undistinguished9 corporate ownershipedit in 1969 annenberg was offered us55 million for the inquirer by samuel newhouse but having earlier promised john s knight the right of first refusal of any sale offer annenberg sold it to knight instead the inquirer along with the philadelphia daily news became part of knight newspapers and its new subsidiary philadelphia newspapers inc pni five years later knight newspapers merged with ridder publications to form knight ridder when the inquirer was bought it was understaffed its equipment was outdated many of its employees were underskilled and the paper trailed its chief competitor the evening bulletin in weekday circulation however eugene l roberts jr who became the inquirers executive editor in 1972 turned the newspaper around between 1975 and 1990 the inquirer won seventeen pulitzers six consecutively between 1975 and 1980 and more journalism awards than any other newspaper in the united states time magazine chose the inquirer as one of the ten best daily newspapers in the united states calling roberts changes to the paper one of the most remarkable turnarounds in quality and profitability in the history of american journalism9 by july 1980 the inquirer had become the most circulated paper in philadelphia forcing the evening bulletin to shut down two years later the inquirers success was not without hardships between 1970 and 1985 the newspaper experienced eleven strikes the longest lasting fortysix days in 1985 the inquirer was also criticized for covering karachi better than kensington9 this did not stop the papers growth during the 1980s and when the evening bulletin shut down the inquirer hired seventeen bulletin reporters and doubled its bureaus to attract former bulletin readers10 by 1989 philadelphia newspapers incs editorial staff reached a peak of 721 employees the 1990s saw gradually dropping circulation and advertisement revenue for the inquirer the decline was part of a nationwide trend but the effects were exacerbated by according to dissatisfied inquirer employees the papers resisting changes that many other daily newspapers implemented to keep readers and pressure from knight ridder to cut costs11 during most of robertss time as editor knight ridder allowed him a great deal of freedom in running the newspaper however in the late 1980s knight ridder had become concerned about the inquirers profitability and took a more active role in its operations knight ridder pressured the inquirer to expand into the more profitable suburbs while at the same time cutting staff and coverage of national and international stories10 staff cuts continued until knight ridder was bought in 2006 with some of the inquirers best reporters accepting buyouts and leaving for other newspapers such as the new york times and the washington post by the late 1990s all of the highlevel editors who had worked with eugene roberts in the 1970s and 1980s had left none at normal retirement age since the 1980s the paper has won just one pulitzer a 1997 award for explanatory journalism12 in 1998 inquirer reporter ralph cipriano filed a libel suit against knight ridder the philadelphia inquirer and inquirer editor robert rosenthal over comments rosenthal made about cipriano to the washington post cipriano had claimed that it was difficult reporting negative stories in the inquirer about the roman catholic archdiocese of philadelphia13 and rosenthal later claimed that cipriano had a very strong personal point of view and an agenda  he could never prove his stories14 the suit was later settled out of court in 2001 the paper launched an online news desk in the early 2000s in order to compete with local radio stations for breaking news1548–49 knight ridder was bought by rival the mcclatchy company in june 2006 the inquirer and the philadelphia daily news were among the twelve lessprofitable knight ridder newspapers that mcclatchy put up for sale when the deal was announced in march16 on june 29 2006 the inquirer and daily news were sold to philadelphia media holdings llc pmh a group of philadelphian area business people including brian p tierney pmhs chief executive the new owners planned to spend us5 million on advertisements and promotions to increase the inquirers profile and readership17 in the years following philadelphia media holdings acquisition the inquirer saw larger than expected revenue losses mostly from national advertising and continued loss of circulation the revenue losses caused management to cut four hundred jobs at the inquirer and daily news in the three years since the papers were bought1819 despite efforts to cut costs philadelphia newspapers llc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on february 21 2009 philadelphia media holdings was about us390 million in debt due to money borrowed to buy the inquirer and daily news20 the bankruptcy was the beginning of a yearlong dispute between philadelphia media holdings and its creditors the group of creditors which included banks and hedge funds wanted to take control of philadelphia newspapers llc themselves and opposed efforts by philadelphia media holdings to keep control21 philadelphia media holdings received support from most of the papers unions and launched a publicrelations campaign to promote local ownership22 a bankruptcy auction was held on april 28 2010 the group of lending creditors and a group of local investors allied with brian tierney both bid for philadelphia newspapers but the lenders had the winning bid23 the deal fell through after the group of lenders under the name of philadelphia media network pmn was unable to reach a contract agreement with the union representing the companys drivers24 philadelphia newspapers represented by lawrence g mcmichael of dilworth paxson llp challenged the right of creditors to credit bid at a bankruptcy auction the us court of appeals for the third circuit held that credit bidding was not permitted the papers went up for auction again in september and again philadelphia media network pmn won the bid after successfully negotiating a contract with all of the papers fourteen unions the us139 million deal became official on october 82526 the philadelphia inquirer continued to struggle to make a profit due to competition from digital media sources by may 2012 the combined journalist staff at all of philadelphia media network was about 320 and some of the same stories and photographs appear both in the inquirer and daily news on april 2 2012 a group of local business leaders paid 55 million for the paper less than 15 percent of the 515 million spent to buy the papers in 200627 in june 2014 pmn was sold to hf gerry lenfest who appointed cz terry egger as publisher and ceo in october 201528 in 2016 lenfest donated pmn to the philadelphia foundation so that the inquirer its sister newspaper the daily news and their joint website phillycom could remain in philadelphia29 in october 2011 philadelphia media network sold the inquirer building to developer bart blatstein of tower investments inc who intends to turn the complex into a mixeduse complex of offices retail and apartments the next month publisher and ceo gregory j osberg announced that 600 of the 740 philadelphia media network employees of the inquirer daily news and phillycom would move to office space in the former strawbridge clothier department store on east market street the remaining employees would move to offices in the suburbs the philadelphia media network moved to the new location in july 2012 consolidating the offices entirely on the third floor cutbacks had left much of the 525000 square feet 49000 m2 within the inquirer building empty but the 125000squarefoot 12000 m2 east market street location consolidated philadelphia medias departments including the daily news newsroom with the inquirers the new location would include a streetlevel lobby and event room plans for the building also included electronic signage such as a news ticker on the corner of the highrise3031 politicsedit the sign above the entrance to the inquirer building john norvell left the aurora gazette and his job as editor because he disagreed with what he felt was the newspapers editorial approval of a movement towards a european class system when norvell and john walker founded the inquirer they wanted the newspaper to represent all people and not just the higher classes the newly launched newspaper supported jeffersonian democracy and president andrew jackson and it declared support for the right of the minoritys opinion to be heard5 a legend about the founding of the inquirer states that norvell said there could be no better name than the inquirer in a free state there should always be an inquirer asking on behalf of the people why was this done why is that necessary work not done why is that man put forward why is that law proposed why why why32 when norvell and walker sold their newspaper to jesper harding harding kept the paper close to the founders politics and backed the democratic party however disagreeing with andrew jacksons handling of the second bank of the united states he began supporting the antijackson wing of the democrats during the 1836 presidential election harding supported the whig party candidate over the democratic candidate and afterwards the inquirer became known for its support of whig candidates2 before the american civil war began the inquirer supported the preservation of the union and was critical of the antislavery movement which many felt was responsible for the southern succession crisis33 once the war began the inquirer maintained an independent reporting of the wars events5 however the inquirer firmly supported the union side at first the inquirers editors were against emancipation of the slaves but after setbacks by the union army the inquirer started advocating a more prowar and prorepublican stance in a july 1862 article the inquirer wrote in this war there can be but two parties patriots and traitors33 republican bibleedit under james elverson the philadelphia inquirer declared the new inquirer shall be in all respects a complete enterprising progressive newspaper moved by all the wideawake spirit of the time and behind in nothing of interest to people who want to know what is going on every day and everywheresteadily and vigorously republican in its political policy but just and fair in its treatment of all questions5 during the 1900 republican convention in philadelphia elverson set up a large electric banner over broad street that declared philadelphia inquirer – largest republican circulation in the world2 at the turn of the 20th century the newspaper began editorial campaigns to improve philadelphia including the paving of major streets and stopping a corrupt plan to buy the polluted schuylkill canal for drinking water the newspaper continued similar politics under elverson jr and by the 1920s the inquirer became known as the republican bible of pennsylvania5 between 1929 and 1936 while under patenotre and curtismartin the inquirer continued to support the republican party and president herbert hoover noticeably by not reporting on the news of the great depression statistics on unemployment or business closings were ignored even when they came from the government information about philadelphia banks closing was relegated to the back of the financial section when moses annenberg took over the philadelphia inquirer he announced that the paper would continue to uphold the principles of the republican party but in a meeting with newspaper editors shortly after he proposed that the paper go independent and support president franklin d roosevelt in the upcoming election the editors rejected this idea and the paper remained republican in the late 1930s annenberg disagreed with roosevelts new deal programs and his handling of strikes this prompted editorials criticizing the policies of roosevelt and his supporters he strongly opposed democratic pennsylvania governor george earle and had the inquirer support the republican candidates in the 1938 pennsylvania state elections when republicans swept the election there was a celebration at the inquirer headquarters with red flares and the firing of cannons the attacks against democrats and the support given towards republicans caught the attention of the roosevelt administration annenberg had turned the philadelphia inquirer into a major challenger to its chief competitor the democratic record and after annenberg began focusing on politics democratic politicians often attacked annenberg and accused him of illegal business practices in 1939 annenberg was charged with income tax evasion pleaded guilty before the trial and was sent to prison for three years annenbergs friends and his son walter claimed that the whole trial was politically motivated and his sentence was harsher than it should have been8 daily circulation year weekday sunday 19365 280093 369525 1938 345422 1035871 1968 648000 905000 19849 533000

independent newspaper and frustrated with corruption in philadelphia supported democratic candidates in the 1951 election5 while walter annenberg had made the inquirer independent he did use the paper to attack people he disliked sometimes when a person or group angered annenberg they were blacklisted and not mentioned anywhere within the inquirer people on the blacklist were even airbrushed out of images people who were on the list at one point included nicholas katzenbach ralph nader zsa zsa gabor and the basketball team the philadelphia warriors who were not mentioned for an entire season in 1966 walter annenberg used the inquirer to attack pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate milton shapp during a press conference an inquirer reporter asked shapp if he had ever been a patient in a mental hospital having never been a patient shapp said no the next days headline in the inquirer read shapp denies ever having been in a mental home shapp attributed his loss of the election to annenbergs attack campaign8 annenberg was a backer and friend of richard nixon in the 1952 presidential election critics later claimed annenberg had the inquirer look the other way when covering accusations nixon was misappropriating funds later to avoid accusations of political bias annenberg had the inquirer use only news agency sources such as the associated press for the 1960 and 1968 presidential elections8 when nixon was elected president in 1968 annenberg was appointed the us ambassador to the court of st jamess a year later when annenberg sold the newspaper to knight newspapers a part of the deal stipulated that annenbergs name would appear as editor and publisher emeritus in the inquirers masthead in 1970 annenberg already unhappy with changes in the newspaper had his name removed from the paper after an editorial critical of richard nixon appeared5 under knight ridder the inquirer continued to be editorially independent however conservative commentators have labeled the inquirer left leaning3637 and the paper has not endorsed a republican candidate for president of the united states since gerald ford in 19763839 throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century groups supportive of israel such as the zionist organization of america often accused the inquirer of being antiisrael40 at the same time edward s herman a university of pennsylvania media analyst has written many articles accusing the inquirer of having given in to conservative pressure and including a conservative slant in the papers reporting and editorial page41 in 2006 the inquirer became one of the only major united states newspapers to print one of the jyllandsposten muhammad cartoons afterwards protesting the printing of the cartoon muslims picketed outside the inquirer building42 the former strawbridge clothier building at 801 market street where the inquirer and daily news offices are now located when philadelphia media holdings llc pmh bought the paper in 2006 brian p tierney and the business people behind pmh signed a pledge promising that they would not influence the content of the paper tierney a republican activist who had represented many local groups in the philadelphia area had criticized the inquirer in the past on behalf of his clients one of tierneys clients had been the roman catholic archdiocese of philadelphia which he had represented during the cipriano affair pmh membership also included bruce e toll vice chairman of toll brothers inc tierney said that the group was aware that the fastest way to ruin its investment in the inquirer was to threaten the papers editorial independence43 the 2012 sale of philadelphia media network to six local business leaders also led to concern of conflict of interest44 the new owners which included new
