moved with his family over much of the usa while a young child he was brought up from age 11 in madisonville a neighborhood in cincinnati ohio he entered harvard college in 1885 on graduation in 1889 he took a post teaching classics at the college of montana after two years he went to study in france at the école pratique des hautesétudes linked to the sorbonne there he studied pali literature and buddhism for a year then he took a masters degree at harvard including sanskrit harvardedit at this point he moved away from a career as a classical scholar taking a teaching position at williams college in romance languages — just for one year as it turned out he then was offered in 1894 an instructors position again at harvard in french he was to stay at harvard rising from the ranks to become a full professor of french literature in 1912 he is credited with introducing the study of comparative literature there he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 19213 the position of irving babbitt professor of comparative literature was endowed by harvard university in 1960 the national humanities institute runs an irving babbitt project new humanismedit it was in the early 1890s that he first allied himself with paul elmer more in developing the core doctrines that were to constitute what he called the new humanism in 1895 he gave a lecture what is humanism which announced his attack on rousseau at the time babbitt had switched out of classical studies he would later declare his opposition to contemporary textual and philological scholarship associated with german scholarship as a finite task which he was unhappy to see placed above teaching based on what he felt was the eternal moral and spiritual content of literary masterpieces his ideas and mores were characteristically written as short pieces or essays that were later gathered into books babbitts literature and the american college although assembled from writings already circulated caused a stir when published in 1908 he continued to publish in the same vein often denouncing authors from his avowed specialty french literature he also criticized francis bacon and denounced literary naturalism and utilitarianism his central emphasis was on the individual moral character and human reason he put stress on selfdiscipline and the need to control impulses seeking liberation from all restraints he opposed naturalism on the grounds that it emphasizes the dominance of external natural forces over the strength of character and individual conscience4 he denounced romanticism and especially its chief propagator jeanjacques rousseau he warned that rousseau was the chief negative influence over modern culture he opposed overt sentimentalism celebration of human perfection and utopian thinking of romanticism his views were in the tradition of classical preromantic literature democracy and leadershipedit in 1924 babbitt published which is perhaps his bestknown work democracy and leadership the book deals with his political views from his humanistic outlook in it he discussed and criticized political theories which derives from naturalism babbitt criticized two sides of naturalistic thought–mechanistic or utilitarian side propagated by francis bacon and the sentimental side represented by jeanjacques rousseau babbitt attacked both for giving too much importance to forces of nature and unrestrained human passion and impulses while ignoring the fundamental importance of individual conscience and moral character5 he rejected historical deterministic theories from saint augustine to bossuet he stated high moral character as the most important quality of leadership in a democratic society he warned against the dangers of unchecked majoritarianism in democracies6 babbitts political views are in the tradition of classical liberalism from aristotle and edmund burke his book is considered as a classic conservative political work conservative scholars like russell kirk were influenced by babbitt kirk praised the book as one of the few truly important works of political thought his political views originated from his belief in the supreme importance of moral character he rejected sociopolitical activism and sentimentalism as no substitute for individual conscience and character he put stress on individual responsibility and opposed everybodys interference in everybody elses business7 criticism influence and legacyedit he met with increasing criticism down the years those provoked into announcing their opposition included r p blackmur oscar cargill ernest hemingway harold laski sinclair lewis h l mencken joel elias spingarn allen tate and edmund wilson in the case of mencken at least babbitt gave as good as he got he branded menckens writing as intellectual vaudeville a criticism with which posterity has had some sympathy he had an early influence on t s eliot a student of his at harvard eliot in his 1926 essay the humanism of irving babbitt a review of democracy and leadership had become equivocal finding babbitts humanism not sufficiently receptive to christian dogma his position visàvis religion is still debated the identifiable figures of the new humanist movement besides babbitt and more were mostly influenced by babbitt on a personal level and included g r elliott 18831963 norman foerster 18871972 frank jewett mather 18681953 robert shafer 18891956 and stuart pratt sherman 18811926 of these sherman moved away early and foerster a star figure later reconsidered and veered towards the new criticism more peripherally yvor winters and the great books movement are supposed to have taken something from new humanism scholars influenced by babbitt include milton hindus russell kirk nathan pusey peter viereck richard m weaver claes g ryn and george will a relationship has been traced between babbitt and gordon keith chalmers walter lippmann louis mercier and austin warren however claims of influence where it is not acknowledged are not easy to sustain and babbitt was known to advise against public tributes from a position of high prominence in the 1920s having the effective but questionable support of the bookman new humanism experienced a drop from fashionable status after babbitt died in 1933 and modernist and progressive currents became increasingly dominant in american intellectual cultural and political life by the 1940s its enemies pronounced it nearly extinct but babbitt continued to exercise a partly hidden influence and a marked revival of interest was seen in the 1980s and ensuing decades babbitt is often namechecked in discussions on cultural conservatism babbitts influence in china which was notable in the 1930s and 40s is again on the rise with the
