works administration project and us army corps of engineers constructing bonneville power and navigation dam in oregon public works administration pwa part of the new deal of 1933 was a largescale public works construction agency in the united states headed by secretary of the interior harold l ickes it was created by the national industrial recovery act in june 1933 in response to the great depression it built largescale public works such as dams bridges hospitals and schools its goals were to spend 33 billion in the first year and 6 billion in all to provide employment stabilize purchasing power and help revive the economy most of the spending came in two waves in 193335 and again in 1938 originally called the federal emergency administration of public works it was renamed the public works administration in 1935 and shut down in 19441 the pwa spent over 6 billion in contracts to private construction firms that did the actual work it created an infrastructure that generated national and local pride in the 1930s and remains vital seven decades later the pwa was much less controversial than its rival agency with a confusingly similar name the works progress administration wpa headed by harry hopkins which focused on smaller projects and hired unemployed unskilled workers2 contents 1 origins 2 projects 21 list of most notable pwa projects 211 bridges 212

financed public works program and the idea received considerable support from harold l ickes james farley and henry wallace after having scaled back the initial cost of the pwa franklin delano roosevelt agreed to include the pwa as part of his new deal proposals in the hundred days of spring 19333 projectsedit pwafunded construction site in washington dc in 1933 the pwa headquarters in washington planned projects which were built by private construction companies hiring workers on the open market unlike the wpa it did not hire the unemployed directly more than any other new deal program the pwa epitomized the progressive notion of priming the pump to encourage economic recovery between july 1933 and march 1939 the pwa funded and administered the construction of more than 34000 projects including airports large electricitygenerating dams major warships for the navy and bridges as well as 70 of the new schools and onethird of the hospitals built in 1933–1939 streets and highways were the most common pwa projects as 11428 road projects or 33 of all pwa projects accounted for over 15 of its total budget school buildings 7488 in all came in second at 14 of spending pwa functioned chiefly by making allotments to the various federal agencies making loans and grants to state and other public bodies and making loans without grants for a brief time to the railroads for example it provided funds for the indian division of the ccc to build roads bridges and other public works on and near indian reservations fort peck dam in montana spillway construction one of the largest dams in the world it continues to generate electricity in july 1936 its construction employed 10500 workers the pwa became with its multipliereffect and first twoyear budget of 33 billion compared to the entire gdp of 60 billion the driving force of america’s biggest construction effort up to that date by june 1934 the agency had distributed its entire fund to 13266 federal projects and 2407 nonfederal projects for every worker on a pwa project almost two additional workers were employed indirectly the pwa accomplished the electrification of rural america the building of canals tunnels bridges highways streets sewage systems and housing areas as well as hospitals schools and universities every year it consumed roughly half of the concrete and a third of the steel of the entire nation4 the pwa also electrified the pennsylvania railroad between new york and washington dc5 at the local level it built courthouses schools hospitals and other public facilities that remain in use in the 21st century6 list of most notable pwa projectsedit pwa project and army corps of engineers lock dam 10 construction pwa project and army corps of engineers lock dam 16 construction

affordable housing as supporters would have hoped building only 29000 units in  4 1⁄2 years14 criticismedit the pwa spent over 6 billion but did not succeed in returning the level of industrial activity to predepression levels1516 though successful in many aspects it has been acknowledged that the pwas objective of constructing a substantial number of quality affordable housing was a major failure1516 some have argued that because roosevelt was opposed to deficit spending there was not enough money spent to help the pwa achieve its housing goals1516 reeves 1973 argues that the competitive theory of administration used by roosevelt proved to be inefficient and produced delays the competition over the size of expenditure the selection of the administrator and the appointment of staff at the state level led to delays and to the ultimate failure of pwa as a recovery instrument as director of the budget lewis douglas overrode the views of leading senators in reducing appropriations to 35 billion and in transferring much of that money to other agencies in lieu of their own specific appropriations the cautious and penurious ickes won out over the more imaginative hugh s johnson as chief of public works administration political competition between rival democratic state organizations and between democrats and progressive republicans led to delays in implementing pwa efforts on the local level ickes instituted quotas for hiring skilled and unskilled black people in construction financed through the public works administration pwa resistance from employers and unions was partially overcome by negotiations and implied sanctions although results were ambiguous the plan helped provide african americans with employment especially among unskilled workers17 terminationedit when president franklin d roosevelt moved industry toward world war ii production the pwa was abolished and its functions were transferred to the federal works agency in june 194318 contrast with wpaedit the pwa should not be confused with its great rival the works progress administration wpa though both were part of the new deal the wpa headed by harry hopkins engaged in smaller projects in close cooperation with local governments—such as building a city hall or sewers or sidewalks the pwa projects were much larger in scope such as giant dams the wpa hired only people on relief who were paid directly by the federal government the pwa gave contracts to private firms who did all the hiring on the private sector job market the wpa also had youth programs the nya projects for women and arts projects that the pwa did not have19page needed referencesedit national archive records of the public works administration 1351  smith 2006 watkins 1990 george mcjimsey the
