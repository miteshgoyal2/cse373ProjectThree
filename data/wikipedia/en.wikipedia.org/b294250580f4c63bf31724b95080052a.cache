alpine in the mountains what is now california was first settled by various native american tribes before being explored by a number of european expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries the spanish empire then claimed it as part of alta california in their new spain colony the area became a part of mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence but was ceded to the united states in 1848 after the mexican–american war the western portion of alta california then was organized and admitted as the 31st state on september 9 1850 the california gold rush starting in 1848 led

external links etymology main articles etymology of california and island of california the word california originally referred to the baja california peninsula of mexico it was later extended to the entire region composed of the current united states states of california nevada and utah and parts of arizona new mexico texas and wyoming24 the name california is surmised by some writers to have derived from the fictional paradise peopled by black amazons and ruled by queen calafia2526 who fought alongside muslims and whose name was chosen to echo the title of a muslim leader the caliph fictionally implying that california was the caliphate27 the story of calafia is recorded in a 1510 work the adventures of esplandián written as a sequel to amadis de gaula by spanish adventure writer garci rodríguez de montalvo282930 the kingdom of queen calafia according to montalvo was said to be a remote land inhabited by griffins and other strange beasts and rich in gold know ye that at the right hand of the indies there is an island called california very close to that part of the terrestrial paradise which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them and they lived in the manner of amazons they were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue the island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks — chapter clvii of the adventures of esplandián31 when spanish explorer francisco de ulloa was exploring the western coast of north america his initial surveys of the baja california peninsula led him to believe that it was an island rather than part of the larger continent so he dubbed the island after the mythical island in montalvos writing32 this conventional wisdom that california was an island with maps drawn to reflect this belief lasted as late as the 18th century33 shortened forms of the states name include ca cal calif and usca history main article history of california a map of california tribal groups and languages at the time of european contact the first inhabitants settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10000 years although increasing numbers of preclovis finds around the americas indicates humans may have arrived up to 40000 years earlier california was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in precolumbian north america various estimates of the native population range from 100000 to 30000034 the indigenous peoples of california included more than 70 distinct groups of native americans ranging from large settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior most of these peoples were parts of larger ethnolinguistic groups spread across the modern mexicanusa border and californias borders with other states including speakers of utoaztecan athabaskan and salishan languages california groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands tribes villages and on the resourcerich coasts large chiefdoms such as the chumash pomo and salinan trade intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups colonial and spanish periods mission san diego de alcalá drawn as it was in 1848 established in 1769 it was the first of the california missions the russian empire established their largest settlement in california at fort ross in 1812 the first european effort to explore the coast as far north as the russian river was a spanish sailing expedition led by portuguese captain juan rodríguez cabrillo in 1542 some 37 years later english explorer francis drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the california coast in 1579 spanish traders made unintended visits with the manila galleons on their return trips from the philippines beginning in 156535 the first asians to set foot on what would be the united states occurred in 1587 when filipino sailors arrived in spanish ships at morro bay36 sebastián vizcaíno explored and mapped the coast of california in 1602 for new spain despite the ontheground explorations of california in the 16th century rodríguezs idea of california as an island persisted that depiction appeared on many european maps well into the 18th century37 after the portolà expedition of 1769–70 spanish missionaries began setting up 21 california missions on or near the coast of alta upper california beginning in san diego during the same period spanish military forces built several forts presidios and three small towns pueblos the san francisco mission grew into the city of san francisco and two of the pueblos grew into the cities of los angeles and san jose several other smaller cities and towns also sprang up surrounding the various spanish missions and pueblos which remain to this day the spanish colonization began the genocide of the indigenous californian peoples decimating their numbers through epidemics of various diseases for which the indigenous peoples had no natural immunity such as measles and diphtheria38 the establishment of the spanish systems of government and social structure which the spanish settlers had brought with them also technologically and culturally overwhelmed the societies of the earlier indigenous peoples during this same period russian ships also explored along the california coast and in 1812 established a trading post at fort ross russias early 19thcentury coastal settlements in california were positioned just north of the northernmost edge of the area of spanish settlement in san francisco bay and were the southernmost russian settlements in north america the russian settlements associated with fort ross were spread over an area stretching from point arena to tomales bay39 california under mexican rule map showing alta california in 1838 when it was a sparsely populated mexican province40 in 1821 the mexican war of independence gave mexico including california independence from spain for the next 25 years alta california remained as a remote sparsely populated northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of mexico cattle ranches or ranchos emerged as the dominant institutions of mexican california soon after mexican independence from spain the chain of missions became the property of the mexican government and were secularized by 183441 the ranchos developed under ownership by californios spanishspeaking californians who had received land grants and traded cowhides and tallow with boston merchants from the 1820s trappers and settlers from the united states and the future canada arrived in northern california these new arrivals used the siskiyou trail california trail oregon trail and old spanish trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding california the early government of the newly independent mexico was highly unstable and in a reflection of this from 1831 onwards california also experienced a series of armed disputes both between regional areas and also revolts against the central mexican government42 during this tumultuous political period juan bautista alvarado was able to secure the governorship from 1836 184243 the military action which first brought alvarado to power had momentarily declared california to be an independent state and had been aided by american and british residents of california44 including isaac graham45 in 1840 one hundred of those residents who did not have passports were arrested leading to the graham affair44 one of the largest ranchers in california was john marsh after failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the mexican courts he determined that california should become part of the united states marsh conducted a letterwriting campaign espousing the california climate soil and other reasons to settle there as well as the best route to follow which became known as marshs route his letters were read reread passed around and printed in newspapers throughout the country and started the first wagon trains rolling to california46 he invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled and assisted in their obtaining passports47 after ushering in the period of organized emigration to california marsh helped end the rule of the last mexican governor of california thereby paving the way to californias ultimate acquisition by the united states48 california republic and american invasion the original of todds bear flag photographed in 1890 in 1846 a group of american settlers in and around sonoma rebelled against mexican rule during the bear flag revolt afterwards rebels raised the bear flag featuring a bear a star a red stripe and the words california republic at sonoma the republics only president was william b ide49 who played a pivotal role during the bear flag revolt this revolt by american settlers served as a prelude to the later american military invasion of california and was closely coordinated with nearby american military commanders the california republic was short lived50 the same year marked the outbreak of the mexican–american war 1846–4851 when commodore john d sloat of the united states navy sailed into monterey bay and began the military occupation of california by the united states northern california capitulated in less than a month to the united states forces52 after a series of defensive battles in southern california the treaty of cahuenga was signed by the californios on january 13 1847 securing american control in california53

guadalupe hidalgo that ended the war the westernmost portion of the old mexican territory of alta california soon became the american state of california and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new american territories of arizona nevada colorado and utah the lightly populated and arid lower region of old baja california remained as a part of mexico in 1846 the total settler population of the western part of the old alta california had been estimated to be no more than 8000 plus about 100000 native americans down from about 300000 before hispanic settlement in 176954 in 1848 only one week before the official american annexation of the area gold was discovered in california this being an event which was to forever alter both the states demographics and its finances soon afterwards a massive influx in immigration into the area resulted as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands the population burgeoned with united states citizens europeans chinese and other immigrants during the great california gold rush by the time of californias application to the us congress for statehood in 1850 the settler population of california had multiplied to 100000 by 1854 over 300000 settlers had come55 between 1847 and 1870 the population of san francisco increased from 500 to 15000056 california was suddenly no longer a sparsely populated backwater but seemingly overnight it had grown into a major us population center the seat of government for california under spanish and later mexican rule had been located in monterey from 1777 until 184541 pio pico last mexican governor of alta california had briefly moved the capital to los angeles in 1845 the united states consulate had also been located in monterey under consul thomas o larkin in 1849 a state constitutional convention was first held in monterey among the first tasks of the convention was a decision on a location for the new state capital the first full legislative sessions were held in san jose 1850–1851 subsequent locations included vallejo 1852–1853 and nearby benicia 1853–1854 these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well the capital has been located in sacramento since 185457 with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in san francisco due to flooding in sacramento once the states constitutional convention had finalized its state constitution it applied to the us congress for admission to statehood on september 9 1850 as part of the compromise of 1850 california was officially admitted into the united states as an undivided free state its status as a free state prevented the expansion of slavery to the pacific coast which question was then a foremost concern for the precivil war us congress within the state of california sept 9th remains as an annually celebrated legal holiday known as california admission day during the american civil war 18611865 california was able to send gold shipments eastwards to washington in support of the union cause58 however due to the existence of a large contingent of prosouth sympathasizers within the state the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the union war effort still several smaller military units within the union army were unofficially associated with the state of california such as the california 100 company due to a majority of their members being from california at the time of californias admission into the union travel between california and the rest of the continental united states had been a time consuming and dangerous feat nineteen years afterwards and shortly after the conclusion of the civil war in 1869 a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the first transcontinental railroad at promontory summit utah once completed hundreds of thousands of united states citizens were enabled to easily migrate westwards into the state upon their arrival in california the new californians were able to discover that if irrigated during the dry summer months that much of california was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general vast expanses of wheat other cereal crops vegetable crops cotton and nut and fruit trees were grown including oranges in southern california and the foundation was laid for the states prodigious agricultural production in the central valley and elsewhere indigenous peoples under early american administration group of california indigenous people under earlier spanish and mexican rule californias original native population had precipitously declined above all from eurasian diseases to which the indigenous people of california had not yet developed a natural immunity59 under its new american administration californias harsh governmental policies towards its own indigenous people did not improve as in other american states many of the native inhabitants were soon forcibly removed from their lands by incoming american settlers such as miners ranchers and farmers although california had entered the american union as a free state the loitering or orphaned indians were de facto enslaved by their new angloamerican masters under the 1853 act for the government and protection of indians60 there were also massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed between 1850 and 1860 the california state government paid around 15 million dollars some 250000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government61 to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations in later decades the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them60 as a result the rise of california was a calamity for the native inhabitants several scholars and native american activists including benjamin madley and ed castillo have described the actions of the california government as a genocide62 20th century hollywood film studios 1922 the birthplace of silicon valley garage where stanford university graduates william hewlett and david packard developed their first product in the 1930s migration to california accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the lincoln highway and route 66 in the period from 1900 to 1965 the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the union in 1940 the census bureau reported californias population as 60 hispanic 24 asian and 895 nonhispanic white63 to meet the populations needs major engineering feats like the california and los angeles aqueducts the oroville and shasta dams and the bay and golden gate bridges were built across the state the state government also adopted the california master plan for higher education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education meanwhile attracted to the mild mediterranean climate cheap land and the states wide variety of geography filmmakers established the studio system in hollywood in the 1920s california manufactured 87 percent of total united states military armaments produced during world war ii ranking third behind new york and michigan among the 48 states64 california however easily ranked 1st in production of military ships during the war transport cargo merchant ships such as liberty ships victory ships and warships at drydock facilities in san diego los angeles and the san francisco bay area65666768 after world war ii californias economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries69 whose size decreased following the end of the cold war6970 stanford university and its dean of engineering frederick terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in california instead of leaving the state and develop a hightech region in the area now known as silicon valley71 as a result of these efforts california is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries of technology engineering and the aerospace industry and as the united states center of agricultural production72 just before the dot com bust california had the 5th largest economy in the world among nations73 yet since 1991 and starting in the late 1980s in southern california california has seen a net loss of domestic migrants most years this is often referred to by the media as the california exodus74 during the 20th

middle of the state lies the california central valley bounded by the sierra nevada in the east the coastal mountain ranges in the west the cascade range to the north and by the tehachapi mountains in the south the central valley is californias productive agricultural heartland divided in two by the sacramentosan joaquin river delta the northern portion the sacramento valley serves as the watershed of the sacramento river while the southern portion the san joaquin valley is the watershed for the san joaquin river both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them with dredging the sacramento and the san joaquin rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports the sacramentosan joaquin river delta is a critical water supply hub for the state water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state to the central valley and the state water projects and other needs water from the delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people almost twothirds of the states population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the san joaquin valley suisun bay

being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the united states and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the north american continent even the san diego shoreline bordering mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous united states just a few miles inland summer temperature extremes are significantly higher with downtown los angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast the same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the bay area where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas that are close to the ocean northern parts of the state have more rain than the south californias mountain ranges also influence the climate some of the rainiest parts of the state are westfacing mountain slopes northwestern california has a temperate climate and the central valley has a mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast the high mountains including the sierra nevada have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer californias mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side creating extensive deserts the higher elevation deserts of eastern california have hot summers and cold winters while the low deserts east of the southern california mountains have hot summers and nearly

country than immigrating126 as a result it is projected that hispanic citizens will constitute 49 of the population by 2060 instead of the previously projected 2050 due primarily to domestic births126128 the states population of undocumented immigrants has been shrinking in recent years due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for lowerskilled workers129 the number of
