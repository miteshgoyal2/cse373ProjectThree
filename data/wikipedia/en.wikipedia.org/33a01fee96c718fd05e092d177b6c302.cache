representatives of the commonwealth of pennsylvaniaby the authority of the same that the said town of pittsburgh shall beerected into a borough which shall be called the borough of pittsburgh for ever21 the current pronunciation which is extremely unusual in english speaking countries is almost certainly a result of a printing error in some copies of the city charter of march 18 1816 though not on the original document the error was repeated commonly enough throughout the rest of the 19th century that the original pronunciation was lost and in 1890 the h was removed in order to make it easier to spell after a public campaign the original spelling was officially restored by the united states board on geographic names in 191121 the area of the ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the shawnee and several other settled groups of native americans22 the first known european to enter the region was the french explorertrader robert de la salle from quebec during his 1669 expedition down

having higher amounts of yearround particle pollution than pittsburgh for ozone smog pollution pittsburgh was ranked 24th among us metro areas6667 the area has improved its air quality with every annual survey the alas rankings have been disputed by the allegheny county health department achd since data from only the worst of the regions 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ala without any context or averaging the lone monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to us steels clairton coke works the nations largest coke mill and several municipalities outside the citys jurisdiction of pollution controls leading to possible confusion that pittsburgh itself is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey68 the regions readings also reflect pollution swept in from ohio and west virginia though both are outside the jurisdictional powers of local leadership69 although the county was still below the pass threshold the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009 and just 10 between 2008 and 2010 compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 199970
