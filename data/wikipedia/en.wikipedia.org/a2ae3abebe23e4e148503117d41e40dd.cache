jones an inspiration was the jacksons hit this place hotel early titles include starlight34 starlight sun and give me some starlight the title was changed to thriller after michael told temperton he wanted something that would appeal to kids5 while still titled starlight the songs hook lyrics were give me some starlight starlight sun but after the song was changed to thriller the hook was rewritten to cause this is thriller thriller night6 temperton commented originally when i did my thriller demo i called it starlight quincy said to me you managed to come up with a title for the last album see what you can do for this album i said oh great so i went back to the hotel wrote two or three hundred titles and came up with the title midnight man the next morning i woke up and i just said this word something in my head just said this is the title you could visualize it on the top of the billboard charts you could see the merchandising for this one word how it jumped off the page as thriller4 while temperton was writing thriller he stated that hed always envisioned a talking section at the end on the song but did not really know what to do with it until deciding to have somebody a famous voice in the horror genre to do this vocal4 jones thenwife peggy lipton who knew vincent price suggested price for the vocal part which price agreed to do4 thriller is considered a discofunk song7 set in the key of c♯ modern doriancitation needed its instrumentation consists of synthesizer guitar trumpet flugelhorn saxophone flute and trombone the song has a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute8 the lyrics and sound effects on thriller pertain to frightful elements and themes9 recording and productionedit quincy jones produced thriller thriller along with other songs from thriller was recorded by jackson over the course of eight weeks10 in 1982 jackson recorded the song at westlake recording studios on santa monica boulevard in los angeles california4 bruce swedien the songs engineer said of the song being recorded when we started thriller the first day at westlake we were all there and quincy jones the producer walked in followed by me and michael and rod temperton and some of the other people quincy turned to us and he said ok guys were here to save the recording industry now thats a pretty big responsibility – but he meant it and thats why those albums and especially thriller sound so incredible the basic thing is everybody who was involved gave 150 percent … quincys like a director of a movie and im like a director of photography and its quincys job to cast it quincy can find the people and he gives us the inspiration to do what we do4 swedien and jones stated that vincent price recorded his introduction and voiceover rap for the song in two takes jones acknowledging that doing a voiceover for a song is difficult praised price and described his recording takes as being fabulous4 swedien said of jackson recording the song that i tried all sorts of things with michael – for instance he would sing the main vocal part and wed double it one time and then id ask him to step away from the mic and do it a third time and that really changed the acoustics in the room so it gave michaels vocals a unique character … we recorded some of those background vocals in the shower stall at westlake4 throughout the song sound effects such as a creaking door thunder feet walking on wooden planks winds and howling dogs can be heard bruce cannon a sound effects editor for thriller said that things like the lightning may have come from old hollywood movies – well never know which movies – but the best soundeffects editors do go out in the desert and find a coyote so i have a feeling that was a real howl4 the backing track especially the bassline has certain similarities to the 1981 numberone rb hit give it to me baby by rick james11 the bass part was made from two modified minimoogs playing in unison12 critical receptionedit thriller is a contemporary critical favourite ashley lasimone of aols spinnercom noted that it became a signature for jackson and described the groove of its bassline paired with michaels killer vocals and sleek moves as having produced a frighteningly great single13 jon pareles of the new york times noted that billie jean beat it wanna be startin somethin and the movie in the song thriller were the songs unlike the fluff pyt that were the hits that made thriller a worldbeater along with mr jacksons stage and video presence listeners must have identified with his willingness to admit terror14 ann powers of the los angeles times described thriller as adequately groovy with a funkedout beat and lyrics seemingly lifted from some little kids scary storybook15 50 cent told nme that the song is the one he wished hed written i had his poster on my wall he had me moonwalkin around my bedroom id love to have written any michael jackson song so maybe start with one of the greatest16 chart

reentered the billboard hot 100 at number 4239 music videoedit main article michael jacksons thriller music video in his 1988 book moonwalk jackson expressed interest in having director john landis direct the music video for thriller having seen landis previous work on the horror film an american werewolf in london jackson envisioned the main character of his short film to undergo similar transitions parallel to those of the characters in landis horror film hence landis was asked to direct the video seeing as michael felt he would make the best fit towards properly conveying his personal concepts for the short feature film40 landis accepted jackson’s invitation and production began soon thereafter filming in various locations in new york and los angeles contrary to reports of 80000041 to 1 million production budgets landis stated that the music video was made for 50000042 within the same excerpt of moonwalk jackson noted how he personally financed much of the short film for thriller out of his own pocket due to all the technical details of production and the nature of the video the budget nearly doubled in costs john branca—jacksons attorney and advisor—suggested creating a documentary outlining the process of creating the short film the behindthescenes documentary was aimed towards seeking a thirdparty sponsor to finance the project and thus alleviate some of the costs of the doubled budget the documentary was entitled the making of thriller and achieved significant sales among audiences40 jackson also said of making the music video in an interview that aired on december 11 1999 for mtvs 100 greatest videos ever made my idea was to make this short film with conversation i like having a beginning and a middle and an ending which would follow a story im very much involved in complete making and creating of the piece it has to be you know my soul usually you know its an interpretation of the music it was a delicate thing to work on because i remember my original approach was how do you make zombies and monsters dance without it being comical so i said we have to do just the right kind of movement so it doesnt become something that you laugh at but it just has to take it to another level so i got in a room with choreographer michael peters and he and i together kind of imagined how these zombies move by making faces in the mirror i used to come to rehearsal sometimes with monster makeup on and i loved doing that so he and i collaborated and we both choreographed the piece and i thought it should start like that kind of thing and go into this jazzy kind of step you know kind of gruesome things like that not too much ballet or whatever43 the music video of the song also included on the video albums video greatest hits history history on film volume ii number ones on the bonus dvd of thriller 25 and michael jacksons vision following the release of the music video a 45minute documentary was released that provided candid glimpses behind the scenes of the music videos production42 entitled making michael jacksons thriller it like the music video was shown heavily on mtv for a time42 and was the topselling homevideo release of all time at one point with over nine million copies sold44 mtv paid 250000 for the exclusive rights to show the documentary showtime paid 300000 for paycable rights and vestron video reportedly paid 500000 to market the cassette in a profit participation agreement4245 conceptedit set in the 1950s michael and his unnamed date ola ray run out of gas near a dark wooded area they walk off into the forest and michael asks her if she would be his girl she accepts and he gives her a ring he warns her however that he is different a full moon appears and michael begins convulsing in agony transforming into a werewolf41 his date runs away in terror but the werecat catches up to her knocking her down and begins lunging at her with his claws he also knocks down a tree the scene then cuts to a modernday movie theater where michael and his date along with a repulsed audience are actually watching the scene unfold in a movie called thriller michaels date leaves the theater as michael hands his popcorn to a stranger catches up to her and assures her that its only a movie some debate follows as to whether or not she was scared by the movie they then walk down a foggy road as michael teases her by singing the verses of thriller they pass a nearby graveyard in which zombies begin to rise out of their caskets as vincent price performs his soliloquy the zombies corner michael and his date threateningly and suddenly michael becomes a zombie himself the zombies then break into an elaborate song and dance number41 followed by the main chorus of thriller during which michael was reverted to human form frightening his date to the point where she runs for cover michael turned back into a zombie and his fellow corpses then back the frightened girl into the corner of a nearby abandoned house michael then reaches for his dates throat as she lets out a bloodcurdling scream only to awake and realize it was all a dream michael then offers to take her home and she happily obliges as they walk out of the house michael turns around and looks at the camera thus revealing his yellow werewolf eyes and fangs from the beginning of the video as we hear vincent prices haunting laugh while michael grins41 receptionedit leah greenblatt of entertainment weekly commented on the music video every aspect of the 14minute horror musical directed with creepycomical zest by john
