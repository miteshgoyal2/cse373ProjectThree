transit systems los angeles expansion of mass transit has been driven in large part by light rail light rail light rail transit lrt or fast tram is urban public transport using rolling stock similar to a tramway but operating at a higher capacity and often on an exclusive rightofway utah transit authoritys trax is one of the fastest growing light rail systems in the united states with nearly a quarter million riders served each day bostons mbta green line is the busiest light rail system in the united states there is no standard definition but in the united states where the terminology was devised in the 1970s from the engineering term light railway light rail operates primarily along exclusive rightsofway and uses either individual tramcars or multiple units coupled to form a train that is lower capacity and lower speed than a long heavy passenger train or metro system12345 a few light rail networks tend to have characteristics closer to rapid transit or even commuter rail some of these heavier rapid transitlike systems are referred to as light metros other light rail networks are tramlike in nature and partially operate on streets light rail systems are found throughout the

ontario6 many original tram and streetcar systems in the united kingdom united states and elsewhere were decommissioned starting in the 1950s as the popularity of the automobile increased britain abandoned its last tram system except for blackpool by 19627 although some traditional trolley or tram systems exist to this day the term light rail has come to mean a different type of rail system modern light rail technology has primarily west german origins since an attempt by boeing vertol to introduce a new american light rail vehicle was a technical failure after world war ii the germans retained many of their streetcar networks and evolved them into model light rail systems stadtbahnen except for hamburg all large and most mediumsized german cities maintain light rail networks8 the basic concepts of light rail were put forward by h dean quinby in 1962 in an article in traffic quarterly called major urban corridor facilities a new concept quinby distinguished this new concept in rail transportation from historic streetcar or tram systems as having the capacity to carry more passengers appearing like a train with more than one car connected together having more doors to facilitate full utilization of the space faster and quieter in operation the term light rail transit lrt was introduced in north america in 1972 to describe this new concept of rail transportation9 the first of the new light rail systems in north america began operation in 1978 when the canadian city of edmonton alberta adopted the german siemensduewag u2 system followed three years later by calgary alberta and san diego california the concept proved popular and although canada has few cities big enough for light rail there are now at least 30 light rail systems in the united states britain began replacing its rundown local railways with light rail in the 1980s starting with the tyne and wear metro and followed by the docklands light railway dlr in london the historic term light railway was used because it dated from the british light railways act 1896 although the technology used in the dlr system was at the high end of what americans considered to be light rail the trend to light rail in the united kingdom was firmly established with the success of the manchester metrolink system in 1992 definitionedit see also passenger rail terminology edmonton light rail transit in edmonton alberta canada was the first modern lrt line in north america the metrolink light rail in st louis missouri united states the buenos aires premetro built in 1987 the term light rail was coined in 1972 by the us urban mass transportation administration umta the precursor to the federal transit administration to describe new streetcar transformations that were taking place in europe and the united states in germany the term stadtbahn to be distinguished from sbahn which stands for stadtschnellbahn was used to describe the concept and many in umta wanted to adopt the direct translation which is city rail the norwegian term bybane means the same however umta finally adopted the term light rail instead10 light in this context is used in the sense of intended for light loads and fast movement rather than referring to physical weight the infrastructure investment is also usually lighter than would be found for a heavy rail system the transportation research board transportation systems center defined light rail in 1977 as a mode of urban transportation utilizing predominantly reserved but not necessarily gradeseparated rightsofway electrically propelled rail vehicles operate singly or in trains lrt provides a wide range of passenger capabilities and performance characteristics at moderate costs the american public transportation association apta in its glossary of transit terminology defines light rail as a mode of transit service also called streetcar tramway or trolley operating passenger rail cars singly or in short usually twocar or threecar trains on fixed rails in rightofway that is often separated from other traffic for part or much of the way light rail vehicles are typically driven electrically with power being drawn from an overhead electric line via a trolley pole or a pantograph driven by an operator on board the vehicle and may have either high platform loading or low level boarding using steps1 however some dieselpowered transit is designated light rail such as the otrain trillium line in ottawa canada the river line in new jersey united states and the sprinter in california united states which use diesel multiple unit dmu cars light rail is similar to the british english term light railway longused to distinguish railway operations carried out under a less rigorous set of regulation using lighter equipment at lower speeds from mainline railways light rail is a generic international english phrase for these types of rail systems which means more or less the same thing throughout the englishspeaking world the use of the generic term light rail avoids some serious incompatibilities between british and american english the word tram for instance is generally used in the uk and many former british colonies to refer to what is known in north america as a streetcar but in north america tram can instead refer to an aerial tramway11 or in the case of the disney amusement parks even a land train12 the usual british term for an aerial tramway is cable car which in the us usually refers to a groundlevel car pulled along by subterranean cables the word trolley is often used as a synonym for streetcar in the united states but is usually taken to mean a cart particularly a shopping cart in the uk and elsewhere13 many north american transportation planners reserve streetcar for traditional vehicles that operate exclusively in mixed traffic on city streets while they use light rail to refer to more modern vehicles operating mostly in exclusive rights of way since they may operate both sidebyside targeted at different passenger groups14 the difference between british english and american english terminology arose in the late 19th century when americans adopted the term street railway rather than tramway with the vehicles being called streetcars rather than trams some have suggested that the americans preference for the term street railway at that time was influenced by german emigrants to the united states15 who were more numerous than british immigrants in the industrialized northeast as it is the same as the german term for the mode straßenbahn meaning street railway a further difference arose because while britain abandoned all of its trams except blackpool after world war ii seven major north american cities toronto boston philadelphia san francisco pittsburgh newark and new orleans continued to operate large streetcar systems16 when these cities upgraded to new technology they called it light rail to differentiate it from their existing streetcars since some continued to operate both the old and new systems since the 1980s portland oregon has built all three types of system a highcapacity light rail system in dedicated lanes and rightsofway a lowcapacity streetcar system integrated with street traffic and an aerial tram system septas 101 trolley pulling into 69th street terminal the opposite phrase heavy rail used for highercapacity higherspeed systems also avoids some incompatibilities in terminology between british and american english as for instance in comparing the london underground and the new york city subway conventional rail technologies including highspeed freight commuterregional and metrosubwayelevated urban transit systems are considered heavy rail people movers and personal rapid transit are even lighter at least in terms of capacity monorail is a separate technology that has been more successful in specialized services than in a commuter transit role typesedit metrolink in manchester city centre england is an example of streetlevel light rail the docklands light railway in london england is an example of light rail separated from road traffic like most light rail systems the tranvia de tenerife tenerife spain includes some operation at street level but separated from other traffic due to varying definitions it is hard to distinguish between what is called light rail and other forms of urban and commuter rail a system described as light rail in one city may be considered to be a streetcar or tram system in another conversely some lines that are called light rail are in fact very similar to rapid transit in recent years new terms such as light metro have been used to describe these mediumcapacity systems some light rail systems such as sprinter bear little similarity to urban rail and could alternatively be classified as commuter rail or even intercity rail in the united states light rail has become a catchall term to describe a wide variety of passenger rail systems there is a significant difference in cost between these different classes of light rail transit tramlike systems are often less expensive than metrolike systems by a factor of two or more lower capacityedit the most difficult distinction to draw is that between light rail and streetcar or tram systems there is a significant amount of overlap between the technologies many of the same vehicles can be used for either and it is common to classify streetcars or trams as a subcategory of light rail rather than as a distinct type of transportation the two general versions are the traditional type where tracks and trains run along the streets and share space with road traffic stops tend to be very frequent but little effort is made to set up special stations because space is shared the tracks are usually visually unobtrusive a more modern variation where the trains tend to run along their own rightofway separated from road traffic stops are generally less frequent and the vehicles are often boarded from a platform tracks are highly visible and in some cases significant effort is expended to keep traffic away through the use of special signaling level crossings with gate arms or even a complete separation with nonlevel crossings higher capacityedit sydneys dulwich hill line is a line consisting of both conventional track and a short onstreet section at the highest degree of separation it can be difficult to draw the line between light rail and metros as in the case of wuppertals schwebebahn hanging rail system the d branch of bostons green line or londons docklands light railway which would likely not be considered light were it not for the contrast between it and the london underground these may be considered to be light metro lines rather than light rail lines in europe however the term light rail is increasingly used to describe any rapid transit system with a fairly low frequency or short trains compared to heavier mass rapid systems such as the london underground or singapores mass rapid transit for instance the lrt1 and mrt3 in manila are often referred to as light rail despite being fully segregated mostly elevated railways this phenomenon is quite common in chinese cities where elevated light metro lines in shanghai wuhan and dalian are called light rail lines in north america such systems are not considered light rail mixed systemsedit many systems have mixed characteristics indeed with proper engineering a rail line could run along a street then go underground and then run along an elevated viaduct for example the los angeles metro rails gold line light rail has sections that could alternatively be described as a tramway a light metro and in a narrow sense rapid transit this is especially common in the united states where there is not a popularly perceived distinction between these different types of urban rail systems it is even possible to have highfloor rapid transit cars run along a street like a tram this is known as street running speed and stop frequencyedit in some areas light rail may also refer to any rail line with frequent low speeds or many stops in a short distance this inherits the old definition of light railway in the uk hong kongs light rail is an example of this although it is also called light rail because it is a lowerscale system than the rest of the mtr sprinter in the san diego area uses dmus and is targeted towards a commuter rail audience however because of the large number of stops along the line it is called light rail reference speed from major light rail systems including station stop time is shown below17 system average speed mph baltimore 24 dallas red line 21 dallas blue line 19 denver alamedalittleton 38 denver downtownlittleton 26 los angeles blue line 24 los angeles green line 38 salt lake city 24 however low top speed is not always a differentiating characteristic between light rail and other systems for example the siemens s70 lrvs used in the houston metrorail and other north american lrt systems have a top speed of 106 kilometres per hour 66 mph while the trains on the allunderground montreal metro can only reach a top speed of 72 kilometres per hour 45 mph los angeles metro light rail vehicles have higher top and average speeds than montreal metro or new york city subway trains18 the main difference is that montreal metro and new york city subway trains carry far more passengers than any north american lrt system and the trains have faster acceleration making stationtostation times relatively short in their densely populated urban areas most light rail systems serve less densely populated cities and suburbs where passenger traffic is not high but low cost combined with high top speed may be important to compete with automobiles systemwide considerationsedit many light rail systems—even fairly old ones—have a combination of both on and offroad sections in some countries especially in europe only the latter is described as light rail in those places trams running on mixed rightsofway are not regarded as light rail but considered distinctly as streetcars or trams however the requirement for saying that a rail line is separated can be quite low—sometimes just with concrete buttons to discourage automobile drivers from getting onto the tracks some systems such as seattles link are truly mixed but closed to traffic with light rail vehicles and traditional buses both operating along a common rightofway some systems such as the airtrain jfk in new york city the dlr in london and kelana jaya line in kuala lumpur malaysia have dispensed with the need for an operator the vancouver skytrain was an early adopter of driverless vehicles while the toronto scarborough rapid transit operates the same trains as vancouver but uses drivers in most discussions and comparisons these specialized systems are generally not considered light rail track gaugeedit historically the track gauge has had considerable variations with narrow gauge common in many early systems however most light rail systems are now standard gauge8 older standardgauge vehicles could not negotiate sharp turns as easily as narrowgauge ones but modern light rail systems achieve tighter turning radii by using articulated cars an important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it rather than custombuilt machinery using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be moved around conveniently using the same tracks as freight railways another factor favoring standard gauge is that accessibility laws are making lowfloor trams mandatory and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrowgauge layout furthermore standardgauge rolling stock can be switched between networks either temporarily or permanently and both newly built and used standardgauge rolling stock tends to be cheaper to buy as more companies offer such vehicles comparison to other rail transit modesedit with its mix of rightofway types and train control technologies lrt offers the widest range of latitude of any rail system in the design engineering and operating practices the challenge in designing light rail systems is to realize the potential of lrt to provide fast comfortable service while avoiding the tendency to overdesign that results in excessive capital costs beyond what is necessary to meet the publics needs19 alternative differences rapid transit light rail vehicles lrvs are distinguished from rapid rail transit rrt vehicles by their capability for operation in mixed traffic generally resulting in a narrower car body and articulation in order to operate in a street traffic environment with their large size large turning radius and often an electrified third rail rrt vehicles cannot operate in the street since lrt systems can operate in existing streets they can often avoid the cost of expensive gradeseparated subway and elevated segments that would be required with rrt streetcars or trams conversely lrvs generally outperform traditional streetcars in terms of capacity and topend speed and almost all modern lrvs are capable of multipleunit operation the latest generation of lrvs is considerably larger and faster typically 29 metres 95 ft long with a maximum speed of around 105 kilometres per hour 65 mph20 heritage streetcars a variation considered by many cities is to use historic or replica cars on their streetcar systems instead of modern lrvs a heritage streetcar may not have the capacity and speed of an lrv but it will add to the ambiance and historic character of its location light metro a derivative of lrt is light rail rapid transit lrrt also referred to as light metro such railways are characterized by exclusive rights of way advanced train control systems short headway capability and floorlevel boarding these systems approach the passenger capacity of full metro systems but can be cheaper to construct due to lrvs generally being smaller in size turning tighter curves and climbing steeper grades than standard rrt vehicles and having a smaller station size interurbans the term interurban mainly refers to rail cars that run through streets like ordinary streetcars trams but also between cities or towns often through rural environments in the period 1900–1930 interurbans were very common in the us especially in the midwest some of them like the red devils the j g brill bullets and the electroliners were the highspeed railcars of their time with an inservice speed of up to about 145 kmh 90 mph in europe interurbans are making a comeback as tramtrains locally known under different names that operate on both railway and light rail tracks often with different voltage the karlsruhe stadtbahn is one well known example typical rolling stockedit the bart railcar in the following chart is not generally considered to be a light rail vehicle it is

typical consist 4–10 vehicles 2–5 vehicles 1 vehicle 1 vehicle train operationedit for more details on this topic see automatic train operation an important factor crucial to lrt is the train operator unlike rail rapid transit which can travel unattended under automatic train operation ato safe highquality lrt operation relies on a human operator as a key element the reason that the operator is so important is because the train tracks often share the streets with automobiles other vehicles and pedestrians if trains were fully automated on roads nobody would be there to stop the train if a car pulled in front of it light rail trains are actually very sturdily built for passenger safety and to reduce damage from impacts with carscitation needed floor heightedit for more details on this topic see low floor the latest generation of lrvs has the advantage of partially or fully lowfloor design with the floor of the vehicles only 300 to 360 mm 118 to 142 in above the top of the rail a feature not found in either rapid rail transit vehicles or streetcars this allows them to load passengers including those in wheelchairs or strollers directly from lowrise platforms that are little more than raised sidewalks this satisfies requirements to provide access to disabled passengers without using expensive and delayinducing wheelchair lifts while also making boarding faster and easier for other passengerscitation needed power sourcesedit overhead lines supply electricity to the vast majority of light rail systems this avoids the danger of passengers stepping on an electrified third rail the docklands light railway uses an inverted third rail for its electrical power which allows the electrified rail to be covered and the power drawn from the underside trams in bordeaux france use a special thirdrail configuration where the power is only switched on beneath the trams making it safe on city streets several systems in europe and a few recently opened systems in north america use dieselpowered trainscitation needed tram and other light rail transit systems worldwideedit the tren de la costa in greater buenos aires main articles tram and light rail transit systems and list of tram and light rail transit systems around the world there are many tram and streetcar systems some date from the beginning of the 20th century or earlier but many of the original tram and streetcar systems were closed down in the mid20th century with the exceptions of many eastern europe countries even though many systems closed down over the years there are still a number of tram systems that have been operating much as they did when they were first built over a century ago some cities such as los angeles and jersey city that once closed down their streetcar networks are now restoring or have already rebuilt at least some of their former streetcartram systems most light rail services are currently committed to articulated vehicles like modern lrvs ie trams with the exception of large underground metro or rapid transit systems metrotram in kryvyi rih ukraine was separated from the streets but later it was upgraded to be compatible with common tramways capacityedit a crystal mover lrt train on boarding efficiencyedit the table below illustrates the capacity of a light rail train the siemens s70 compared to that of a standard car with five seats the average length of a standard fiveseat car is about 474 metres the length of a siemens s70 light rail vehicle is 277 meters approximately the same length as 58 cars the maximum occupancy of a fiveseat automobile car is five people the maximum capacity of the siemens s70 is 220 people this means that one metre in a car has a capacity of one person and one metre in a light rail vehicle has a capacity of almost eight persons so the capacity of light rail is about eight times as high as that of an average consumer car if only the length of the vehicles is taken into consideration the average width of an automobile is about 177 metres while the average width of the siemens s70 is about 27 metres the area of an average consumer car is about 84 m² while the area taken up by a light rail car is about 748 m² in an automobile car each square metre has room for only 06 persons while each square metre in a light rail car has room for 29 persons this means that a light rail vehicle is significantly more capacityeffective than a consumer car is height is not taken into consideration because it is not normally a problem given minimumclearance regulations for underpasses length width area maximum passengers passenger density

circumstances23 comparison with high capacity roadsedit while the table above compares the maximum capacity of each mode the average use of a lane might be quite different based on a number of factors one line of light rail requires 25 right of way has a theoretical capacity of up to 8 times more than one 12 lane of freeway not counting buses during peak times roads have ultimate capacity limits that can be determined by traffic engineering they usually experience a chaotic breakdown in flow and a dramatic drop in speed colloquially known as a traffic jam if they exceed about 2000 vehicles per hour per lane each car roughly two seconds behind another24 since most people who drive to work or on business trips do so alone studies show that the average car occupancy on many roads carrying commuters is only about 15 people per car during the highdemand rush hour periods of the day25 this combination of factors limits roads carrying only automobile commuters to a maximum observed capacity of about 3000 passengers per hour per lane the problem can be mitigated by introducing highoccupancy vehicle hov lanes and ridesharing programs but in most cases the solution adopted has been to add more lanes to the roads by contrast light rail vehicles can travel in multicar trains carrying a theoretical ridership up to 20000 passengers per hour in much narrower rightsofway not much more than two car lanes wide for a double track system26 they can often be run through existing city streets and parks or placed in the medians of roads if run in streets trains are usually limited by city block lengths to about four 180passenger vehicles 720 passengers operating on twominute headways using traffic signal progression a welldesigned twotrack system can handle up to 30 trains per hour per track achieving peak rates of over 20000 passengers per hour in each direction more advanced systems with separate rightsofway using moving block signalling can exceed 25000 passengers per hour per track27 practical considerationsedit most light rail systems in the united states are limited by demand rather than capacity by and large most north american lrt systems carry fewer than 4000 persons per hour per direction but bostons and san franciscos light rail lines carry 9600 and 13100 passengers per hour per track during rush hour28 elsewhere in north america the calgary ctrain and monterrey metro have higher light rail ridership than boston or san francisco systems outside north america often have much higher passenger volumes the manila light rail transit system is one of the highest capacity ones having been upgraded in a series of expansions to handle 40000 passengers per hour per direction and having carried as many as 582989 passengers in a single day on its line 129 it achieves this volume by running fourcar trains with a capacity of up to 1350 passengers each at a frequency of up to 30 trains per hour however the manila light rail system has full grade separation and as a result has many of the operating characteristics of a metro system rather than a light rail system a capacity of 1350 passengers per train is more similar to heavy rail than light rail a bus rapid transit brt system using dedicated lanes can have a theoretical capacity of 3600 passengers per hour per direction 30 buses per direction 120 passengers in articulated buses brt is an alternative to lrt at least if very high capacity is not needed using buses roads can achieve a much higher commuter capacity than is achievable with passenger cars to have 30 buses per direction an hour buses must have priority at traffic lights and have their own dedicated lanes buses can travel closer to each other than rail vehicles because of better braking capability however each bus vehicle requires a single driver whereas a light rail train may have three to four cars of much larger capacity in one train under the control of one driver or no driver at all in fully automated systems increasing the labor costs of hightraffic brt systems compared to lrt systems the peak passenger capacity per lane per hour depends on which types of vehicles are allowed at the roads typically roadways have 1900 passenger cars per lane per hour pcplph30 if only cars are allowed the capacity will be less and will not increase when the traffic volume increases when there is a bus driving on this route the capacity of the lane will be more and will increase when the traffic level increases and because the capacity of a light rail system is higher than that of a bus there will be even more capacity when there is a combination of cars and light rail table 3 shows an example of peak passenger capacity car car bus car light rail low volume 900 1650 2250 medium volume 900 2350 3250 high volume 900 3400 4600 edson tennyson 2003 safetyedit while many claim that light rail is safe research by car bloggerswhich suggest otherwise for example an analysis of data from the 505page national transportation statistics report 31 published by the us department of transportation shows that light rail fatalities are higher than all other forms of transportation except motorcycle travel 315 fatalities per 100 million miles32 however the national transportation statistics report 31 published by the us department of transportation states that caution must be exercised in comparing fatalities across modes because significantly different definitions are used in particular rail and transit fatalities include incidentrelated as distinct from accidentrelated fatalities such as fatalities from falls in transit stations or railroad employee fatalities from a fire in a workshed equivalent fatalities for the air and highway modes fatalities at airports not caused by moving aircraft or fatalities from accidents in automobile repair shops are not counted toward the totals for these modes thus fatalities not necessarily directly related to in service transportation are counted for the transit and rail modes potentially overstating the risk for these modes health impact of light railedit main article health impact of light rail systems integration with bicyclesedit light rail lines have various policies on bicycles33 some fleets restrict bicycles on trains during peak hours some light rail systems such as the st louis metrolink allow bicycles on the trains but only in the rear sections of cars some light rail lines like san franciscos allow only folding bicycles on board34 in some systems dedicated bike parking is available at select stations and others are integrated with local bike share systems construction and operation costsedit the cost of light rail construction varies widely largely depending on the amount of tunneling and elevated structures required a survey of north american light rail projects35 shows that costs of most lrt systems range from 15 million to over 100 million per mile seattles new light rail system is by far the most expensive in the us at 179 million per mile since it includes extensive tunneling in poor soil conditions elevated sections and stations as deep as 180 feet 55 m below ground level36 this results in costs more typical of subways or rapid transit systems than light rail at the other end of the scale four systems baltimore maryland camden new jersey sacramento california and salt lake city utah incurred construction costs of less than 20 million per mile over the us as a whole excluding seattle new light rail construction costs average about 35 million per mile35 by comparison a freeway lane expansion typically costs 10 million to 85 million per lane mile for two directions with an average of 23 million37 however freeways are frequently built in suburbs or rural areas whereas light rail tends to be concentrated in urban areas where right of way and property acquisition is expensive similarly the most expensive us highway expansion project was the big dig in boston massachusetts which cost 200 million per lane mile for a total cost of 146 billion since a light rail track can carry up to 20000 people per hour as compared with 2000–2200 vehicles per hour for one freeway lane38 light rail is comparable in construction cost to freeways on a per passengermile basis for example in boston and san francisco light rail lines carry 9600 and 13100 passengers per hour respectively in the peak direction during rush hour28 combining highway expansion with lrt construction can save costs by doing both highway improvements and rail construction at the same time as an example denvers transportation expansion project rebuilt interstate highways 25 and 225 and added a light rail expansion for a total cost of 167 billion over five years39 the cost of 17 miles 27 km of highway improvements and 19 miles 31 km of doubletrack light rail worked out to 193 million per highway lanemile and 276 million per lrt trackmile the project came in under budget and 22 months ahead of schedule40 lrt cost efficiency improves dramatically as ridership increases as can be seen from the numbers above the same rail line with similar capital and operating costs is far more efficient if it is carrying 20000 people per hour than if it is carrying 2400 the calgary alberta ctrain used many common light rail techniques to keep costs low including minimizing underground and elevated trackage sharing transit malls with buses leasing rightsofway from freight railroads and combining lrt construction with freeway expansion as a result calgary ranks toward the less expensive end of the scale with capital costs of around 24 million per mile41 however calgarys lrt ridership is much higher than any comparable us light rail system at 300000 passengers per weekday and as a result its capital efficiency is also much higher its capital costs were onethird those of the san diego trolley a comparably sized us system built at the same time while by 2009 its ridership was approximately three times as high thus calgarys capital cost per passenger was much lower than that of san diego its operating cost per passenger was also much lower because of its higher ridership a typical ctrain vehicle costs only ca163 equivalent to 192 in 2016 per hour to operate and since it averages 600 passengers per operating hour42 calgary transit estimates that its lrt operating costs are only 27 cents per ride versus 150 per ride on its buses41 compared to buses costs can be lower due to lower labor costs per passenger mile higher ridership observations show that light rail attracts more ridership than a comparable bus servicecitation needed and faster average speed reducing the number of vehicles needed for the same service frequency while light rail vehicles are more expensive to buy they have a longer useful life than buses sometimes making for lower lifecycle costs variationsedit trams operating on mainline railwaysedit see also karlsruhe model on the karlsruhe stadtbahn trams sometimes share mainline tracks with heavy rail trains around karlsruhe kassel and saarbrücken in germany dualvoltage light rail trains partly use mainline railroad tracks sharing these tracks with heavy rail trains in the netherlands this concept was first applied on the rijngouwelijn this allows commuters to ride directly into the city centre rather than taking a mainline train only as far as a central station and then having change to a tram in france similar tramtrains are planned for paris mulhouse and strasbourg further projects exist in some cases tramtrains use previously abandoned or lightly used heavy rail lines in addition to or instead of still in use mainline tracks some of the issues involved in such schemes are compatibility of the safety systems power supply of the track in relation to the power used by the vehicles frequently different voltages rarely third rail vs overhead wires width of the vehicles in relation to the position of the platforms height of the platforms there is a history of what would now be considered light rail vehicles operating on heavy rail rapid transit tracks in the us especially in the case of interurban streetcars notable examples are lehigh valley transit trains running on the philadelphia and western railroad highspeed third rail line now the norristown high speed line such arrangements are almost impossible now due to the federal railroad administration refusing for crash safety reasons to allow nonfra compliant railcars ie subway and light rail vehicles to run on the same tracks at the same times as compliant railcars which includes locomotives and standard railroad passenger and freight equipment notable exceptions in the us are the nj transit river line from camden to trenton and austins capital metrorail which have received exemptions to the provision that light rail operations occur only during daytime hours and conrail freight service only at night with several hours separating one operation from the other the otrain trillium line in ottawa also has freight service at certain hours thirdrail power for tramsedit main article groundlevel power supply when electric streetcars were introduced in the late 19th century conduit current collection was one of the first ways of supplying power but it proved to be much more expensive complicated and troubleprone than overhead wires when electric street railways became ubiquitous conduit power was used in those cities that did not permit overhead wires in europe it was used in london paris berlin marseille budapest and prague in the united states it was used in parts of new york city and washington dc43 third rail technology was investigated for use on the gold coast of australia for the glink light rail44 though power from overhead lines was ultimately utilized for that system in the french city of bordeaux the tramway network is powered by a third rail in the city centre where the tracks are not always segregated from pedestrians and cars45 the third rail actually two closely spaced rails is placed in the middle of the track and divided into eightmetre sections each of which is powered only while it is completely covered by a tram this minimises the risk of a person or animal coming into contact with a live rail in outer areas the trams switch to conventional overhead wires the bordeaux power system costs about three times as much as a conventional overhead wire system and took 24 months to achieve acceptable levels of reliability requiring replacement of all the main cables and power supplies46 operating and maintenance costs of the innovative power system still remain high however despite numerous service outages the system was a success with the public gaining up to 190000 passengers per
