translated the sushruta samhita from sanskrit to arabic in due course sushruta’s medical compendium travelled from arabia to persia to egypt and by the 15th century western european medicine had encountered it as the medical atlas cerrahiyetul haniye imperial surgery 15th century by şerafeddin sabuncuoğlu 1385–1468 among its surgical techniques featured a breast reduction procedure56 in italy gasparo tagliacozzi 1546–1599 professor of surgery and anatomy at the university of bologna published curtorum chirurgia per insitionem the surgery of defects by implantations 1597 a technico–procedural manual for the surgical repair and reconstruction of facial wounds in soldiers the illustrations featured a reattachment rhinoplasty using a biceps muscle pedicle flap the graft attached at 3weeks postprocedure which at 2weeks postattachment the surgeon then shaped into a nose in time the 5thcentury bc indian rhinoplasty technique—featuring a freeflap graft—was rediscovered by western medicine in the 18th century during the third anglo–mysore war 1789–1792 of colonial annexation by the british against tipu sultan when the east india company surgeons thomas cruso and james findlay witnessed indian rhinoplasty procedures at the british residency in poona in the englishlanguage madras gazette the surgeons published photographs of the rhinoplasty procedure and its nasal reconstruction outcomes later in the october 1794 issue of the gentlemans magazine of london the doctors cruso and findlay published an illustrated report describing a forehead pedicleflap rhinoplasty that was a technical variant of the freeflap graft technique that sushruta had described some twentythree centuries earlier7 in 1815 dr karl ferdinand von gräfe wrote a book about rebuilding the human nose predating the indian sushruta samhita medical compendium is the ebers papyrus c 1550 bc an ancient egyptian medical papyrus that describes rhinoplasty as the plastic surgical operation for reconstructing a nose destroyed by rhinectomy such a mutilation was inflicted as a criminal religious political and military punishment in that time and culture8 in the event the indian rhinoplasty technique continued in 19thcentury western european medicine in great britain joseph constantine carpue 1764–1846 published the account of two successful operations for restoring a lost nose 1815 which described two rhinoplasties the reconstruction of a battlewounded nose and the repair of an arsenicdamaged nose cf carpue’s operation59 the polymath johann friedrich dieffenbach contributed one of the foundation texts of the plastic surgery specialty 1840 in germany rhinoplastic technique was refined by surgeons such as the berlin university professor of surgery karl ferdinand von gräfe 1787–1840 who published rhinoplastik rebuilding the nose 1818 wherein he described fiftyfive 55 historical plastic surgery procedures indian rhinoplasty italian rhinoplasty etc and his technically innovative freegraft nasal reconstruction with a tissueflap harvested from the patient’s arm and surgical approaches to eyelid cleft lip and cleft palate corrections dr von gräfe’s protégé the medical and surgical polymath johann friedrich dieffenbach 1794–1847 who was among the first surgeons to anaesthetize the patient before performing the nose surgery published die operative chirurgie operative surgery 1845 which became a foundational medical and plastic surgical text see strabismus torticollis moreover the prussian jacques joseph 1865–1934 published nasenplastik und sonstige gesichtsplastik rhinoplasty and other facial plastic surgeries 1928 which described refined surgical techniques for performing nosereduction rhinoplasty via internal incisions10 in the united states in 1887 the otolaryngologist john orlando roe 1848–1915 performed the first modern endonasal rhinoplasty closed rhinoplasty about which he reported in the article the deformity termed pug nose and its correction by a simple operation 1887 and about his management of saddle nose deformities1112 in the early 20th century freer in 1902 and killian in 1904 respectively pioneered the submucous resection septoplasty smr procedure for correcting a deviated septum they raised mucoperichondrial tissue flaps and resected the cartilaginous and bony septum including the vomer bone and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone maintaining septal support with a 10cm margin at the dorsum and a 10cm margin at the caudad for which innovations the technique became the foundational standard septoplastic procedure in 1921 a rethi introduced the open rhinoplasty approach featuring an incision to the columella to facilitate modifying the tip of the nose13 in 1929 peer and metzenbaum performed the first manipulation of the caudal septum where it originates and projects from the forehead in 1947 maurice h cottle 1898–1981 endonasally resolved a septal deviation with a minimalist hemitransfixion incision which conserved the septum thus he advocated for the practical primacy of the closed rhinoplasty approach8 in 1957 a sercer advocated the “decortication of the nose” dekortication des nase technique which featured a columellarincision open rhinoplasty that allowed greater access to the nasal cavity and to the nasal septum nonetheless at mid–20th century despite such refinement of the open rhinoplasty approach the endonasal rhinoplasty was the usual approach to nose surgery—until the 1970s when padovan presented his technical refinements advocating the open rhinoplasty approach he was seconded by wilfred s goodman in the later 1970s and by jack p gunter in the 1990s1415 goodman impelled technical and procedural progress with the article external approach to rhinoplasty 1973 which reported his technical refinements and popularized the open rhinoplasty approach16 in 1982 jack anderson reported his refinements of nose surgery technique in the article open rhinoplasty an assessment 198217 during the 1970s the principal application of open rhinoplasty was to the firsttime rhinoplasty patient ie a primary rhinoplasty not as a revision surgery ie a secondary rhinoplasty to correct a failed nose surgery in 1987 in the article external approach for secondary rhinoplasty 1987 jack p gunter reported the technical effectiveness of the open rhinoplasty approach for performing a secondary rhinoplasty his improved techniques advanced the management of a failed nose surgery18 hence does contemporary rhinoplastic praxis derive from the primeval c 600 bc indian rhinoplasty nasal reconstruction via an autologous foreheadskin flap and its technical variants carpues operation the italian rhinoplasty pedicleflap reconstruction aka the tagliocotian rhinoplasty and the closedapproach endonasal rhinoplasty featuring exclusively internal incisions that allow the plastic surgeon to palpate feel the corrections being effected to the

embryonic human head c 30 days of gestation at four 4 weeks of gestational development the neural crest cells the precursors of the nose begin their caudad migration from the posterior towards the midface two symmetrical nasal placodes the future olfactory epithelium develop inferiorly which the nasal pits then divide into the medial and the lateral nasal processes the future upper lip and nose the medial processes then form the septum the philtrum and the premaxilla of the nose the lateral processes form the sides of the nose and the mouth forms from the stomodeum the anterior ectodermal portion of the alimentary tract which is inferior to the nasal complex a nasobuccal membrane separates the mouth from the nose respectively the inferior oral cavity the mouth and the superior nasal cavity the nose as the olfactory pits deepen said development forms the choanae the two openings that connect the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx upper part of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages initially primitiveform choanae develop which then further develop into the secondary permanent choanae at ten 10 weeks of gestation the cells differentiate into muscle cartilage and bone if this important early facial embryogenesis fails it might result in anomalies such as choanal atresia absent or closed passage medial nasal clefts fissures or lateral nasal clefts nasal aplasia faulty or incomplete development and polyrrhinia double nose20 this normal human embryologic development is exceptionally important—because the newborn infant breathes through his or her nose during the first 6 weeks of life—thus when a child is afflicted with bilateral choanal atresia the blockage of the posterior nasal passage either by abnormal bony tissue or by abnormal soft tissue emergency remedial action is required to ensure that the child can breathe21 the structures of the noseedit nasal anatomy squamous epithelium is one of several types of epithelia nasal anatomy the procerus muscle musculus procerus pyramidalis nasi depressor glabellae for plastic surgical correction the structural anatomy of the nose comprehends a the nasal soft tissues b the aesthetic subunits and segments c the blood supply arteries and veins d the nasal lymphatic system e the facial and nasal nerves f the nasal bones and g the nasal cartilages a the nasal soft tissues nasal skin – like the underlying boneandcartilage osseocartilaginous support framework of the nose the external skin is divided into vertical thirds anatomic sections from the glabella the space between the eyebrows to the bridge to the tip for corrective plastic surgery the nasal skin is anatomically considered as the upper third section – the skin of the upper nose is thick and relatively distensible flexible and mobile but then tapers adhering tightly to the osseocartilaginous framework and becomes the thinner skin of the dorsal section the bridge of the nose middle third section – the skin overlying the bridge of the nose middorsal section is the thinnest least distensible nasal skin because it most adheres to the support framework lower third section – the skin of the lower nose is as thick as the skin of the upper nose because it has more sebaceous glands especially at the nasal tip nasal lining – at the vestibule the human nose is lined with a mucous membrane of squamous epithelium which tissue then transitions to become columnar respiratory epithelium a pseudostratified ciliated lashlike tissue with abundant seromucinous glands which maintains the nasal moisture and protects the respiratory tract from bacteriologic infection and foreign objects nasal muscles – the movements of the human nose are controlled by groups of facial and neck muscles that are set deep to the skin they are in four 4 functional groups that are interconnected by the nasal superficial aponeurosis—the superficial musculoaponeurotic system smas—which is a sheet of dense fibrous collagenous connective tissue that covers invests and forms the terminations of the muscles the movements of the nose are affected by the elevator muscle group – which includes the procerus muscle and the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle the depressor muscle group – which includes the alar nasalis muscle and the depressor septi nasi muscle the compressor muscle group – which includes the transverse nasalis muscle the dilator muscle group – which includes the dilator naris muscle that expands the nostrils it is in two parts i the dilator nasi anterior muscle and ii the dilator nasi posterior muscle rhinoplasty the surgical nose as aesthetic nasal segments b aesthetics of the nose – nasal subunits and nasal segments to plan map and execute the surgical correction of a nasal defect or deformity the structure of the external nose is divided into nine 9 aesthetic nasal subunits and six 6 aesthetic nasal segments which provide the plastic surgeon with the measures for determining the size extent and topographic locale of the nasal defect or deformity the surgical nose as nine 9 aesthetic nasal subunits tip subunit columellar subunit right alar base subunit right alar wall subunit left alar wall subunit left alar base subunit dorsal subunit right dorsal wall subunit left dorsal wall subunit in turn the nine 9 aesthetic nasal subunits are configured as six 6 aesthetic nasal segments each segment comprehends a nasal area greater than that comprehended by a nasal subunit the surgical nose as six 6 aesthetic nasal segments the dorsal nasal segment the lateral nasalwall segments the hemilobule segment the softtissue triangle segments the alar segments the columellar segment rhinoplasty the common carotid artery using the coordinates of the subunits and segments to determine the topographic location of the defect on the nose the plastic surgeon plans maps and executes a rhinoplasty procedure the unitary division of the nasal topography permits minimal but precise cutting and maximal correctivetissue coverage to produce a functional nose of proportionate size contour and appearance for the patient hence if more than 50 per cent of an aesthetic subunit is lost damaged defective destroyed the surgeon replaces the entire aesthetic segment usually with a regional tissue graft harvested from either the face or the head or with a tissue graft harvested from elsewhere on the patients body22 c nasal blood supply – arteries and veins like the face the human nose is well vascularized with arteries and veins and thus supplied with abundant blood the principal arterial bloodvessel supply to the nose is twofold i branches from the internal carotid artery the branch of the anterior ethmoid artery the branch of the posterior ethmoid artery which derive from the ophthalmic artery ii branches from the external carotid artery the sphenopalatine artery the greater palatine artery the superior labial artery and the angular artery the external nose is supplied with blood by the facial artery which becomes the angular artery that courses over the superomedial aspect of the nose the sellar region sella turcica turkish chair and the dorsal region of the nose are supplied with blood by branches of the internal maxillary artery infraorbital and the ophthalmic arteries that derive from the internal common carotid artery system internally the lateral nasal wall is supplied with blood by the sphenopalatine artery from behind and below and by the anterior ethmoid artery and the posterior ethmoid artery from above and behind the nasal septum also is supplied with blood by the sphenopalatine artery and by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries with the additional circulatory contributions of the superior labial artery and of the greater palatine artery these three 3 vascular supplies to the internal nose converge in the kiesselbach plexus the little area which is a region in the anteroinferiorthird of the nasal septum in front and below furthermore the nasal vein vascularisation of the nose generally follows the arterial pattern of nasal vascularisation the nasal veins are biologically significant because they have no vesselvalves and because of their direct circulatory communication to the sinus caverns which makes possible the potential intracranial spreading of a bacterial infection of the nose hence because of such an abundant nasal blood supply tobacco smoking does therapeutically compromise postoperative healing d lymphatic system of the nose the pertinent nasal lymphatic system arises from the superficial mucosa and drains posteriorly to the retropharyngeal nodes in back and anteriorly in front either to the upper deep cervical nodes in the neck or to the submandibular glands in the lower jaw or into both the nodes and the glands of the neck and the jaw nasal innervation cranial nerve v the trigeminal nerve nervus trigeminis gives sensation to the nose the face and the upper jaw maxilla e nerves of the nose the sensations registered by the human nose derive from the first two 2 branches of cranial nerve v the trigeminal nerve nervus trigeminis the nerve listings indicate the respective innervation sensory distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches within the nose the face and the upper jaw maxilla nasal innervation cranial nerve vii nervus facialis is the facial nerve that gives sensation to the nose and the upper jaw maxilla the indicated nerve serves the named anatomic facial and nasal regions ophthalmic division innervation lacrimal nerve – conveys sensation to the skin areas of the lateral orbital eye socket region except for the lacrimal gland frontal nerve – conveys sensation to the skin areas of the forehead and the scalp supraorbital nerve – conveys sensation to the skin areas of the eyelids the forehead and the scalp supratrochlear nerve – conveys sensation to the medial region of the eyelid skin area and the medial region of the forehead skin nasociliary nerve – conveys sensation to the skin area of the nose and the mucous membrane of the anterior front nasal cavity anterior ethmoid nerve – conveys sensation in the anterior front half of the nasal cavity a the internal areas of the ethmoid sinus and the frontal sinus and b the external areas from the nasal tip to the rhinion the anterior tip of the terminal end of the nasalbone suture posterior ethmoid nerve – serves the superior upper half of the nasal cavity the sphenoids and the ethmoids intratrochlear nerve – conveys sensation to the medial region of the eyelids the palpebral conjunctiva the nasion nasolabial junction and the bony dorsum the maxillary division innervation maxillary nerve – conveys sensation to the upper jaw and the face infraorbital nerve – conveys sensation to the area from below the eye socket to the external nares nostrils zygomatic nerve – through the zygomatic bone and the zygomatic arch conveys sensation to the cheekbone areas superior posterior dental nerve – sensation in the teeth and the gums superior anterior dental nerve – mediates the sneeze reflex sphenopalatine nerve – divides into the lateral branch and the septal branch and conveys sensation from the rear and the central regions of the nasal cavity nasal anatomy the shellform turbinates conchae nasales nasal anatomy the septum nasi bones and cartilages the supply of parasympathetic nerves to the face and the upper jaw maxilla derives from the greater superficial petrosal gsp branch of cranial nerve vii the facial nerve the gsp nerve joins the deep petrosal nerve of the sympathetic nervous system derived from the carotid plexus to form the vidian nerve in the vidian canal that traverses the pterygopalatine ganglion an autonomic ganglion of the maxillary nerve wherein only the parasympathetic nerves form synapses which serve the lacrimal gland and the glands of the nose and of the palate via the upper jaw maxillary division of cranial nerve v the trigeminal nerve f bony anatomy of the nose in the upper portion of the nose the paired nasal bones attach to the frontal bone above and to the side superolaterally the paired nasal bones connect to the lacrimal bones and below and to the side inferolaterally they attach to the ascending processes of the maxilla upper jaw above and to the back posterosuperiorly the bony nasal septum is composed of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone the vomer bone lies below and to the back posteroinferiorly and partially forms the choanal opening into the nasopharynx the upper portion of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages the floor of the nose comprises the premaxilla bone and the palatine bone the roof of the mouth the nasal septum is composed of the quadrangular cartilage the vomer bone the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone aspects of the premaxilla and the palatine bones each lateral nasal wall contains three pairs of turbinates nasal conchae which are small thin shellform bones i the superior concha ii the middle concha and iii the inferior concha which are the bony framework of the turbinates lateral to the turbinates is the medial wall of the maxillary sinus inferior to the nasal conchae turbinates is the meatus space with names that correspond to the turbinates eg superior turbinate superior meatus et alii the internal roof of the nose is composed by the horizontal perforated cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone through which pass sensory filaments of the olfactory nerve cranial nerve i finally below and behind posteroinferior the cribriform plate sloping down at an angle is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus g the cartilaginous pyramid of the nose the cartilaginous septum septum nasi extends from the nasal bones in the midline above to the bony septum in the midline posteriorly then down along the bony floor the septum is quadrangular the upper half is flanked by two 2 triangulartotrapezoidal cartilages the upper lateralcartilages which are fused to the dorsal septum in the midline and laterally attached with loose ligaments to the bony margin of the pyriform pearshaped aperture while the inferior ends of the upper lateralcartilages are free unattached the internal area angle formed by the septum and upper lateralcartilage constitutes the internal valve of the nose the sesamoid cartilages are adjacent to the upper lateralcartilages in the fibroareolar connective tissue beneath the upper lateralcartilages lay the lower lateralcartilages the paired lower lateralcartilages swing outwards from medial attachments to the caudal septum in the midline the medial crura to an intermediate crus shank area finally the lower lateralcartilages flare outwards above and to the side superolaterally as the lateral crura these cartilages are mobile unlike the upper lateral cartilages furthermore some persons present anatomical evidence of nasal scrolling—ie an outward curving of the lower borders of the upper lateralcartilages and an inward curving of the cephalic borders of the alar cartilages the external noseedit external nasal anatomy the form of the nasal subunits—the dorsum the sidewalls the lobule the soft triangles the alae and the columella—are configured differently according to the race and the ethnic group of the patient thus the nasal physiognomies denominated as african platyrrhine flat wide nose asiatic subplatyrrhine low wide nose caucasian leptorrhine narrow nose and hispanic paraleptorrhine narrowsided nose the respective external valve of each nose is variably dependent upon the size shape and strength of the lower lateral cartilage23 internal nasal anatomy in the midline of the nose the septum is a composite osseocartilaginous structure that divides the nose into two 2 similar halves the lateral nasal wall and the paranasal sinuses the superior concha the middle concha and the inferior concha form the corresponding passages the superior meatus the middle meatus and the inferior meatus on the lateral nasal wall the superior meatus is the drainage area for the posterior ethmoid bone cells and the sphenoid sinus the middle meatus provides drainage for the anterior ethmoid sinuses and for the maxillary and frontal sinuses and the inferior meatus provides drainage for the nasolacrimal duct the internal nasal valve comprises the area bounded by the upper lateralcartilage the septum the nasal floor and the anterior head of the inferior turbinate in the narrow leptorrhine nose this is the narrowest portion of the nasal airway generally this area requires an angle greater than 15 degrees for unobstructed breathing for the correction of such narrowness the width of the nasal valve can be increased with spreader grafts and flaring sutures nasal analysisedit rhinoplasty nasal anatomy the philtrum the surgical management of nasal defects and deformities divides the nose into six 6 anatomic subunits i the dorsum ii the sidewalls paired iii the hemilobules paired iv the soft triangles paired v the alae paired and vi the columella surgical correction and reconstruction comprehend the entire anatomic subunit affected by the defect wound or deformity thus the entire subunit is corrected especially when the resection cutting of the defect encompasses more than 50 per cent of the subunit aesthetically the nose—from the nasion the midpoint of the nasofrontal junction to the columellalabial junction—ideally occupies onethird of the vertical dimension of the person’s face and from ala to ala it ideally should occupy onefifth of the horizontal dimension of the persons face24 the nasofrontal angle between the frontal bone and the nasion usually is 120 degrees the nasofrontal angle is more acute in the male face than in the female face the nasofacial angle the slope of the nose relative to the plane of the face is approximately 30–40 degrees the nasolabial angle the slope between the columella and the philtrum is approximately 90–95 degrees in the male face and approximately 100–105 degrees in the female face therefore when observing the nose in profile the normal show of the columella the height of the visible nasal aperture is 2 mm and the dorsum should be rectilinear straight when observed from below worm’seye view the alar base configures an isosceles triangle with its apex at the infratip lobule immediately beneath the tip of the nose the facially proportionate projection of the nasal tip the distance of the nose’s tip from the face is determined with the goode method wherein the projection of the nasal tip should be 55–60 per cent of the distance between the nasion nasofrontal junction and the tipdefining point a columellar double break might be present marking the transition between the intermediate crus of the lowerlateral cartilage and the medial crus the goode method determines the extension of the nose from the facial surface by comprehending the distance from the alar groove to the tip of the nose and then relating that measurement of nasaltip projection to the length of the nasal dorsum the nasal projection measurement is obtained by delineating a right triangle with lines parting from the nasion nasofrontal juncture to the alar–facial–groove then a second perpendicular delineation that traverses the tipdefining point establishes the ratio of projection of the nasal tip hence the range of 0551 to 0601 is the ideal nasaltiptonasallength projection25 rhinoplasty nasal class i the roman nose nasology eden warwick 1848 rhinoplasty nasal class ii the greek nose

michelangelo merisi to determine the patients suitability for undergoing a rhinoplasty procedure the surgeon clinically evaluates him or her with a complete medical history anamnesis to determine his or her physical and psychological health the prospective patient must explain to the physician–surgeon the functional and aesthetic nasal problems that he or she suffers the surgeon asks about the ailments symptoms and their duration past surgical interventions allergies drugs use and drugs abuse prescription and commercial medications and a general medical history furthermore additional to physical suitability is psychological suitability—the patients psychological motive for undergoing nose surgery is critical to the surgeons preoperative evaluation of the patient in the case of men the surgeon must identify prospective patients presenting the mental traits denoted by the psychiatric acronym simon single immature male overexpectant and narcissistic which might indicate a man overvaluing the outcome of a rhinoplasty8 the complete physical examination of the rhinoplasty patient determines if he or she is physically fit to undergo and tolerate the physiologic stresses of nose surgery the examination comprehends every existing physical problem and a consultation with an anaesthesiologist if warranted by the patients medical data specific facial and nasal evaluations record the patients skintype existing surgical scars and the symmetry and asymmetry of the aesthetic nasal subunits the external and internal nasal examination concentrates upon the anatomic thirds of the nose—upper section middle section lower section—specifically noting their structures the measures of the nasal angles at which the external nose projects from the face and the physical characteristics of the nasofacial bony and soft tissues the internal examination evaluates the condition of the nasal septum the internal and external nasal valves the turbinates and the nasal lining paying special attention to the structure and the form of the nasal dorsum and the tip of the nose8 furthermore when warranted specific tests—the mirror test vasoconstriction examinations and the cottle maneuver—are included to the preoperative evaluation of the prospective rhinoplasty patient established by maurice h cottle 1898–1981 the cottle maneuver is a principal diagnostic technique for detecting an internal nasalvalve disorder whilst the patient gently inspires the surgeon laterally pulls the patients cheek thereby simulating the widening of the crosssectional area of the corresponding internal nasal valve if the maneuver notably facilitates the patients inspiration that result is a positive cottle sign—which generally indicates an airflowcorrection to be surgically effected with an installed spreadergraft said correction will improve the internal angle of the nasal valve and thus allow unobstructed breathing nonetheless the cottle maneuver occasionally yields a falsepositive cottle sign usually observed in the patient afflicted with alar collapse and in the patient with a scarred nasalvalve region26 surgical rhinoplastyedit open rhinoplasty versus closed rhinoplastyedit the plastic surgical correction of congenital and acquired abnormalities of the nose restores functional and aesthetic properties by the surgeons manipulations of the nasal skin the subcutaneous underlying cartilageandbone support framework and the mucous membrane lining technically the plastic surgeons incisional approach classifies the nasal surgery either as an open rhinoplasty or as a closed rhinoplasty procedure in open rhinoplasty the surgeon makes a small irregular incision to the columella the fleshy exteriorend of the nasal septum this columellar incision is additional to the usual set of incisions for a nasal correction in closed rhinoplasty the surgeon performs every procedural incision endonasally exclusively within the nose and does not cut the

bleeding generally the plastic surgeon first separates the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the osseocartilagenous nasal framework and then corrects reshapes them as required afterwards sutures the incisions and then applies either an external or an internal stent and tape to immobilize the newly reconstructed nose and so facilitate the healing of the surgical cuts occasionally the surgeon uses either an autologous cartilage graft or a bone graft or both in order to strengthen or to alter the nasal contours the autologous grafts usually are harvested from the nasal septum but if it has insufficient cartilage as can occur in a revision rhinoplasty then either a costal cartilage graft from the rib cage or an auricular cartilage graft concha from the ear is harvested from the patient’s body when the rhinoplasty requires a bone graft it is harvested from either the cranium the hips or the rib cage moreover when neither type of autologous graft is available a synthetic graft nasal implant is used to augment the nasal bridge29 photographic recordsedit for the benefit of patient and the physician–surgeon a photographic history of the entire rhinoplastic procedure is established

chiselling away the main mass of the nasal hump with an osteotome the surgeon then sculpts refines and smoothens the cut nasal bones with rasps files rhinoplastic instruments bonescraping rasps of various grades and types that the plastic surgeon uses to refine the corrections required to produce a new nose types of rhinoplasty – primary and secondaryedit in plastic surgical praxis the term primary rhinoplasty denotes an initial firsttime reconstructive functional or aesthetic corrective procedure the term secondary rhinoplasty denotes the revision of a failed rhinoplasty an occurrence in 5–20 per cent of rhinoplasty operations hence a revision rhinoplasty the corrections usual to secondary rhinoplasty include the cosmetic reshaping of the nose because of a functional breathing deficit from an over aggressive rhinoplasty asymmetry deviated or crooked nose areas of collapses hanging columella pinched tip scooped nose and more although most revision rhinoplasty procedures are open approach such a correction is more technically complicated usually because the nasal support structures either were deformed or destroyed in the primary rhinoplasty thus the surgeon must recreate the nasal support with cartilage grafts harvested either from the ear auricular cartilage graft or from the rib cage costal cartilage graft nasal reconstructionedit rhinoplasty right lateral view of the nasal cartilages and the nasal bone rhinoplasty lateral wall of the nasal cavity in reconstructive rhinoplasty the defects and deformities that the plastic surgeon encounters and must restore to normal function form and appearance include broken and displaced nasal bones disrupted and displaced nasal cartilages a collapsed bridge of the nose congenital defect trauma blunt penetrating blast autoimmune disorder cancer intranasal drugabuse damages and failed primary rhinoplasty outcomes rhinoplasty reduces bony humps and realigns the nasal bones after they are cut dissected resected when cartilage is disrupted suturing for resuspension structural support or the use of cartilage grafts to camouflage a depression allow the reestablishment of the normal nasal contour of the nose for the patient when the bridge of the nose is collapsed ribcartilage earcartilage or cranialbone grafts can be used to restore its anatomic integrity and thus the aesthetic continuity of the nose for augmenting the nasal dorsum autologous cartilage and bone grafts are preferred to artificial prostheses because of the reduced incidence of histologic rejection and medical complications30 surgical anatomy for nasal reconstructionedit the human nose is a sensory organ that is structurally composed of three types of tissue i an osseocartilaginous support framework nasal skeleton ii a mucous membrane lining and iii an external skin the anatomic topography of the human nose is a graceful blend of convexities curves and depressions the contours of which show the underlying shape of the nasal skeleton hence these anatomic characteristics permit dividing the nose into nasal subunits i the midline ii the nosetip iii the dorsum iv the soft triangles v the alar lobules and vi the lateral walls surgically the borders of the nasal subunits are ideal locations for the scars whereby is produced a superior aesthetic outcome a corrected nose with corresponding skin colors and skin textures3132 nasal skeleton therefore the successful rhinoplastic outcome depends entirely upon the respective maintenance or restoration of the anatomic integrity of the nasal skeleton which comprises a the nasal bones and the ascending processes of the maxilla in the upper third b the paired upperlateral cartilages in the middle third and c the lowerlateral alar cartilages in the lower third hence managing the surgical reconstruction of a damaged defective or deformed nose requires that the plastic surgeon manipulate three 3 anatomic layers the osseocartilagenous framework – the upper lateral cartilages that are tightly attached to the rear caudal edge of the nasal bones and the nasal septum said attachment suspends them above the nasal cavity the paired alar cartilages configure a tripodshaped union that supports the lower third of the nose the paired medial crura conform the centralleg of the tripod which is attached to the anterior nasal spine and septum in the midline the lateral crura compose the secondleg and the thirdleg of the tripod and are attached to the pearshaped pyriform aperture the nasalcavity opening at the front of the skull the dome of the nostrils defines the apex of the alar cartilage which supports the nasal tip and is responsible for the light reflex of the tip the nasal lining – a thin layer of vascular mucosa that adheres tightly to the deep surface of the bones and the cartilages of the nose said dense adherence to the nasal interior limits the mobility of the mucosa consequently only the smallest of mucosal defects 5 mm can be sutured primarily the nasal skin – a tight envelope that proceeds inferiorly from the glabella the smooth prominence between the eyebrows which then becomes thinner and progressively inelastic less distensible the skin of the midthird of the nose covers the cartilaginous dorsum and the upper lateral cartilages and is relatively elastic but at the far distalthird of the nose the skin adheres tightly to the alar cartilages and is little distensible the skin and the underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a semirigid anatomic unit that maintains the graceful curve of the alar rim and the patency openness of the nostrils anterior nares to preserve this nasal shape and patency the replacement of the alar lobule must include a supporting cartilage graft—despite the alar lobule not originally containing cartilage because of its many sebaceous glands the nasal skin usually is of a smooth oiled texture moreover regarding scarrification when compared to the skin of other facial areas the skin of the nose generates fineline scars that usually are inconspicuous which allows the surgeon to strategically hide the surgical scars33 principles of rhinoplastic reconstructionedit principles the technical principles for the surgical reconstruction of a nose derive from the essential operative principles of plastic surgery that the applied procedure and techniques yield the most satisfactory functional and aesthetic outcome hence the rhinoplastic reconstruction of a new nasal subunit of virtually normal appearance can be done in a few procedural stages using intranasal tissues to correct defects of the mucosa cartilage battens to brace against tissue contraction and depression topographic collapse axial skin flaps designed from threedimensional 3d templates derived from the topographic subunits of the nose and the refinement of the resultant correction with the subcutaneous sculpting of bone cartilage and flesh nonetheless the physiciansurgeon and the rhinoplasty patient must abide the fact that the reconstructed nasal subunit is not a nose proper but a collagenglued collage—of forehead skin cheek skin mucosa vestibular lining nasal septum and fragments of ear cartilage—which is perceived as a nose only because its contour skin color and skin texture are true to the original nose32 restoration in nasal reconstruction the plastic surgeons ultimate goal is recreating the shadows the contours the skin color and the skin texture that define the patients normal nose as perceived at conversational distance c 10 metre yet such an aesthetic outcome suggests the application of a more complex surgical approach which requires that the surgeon balance the patients required rhinoplasty with the patients aesthetic ideal body image in the context of surgically reconstructing the patients physiognomy the normal nose is the threedimensional 3d template for replacing the missing parts of a nose aesthetic nasal subunit aesthetic nasal segment which the plastic surgeon recreates using firm malleable modelling materials—such as bone cartilage and flaps of skin and of tissue in repairing a partial nasal defect wound such as that of the alar lobule the dome above the nostrils the surgeon uses the undamaged opposite contralateral side of the nose as the 3d model to fabricate the anatomic template for recreating the deformed nasal subunit by molding the malleable template material directly upon the normal undamaged nasal anatomy to effect a total nasal reconstruction the template might derive from quotidian observations of the normal nose and from photographs of the patient before he or she suffered the nasal damage the surgeon replaces missing parts with tissue of like quality and quantity nasal lining with mucosa cartilage with cartilage bone with bone and skin with skin that best match the native skin color and skin texture of the damaged nasal subunit for such surgical repairs skin flaps are preferable to skin grafts because skin flaps generally are the superior remedy for matching the color and the texture of nasal skin better resist tissue contracture and provide better vascularisation of the nasal skeleton thus when there is sufficient skin to allow tissue harvesting nasal skin is the best source of nasal skin furthermore despite its notable scarring propensity the nasal skin flap is the prime consideration for nasal reconstruction because of its greater verisimilitude the most effective nasal reconstruction for repairing a defect wound of the nasal skin is to recreate the entire nasal subunit thus the wound is enlarged to comprehend the entire nasal subunit technically this surgical principle permits laying the scars in the topographic transition zones between and among adjacent aesthetic subunits which avoids juxtaposing two different types of skin in the same aesthetic subunit where the differences of color and texture might prove too noticeable even when reconstructing a nose with skin flaps nonetheless in the final stage of nasal reconstruction—replicating the normal nose anatomy by subcutaneous sculpting the surgeon does have technical allowance to revise the scars and render them more inconspicuous33 reasons for reconstructionedit rhinoplasty a melanoma lesion a type of skin cancer that occurs to the nasal skin reconstruction rhinoplasty is indicated for the correction of defects and deformities caused by skin cancer the most common cause etiology for a nasal reconstruction is skin cancer especially the lesions to the nose of melanoma and basalcell carcinoma this oncologic epidemiology occurs more readily among the aged and people who reside in very sunny geographic areas although every type of skin is susceptible to skin cancer whiteskin is most epidemiologically prone to developing skin cancer furthermore regarding plastic surgical scars the age of the patient is a notable factor in the timely postsurgical healing of a skin cancer defect lesion in terms of scarrification the very elastic skin of young people has a greater regenerative propensity for producing scars that are thicker stronger and more noticeable therefore in young patients the strategic placement hiding of the rhinoplastic scars is a greater aesthetic consideration than in elder patients whose less elastic skin produces scars that are narrower and less noticeable traumatic nasal defect although trauma is a less common rhinoplastic occurrence a nasal defect or deformity caused by blunt trauma impact penetrating trauma piercing and blast trauma blunt and penetrating requires a surgical reconstruction that abides the conservational principles of plastic surgery as in the corrections of cancerous lesions congenital deformities the unique plastic properties of the bone cartilage and skin of patients afflicted with congenital defects and associated anomalies are considered separately3334 surgical techniquesedit the effectiveness of a rhinoplastic reconstruction of the external nose derives from the contents of the surgeons armamentarium of skinflap techniques applicable to correcting defects of the nasal skin and of the mucosal lining some management techniques are the bilobed flap the nasolabial flap the paramedian forehead flap and the septal mucosal flap i the bilobed flap the design of the bilobed flap derives from the creation of two 2 adjacent random transposition flaps lobes in its original design the leading flap is applied to cover the defect and the second flap is emplaced where the skin flexes more and fills the donorsite wound from where the first flap was harvested which then is closed primarily with sutures the first flap is oriented geometrically at 90 degrees from the long axis of the wound defect and the second flap is oriented 180 degrees from the axis of the wound although effective the bilobed flap technique did create troublesome dog ears of excess flesh that required trimming and it also produced a broad skindonor area that was difficult to confine to the nose in 1989 j a zitelli modified the bilobed flap technique by a orienting the leading flap at 45 degrees from the long axis of the wound and b orienting the second flap at 90 degrees from the axis of the wound said orientations and emplacements eliminated the excessflesh dog ears and thus required a smaller area of donor skin resultantly the broadbased bilobed flap is less prone to the trap door and the pin cushion deformities common to skinflap transposition procedure35 rhinoplasty the nasal muscle compresses the nasal bridge depresses the tip of the nose and flares elevates the corners of the nostrils surgical technique – the bilobed flap the design of the bilobed flap coordinates its lobes with the long axis of the nasal defect wound each lobe of the flap is emplaced at a 45degree angle to the axis the two lobes of the bilobed flap rotate along an arc of which all points are equidistant from the apex of the nasal defect based upon the available area of nasal skin the surgeon selects the locale for the bilobed flap and orients the pedicle if the defect is in the lateral aspect of the nose the pedicle is based medially if the defect is at the nasal tip or at the nasal dorsum the pedicle is based laterally an ideal location for the second flap is along the junction of the nasal dorsum and the lateral nasal wall the nasal wound is cut and shaped into a teardrop form by the cutting out of a burrows triangle of flesh on the side of pedicle base cutting out the burrows triangle skin and subcutaneous fat permits the moving the pedicle flap to emplace it without buckling the tissues adjacent to the graft using a 20 mm calliper as a protractor—one tip at the apex of the wound—the surgeon delineates two semicircles an inner semicircle and an outer semicircle the outer semicircle defines the necessary length of the two lobes of the skin flap the inner semicircle bisects the center of the original wound and continues across the donor skin establishing limit measure of the pedicle common to the two lobes of the flap the surgeon then draws two lines from the apex of the wound the first line drawn is at an angle of 45 degrees from the long axis of the wound and the second line drawn is at a 90degree angle from the axis of the wound the two 2 lines delineate the central axes of the two lobes of the bilobed flap the delineation of each of the two lobes of the flap begins and ends at the inner semicircle and extends to the outer semicircle to the point where it intersects its central axis the width of the first lobe is approximately 2 mm narrower than the width of the wound the width of the second lobe is approximately 2 mm narrower than the width of the first lobe after the cutting from the tissue donorsite the bilobed flap is elevated to a plane between the subcutaneous fat and the nasalis muscle the wound is deepened down to the nasal skeleton to accommodate the tissue thickness of the bilobed flap technically cutting the wound enlarging it is preferable and safer than trimming thinning the flap to fit the wound undermining the donor site for the second lobe allows closing it primarily it also eliminates excessskin dogears at the donor site moreover if the donor site cannot be closed with sutures or if the skin blanches whitens when sutured usually because of excessively tight sutures the tension is decreased by reducing the size length width depth of the wound with deep sutures that will allow it to heal more readily ii nasolabial flap in the 19th century the surgical techniques of jf dieffenbach 1792–1847 popularized the nasolabial flap for nasal reconstruction for which it remains a foundational nose surgery procedure the nasolabial flap can be either superiorly based or inferiorly based of which the superiorly based flap is the more practical rhinoplastic application because it has a more versatile arc of rotation and the donorsite scar is inconspicuous depending upon the how the defect lay upon the nose the flap pediclebase can be incorporated either solely to the nasal reconstruction or it can be divided into a second stage procedure the blood supply for the flap pedicle are the transverse branches of the contralateral angular artery the facial artery terminus parallel to the nose and by a confluence of blood vessels from the angular artery and from the supraorbital artery in the medial canthus the angles formed by the meeting of the upper and lower eyelids therefore the incisions for harvesting the nasolabial flap do not continue superiorly beyond the medial canthal tendon the nasolabial flap is a random flap that is emplaced with the proximal near portion resting upon the lateral wall of the nose and the distal far portion resting upon the cheek which contains the main angular artery and so is perfused with retrograde arterial flow36 surgical technique – the nasolabial flap the pedicle of the nasolabial flap rests upon the lateral nasal wall and is transposed a maximum of 60 degrees in order to avoid the bridge effect of a flap emplaced across the nasofacial angle the surgeon designs the nasolabial flap and sets its central axis at a 45degree angle from the long axis of the nasal dorsum the shape of the skin flap is cut from the wound template fabricated by the surgeon an incision is made to the flap without an anaesthetic injection of epinephrine which then is elevated and oriented in an inferiortosuperior direction between the subcutaneous fat and the muscle fascia the cutting continues until the skin flap can be freely transposed upon the nasal defect a burrow’s triangle is excised from the skin between the medial border of the flap and the nasal dorsum the triangle can be cut either before or after the elevation of the nasolabial the flap then is bent back reflected and can be thinned cut under loupe magnification however a nasolabial flap cannot be thinned as easily as an axial skinflap after the nasolabial flap has been emplaced the flap donorsite wound is sutured closed for a wound of the lateral nasal wall that is less than 15 mm wide the flap donorsite can be closed primarily with sutures for a wound wider than 15 mm—especially a wound that comprehends the alar lobule and the lateral wall of the nose—primary closure is not indicated because such a wound closure imposes excessive stresses upon the skin flap thereby risking either blanching whitening or distortion or both such risks are avoided by advancing moving the skin of the cheek towards the nasofacial junction where it is sutured to the deep tissues furthermore a narrow wound less than 1 mm wide can be allowed to heal by secondary intention autonomous reepithelialisation iii the paramedian forehead flap the paramedian forehead flap is the premier autologous skin graft for the reconstruction of a nose by replacing any of the aesthetic nasal subunits especially regarding the problems of different tissue thickness and skin color the forehead flap is an axial skin flap based upon the supraorbital artery an ophthalmic artery branch and the supratrochlear artery an ophthalmic artery terminus which can be thinned to the subdermal plexus in order to enhance the functional and aesthetic outcome of the nose restricted length is a practical application limit of the paramedian forehead flap especially when the patient has a low frontal hairline in such a patient a small portion of scalp skin can be included to the flap but it does have a different skin texture and does continue growing hair such mismatching is avoided with the transverse emplacement of the flap along the hairline yet that portion of the skin flap is random and so risks a greater incidence of necrosis the paramedian forehead flap has two disadvantages one operational and one aesthetic operationally the reconstruction of a nose with a paramedian forehead flap is a twostage surgical procedure which might a problem for the patient whose health surgical suitability includes significant secondary medical risks nonetheless the second stage of the nasal reconstruction can be performed with the patient under local anaesthesia aesthetically although the flap donorsite scar heals well it is noticeable and thus difficult to conceal especially in men33 rhinoplasty a paramedian forehead flap design surgical technique – the paramedian forehead flap the surgeon designs the paramedian forehead flap from a customfabricated threedimensional metal foil template derived from the measures of the nasal defect to be corrected using an ultrasonic scanner the flappedicle is centrealigned upon the doppler signal of the supraorbital artery afterwards the distal onehalf of the flap is dissected and thinned to the subdermal plexus the surgeon fabricates a metal foil template derived from the dimensions of the nasal wound applying a doppler ultrasonic scanner the surgeon identifies the axial pedicle of the tissueflap composed of the supraorbital artery and the supratrochlear artery usually at the base next to the medial brow the point usually is between the midline and the supraorbital notch tracing the doppler pulse of the blood flow of the supraorbital artery as far as possible its delineation is continued as a vertical line until it intersects with the hairline of the patient the line extended from the pulse of the blood flow is the central axis of the forehead flap the length of the flap is determined by placing an unfolded unstretched 4 × 4inch gauze upon the wound and with it measuring from the pedicle base to the distal farthest point of the wound this measure is the length of the central axis of the skin flap the template is rotated 180 degrees and placed over the distal far portion of the axis of the skin flap the surgeon outlines it with a surgical marker the outline markings are continued proximally and parallel to the central axis maintaining a 2cm width for the proximal flap without applying an injection of anaesthetic epinephrine the flap is incised cut and the distal onehalf is elevated between the frontalis muscle and the subcutaneous fat at approximately the midportion of the forehead the surgeon deepens the plane of the dissection down to the submuscular plane the dissection continues toward the brow and the glabella the smooth prominence between the eyebrows until the skin flap is sufficiently mobile to allow its relaxed transposition upon the nose under loupe magnification the distal portion of the forehead flap is defatted down to the subdermal plexus yet the fatremoval should be conservative especially if the patient is either a tobacco smoker or a diabetic or both because such health factors negatively affect blood circulation and tissue perfusion and thus the timely and correct healing of the surgical scars to the nose the flap is allowed to perfuse while the donor site is sutured closed by means of the wide undermining deep to the frontalis muscle at that time diluted epinephrine can be injected to the forehead skin but not to the areas near the pedicle of the forehead flap moreover if the distal wound is wider than 25 mm it usually is not closed by primary intention with sutures but is allowed to heal by secondary intention by reepithelialisation the forehead flap is attached to the nasal wound with subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures if the excess tension of a suture compromises the color of the skin flap the suture can be loosened with a skin hook and observed for 10–15 minutes if the skin color remains compromised white the suture is removed upon the complete attachment of the paramedian forehead flap to the nose the surgical wounds are dressed only with antibiotic ointment iv septal mucosal flap the septal mucosal tissue flap is the indicated technique for correcting defects of the distal half of the nose and for correcting almost every type of large defect of the mucosal lining of the nose the septal mucosal tissue flap which is an anteriorly based pediclegraft supplied with blood by the septal branch of the superior labial artery to perform such a nasal correction the entire septal mucoperichondrium can be harvested3738 surgical technique – the septal mucosal flap the surgeon cuts the anteriorly based septal mucosal tissueflap as widely as possible and then releases it with a low posterior backcut but only as required to allow the rotation of the tissueflap into the nasal wound the surgeon measures the dimensions length width depth of the nasal wound and then delineates them upon the nasal septum and if possible incorporates an additional margin of 3–5 mm of width to the wound measurements furthermore the base of the mucosal tissue flap should be at least 15cm wide the surgeon then makes two 2 parallel incisions along the floor and the roof of the nasal septum the incisions converge anteriorly towards the front of the nasal spine using an elevator the flap is dissected in a submucoperichondrial plane the far distal edge of the flap is cut with a rightangle beaver blade and then is transposed into the wound the exposed cartilages will reepithelialise regenerate the epithelium provided the opposite contralateral side of the septal mucosa is undisturbed a technical variant of the septal mucosal flap technique is the trapdoor flap which is used to reconstruct one side of the upper half of the nasal lining it is emplaced in the contralateral nasal cavity as a superiorly based septal mucosal flap of rectangular shape like that of a trapdoor this septomucosal flap variant is a random flap with its pedicle based at the junction of the septum and the lateral nasal skeleton the surgeon elevates the flap of septal mucosa to the roof of the nasal septum and then traverses it into the contralateral opposite nasal cavity through a slit made by removing a small narrow portion of the dorsal roof of the septum afterwards the septomucosal flap is stretched across the wound in the mucosal lining of the lateral nose33 surgical managementedit the following rhinoplastic techniques are applied to the surgical management of i partialthickness defects ii fullthickness defects iii heminasal reconstruction and iv total nasal reconstruction i partialthickness defects a partialthickness defect is a wound with adequate softtissue coverage of the underlying nasal skeleton yet is too large for primary intention closure with sutures based upon the locale of the wound the surgeon has two 2 options for correcting such a wound i healing the wound by secondary intention reepithelialisation and ii healing the wound with a fullthickness skin graft moreover because it avoids the patched appearance of a skingraft surgical correction healing by secondary intention can successfully repair nasal wounds up to 10 mm in diameter and if the resultant scar proves aesthetically unacceptable it can be revised later after the wound has healed in the event larger nasal wounds defects do successfully heal by secondary intention but do present two disadvantages first the resultant scar often is a wide patch of tissue that is aesthetically inferior to the scars produced with other nasaldefect correction techniques however the skin of the medial canthus is an exception to such scarring the second disadvantage to healing by secondary intention is that the contracture of the wound might distort the normal nasal anatomy which can lead to a pronounced deformity of the alar rim area for this reason healing by secondary intention generally is not recommended for defects of the distal third of the nose nonetheless the exception is a small wound directly upon the nasal tip fullthickness skin grafts are the effective woundmanagement technique for defects with a wellvascularized softtissue bed covering the nasal skeleton the patient’s ear is the preferred skingraft donor site from which to harvests grafts of preauricular skin and grafts of postauricular skin usually with an additional small amount of adipose tissue to fill the wound cavity yet nasal correction with a skin graft harvested from the patients neck is not recommended because that skin is lowdensity pilosebaceous tissue with very few follicles and sebaceous glands thus is unlike the oily skin of the nose the technical advantages of nasaldefect correction with a skin graft are a brief surgery time a simple rhinoplastic technique and a low incidence of tissue morbidity the most effective corrections are with a shallow wound with sufficient supporting softtissue that will prevent the occurrence of a conspicuous depression nonetheless two disadvantages of skingraft correction are mismatched skin color and skin texture which might result in a correction with a patchwork appearance a third disadvantage is the natural histologic tendency for such skin grafts to contract which might distort the shape of the corrected nose ii fullthickness defects fullthickness nasal defects are in three types i wounds to the skin and to the soft tissues featuring either exposed bone or exposed cartilage or both ii wounds extending through the nasal skeleton and iii wounds traversing all three nasal layers skin muscle and the osseocartilaginous framework based upon the dimensions length width depth and topographic locale of the wound and the number of missing nasaltissue layers the surgeon determines the rhinoplastic technique for correcting a fullthickness defect each of the aesthetic nasal subunits is considered separately and in combination a medial canthus the skin between the nasal dorsum and the medial canthal tendon is uniquely suited to healing by secondary intention the outcomes often are superior to what is achieved with either skin grafts or skinflaps and tissueflaps because the medial canthal tendon is affixed to the facial bone it readily resists the forces of wound contracture moreover the animation movement of the medial brow also lends resistance to the forces of wound contracture furthermore the medial canthal region is aesthetically hidden by the shadows of the nasal dorsum and of the supraorbital rim thereby obscuring any differences in the quality of the color and of the texture of the replacement skin epithelium healing by secondary intention reepithelialisation occurs even when the wound extends to the nasal bone although the rate of healing depends upon the patients woundhealing capacity nasal wounds measuring up to 10 mm in diameter usually heal in at 4weeks postoperative nonetheless one potential but rare complication of this nasal correction approach is the formation of a medial canthal web which can be corrected with two 2 opposing zplasties technique which relieves the disfiguring tensions exerted by the scar tissues contracture its shape and location on the nose rhinoplasty a basalcell carcinoma lesion on the juncture of the left alar base subunit and the left dorsal sidewall subunit ie on the left nostril rhinoplasty a divided section design used in mohs surgery for excising cancerous lesions before nasal reconstruction b nasal dorsum and lateral nasal wall defect the size of the nasal defect wound occurred in either the dorsum or the lateral wall or both determines the reconstructive skinflap technique applicable to the corresponding aesthetic nasal subunits a wound of less than 10 mm in diameter can be managed either by primary intention healing suturing or by secondary intention healing reepithelialisation a wound measuring 10–15 mm in diameter can be reconstructed with a singlestage modified bilobed flap because it best matches the skin color and the skin texture of the wounded aesthetic subunit although not every scar can be hidden at the margins of the aesthetic nasal subunits concerned the superior scarring ability of those nasal skin areas minimizes such an histologic disadvantage in a patient whose basalcell carcinoma was excised with mohs surgery the scar of the nasal reconstruction an 11 mm fullthickness laterally based bilobedflap applied down to the bone and the cartilage was hidden by aligning the axis of the second lobe to and emplacing the skin graft at the junction of the nasal dorsum and the lateral wall of the nose a wound greater than 15 mm in diameter can be corrected with a paramedian forehead flap which will reconstruct either the entire nasal dorsum or the lateral wall of the nose as required the surgical management of such wounds 15 mm dia usually requires enlarging the wound as necessary in order for the skin graft to comprehend the entire aesthetic subunit being corrected moreover if the wound comprehends the dorsum and the lateral wall of the nose then a cheekadvancement skin flap is the applicable correction for replacing the lateral nasal skin up to its junction with the dorsum afterwards a paramedian forehead flap is applied to resurface the nasal dorsum a wound in the lateral nasal wall that is greater than 15 mm in diameter can also be corrected with a superiorly based nasolabialflap which is especially suited for correcting distal defects that lay among the convexities of the nasal tip and the alar lobule the nasolabial flap can correct defects that comprehend the distal twothirds of the nose if there is a supply of skin sufficient for constructing the base of the flap pedicle and the donor sites cannot be closed primarily yet bulkiness is the principal disadvantage of the nasolabial flap—except in elderly patients with atrophic cheek skin nonetheless it is technically effective for patients unsuitable for a twostage rhinoplasty with a paramedian forehead flap nasal defects involving either the bone or the cartilage of the lateral nose are best managed with free grafts of flat septal bone and of cartilage small defects of the nasal dorsum can be covered with cartilage grafts harvested from either the septum or the concha of the ear the correction of largearea defects of the nasal dorsum requires the stable support of a bone graft affixed either with a lag screw or with a lowprofile plate a costal graft from the rib cage is ideal for such a repair because it can be harvested with an attached extension of cartilage that can be sculpted to blend into the nasal tip other potential donor sites for nasal dorsum reconstruction materials are the outer table of the skull the iliac crest and the inner table of the ilium proper to correct a defect of the nasal lining of the upper twothirds of the nose the wound dimensions length width depth determine the technique a nasallining defect of less than 5 mm in diameter can be closed primarily with sutures a nasallining defect 5–15 mm in diameter can be closed with a random transposition flap harvested from a nasal area that remains protected either by the nasal bones or by the upper lateral cartilages and the flap donorsite can be healed by secondary intention reepithelialisation for a mucosa defect greater than 15 mm in diameter the indicated correction is a superiorly based “trap door” septal mucosal flap grafted to the roof of the nasal septum c nasal tip defect the width of the human nasaltip ranges 20–30 mm the average width of the nasal tip measured between the two alar lobules is approximately 25 mm a nasal skin defect of less than 15 mm in diameter can be managed with a bilobed flap the surgeon trims the edges of the wound defect to match its dimensions length width depth to the natural curve at the border of the nasal tip if the wound is eccentric the skinflap is positioned so that the lateral base of the graft occupies the largest portion of the wound’s surface if the nasaltip wound is greater than 15 mm in diameter the surgeon enlarges it to comprehend the entire aesthetic subunit affected by the defect and the reconstruction of the nasal subunit done with a forehead flap if the nasaltip defect also involves the nasal dorsum a forehead flap is indicated for reconstructing the entire nasaltip and dorsum if an alar cartilage is missing either partially or entirely it is reconstructed with cartilage grafts the defect of an alar dome which retains adequate anatomic supporttripod configuration can be corrected with an onlay graft harvested either from the nasal septum or from the conchal cartilage of an ear the surgeon forms the cartilage graft into the shape of a shield—its widest margins become the replacement alar domes typically the shield cartilage graft is stacked in two layers in order to transmit the desired light reflex characteristic of the nasal tip defects of the lateral crura can be corrected with a flat strut of formed cartilage but if the support of the medial crura is absent then a columella strut must be inserted and attached at the level of the anterior nasal spine if a strut of nasalseptum cartilage proves too weak then a rib cartilage strut can be applied to provide the adequate nasal support afterwards the strut is covered with onlay grafts absent alar cartilages can be replaced using all of the conchal cartilage from both ears two strips each 10 mm wide are harvested from the antihelical fold and then are applied as replacement alar wings the surgeon attaches them to the anterior nasal spine and to each side of the pearshaped pyriform aperture the remainder of the harvested conchal cartilage is applied as onlay grafts to augment the nasal tip a nasaltip lining defect is unusual because of its midline location yet the reconstruction is with an anteriorly based septal mucosal flap that is rotated into place to provide adequate coverage and correction of the nasal lining defect vertical lobule division vld is a common technique for nasal tip refinement which involves the medial crural angle and the lateral crural angle39 d alar lobule defect the appropriate surgical management of an alar lobule defect depends upon the dimensions length width depth of the wound anatomically the nasal skin and the underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a semirigid aesthetic subunit that forms the graceful curve of the alar rim and provides unobstructed airflow through the nostrils the anterior nares when most of the alar lobule tissue is missing the nose collapses the correction is with an ear concha cartilagegraft harvested from the antihelix a donor site where the cartilage is most rigidly curved thus is ideal for replacing an alar lobule nasal skin defects can be corrected with a medially based bilobed flap which is emplaced to provide adequate skin coverage for wounds limited to the alar lobule if the entire lobule is missing it might be necessary to leave the secondlobe donorsite wound partially open it will close at 2–4 weeks postoperative afterwards the scar can be revised nonetheless the alternative surgical correction is a twostage superiorly based nasolabial flap if the alar lobule defect also comprehends the lateral wall of the nose the defect can be closed either with a superiorly based nasolabialflap or with a forehead flap if the cheek skin is thin and atrophic a nasolabial flap is the recommended reconstruction otherwise a forehead flap is recommended because the thickness of forehead skin is a superior match for nasal skin and tissue mucosal lining defects of the alar lobule can be resurfaced with a bipedicled mucosal advancementflap harvested from inside the lateral wall of the nose likewise larger defects of the mucosa do require correction with an anteriorly based septal mucosal flap iii heminasal and total nasal reconstruction the reconstruction rhinoplasty of an extensive heminasal defect or of a total nasal defect is an extension of the plastic surgical principles applied to resolving the loss of a regional aesthetic subunit the skin layers are replaced with a paramedian forehead flap but if forehead skin is unavailable the alternative corrections include the washio retroauriculartemporal flap and the tagliacozzi flap the nasal skeleton is replaced with a ribgraft nasal dorsum and lateral nasal wall septal cartilage grafts and conchal cartilage grafts are applied to correct defects of the nasal tip and of the alar lobules4041 the nasal lining of the distal twothirds of the nose can be covered with anteriorly based septal mucosal flaps however if bilateral septalflaps are used the septal cartilage does become devascularized possibly from iatrogenic septal perforation furthermore if the nasal defect is beyond the woundcorrection scope of a septal mucosal flap the alternative techniques are either an inferiorly based pericranialflap harvested from the frontal bone or a free flap of temporoparietal fascia harvested from the head either of which can be lined with free grafts of mucosa to achieve the nasal reconstruction corrections of defect and deformityedit cancer – the excision of cancerous nasal skin can cause the loss of skin and internal support cartilage such resections surgical removal usually are via the mohs’ chemosurgical technique after removing the cancerous tissues the reconstructive rhinoplasty will provide skin coverage using either skin grafts or pedicle flaps see nasal reconstruction paramedian forehead flap if the resection of the cancerous skin leads to losing the nose tip cartilage grafts can be used for support and to prevent longterm distortion consequent to the force of the contracture of scar tissue revision rhinoplasty the american actor wc fields was afflicted with rhinophyma congenital deformity – the correction of vascular malformations and cleft lip and palate abnormalities in vascular malformations the progression of the disease distorts the skin and the underlying structure of the nose cleft lip and cleft palate defects usually distort the size position and orientation of the nasaltip cartilages reconstruction of vascular malformations can involve laser treatment of the skin and surgical excision of the deformed tissues when the underlying cartilage support structure is disturbed cartilage grafts and suturing of the native nasal cartilages can help improve nasal aesthetics by reorienting the nasal tip cartilages and cartilagegraft refinements to the nose tip are performed as required42 obstructed airways – the restoration of normal breathing by correcting nasal obstruction caused by a cosmetic rhinoplasty wherein nasal cartilages were overaggressively trimmed and the nose appears pinched which compromises nasal potency airflow especially when the patient attempts deep inspiration these grafting techniques restore normal breathing by increasing the size of the nose tip with baton grafts internal cartilage and spreader grafts to widen the nasal middle vault furthermore to improve breathing a septoplasty can be performed concurrent to the reconstructive surgery likewise if there is turbinate hypertrophy an inferior turbinectomy can be performed43 perforated septum – the reconstruction of a saddle nose caused by a collapsed perforated septum or by autoimmune problems such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis gpa sarcoidosis eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis egpa relapsing polychondritis by intranasal drug use and by excessive nasal aerosol use the saddle nose deformity resulting from lost dorsum support is reconstructed using autologous bone grafts and rib cartilage grafts44 rhinophyma – the correction of latestage rosacea wherein the nasal skin is infected with acne rosacea that reddens thickens and enlarges the nose tip an exemplar case is the american actor wc fields although antibiotic acne treatments eg acutane can halt the progression of rosacea the thickened skin and the fleshy obscuring of the nasal tip can only be corrected with rhinoplasty laser excision of abnormally thickened skin is the best rhinoplastic treatment for rhinophyma the co2 laser and the infrared erbium yag laser are the most effective treatments45 illustration 2 nosenarrowing rhinoplasty two chisel cuts green and black arrows meet at the red zigzag line to release the bone for corrective realignment illustration 1 the nasal bones violet of the dorsum identified for effecting a nosenarrowing rhinoplasty wide nose – to narrow a toowide nose the plastic surgeon cuts contours and rearranges the craniofacial bones to achieve the desired functional and aesthetic outcome of a narrower straighter nose to leave no visible surgical scars upon the new nose the surgeon effects the osteotome bone chisel incisions to the nasal bones beneath the facial skin illustration 1 the surgeon cuts the excessively wide bones of the upper nasal dorsum violet with an osteotome bone chisel then detaches corrects and relocates them inwards to a position between the ocular orbits red that narrows the width of the nasal dorsum illustration 2 the surgeon chisels two cuts incisions to the nasal bones each incision begins at the nasal cavity the first incision begins at the yellow dot and extends upwards along the green arrow until meeting the zigzag line red the second incision begins at the blue dot and extends upwards along the black arrow until meeting the zigzag line red once cut and loosened from the face the nasal bone pieces are corrected then pushed inwards and reset thus narrowing the nose rhinoplastic instruments an osteotome bone chisel and a surgical hammer for

discoloration is consequent to trauma and ocular blood vessel disruption post–surgical recoveryedit convalescence the rhinoplasty patient returns home after surgery to rest and allow the nasal cartilage and bone tissues to heal the effects of having been forcefully cut assisted with prescribed medications—antibiotics analgesics steroids—to alleviate pain and aid wound healing the patient convalesces for about 1week and can go outdoors postoperatively external sutures are removed at 4–5 days the external cast is removed at 1week the stents are removed within 4–14 days and the panda eyes periorbital bruising heal at 2weeks if an alar base reduction is performed conjunctively within the rhinoplasty these sutures need to be removed within 7–10 days post operatively throughout the first year postoperative in the course of the rhinoplastic wounds healing the tissues will shift moderately as they settle into being a new nose risksedit this article needs additional citations for

rhinoplasty is safe yet complications can arise postoperative bleeding is uncommon but usually resolves without treatment infection is rare but when it does occur it might progress to become an abscess requiring the surgical drainage of the pus whilst the patient is under general anaesthesia adhesions scars that obstruct the airways can form a bridge across the nasal cavity from the septum to the turbinates and require surgical removal if too much of the osseocartilaginous framework is removed the consequent weakening can cause the external nasal skin to become shapeless resulting in a polly beak deformity resembling the beak of a parrot likewise if the septum is unsupported the bridge of the nose can sink resulting in a saddle nose deformity the tip of the nose can be overrotated causing the nostrils to be too visible resulting in a porcine nose if the cartilages of the nose tip are overresected it can cause a pinchedtip nose if the columella is incorrectly cut variabledegree numbness might result which requires a monthslong resolution furthermore in the course of the rhinoplasty the surgeon might accidentally perforate the septum septal perforation which later can cause chronic nose bleeding crusting of nasal fluids difficult breathing and whistling breathing a turbinectomy may result in empty nose syndrome nonsurgical rhinoplastyedit main article nonsurgical rhinoplasty nonsurgical rhinoplasty is a medical procedure in which injectable fillers such as collagen or hyaluronic acid are used to alter and shape a persons nose without invasive surgery the procedure fills in depressed areas on the nose lifting the angle of the tip or smoothing the appearance of bumps on the bridge46 the procedure does not alter nose size though it can be used to correct some functional birth defects originally developed at the turn of the twentyfirst century early attempts used biologically harmful softtissue fillers such as paraffin wax and silicone after 2000 physicians such as andrew tuananh le successfully developed benign techniques using modern fillers4748 see alsoedit otolaryngology oral and maxillofacial surgery nasal reconstruction using a
