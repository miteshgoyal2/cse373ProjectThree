jordan and his wife leona née kile she attended emerson elementary school there and was known to her classmates as duane jordan she had a younger sibling jerry at 12 her father moved the family to mt vernon illinois where she graduated from mt vernon township high school in 1948 she graduated from barnard college of columbia university after she received her associate degree from stephens college then only a twoyear institution in columbia missouri in 1968 kirkpatrick earned a phd in political science from columbia4 she spent a year of postgraduate study at sciences po at the university of paris which helped her learn french she was fluent in spanish5 though she ultimately became a conservative as a college freshman in 1945 she joined the young peoples socialist league the youth wing of the socialist party of america influenced by her grandfather who was a founder of the populist and socialist parties in oklahoma6 as kirkpatrick recalled at a symposium in 2002 it wasnt easy to find the ypsl in columbia missouri but i had read about it and i wanted to be one we had a very limited number of activities in columbia missouri we had an antifranco rally which was a worthy cause you could raise a question about how relevant it was likely to be in columbia missouri but it was in any case a worthy cause we also planned a socialist picnic which we spent quite a lot of time organizing eventually i regret to say the ypsl chapter after much discussion many debates and some downright quarrels broke up over the socialist picnic i thought that was rather discouraging6 at columbia university her principal adviser was franz leopold neumann a revisionist marxist in 1967 she joined the faculty of georgetown university and became a full professor of government in 1973 she became active in politics as a democrat in the 1970s and was involved in the later campaigns of former vice president and democratic presidential candidate hubert humphrey along with humphrey she was close to henry jackson who ran for the democratic nomination for president in 1972 and in 19764 she was opposed to the candidacy of george mcgovern in 1976 she joined with richard v allen and others to found the committee on the present danger for the purpose of warning americans against the soviet unions growing military power and the dangers of the salt ii treaty7 she also served on the platform committee for the democratic party in 19768 kirkpatrick published a number of articles in political science journals reflecting her disillusionment with the democratic party with specific criticism of the foreign policy of democratic president jimmy carter her most well known piece was dictatorships and double standards published in commentary in november 19799 in that piece kirkpatrick mentioned what she saw as a difference between authoritarian regimes and the totalitarian regimes such as the soviet union sometimes it was necessary to work with authoritarian regimes if it suited american purposes4 no idea holds greater sway in the mind of educated americans than the belief that it is possible to democratize governments anytime and anywhere under any circumstances  decades if not centuries are normally required for people to acquire the necessary disciplines and habits in britain the road to democratic government took seven centuries to traverse  the speed with which armies collapse bureaucracies abdicate and social structures dissolve once the autocrat is removed frequently surprises american policymakers1 cabinetedit jeane kirkpatrick center with the other members of the reagan administration 1981 kirkpatrick left in red among the reagan cabinet 1984 the piece came to the attention of ronald reagan through his national security adviser richard v allen4 kirkpatrick then became a foreign policy adviser throughout reagans 1980 campaign and presidency and after his election to the presidency ambassador to the united nations which she held for four years the economist writes that until then she had never spent time with a republican before1 on the way to her first meeting with him she told allen listen dick i am an aflcio democrat and i am quite concerned that my meeting ronald reagan on any basis will be misunderstood7 she asked reagan if he minded having a lifelong democrat on his team he replied that he himself had been a democrat until he was 51 and in any event he liked her way of thinking about american foreign policy5 she was one of the strongest supporters of argentinas military dictatorship following the march 1982 argentine invasion of the united kingdoms falkland islands which triggered the falklands war kirkpatrick had a soft spot for argentinas general leopoldo galtieri1 and favored neutrality rather than the probritish policy favored by secretary of state alexander haig5 kirkpatrick who according to british un ambassador sir anthony parsons was very mixed up with latin american policy even went as far as supporting the argentinian dictatorship by urging the reagan administration to act as outlined as in the rio pact of 1947 which stated that an attack against one state in the hemisphere should be considered an attack against them all10 british ambassador sir nicholas henderson allegedly characterized her in a diplomatic cable as more fool than fascist  she appears to be one of americas owngoal scorers tactless wrongheaded ineffective and a dubious tribute to the academic profession to which she expresses her allegiance11 the reagan administration ultimately decided to declare support for the british making her vote for united nations security council resolution 502 at the 1984 republican national convention she delivered the blame america first keynote speech4 which renominated reagan by praising his administrations foreign policy5 while excoriating the leadership of what she called the san francisco democrats the democrats had just held their convention in san francisco for the partys shift away from the policies of harry s truman and john f kennedy to a more strident antiwar position for which the leftwing of the democratic party had pushed since the vietnam war it was the first time since the 1952 speech from douglas macarthur that a nonparty member had delivered the republican conventions keynote address8 kirkpatrick a member of the national security council did not get along with either secretary of state haig or his successor george shultz she disagreed with shultz most notably on the irancontra affair in which she supported skimming money off arms sales to fund the nicaraguan contras5 while shultz told kirkpatrick that it would be an impeachable offense to do so because of the massacres perpetrated by that group1 shultz threatened to resign if kirkpatrick was appointed national security adviser5 kirkpatrick was more closely allied with secretary of defense caspar weinberger and head of the cia william j casey on the issue12 kirkpatricks foreign policy while applauded by conservatives has been criticized by some historians and intellectuals chiefly on the grounds that she worked solely for the interest of american corporations in central america and so actually worked to undermine democratic government in nicaragua and to suppress democratic movements in el salvador and guatemala noam chomsky for example referred to her as the chief sadistinresidence of the reagan administration and went on to criticize what he called the hypocrisy of supporting brutal military regimes that showed no respect for human rights or democracy while claiming to be protecting the region from communism13 author lars schoultz has argued that her policy was based on her belief that latin americans are pathologically violent and goes on to criticize that as a prejudice with no factual basis14 ambassador to unedit kirkpatrick with president ronald reagan in the oval office kirkpatrick said what takes place in the security council more closely resembles a mugging than either a political debate or an effort at problemsolving15 still she finished her term with a certain respect for the normative power of the united nations as the institution whose majorities claim the right to decide—for the world—what is legitimate and what is illegitimate16 she noted that the united states had increasingly ignored that significance and became increasingly isolated17 that was problematic because relative isolation in a body like the united nations is a sign of impotence18 especially given its ability to shape international attitudes19 she was ambassador to the un during the september 1 1983 soviet shooting down of korean air lines flight 007 near moneron island it had carried 269 passengers and crew including a sitting congressman larry mcdonald dga she played before the security council the audio of the electronic intercept of the interceptor pilot during the attack and the soviet union could no longer deny its responsibility for the shootdowncitation needed kirkpatrick was a board member of the american foundation for resistance international and the national council to support the democracy movements intended to help bring down soviet and east european communism along with vladimir bukovsky martin colman and richard perle she worked to organize democratic revolutions against communismcitation needed according to jay nordlinger on a visit with american dignitaries soviet human rights activist andrei sakharov said kirkpatski kirkpatski which of you is kirkpatski when others pointed to kirkpatrick he said your name is known in every cell in the gulag because she had named soviet political prisoners on the floor of the un12 kirkpatrick said she would serve only one term at the un and stepped down in april 19855 views on israeledit kirkpatrick was a staunch supporter of israel20 during her ambassadorship at the united nations she considered its frequent criticism and condemnation of the jewish state as holding israel to a double standard which she attributed to hostility and regarded as politically motivated in 1989 mohammed wahby press director of egypts information bureau wrote to the washington post jeane kirkpatrick has somehow consistently opposed any attempt to resolve the arab–israeli conflict however in a 1989 oped kirkpatrick warned secretary of state james baker and bush not to get involved in the conflict because any intervention would fail21 kirkpatrick frequently expressed disdain for what she perceived to be disproportionate attention towards israels at the expense of others conflicts22 antidefamation league president abraham foxman issued a press release upon her death she will be fondly remembered for her unwavering and valiant support of the state of israel and her unequivocal opposition to antisemitism especially during her tenure at the united nations she was always a true friend of the jewish people23 political viewsedit comparing authoritarian and totalitarian regimes she said authoritarian regimes really typically dont have complete command economies authoritarian regimes typically have some kind of traditional economy with some private ownership the nazi regime left ownership in private hands but the state assumed control of the economy control was separated from ownership but it was really a command economy because it was controlled by the state a command economy is an attribute of a totalitarian state24 explaining her disillusionment with international organizations especially the united nations she stated as i watched the behavior of the nations of the un including our own i found no reasonable ground to expect any one of those governments to transcend permanently their own national interests for those of another country i conclude that it is a fundamental mistake to think that salvation justice or virtue come through merely human institutions democracy not only requires equality but also an unshakable conviction in the value of each person who is then equal cross cultural experience teaches us not simply that people have different beliefs but that people seek meaning and understand themselves in some sense as members of a cosmos ruled by god regarding socialism she said as i read the utopian socialists the scientific socialists the german social democrats and revolutionary socialists—whatever i could in either english or french—i came to the conclusion that almost all of them including my grandfather were engaged in an effort to change human nature the more i thought about it the more i thought this was not likely to be a successful effort so i turned my attention more and more to political philosophy and less and less to socialist activism of any kind6 later lifeedit in april 1985 kirkpatrick became a republican a move which the economist called her only recourse after her speech at the 1984 republican convention1 she returned to teaching at georgetown university and became a fellow at the american enterprise institute a washington dc think tank and a contributor to the american freedom journal in 1993 she cofounded empower america a publicpolicy organization she was also on the advisory board of the national association of scholars a group that works against what it regards as a liberal bias in universities in the united states with its emphasis on multicultural education and affirmative action kirkpatrick briefly considered running for president in 1988 against george h w bush because she believed he was not tough enough on communism15 kirkpatrick endorsed senator robert dole of kansas who was the runner up to bush despite a strong showing in the iowa caucuses doles campaign quickly faded after he lost the new hampshire primary in february 1988 kirkpatrick was an active surrogate campaigner for dole even as he was losing as was her old foe alexander haig who endorsed dole after ending his own 1988 campaign several days before the new hampshire primarycitation needed along with empower america codirectors william bennett and jack kemp she called on the congress to issue a formal declaration of war against the entire fundamentalist islamist terrorist network the day after the september 11 attacks on the world trade center in 2003 she headed the us delegation to the united nations commission on human rights kirkpatrick was appointed to the board of directors of idt corp in 20043 it was revealed after her death that in 2003 she was sent as a us envoy to meet an arab delegation and attempt to convince them to support the iraq war she was supposed to argue that preemptive war was justifiable but she knew that it would not work and instead argued that saddam hussein had consistently gone against the un5 however she described george w bush as a bit too interventionist for my taste and felt that what she described as moral imperialism was not taken seriously anywhere outside a few places in washington dc1 personal lifeedit on february 20 1955 she married evron maurice kirkpatrick who was a scholar and a former member of the oss the world war iiera predecessor of the cia her husband died in 1995

to face the truth about themselves no matter how pleasant it is i dont think the government of el salvador was responsible the nuns were not just nuns the nuns were political activists we ought to be
