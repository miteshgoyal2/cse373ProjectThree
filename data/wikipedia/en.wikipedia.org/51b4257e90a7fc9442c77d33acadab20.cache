january 1901 until his death in 1910 the eldest son of queen victoria and prince albert of saxecoburg and gotha edward was related to royalty throughout europe before his accession to the throne he served as heir apparent and held the title of prince of wales for longer than any of his predecessors during the long reign of his mother he was largely excluded from political power and came to personify the fashionable leisured elite he travelled throughout britain performing ceremonial public duties and represented britain on visits abroad his tours of north america in 1860 and the indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother as king edward played a role in the modernisation of the british home fleet and the reorganisation of the british army after the second boer war he reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised he fostered good relations between britain and other european countries especially france for which he was popularly called peacemaker but his relationship with his nephew the german emperor wilhelm ii was poor the edwardian era which covered edwards reign and was named after him coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism he died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the parliament act 1911 which

was the eldest son and second child of queen victoria and her husband and first cousin prince albert of saxecoburg and gotha he was christened albert edward at st georges chapel windsor castle on 25 january 1842a he was named albert after his father and edward after his maternal grandfather prince edward duke of kent and strathearn he was known as bertie to the royal family throughout his life3 as the eldest son of the british sovereign he was automatically duke of cornwall and duke of rothesay at birth as a son of prince albert he also held the titles of prince of saxecoburg and gotha and duke of saxony he was created prince of wales and earl of chester on 8 december 1841 earl of dublin on 17 january 1850 a knight of the garter on 9 november 1858 and a knight of the thistle on 24 may 18674 in 1863 he renounced his succession rights to the duchy of saxecoburg and gotha in favour of his younger brother prince alfred5 queen victoria and prince albert were determined that their eldest son should have an education that would prepare him to be a model constitutional monarch at age seven edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by prince albert and supervised by several tutors unlike his elder sister victoria edward did not excel in his studies6 he tried to meet the expectations of his parents but to no avail although edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those of charm sociability and tact—benjamin disraeli described him as informed intelligent and of sweet manner7 after the completion of his secondarylevel studies his tutor was replaced by a personal governor robert bruce after an educational trip to rome undertaken in the first few months of 1859 he spent the summer of that year studying at the university of edinburgh under among others the chemist lyon playfair in october he matriculated as an undergraduate at christ church oxford8 now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents he enjoyed studying for the first time and performed satisfactorily in examinations9 in 1861 he transferred to trinity college cambridge10 where he was tutored in history by charles kingsley regius professor of modern history11 kingsleys efforts brought forth the best academic performances of edwards life and edward actually looked forward to his lectures12 early adulthoodedit edward at niagara falls 1860 in 1860 edward undertook the first tour of north america by a prince of wales his genial good humour and confident bonhomie made the tour a great success13 he inaugurated the victoria bridge montreal across the st lawrence river and laid the cornerstone of parliament hill ottawa he watched charles blondin traverse niagara falls by highwire and stayed for three days with president james buchanan at the white house buchanan accompanied the prince to mount vernon to pay his respects at the tomb of george washington vast crowds greeted him everywhere he met henry wadsworth longfellow ralph waldo emerson and oliver wendell holmes prayers for the royal family were said in trinity church new york for the first time since 177613 the fourmonth tour throughout canada and the united states considerably boosted edwards confidence and selfesteem and had many diplomatic benefits for great britain14 edward had hoped to pursue a career in the british army but his mother vetoed an active military career15 he had been gazetted colonel on 9 november 185816—to his disappointment as he had wanted to earn his commission by examination9 in september 1861 edward was sent to germany supposedly to watch military manoeuvres but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and princess alexandra of denmark the eldest daughter of prince christian of denmark and his wife louise queen victoria and prince albert had already decided that edward and alexandra should marry they met at speyer on 24 september under the auspices of his elder sister victoria who had married the crown prince of prussia in 185817 edwards elder sister acting upon instructions from their mother had met princess alexandra at strelitz in june the young danish princess made a very favourable impression edward and alexandra were friendly from the start the meeting went well for both sides and marriage plans advanced18 from this time edward gained a reputation as a playboy determined to get some army experience edward attended manoeuvres in ireland during which he spent three nights with an actress nellie clifden who was hidden in the camp by his fellow officers19 prince albert though ill was appalled and visited edward at cambridge to issue a reprimand albert died in december 1861 just two weeks after the visit queen victoria was inconsolable wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life and blamed edward for his fathers death20 at first she regarded her son with distaste as frivolous indiscreet and irresponsible she wrote to her eldest daughter i never can or shall look at him without a shudder21 marriageedit once widowed queen victoria effectively withdrew from public life shortly after prince alberts death she arranged for edward to embark on an extensive tour of the middle east visiting egypt jerusalem damascus beirut and constantinople22 the british government wanted edward to secure the friendship of egypts ruler said pasha to prevent french control of the suez canal if the ottoman empire collapsed it was the first royal tour on which an official photographer francis bedford was in attendance23 as soon as edward returned to britain preparations were made for his engagement which was sealed at laeken in belgium on 9 september 186224 edward married alexandra at st georges chapel windsor castle on 10 march 1863 he was 21 she was 18 edward and alexandra on their wedding day 1863 the couple established marlborough house as their london residence and sandringham house in norfolk as their country retreat they entertained on a lavish scale their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles because most of queen victorias relations were german and denmark was at loggerheads with germany over the territories of schleswig and holstein when alexandras father inherited the throne of denmark in november 1863 the german confederation took the opportunity to invade and annex schleswigholstein queen victoria was of two minds whether it was a suitable match given the political climate25 after the marriage she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters including the names of their children26 edward had mistresses throughout his married life he socialised with actress lillie langtry lady randolph churchill born jennie jerome the mother of winston churchillb daisy greville countess of warwick actress sarah bernhardt noblewoman lady susan vanetempest singer hortense schneider prostitute giulia beneni known as la barucci wealthy humanitarian agnes keyser and alice keppel at least fiftyfive liaisons are conjectured28 how far these relationships went is not always clear edward always strove to be discreet but this did not prevent society gossip or press speculation29 one of alice keppels greatgranddaughters camilla parker bowles became the mistress and subsequently wife of charles prince of wales one of edwards greatgreatgrandsons it was rumoured that camillas grandmother sonia keppel born in may 1900 was the illegitimate daughter of edward but she was almost certainly the daughter of george keppel whom she resembled30 edward never acknowledged any illegitimate children31 alexandra is believed to have been aware of many of his affairs and to have accepted them32 in 1869 sir charles mordaunt a british member of parliament threatened to name edward as corespondent in his divorce suit ultimately he did not do so but edward was called as a witness in the case in early 1870 it was shown that edward had visited the mordaunts house while sir charles was away sitting in the house of commons although nothing further was proven and edward denied he had committed adultery the suggestion of impropriety was damaging933 in the 1880s edward was a regular habitué of parisian brothels most notably le chabanais which was regarded as the top establishment in paris where brothels were legal one room contained a custom made bath which was sometimes filled with champagne and a specially designed and crafted siège damour love seat that allowed easy access for oral and other forms of sex for two or three people it is now a museum piece343536 heir apparentedit during queen victorias widowhood edward pioneered the idea of royal public appearances as we understand them today—for example opening the thames embankment in 1871 the mersey tunnel in 1886 and tower bridge in 189437—but his mother did not allow edward an active role in the running of the country until 18983839 he was sent summaries of important government documents but she refused to give him access to the originals9 he annoyed his mother by siding with denmark on the schleswigholstein question in 1864 she was progerman and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet giuseppe garibaldi40 liberal prime minister william ewart gladstone sent him papers secretly9 from 1886 foreign secretary lord rosebery sent him foreign office despatches and from 1892 some cabinet papers were opened to him9 in 1870 republican sentiment in britain was given a boost when the french emperor napoleon iii was defeated in the francoprussian war and the french third republic was declared41 however in the winter of 1871 a brush with death led to an improvement in both edwards popularity with the public and his relationship with his mother while staying at londesborough lodge near scarborough north yorkshire edward contracted typhoid the disease that was believed to have killed his father there was great national concern and one of his fellow guests lord chesterfield died edwards recovery was greeted with almost universal relief9 public celebrations included the composition of arthur sullivans festival te deum edward cultivated politicians from all parties including republicans as his friends and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him42 edward front centre in india 1876 in october 1875 edward set off for india on an extensive eightmonth tour of the subcontinent his advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same regardless of their social station or colour in letters home he complained of the treatment of the native indians by the british officials because a man has a black face and a different religion from our own there is no reason why he should be treated as a brute43 consequently lord salisbury the secretary of state for india issued new guidance and at least one resident was removed from office9 at the end of the tour queen victoria was given the title empress of india by parliament in part as a result of the tours success44 he was regarded worldwide as an arbiter of mens fashions4546 he made wearing tweed homburg hats and norfolk jackets fashionable and popularised the wearing of black ties with dinner jackets instead of white tie and tails47 he pioneered the pressing of trouser legs from side to side in preference to the now normal front and back creases48 and was thought to have introduced the standup turndown shirt collar49 a stickler for proper dress he is said to have admonished lord salisbury for wearing the trousers of an elder brother of trinity house with a privy councillors coat deep in an international crisis salisbury informed the prince that it had been a dark morning and that my mind must have been occupied by some subject of less importance50 the tradition of men not buttoning the bottom button of waistcoats is said to be linked to edward who supposedly left his undone because of his large girth951 his waist measured 48 inches 122 cm shortly before his coronation52 he introduced the practice of eating roast beef and potatoes with horseradish sauce and yorkshire pudding on sundays a meal that remains a staple british favourite for sunday lunch53 he was not a heavy drinker though he did drink champagne and occasionally port54 edward was a patron of the arts and sciences and helped found the royal college of music he opened the college in 1883 with the words class can no longer stand apart from class  i claim for music that it produces that union of feeling which i much desire to promote44 at the same time he enjoyed gambling and country sports and was an enthusiastic hunter he ordered all the clocks at sandringham to run half an hour ahead to provide more daylight time for shooting this socalled tradition of sandringham time continued until 1936 when it was abolished by edward viii55 he also laid out a golf course at windsor by the 1870s the future king had taken a keen interest in horseracing and steeplechasing in 1896 his horse persimmon won both the derby stakes and the st leger stakes in 1900 persimmons brother diamond jubilee won five races derby st leger 2000 guineas stakes newmarket stakes and eclipse stakes56 and another of edwards horses ambush ii won the grand national57 edward right with his mother centre and russian relations tsar nicholas ii left empress alexandra and baby grand duchess olga nikolaevna 1896 in 1891 edward was embroiled in the royal baccarat scandal when it was revealed he had played an illegal card game for money the previous year the prince was forced to appear as a witness in court for a second time when one of the participants unsuccessfully sued his fellow players for slander after being accused of cheating58 in the same year edward was involved in a personal conflict when lord charles beresford threatened to reveal details of edwards private life to the press as a protest against edward interfering with beresfords affair with daisy greville countess of warwick the friendship between the two men was irreversibly damaged and their bitterness would last for the remainder of their lives59 usually edwards outbursts of temper were shortlived and after he had let himself go  he would smooth matters by being especially nice60 in late 1891 edwards eldest son albert victor was engaged to princess victoria mary of teck just a few weeks later in early 1892 albert victor died of pneumonia edward was griefstricken to lose our eldest son he wrote is one of those calamities one can never really get over edward told queen victoria i would have given my life for him as i put no value on mine61 albert victor was the second of edwards children to die in 1871 his youngest son alexander john had died just 24 hours after being born edward had insisted on placing alexander john in a coffin personally with the tears rolling down his cheeks62 on his way to denmark through belgium on 4 april 1900 edward was the victim of an attempted assassination when fifteenyearold jeanbaptiste sipido shot at him in protest over the boer war sipido though obviously guilty was acquitted by a belgian court because he was underage63 the perceived laxity of the belgian authorities combined with british disgust at belgian atrocities in the congo worsened the already poor relations between the united kingdom and the continent however in the next ten years edwards affability and popularity as well as his use of family connections assisted britain in building european alliances64 accessionedit when queen victoria died on 22 january 1901 edward became king of the united kingdom emperor of india and in an innovation king of the british dominions65 he chose to reign under the name edward vii instead of albert edward—the name his mother had intended for him to usec—declaring that he did not wish to undervalue the name of albert and diminish the status of his father with whom the name should stand alone66 the numeral vii was occasionally omitted in scotland even by the national church in deference to protests that the previous edwards were english kings who had been excluded from scotland by battle9 j b priestley recalled i was only a child when he succeeded victoria in 1901 but i can testify to his extraordinary popularity he was in fact the most popular king england had known since the earlier 1660s67 caricature in puck magazine 1901 he donated his parents house osborne on the isle of wight to the state and continued to live at sandringham68 he could afford to be magnanimous his private secretary sir francis knollys claimed that he was the first heir to succeed to the throne in credit69 edwards finances had been ably managed by sir dighton probyn comptroller of the household and had benefited from advice from edwards jewish financier friends such as ernest cassel maurice de hirsch and the rothschild family70 at a time of widespread antisemitism edward attracted criticism for openly socialising with jews7172 edwards coronation had originally been scheduled for 26 june 1902 however two days before on 24 june he was diagnosed with appendicitis73 appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made lifesaving surgery possible74 sir frederick treves with the support of lord lister performed a thenradical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision through  4 1⁄2inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer75 the next day edward was sitting up in bed smoking a cigar76 two weeks later it was announced that the king was out of danger treves was honoured with a baronetcy which edward had arranged before the operation77 and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream74 edward was crowned at westminster abbey on 9 august 1902 by the 80yearold archbishop of canterbury frederick temple who died only four months later73 edward refurbished the royal palaces reintroduced the traditional ceremonies such as the state opening of parliament that his mother had forgone and founded new honours such as the order of merit to recognise contributions to the arts and sciences78 in 1902 the shah of persia mozzafaraldin visited england expecting to receive the order of the garter edward refused to bestow the honour on the shah because the order was meant to be in his personal gift and the foreign secretary lord lansdowne had promised it without his consent edward also objected to inducting a muslim into a christian order of chivalry his refusal threatened to damage british attempts to gain influence in persia79 but edward resented his ministers attempts to reduce the kings traditional powers80 eventually he relented and britain sent a special embassy to the shah with a full order of the garter the following year81 uncle of europeedit edward vii relaxing at balmoral castle photographed by his wife alexandra as king edwards main interests lay in the fields of foreign affairs and naval and military matters fluent in french and german he reinvented royal diplomacy by numerous state visits across europe82 he took annual holidays in biarritz and marienbad55 one of his most important foreign trips was an official visit to france in may 1903 as the guest of president émile loubet following a visit to the pope in rome this trip helped create the atmosphere for the anglofrench entente cordiale an agreement delineating british and french colonies in north africa and ruling out any future war between the two countries the entente was negotiated in 1904 between the french foreign minister théophile delcassé and the british foreign secretary lord lansdowne it marked the end of centuries of anglofrench rivalry and britains splendid isolation from continental affairs and attempted to counterbalance the growing dominance of the german empire and its ally austriahungary83 edward was related to nearly every other european monarch and came to be known as the uncle of europe38 german emperor wilhelm ii and emperor nicholas ii of russia were his nephews queen victoria eugenia of spain crown princess margaret of sweden crown princess marie of romania crown princess sophia of greece and empress alexandra of russia were his nieces king haakon vii of norway was both his nephew and his soninlaw kings frederick viii of denmark and george i of greece were his brothersinlaw kings albert i of belgium ferdinand of bulgaria and charles i and manuel ii of portugal were his second cousins edward doted on his grandchildren and indulged them to the consternation of their governesses84 however there was one relation whom edward did not like wilhelm ii edwards difficult relationship with his nephew exacerbated the tensions between germany and britain85 in april 1908 during edwards annual stay at biarritz he accepted the resignation of british prime minister sir henry campbellbannerman in a break with precedent edward asked campbellbannermans successor h h asquith to travel to biarritz to kiss hands asquith complied but the press criticised the action of the king in appointing a prime minister on foreign soil instead of returning to britain86 in june 1908 edward became the first reigning british monarch to visit the russian empire despite refusing to visit in 1906 when anglorussian relations were strained in the aftermath of the russojapanese war the dogger bank incident and the tsars dissolution of the duma87 the previous month edward visited the scandinavian countries becoming the first british monarch to visit sweden88 political opinionsedit edward depicted in naval uniform by vanity fair magazine 1902 while prince of wales edward had to be dissuaded from breaking with constitutional precedent by openly voting for gladstones representation of the people bill 1884 in the house of lords989 on other matters he was less progressive he did not for example favour giving votes to women990 although he did suggest that the social reformer octavia hill serve on the commission for working class housing91 he was also opposed to irish home rule instead preferring a form of dual monarchy9 as prince of wales he had come to enjoy warm and mutually respectful relations with w e gladstone whom his mother detested92 but gladstones son home secretary herbert gladstone angered the king by planning to permit roman catholic priests in vestments to carry the host through the streets of london and by appointing two ladies lady frances balfour and mrs h j tennant to serve on a royal commission on reforming divorce law – edward thought divorce could not be discussed with delicacy or even decency before ladies edwards biographer philip magnus suggests that gladstone may have become a whippingboy for the kings general irritation with the liberal government gladstone was sacked in the reshuffle the following year and the king agreed with some reluctance to appoint him governorgeneral of south africa93 edward involved himself heavily in discussions over army reform the need for which had become apparent with the failings of the boer war94 he supported the redesign of army command the creation of the territorial force and the decision to provide an expeditionary force supporting france in the event of war with germany95 reform of the royal navy was also suggested partly due to the everincreasing naval estimates and because of the emergence of the imperial german navy as a new strategic threat96 ultimately a dispute arose between admiral lord charles beresford who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment and the first sea lord admiral sir john fisher who favoured efficiency savings scrapping obsolete vessels and a strategic realignment of the royal navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new dreadnoughts97 the king lent support to fisher in part because he disliked beresford and eventually beresford was dismissed beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909 although the bulk of his policies were retained98 the king was intimately involved in the appointment of fishers successor as the fisherberesford feud had split the service and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was sir arthur knyvet wilson who had retired in 190799 wilson was reluctant to return to active duty but edward persuaded him to do so and wilson became first sea lord on 25 january 1910100 edward was rarely interested in politics although his views on some issues were notably liberal for the time during his reign he said use of the word nigger was disgraceful despite it then being in common parlance101 in 1904 during an anglogerman summit in kiel between wilhelm ii and edward wilhelm with the russojapanese war in mind started to go on about the yellow peril which he called the greatest peril menacing  christendom and european civilisation if the russians went on giving ground the yellow race would in twenty years time be in moscow and posen102 wilhelm went on to attack his british guests for supporting japan against russia suggesting that the british were committing race treason in response edward stated that he could not see it the japanese were an intelligent brave and chivalrous nation quite as civilised as the europeans from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin102 edward lived a life of luxury that was often far removed from that of the majority of his subjects however his personal charm with people at all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime9 constitutional crisisedit bust by francis derwent wood profile of edward vii on a halfpenny 1902 in the last year of his life edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the conservative majority in the house of lords refused to pass the peoples budget proposed by the liberal government of prime minister h h asquith the crisis eventually led – after edwards death – to the removal of the lords right to veto legislation the king was displeased at liberal attacks on the peers which included a polemical speech by david lloyd george at limehouse103 cabinet minister winston churchill publicly demanded a general election for which asquith apologised to the kings adviser lord knollys and rebuked churchill at a cabinet meeting edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare – although asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the first home rule bill in 1886 – that he introduced his son to secretary of state for war richard haldane as the last king of england104 after the kings horse minoru won the derby on 26 july 1909 he returned to the racetrack the following day and laughed when a man shouted now king youve won the derby go back home and dissolve this bloody parliament105 in vain the king urged conservative leaders arthur balfour and lord lansdowne to pass the budget which lord esher had advised him was not unusual as queen victoria had helped to broker agreements between the two houses over irish disestablishment in 1869 and the third reform act in 1884106 on asquiths advice however he did not offer them an election at which to judge from recent byelections they were likely to gain seats as a reward for doing so107 the finance bill passed the commons on 5 november 1909 but was rejected by the lords on 30 november they instead passed a resolution of lord lansdownes stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate the king was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge108 and had forbidden his adviser lord knollys who was an active liberal peer from voting for the budget although knollys had suggested that this would be a suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the budget pass109 in december 1909 a proposal to create peers to give the liberals a majority in the lords or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered outrageous by knollys who thought the king should abdicate rather than agree to it110 the january 1910 election was dominated by talk of removing the lords veto during the election campaign lloyd george talked of guarantees and asquith of safeguards that would be necessary before forming another liberal government but the king informed asquith that he would not be willing to contemplate creating peers until after a second general election9111 balfour refused to be drawn on whether or not he would be willing to form a conservative government but advised the king not to promise to create peers until he had seen the terms of any proposed constitutional change112 during the campaign the leading conservative walter long had asked knollys for permission to state that the king did not favour irish home rule but knollys refused on the grounds that it was not appropriate for the monarchs views to be known in public113 the election resulted in a hung parliament with the liberal government dependent on the support of the third largest party the irish nationalists the king suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed to vote which would also redress the large conservative majority in the lords but lord crewe liberal leader in the lords advised that this would reduce the lords independence as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked113 pressure to remove the lords veto now came from the irish nationalist mps who wanted to remove the lords ability to block the introduction of irish home rule they threatened to vote against the budget unless they had their way an attempt by lloyd george to win their support by amending whiskey duties was abandoned as the cabinet felt this would recast the budget too much asquith now revealed that there were no guarantees for the creation of peers the cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to balfour to try to form a conservative government114 the kings speech from the throne on 21 february made reference to introducing measures restricting the lords power of veto to one of delay but asquith inserted a phrase in the opinion of my advisers so the king could be seen to be distancing himself from the planned legislation115 the commons passed resolutions on 14 april that would form the basis for the 1911 parliament act to remove the power of the lords to veto money bills to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay and to reduce the term of parliament from seven years to five the king would have preferred four112 but in that debate asquith hinted – to ensure the support of the nationalist mps – that he would ask the king to break the deadlock in that parliament ie contrary to edwards earlier stipulation that there be a second election the budget was passed by both commons and lords in april116 by april the palace was having secret talks with balfour and the archbishop of canterbury who both advised that the liberals did not have sufficient mandate to demand the creation of peers the king thought the whole proposal simply disgusting and that the government was in the hands of redmond co lord crewe announced publicly that the governments wish to create peers should be treated as formal ministerial advice which by convention the monarch must obey although lord esher argued that the monarch was entitled in extremis to dismiss the government rather than take their advice117 eshers view has been called obsolete and unhelpful118 deathedit drawing of edward on his deathbed in buckingham palace by sir luke fildes 1910 play media funeral procession of king edward vii london 1910 edward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day in 1907 a rodent ulcer a type of cancer affecting the skin next to his nose was cured with radium119 towards the end of his life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis9 he suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to berlin in february 1909120 in march 1910 he was staying at biarritz when he collapsed he remained there to convalesce while in london asquith tried to get the finance bill passed the kings continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in france while political tensions were so high9 on 27 april he returned to buckingham palace still suffering from severe bronchitis alexandra returned from visiting her brother king george i of greece in corfu a week later on 5 may the following day the king suffered several heart attacks but refused to go to bed saying no i shall not give in i shall go on i shall work to the end121 between moments of faintness his son the prince of wales shortly to be king george v told him that his horse witch of the air had won at kempton park that afternoon the king replied yes i have heard of it i am very glad his final words9 at 1130 pm he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed he died 15 minutes later121 alexandra refused to allow the kings body to be moved for eight days afterwards though she allowed small groups of visitors to enter his room122 on 11 may the late king was dressed in his uniform and placed in a massive oak coffin which was moved on 14 may to the throne room where it was sealed and lay in state with four guardsmen standing at each corner of the bier despite the time that had elapsed since his death alexandra noted the kings body remained wonderfully preserved123 on the morning of 17 may the coffin was placed on a gun carriage and drawn by black horses to westminster hall with the new king and his family walking behind following a brief service the royal family left and the hall was opened to the public over 400000 people filed past the coffin over the next two days124 as barbara tuchman noted in the guns of august his funeral held on 20 may 1910 marked the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and of its kind the last a royal train conveyed the kings coffin from london to windsor castle where edward vii was buried at st georges chapel125 legacyedit further information cultural depictions of edward vii of the united kingdom and royal eponyms in canada statue in queen victoria gardens melbourne statue outside holyrood palace edinburgh statue of king edward vii bangalore india statues of edward can be found throughout the former empire before his accession to the throne edward was the longestserving heir apparent in british history he was surpassed by his greatgreatgrandson charles prince of wales on 20 april 2011126 the title prince of wales is not automatically held by the heir apparent it is bestowed by the reigning monarch at a time of his or her choosing127 edward was the longestserving holder of that title until surpassed by charles on 9 september 2017 edward was prince of wales between 8 december 1841 and 22 january 1901 59 years 45 days charles was created prince of wales on 26 july 1958 7004216510000000000♠59 years 101 days ago127128129 as king edward vii proved a greater success than anyone had expected130 but he was already past the average life expectancy and had little time left to fulfil the role in his short reign he ensured that his second son and heir george v was better prepared to take the throne contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son131 and on edwards death george wrote in his diary that he had lost his best friend and the best of fathers  i never had a cross word with him in my life i am heartbroken and overwhelmed with grief132 edward has been recognised as the first truly constitutional british sovereign and the last sovereign to wield effective political power133 though lauded as peacemaker134 he had been afraid his nephew the german emperor wilhelm ii would tip europe into war135 four years after edwards death world war i broke out the naval reforms he had supported and his part in securing the triple entente between britain france and russia as well as his relationships with his extended family fed the paranoia of the german emperor who blamed edward for the war136 publication of the official biography of edward was delayed until 1927 by its author sidney lee who feared german propagandists would select material to portray edward as an antigerman warmonger137 lee was also hampered by the extensive destruction of edwards personal papers edward had left orders that all his letters should be burned on his death138 subsequent biographers have been able to construct a more rounded picture of edward by using material and sources that were unavailable to lee139 historian r c k ensor writing in 1936 praised the kings political personality he had in many respects great natural ability he knew how to be both dignified and charming he had an excellent memory and his tact in handling people was quite exceptional he had a store of varied though unsystematized knowledge gathered at firsthand through talking to all sorts of eminent men his tastes were not particularly elevated but they were thoroughly english and he showed much though not unfailing comprehension for the common instincts of the people over whom he reigned this was not the less remarkable because though a good linguist in french and german he never learned to speak english without a german accent140 ensor rejects the widespread notion that the king exerted important influence on british foreign policy ensor believed edward gained that reputation by making frequent trips abroad with many highly publicized visits to foreign courts but surviving documents paint a different picture of how comparatively crude his views on foreign policy were how little he read and of what naïve indiscretions he was capable141 edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of selfindulgent pleasure but he received great praise for his affable and kind good manners and his diplomatic tact as his grandson edward viii wrote his lighter side  obscured the fact that he had both insight and influence142 he had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty wrote j b priestley143 lord esher wrote that edward was kind and debonair and not undignified – but too human144 titles styles honours and armsedit titles and stylesedit 9 november – 8 december 1841 his royal
