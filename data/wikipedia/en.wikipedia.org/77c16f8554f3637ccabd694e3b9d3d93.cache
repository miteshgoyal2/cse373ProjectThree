orejón comes from the historical chronicle relación de la alta y baja california 159812 written by the new spaniard rodrigo motezuma and made reference to the columbia river when the spanish explorers penetrated into the actual north american territory that became part of the viceroyalty of new spain this chronicle is the first topographical and linguistic source with respect to the place name oregon there are also two other sources with spanish origins such as the name oregano which grows in the southern part of the region it is most probable that the american territory was named by the spaniards as there are some populations in spain such as arroyo del oregón which is situated in the province of ciudad real also considering that the individualization in spanish language el orejón with the mutation of the letter g instead of j13 another early use of the name spelled ouragon was in a 1765 petition by major robert rogers to the kingdom of great britain the term referred to the thenmythical river of the west the columbia river by 1778 the spelling had shifted to oregon14 in his 1765 petition rogers wrote the rout sicis from the great lakes towards the head of the mississippi and from thence to the river called by the indians ouragon15 one theory is that the name comes from the french word ouragan windstorm or hurricane which was applied to the river of the west based on native american tales of powerful chinook winds on the lower columbia river or perhaps from firsthand french experience with the chinook winds of the great plains at the time the river of the west was thought to rise in western minnesota and flow west through the great plains16 joaquin miller explained in sunset magazine in 1904 how oregons name was derived the name oregon is rounded down phonetically from aure il agua—oragua oragon oregon—given probably by the same portuguese navigator that named the farallones after his first officer and it literally in a large way means cascades hear the waters you should steam up the columbia and hear and feel the waters falling out of the clouds of mount hood to understand entirely the full meaning of the name aure il agua oregon17 another account endorsed as the most plausible explanation in the book oregon geographic names was advanced by george r stewart in a 1944 article in american speech according to stewart the name came from an engravers error in a french map published in the early 18th century on which the ouisiconsink wisconsin river was spelled ouariconsint broken on two lines with the sint below so there appeared to be a river flowing to the west named ouaricon according to the oregon tourism commission presentday oregonians ˌɒrɪˈɡoʊniənz18 pronounce the states name as oruhgun never oreegone7 after being drafted by

oregon and affecting some areas there28 the columbia river which forms much of oregons northern border also played a major role in the regions geological evolution as well as its economic and cultural development the columbia is one of north americas largest rivers and one of two rivers to cut through the cascades the klamath river in southern oregon is the other about 15000 years ago the columbia repeatedly flooded much of oregon during the missoula floods the modern fertility of the willamette valley is largely a result of those floods plentiful salmon made parts of the river such as celilo

southwestern portion particularly the rogue valley has a mediterranean climate with drier and sunnier winters and hotter summers similar to northern california42 oregons northeastern portion has a steppe climate and the high terrain regions have a subarctic climate like western europe oregon and the pacific northwest in general is considered warm for its latitude and the state has far milder winters at a given elevation than comparable latitudes elsewhere in north america such as the upper midwest ontario quebec and new england43 western oregons climate is heavily influenced by the pacific ocean the western third of oregon is very wet in the winter moderately to very wet during the spring and fall and dry during the summer the relative humidity of western oregon is high except during summer days which are semidry to semihumid eastern oregon typically sees low humidity yearround43 the eastern two thirds of oregon have cold snowy winters and very dry summers much of the east is semiarid to arid like the rest of the great basin though the blue mountains are wet enough to support extensive forests most of oregon receives significant snowfall but the willamette valley where 60 percent of the population lives44 has considerably milder winters for its latitude and typically only sees light snowfall43 oregons highest recorded temperature is 119 °f 48 °c at pendleton on

material from fort rock to 13200 years ago47 and there is evidence supporting inhabitants in the region at least 15000 years ago48 by 8000 bc there were settlements throughout the state with populations concentrated along the lower columbia river in the western valleys and around coastal estuaries during the prehistoric period the willamette valley region was flooded after the collapse of glacial dams from lake missoula located in what would later become montana these massive floods occurred during the last glacial period and filled the valley with 300 to 400 feet 91 to 122 m of

frigate santiago by juan josé pérez hernández see spanish expeditions to the pacific northwest and the coast of oregon became a valuable trading route to asia in 1778 british captain james cook also explored the coast56 french canadian and métis trappers and missionaries arrived in the eastern part of the state in the late 18th and early 19th centuries many having travelled as members of lewis and clark and the 1811 astor expeditions some stayed permanently including étienne lussier believed to be the first european farmer in the state of oregon the evidence of this french canadian presence can be found in the numerous names of french origin in that part of the state including malheur lake and the malheur river the grande ronde and deschutes rivers and the city of la grande fort astoria as established by john jacob astor in 1813 the lewis and clark expedition travelled through northern oregon also in search of the northwest passage they built their winter fort in 1805–06 at fort clatsop near the mouth of the columbia river staying at the encampment from december until march57 british explorer david thompson also conducted overland exploration in 1811 while working for the north west company thompson became the first european to navigate the entire columbia river58 stopping on the way at the junction of the snake river he posted a claim to the region for great britain and the north west company upon returning to montreal he publicized the abundance of furbearing animals in the area59 also in 1811 new yorker john jacob astor financed the establishment of fort astoria at the mouth of the columbia river as a western outpost to his pacific fur company60 this was the first permanent european settlement in oregon map of oregon country 1818–46 in the war of 1812 the british gained control of all pacific fur company posts the treaty of 1818 established joint british and american occupancy of the region west of the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean by the

between lees mission and oregon city to discuss wolves and other animals of contemporary concern these meetings were precursors to an allcitizen meeting in 1843 which instituted a provisional government headed by an executive committee made up of david hill alanson beers and joseph gale63 this government was the first acting public government of the oregon country before annexation by the government of the united states it was succeeded by a second executive committee made up of peter g stewart osborne russell and william j bailey and this committee was itself succeeded by george abernethy who was the first and only governor of oregon under the provisional government also in 1841 sir george simpson governor of the hudsons bay company reversed the hudsons bay companys

relocation of the native population to indian reservations in oregon statehoodedit in december 1844 oregon passed its black exclusion law which prohibited african americans from entering the territory while simultaneously prohibiting slavery slave owners who brought their slaves with them were given three years before they were forced to free them any african americans in the region after the law was passed were forced to leave and those who did not comply were arrested and beaten they received no less than twenty and no more than thirtynine stripes across their bare back if they still did not leave this process could be repeated every six months67 slavery played a major part in oregons history and even influenced its path to statehood the territorys request for statehood was delayed several times as members of congress argued among themselves whether the territory should be admitted as a free or slave state eventually politicians from the south agreed to allow oregon to enter as a free state in exchange for opening slavery to the southwest united states68 oregon was admitted to the union on february 14 1859 founded as a refuge from disputes over slavery oregon had a whites
