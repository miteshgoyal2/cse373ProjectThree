monthly paper with only one staff member later the paper started producing every other week5 in february 2005 real change began publishing weekly due to increasing interest and sales5 making it the second street newspaper in the country to do sonote 1 in addition to becoming a weekly newspaper it hired several professional journalists shifting its focus to become a broadly progressive alternative paper89 as a biweekly it sold 18000 copies every two weeks5 and now has a weekly circulation of 16000 papers in april 2013 the papers price increased from one dollar to two dollars and was the sixth street newspaper to do so10 in 2012 it sold 872562 copies and raised 957949 dollars 6842 percent from donations and grants 3126 percent from circulation advertising and subscriptions and 032 percent from other sources11 contentsedit the topics covered in real change are a mixture of progressive local news and information specifically pertaining to the homeless and poor though it covers local news it still openly advocates for social justice8 and attempts to educate readers about homelessness5 some readers though admit that they buy the paper more to help out and interact with the vendors than to actually read the contents912 this pattern of buying is common among street newspapers131415 part of the reason for the paper becoming a weekly publication in 2005 was to attract more readers and move the newspapers image from a charity buy to a legitimate source of news9 vendorsedit real change vendor 2008 anyone may be a real change vendor however most are poor or unable to hold a regular job due to physical disability mental illness criminal records or other issues12 after attending an orientation and signing a code of conduct vendors get their first 10 papers free12 they then buy the paper for sixty cents and sell it for two dollars keeping the difference plus any tips78 the paper has an average of 350 to 400 active vendors each month13 and there as many as 800 vendors in a year if occasional vendors are included5 most vendors sell within seattle proper although some sell in the eastside as far north as bellingham and as far south as olympia wa5 vendors may sell without restriction on sidewalks and public spaces and sometimes need to obtain permission to sell in commercial areas like malls5 several vendors are very successful selling as many as 2000 papers a month and being known as fixtures in the community12 however most sell far less than that16 real changes turf system allows vendors selling over 300 papers per month to have priority at certain spots17 according to harris this system allows buyervendor relationships to grow and for vendors to become well known in communities and can minimize conflict and competition between vendors12
