swedish chef from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search børk redirects here for other uses see bork disambiguation the swedish chef the muppets character first appearance the muppet show sex and violence 19751 created by jim henson performed by jim henson 1975–1990 bill barretta2 1996–present information species muppet human gender male occupation chef nationality swedish the swedish chef is a muppet character that appeared on the muppet show he was originally performed by jim henson and frank oz simultaneously with henson performing the head and voice and oz performing the characters live hands the swedish chef is currently performed by bill barretta his best known phrase is bork bork bork contents 1 character 2 inspiration 21 reaction from swedes 3 appearances 4 see also 5 references 6 external links characteredit a parody of television chefs the swedish chef wears a toque blanche has a thick brown moustache and has bushy eyebrows that completely obscure his eyes he was one of the few muppets to employ an actual puppeteers visible hands which extended from the ends of his sleeves and facilitated handling food and utensils oz originally provided the characters hands nearly all swedish chef sketches on the muppet show feature him in a kitchen waving some utensils while singing an introductory song in mock swedish – a semicomprehensible gibberish mimicking swedish phonology and prosody the songs lyrics vary slightly from one episode to the next but always end with bork bork bork as the chef throws the utensils aside occasionally knocking items off a shelf or the back wall in the process after this introduction the chef begins to prepare a recipe while giving a gibberish explanation of what he is doing his commentary is spiced with the occasional english word to clue in the viewer to what he is attempting these hints are necessary as he frequently uses unorthodox culinary equipment firearms sports equipment hand tools etc to prepare his dishes eg see de moofin und here de boomashootin before tossing an english muffin into the air and firing a blunderbuss at it to make a doughnut in the pilot episode of the muppet show the chefs commentary was supplemented by chinese subtitlescitation needed but this was abandoned for all other episodes of the series the sketch typically degenerates into a slapstick finale where the equipment or ingredients usually a live chickengoatcow etc get the better of him in the sketch bomb egg episode 212 a misaimed explosive charge slightly damaged the face of the puppetcitation needed the chefs face remained scarred through the rest of the seasoncitation needed the chef is referred to by name in one episode in which danny kaye plays his uncle kaye reels off a very long name but adds but we call him tom – much to the chefs amusement3 in 2010 the chef was seen wearing a wedding ring implying that the character is married4 inspirationedit some claim that the swedish chef was inspired by a real life chef one example is friedman paul erhardt a german american television chef known as chef tell56 another example is lars kuprik bäckman a real life swedish chef bäckman claims that his rather unsuccessful appearance on an early edition of good morning america caught the attention of jim henson who later bought the rights to the recording and created bäckmans muppet alter ego bäckmans dalecarlian accent would explain the chefs strange pronunciation muppet writer jerry juhl denied bäckmans story and insisted the character had no realworld counterpart i wrote rehearsed rewrote brainstormed and giggled uncontrollably a thousand times with jim henson as we dealt with the swedish chef and i never once heard him mention an actual swedish chef7 according to brian henson in one of his introductions for the muppet show jim henson had this tape that he used to play which was how to speak mock swedish and he used to drive to work and i used to ride with him a lot and he would drive to work trying to make a chicken sandwich in mock swedish or make a turkey casserole in mock swedish it was the most ridiculous thing you had ever seen and people at traffic lights used to stop and sort of look at him a little crazy but that was the roots of the character that would eventually become the swedish chef8 reaction from swedesedit swedes generally have a negative impression of the swedish chef stemming from the fact that to swedes his gibberish speech sounds very little like swedish to swedes the singsong quality of the characters mock language is suggestive of norwegian not swedish despite both languages being closely related and mutually intelligible the melodies are different between different dialects of swedish and norwegian outside of sweden swedes are often asked about the swedish chef causing many to become tired of the question9 in the germandubbed version of the muppet show the chef is not a swede but a dane10 appearancesedit besides appearances in the muppet show the chef also appears in the muppet movie 1979 the great muppet caper 1981 the muppets take manhattan 1984 the muppets a celebration of 30
