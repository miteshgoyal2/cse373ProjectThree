president barack obama was not born in the united states instead being born in kenya moore had also argued that obama was a secret muslim1112 among other beliefs his view that christianity should supersucceed public laws has been cause for criticism and has earned him the nickname of ayatollah of alabama by his critics413 moore was elected to the position of chief justice of the alabama

moores political ambitions1818 a number of charity and tax law experts have said that the foundations activities raised questions about compliance with irs rules including prohibitions on the use of a

etowah county high school for his final three years graduating in 196519 on the recommendation of outgoing democratic us representative albert rains after confirmation by incoming republican representative james d martin of gadsden moore was admitted to the united states military academy at west point new york where he graduated in 1969 with a bachelor of science degree with the vietnam war underway moore served in several posts as a military police officer including fort benning georgia and illesheim germany before being sent to the republic of vietnam serving as the commander of 188th military police company of the 504th military police battalion20 moore was known to be very strict some of his soldiers gave him the derogatory nickname captain america due to his attitude toward discipline this role earned him enemies and in his autobiography he recalls sleeping on sandbags to avoid a grenade or bomb being tossed under his cot as many of his men had threatened him with fragging moore was discharged from the united states army as a captain in 1974 and was admitted to the university of alabama school of law that same year he graduated in 1977 with a juris doctor

funding shortages in the sheriffs office several weeks after the state bar investigation was dismissed as unfounded moore quit his prosecuting position to run as a democrat for the countys circuitcourt judge seat in 1982 the election was bitter with moore alleging that cases were being delayed in exchange for payoffs the allegations were never substantiated and moore overwhelmingly lost

and when to remove this template message appointmentedit in 1992 etowah county circuit judge julius swann died in office republican governor h guy hunt was charged with making a temporary appointment until the next election moores name was floated by some of his associates and a background check was initiated with several state and county agencies including the etowah county district attorneys office moores former political opponent jimmy hedgspeth who still helmed the das office recommended moore despite personal reservations and moore was installed in the position he had failed to win in 1982 the impossible had happened moore wrote afterward god had given me something that i had not been able to obtain through my own efforts21 judge moore ran as a republican in the 1994 etowah county election and was elected to the circuit judge seat 6 year term with 62 of the vote he was the first countywide republican to win since the reconstruction early prayerten commandments controversyedit when moores tenure as circuit judge began he brought his wooden ten commandments plaque with him hanging it on the walls of his courtroom behind his bench moore told the montgomery advertiser that his intention in hanging the plaque was to fill up the bare space on the courtroom walls and to indicate the importance of the ten commandments he states that it was not his intention to generate controversy still as he told the atlantic he understood that the potential for controversy was there but i wanted to establish the moral foundation of our law soon after his appointment when moore presided over a case where two male strippers known professionally as silk and satin were charged with murdering a drug addict the attorney for the defendants objected to the display this drew the attention of critics who also objected to moores practice of opening court sessions with a prayer beseeching divine guidance for jurors in their deliberations in at least one instance moore asked a clergyman to lead the courts jury pool in prayer the local branch of the american civil liberties union aclu sent a letter in june 1993 with the threat of a lawsuit if such prayers did not cease on june 20 1994 the aclu sent a representative to moores courtroom to observe and record the presession prayer though the organization did not immediately file suit moore decried the action as an act of intimidation in a posttrial press conference the incident drew additional attention to moore just as he was campaigning to hold onto his circuit court seat in that years election moore won the seat in a landslide victory over local attorney keith pitts who had unsuccessfully prosecuted the silk and satin murder case lawsuitedit in march 1995 the aclu filed a lawsuit against moore stating that the presession prayers and the ten commandments display were both unconstitutional this original lawsuit was eventually dismissed for technical reasons but governor fob james instructed state attorney general bill pryor to file suit in montgomery county in support of moore the case ended up before state circuit judge charles price who in 1996 declared the prayers unconstitutional but initially allowed the ten commandments plaque to remain on the courtroom walls immediately after the ruling moore held a press conference vowing to defy the ruling against presession prayers and affirming a religious intent in displaying the plaque critics responded by asking price to reconsider his previous ruling and the judge issued a new ruling requiring the ten commandments plaque to be removed in ten days moore appealed prices decision and kept the plaque up ten days later the alabama supreme court issued a temporary stay against the ruling the court never ruled in the case throwing it out for technical reasons in 1998 on the day that the circuit court ruling was stayed moore appeared on the national morning program today praising the ruling and vowing to continue his practices a poll released soon after found that 88 percent of alabamians supported moore though moore was later investigated by the state judicial ethics committee regarding the use of money raised by coral ridge ministries in his defense the investigation eventually ended with no charges being brought chief justice alabama supreme courtedit campaign and electionedit in late 1999 the american family association began working to draft moore into the race for chief justice of the alabama supreme court when incumbent republican perry o hooper sr of montgomery announced that he would not seek reelection moore said that he was hesitant to make the statewide race because he had absolutely no funds and three other candidates particularly associate justice harold see were wellfinanced19 nevertheless on december 7 1999 moore announced from his etowah county courtroom that he would enter the race with hope of returning god to our public life and restore the moral foundation of our law his campaign centered on religious issues arguing that christianitys declining influence corresponded directly with school violence homosexuality and crime21 associate justice harold see was the heavy favorite to win the republican nomination because of his support from the state business community and the party hierarchy including chief justice hooper however as moore made headway in state polls see elicited the help of republican strategist karl rove advisor to texas governor and future president george w bush despite roves support and significantly more campaign funding see lost the primary to moore judge moore also beat two other opponents criminal appeals judge pam baschab and jefferson county presiding circuit judge wayne thorn in the republican primary—without a runoff—garnering over 50 of the statewide primary vote judge moore then easily defeated democratic contender sharon yates in novembers general election with over 60 of the vote judge moore won his election to chief justice with just over 200000 compared to the over 2 million spent by his opponents moore was sworn in as chief justice on january 15 2001 republican former us representative james d martin who had appointed moore to west point years earlier was among the dignitaries in attendance on taking the position moore said that he had come to realize the real meaning of the first amendment and its relationship to the god on whom the oath was based my mind had been opened to the spiritual war occurring in our state and our nation that was slowly removing the knowledge of that relationship between god and law i pledged to support not only the us constitution but the alabama constitution as well which provided in its preamble that the state established justice by invoking the favor and guidance of almighty god the connection between god and our law could not be more clear 19 case of dh vs hhedit in february 2002 as alabama chief justice moore issued a controversial opinion that expressed his belief that the state should use its powers to punish homosexual behavior the case dh vs hh was a custody dispute where a lesbian was petitioning for custody of her children alleging abuse by her exhusband a circuit court in alabama had ruled in favor of the father but the alabama court of civil appeals overturned that verdict 4–1 saying that substantial evidence existed of abusive behavior by the father22 the state supreme court overruled the appeals court because the appeals court ignored evidence disputing abusive behavior by the father however moore issued a concurring opinion concluding that a parents sexual orientation in this case homosexuality should be a deciding factor in refusing custody to disfavor practicing homosexuals in custody matters is not invidious discrimination nor is it legislating personal morality on the contrary disfavoring practicing homosexuals in custody matters promotes the general welfare of the people of our state in accordance with our law which is the duty of its public servants the state carries the power of the sword that is the power to prohibit conduct with physical penalties such as confinement and even execution it must use that power to prevent the subversion of children toward this lifestyle to not encourage a criminal lifestyle homosexual behavior is a ground for divorce an act of sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in alabama a crime against nature an inherent evil and an act so heinous that it defies ones ability to describe it that is enough under the law to allow a court to consider such activity harmful to a child to declare that homosexuality is harmful is not to make new law but to reaffirm the old to say that it is not harmful is to experiment with peoples lives particularly the lives of children23 moores comments led to protests in front of the state judicial building and drew nationwide criticism from civil rights groups such as glaad the national gay and lesbian task force and the human rights campaign an official complaint with the alabama judicial inquiry commission was also filed by the lambda legal defense education fund24 a year following the case the united states supreme court struck down statutes such as and including the one moore referred to prohibiting samegender sexual relations as being unconstitutional in the landmark civil rights case lawrence v texas ten commandments monument controversyedit the ten commandments monument in the alabama supreme court building erected in 2001 construction and installationedit a month after his election moore began making plans for a larger monument to the ten commandments reasoning that the alabama supreme court building required something grander than a wooden plaque his final design involved a 5280 pound 2400 kg granite block three feet wide by three feet deep by four feet tall covered with quotes from the declaration of independence the national anthem and various founding fathers25 the crowning element would be two large carved tablets inscribed with the ten commandments highgrade granite from vermont was ordered and shipped and moore found benefactors and a sculptor to complete the job on the evening of july 31 2001 despite some initial installation difficulties and concerns regarding structural support for the monuments weight moore had the completed monument transported to the state judicial building and installed in the central rotunda the installation was filmed and videotapes of the event were sold by coral ridge ministries an evangelical media outlet in fort lauderdale florida which later used proceeds from the sales of the film to underwrite moores ensuing legal expenses coral ridge was the operation of the late reverend d james kennedy a staunch moore supporter26 the next morning moore held a press conference in the central rotunda to officially unveil the monument in a speech following the unveiling moore declared today a cry has gone out across our land for the acknowledgment of that god upon whom this nation and our laws were founded may this day mark the restoration of the moral foundation of law to our people and the return to the knowledge of god in our land federal lawsuitedit on october 30 2001 the aclu of alabama americans united for separation of church and state and the southern poverty law center were among groups which filed suit in the united states district court for the middle district of alabama asking that the monument be removed because it sends a message to all who enter the state judicial building that the government encourages and endorses the practice of religion in general and judeochristianity in particular the trial titled glassroth v moore began on october 15 2002 evidence for the plaintiffs included testimony that lawyers of different religious beliefs had changed their work practices including routinely avoiding visiting the court building to avoid passing by the monument and testimony that the monument created a religious atmosphere with many people using the area for prayer moore argued that he would not remove the monument as doing so would violate his oath of office the monument serves to remind the appellate courts and judges of the circuit and district court of this state and members of the bar who appear before them as well as the people of alabama who visit the alabama judicial building of the truth stated in the preamble to the alabama constitution that in order to establish justice we must invoke the favor and guidance of almighty god25 on this note moore said that the ten commandments are the moral foundation of us law stating that in order to restore this foundation we must first recognize the source from which all morality springs by recognizing the sovereignty of god he added that the addition of the monument to the state judiciary building marked the beginning of the restoration of the moral foundation of law to our people and a return to the knowledge of god in our land25 additionally moore acknowledged an explicit theistic intent in placing the monument agreeing that the monument reflects the sovereignty of god over the affairs of men and acknowledges god’s overruling power over the affairs of men27 however in moores view this did not violate the doctrine of separation of church and state as the presiding judge later summarized it moore argued that the judeochristian god reigned over both the church and the state in this country and that both owed allegiance to that god although they must keep their affairs separate25 judgment and appealedit on november 18 2002 federal us district judge myron thompson issued his ruling declaring that the monument violated the establishment clause of the first amendment to the us constitution and was thus unconstitutional if all chief justice moore had done were to emphasize the ten commandments historical and educational importance or their importance as a model code for good citizenship this court would have a much different case before it but the chief justice did not limit himself to this he went far far beyond he installed a twoandahalf ton monument in the most prominent place in a government building managed with dollars from all state taxpayers with the specific purpose and effect of establishing a permanent recognition of the sovereignty of god the judeochristian god over all citizens in this country regardless of each taxpaying citizens individual personal beliefs or lack thereof to this the establishment clause says no25 judge thompsons decision mandated that moore remove the monument from the state judicial building by january 3 2003 but stayed this order on december 23 2002 after moore appealed the decision to the eleventh circuit court of appeals this appeal was argued on june 4 2003 before a threejudge panel in atlanta georgia on july 1 2003 the panel issued a ruling upholding the lower courts decision agreeing that the monument fails two of lemons three prongs it violates the establishment clause additionally the court noted that different religious traditions assign different wordings of the ten commandments meaning that choosing which version of the ten commandments to display can have religious endorsement implications27 in response to the appeals courts decision judge thompson lifted his earlier stay on august 5 2003 requiring moore to have the monument removed from public areas of the state judicial building by august 2028 protests and monument removaledit rally before the alabama state capitol august 16 2003 on august 14 moore announced his intention to disobey judge thompsons order to have the monument removed two days later large rallies in support of moore and the ten commandments monument began forming in front of the judicial building featuring speakers such as alan keyes the reverend jerry falwell and moore himself the crowd peaked at an estimated count of 4000 that day29 and anywhere from several hundred to over a thousand protesters remained through the end of august the time limit for removal expired on august 20 with the monument still in place in the buildings rotunda as specified in judge thompsons order the state of alabama faced fines of 5000 a day until the monument was removed in response the eight other members of the alabama supreme court intervened on august 21 unanimously overruled moore and ordered the removal of the monument30 moore said that thompson fearing that i would not obey his order decided to threaten other state officials and force them to remove the monument if i did not do so a threat of heavy fines was his way of coercing obedience to that order an action that moore sees as a violation of the eleventh amendment to the united states constitution19 on august 27 the monument was moved to a nonpublic side room in the judicial building31 the monument was not immediately removed from the building for several reasons—pending legal hearings the monuments weight worries that the monument could break through the floor if it was taken outside intact and a desire to avoid confrontation with protesters massed outside the structure the monument was not actually removed from the state judicial building until july 19 200432 removal from officeedit on august 22 2003 two days after the deadline for the ten commandments monuments removal had passed the alabama judicial inquiry commission jic filed a complaint with the alabama court of the judiciary coj a panel of judges lawyers and others appointed variously by judges legal leaders the governor and the lieutenant governor the complaint effectively suspended moore from the chief justice position pending a hearing by the coj33 the coj ethics hearing was held on november 12 2003 moore repeated his earlier sentiment that to acknowledge god cannot be a violation of the canons of ethics without god there can be no ethics he also acknowledged that he would repeat his defiance of the court order if given another opportunity to do so and that if he returned to office i certainly wouldnt leave the monument in a closet shrouded from the public in closing arguments the assistant attorney general said moores defiance left unchecked undercuts the entire workings of the judicial system what message does that send to the public to other litigants the message it sends is if you dont like a court order you dont have to follow it34 moore had previously stated his belief that the order was unlawful and that compliance with such an order was not an enforceable mandate the next day the coj issued a unanimous opinion ruling that chief justice moore has violated the alabama canons of judicial ethics as alleged by the jic in its complaint the coj had several disciplinary options including censure or suspension without pay but because moores responses had indicated he would defy any similar court orders in the future the coj concluded that under these circumstances there is no penalty short of removal from office that would resolve this issue35 moore was immediately removed from his post moore appealed the cojs ruling to the supreme court of alabama on december 10 2003 a special panel of retired judges and justices was randomly selected to hear the case moore argued that the coj did not consider the underlying legality of the federal courts order that the monument be removed from the courthouse the alabama supreme court rejected this argument saying that the coj did not have the authority to overrule the federal courts only to determine whether moore violated the canons of judicial ethics therefore the court reasoned it was enough to show that a procedurallyvalid order was in place against moore moore also argued that the coj had imposed a religious test on him to hold his office and that the cojs actions had violated his own rights under the free exercise clause of the first amendment36 the supreme court of alabama rejected each of these arguments as well and ruled on april 30 2004 that the coj had acted properly the court also upheld the sanction of removal as appropriate36 return to the benchedit in 2011 moore initially considered a bid for the presidency but instead moore chose to enter the race for chief justice of the alabama supreme court once again he ran in the march 12 2012 republican primary against two candidates they were the sitting chief justice chuck malone who had been appointed to the office seven months earlier and former democratic attorney general charles graddick who had become a republican in 1994 moore unexpectedly defeated both without a runoff as he had done in 2000 despite being heavily outspent 225000 to 15 million surprised democrats had expected chief justice malone to win and did not run a serious candidate and only had a perennial gadfly nominee democrats quickly disqualified him and handpicked jefferson county circuit judge bob vance as his replacement on november 6 2012 moore defeated vance who had outspent him vance raised and spent 18 million compared to chief justice moores 275000 during the general election3738 in january 2012 the montgomery advertiser reported that the singlebiggest donor to his campaign having contributed 50000 of the total 78000 received by moore until december 31 2011 is michael peroutka a longtime acquaintance of moores who is associated with organizations such as the constitution party and white supremacist group league of the south and is a frequent guest on the political cesspool in response moore said he did not share the ideas of those organizations39 this was the second time that moore had beat out his opponents in the republican primary without a runoff along with democratic challengers in the general election all of whom were significantly better funded samesex marriageedit on january 28 2015 the southern poverty law center filed a judicial ethics complaint against moore stating that he had publicly commented on pending samesex marriage cases and encouraged state officials and judges to ignore federal court rulings overturning bans on samesex marriage4041 moore issued an order to probate judges and their employees on february 8 the day before a federal court ruling legalizing samesex marriage in alabama was set to take effect ordering them to disregard the ruling and enforce the states ban under threat of legal action by the governor42 on february 9 after the united states supreme court allowed the federal court ruling to take effect probate judges in birmingham montgomery and huntsville disobeyed moore and issued marriage licenses to samesex couples43 on january 6 2016 after the us supreme court issued its opinion in obergefell v hodges the previous june moore issued an administrative order to lower court judges stating that until further decision by the alabama supreme court the existing orders of the alabama supreme court that alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the alabama sanctity of marriage amendment or the alabama marriage protection act remain in full force and effect44 judge roy moore is coming to dinneredit inspired by guess whos coming to dinner45 tom woffords judge roy moore is coming to dinner is a 2004 play about two gay men who decide to marry in california and return home to alabama to tell their families laced throughout the performance are quotes from moores concurring opinion in dh vs hh the 2002 child custody dispute mentioned above46 the original cast starred brian webber as judge roy moore moore issued a statement condemning it as the result of federal activism in our court system and saying that samesex marriage corrupts american society he did not attend a viewing of the play46 the play was revived in 2012 at the carver theater in birmingham45 2016 charges in alabama court of the judiciaryedit on may 6 2016 the alabama judicial inquiry commission forwarded a list of six charges of ethical violations by moore to the alabama court of the judiciary47 moore was suspended from the alabama supreme court pending trial and ruling moore faced removal from office over the charges which were more serious than those which removed him from office in 20034849 the list of charges included50 violation of the alabama canon of judicial ethics for disregarding a federal injunction violation of the alabama canon of judicial ethics for demonstrated unwillingness to follow clear law violation of the alabama canon of judicial ethics for abuse of administrative authority violation of the

own court violation of the alabama canon of judicial ethics for interference with legal process and remedies in the united states district court andor alabama supreme court related to proceedings in which alabama probate judges were involved violation of the alabama canon of judicial ethics for failure to recuse himself from pending proceedings in the alabama supreme court after making public comment and placing his impartiality into question moore vs judicial inquiry commission us district courtedit on may 27 moore filed a federal lawsuit against the alabama judicial inquiry commission alleging that his automatic suspension was unconstitutional5152 on august 4 the federal district court dismissed moores suit ruling that under the abstention doctrine federal courts generally do not interfere with ongoing state court proceedings535455 jic vs moore court of the judiciaryedit on june 22 moore filed a motion to dismiss the jic proceedings arguing among other things that the alabama judicial inquiry commission and the alabama court of the judiciary did not have jurisdiction over review of administrative orders of the chief justice of the alabama supreme court and that the jic had failed to adhere to its own rules regarding confidentiality of the proceedings moore also continued to assert in his motion to dismiss that the orders of the alabama supreme court were still in effect from the alabama policy institute proceedings prohibiting the issuance of samesex marriage licenses by probate judges in alabama despite the rulings in obergefell v hodges issued by the us supreme court searcy v strange strawser v strange and the eleventh circuit court of appeals which held that the orders were abrogated by obergefell4756575859 the human rights campaign responded it is clear that roy moore not only believes he is above the law he believes he is above judicial ethics moore was tasked with upholding the law of the land when marriage equality was affirmed by the supreme court of the united states and he defied that task in the process harming loving committed samesex couples across alabama for his own personal discriminatory reasons we remain optimistic that the sanctions against moore will be upheld60 on june 27 the court of the judiciary issued on order setting a hearing date on moores motion to dismiss for august 8 and stated in their order that moores motion to dismiss would be treated as a motion for summary judgment pertaining to the charges filed by the jic6162 on july 15 the judicial inquiry commission filed a response to roy moores motion to dismiss asking the court of the judiciary to issue summary judgment removing moore from the bench attorneys for the jic wrote in their response because the chief justice has proven—and promised—that he will not change his behavior he has left this court with no choice but to remove him from office to preserve the integrity independence impartiality of alabamas judiciary and the citizens who depend on it for justice63646566 on july 22 alabama court of the judiciary member john v denson ii recused himself from the proceedings citing his prior involvement in the 2003 jic case which removed justice roy moore from the bench over the ten commandments monument controversy denson stated his reason for recusing himself was to promote public confidence in the court and avoid the appearance of impropriety676869 on july 23 chief judge michael joiner of the alabama court of the judiciary issued an order appointing attorney w n rocky watson to replace john denson on the alabama court of the judiciary during the moore case70 on july 26 attorneys for liberty counsel who represent roy moore in the jic proceedings filed a reply to the jic motion for summary judgment denying that chief justice roy moore had directed alabamas probate judges to disobey an injunction issued by the us district court for the middle district of alabama moores attorneys continued to assert that the orders of the alabama supreme court which required alabamas probate judges to deny same sex couples marriage licenses were still in effect and that moores january 6 administrative order was mischaracterized by the jic despite the fact that moore stated in his january 6 order until further decision by the alabama supreme court the existing orders of the alabama supreme court that alabama probate judges

attorneys continued to assert in their arguments that justice moore did not order probate judges to disobey an injunction issued by the us district court or to disobey the us supreme court rulings regarding samesex marriage john carroll who represented the alabama judicial inquiry commission responded that this defense argument defies common sense based upon justice moores actions carroll argued that moore was removed from office in 2003 for defying a federal court order and said moore is again defying federal courts and their rulings supporting samesex marriage and should be immediately removed from office7576 the alabama court of the judiciary subsequently denied both justice moores motion for dismissal and the jic motion for summary judgment and ordered the matter set for a trial scheduled for september 28 2016 at 900 am in the alabama supreme courtroom77 on september 30 2016 moore was found guilty of all six charges against him and suspended for the remainder of his term slated to end in 201978 in its 50page order the court of the judiciary stated it did not find credible moores claim that the purpose for the jan 6 order was merely to provide a status update to the states probate judges78 he will not be paid for the remainder of his term must pay court costs and the ruling effectively ends moores supreme court career as he will not be eligible for reelection in 2018798081 jic vs moore appeal to the alabama supreme courtedit on october 3 2016 moore filed a notice of appeal with the court of the judiciary appealing his suspension and the final judgment to the alabama supreme court contending that neither the jic nor the coj had jurisdiction to investigate and punish chief justice moore for issuing his administrative order of january 6 2016 moore contended that the jic failed to prove any of its six charges with clear and convincing evidence that the jic violated its own rules and alabama law by breaching confidentiality during its investigation and that it prosecuted a charge charge number 6 that was never included in a sworn complaint moore also contended that by suspending him without pay for the remainder of his term the coj essentially removed him from office without unanimous agreement by the entire the coj as required under alabama law82838485 pending the appeal moore refused to clean out his office86 on october 27 the alabama supreme court randomly selected seven retired judges to review the appeal of moores suspension878889 on october 31 2016 robert bentley the governor of alabama issued an executive order confirming the appointment of the seven retired justices to hear moores appeal from the decision of the coj that suspended him from the bench for the remainder of his term90 on december 13 moore filed his appeal brief with the special alabama supreme court that had been appointed to hear his appeal he argued among other things that the coj did not have jurisdiction or authority to review administrative orders of the chief justice of the alabama supreme court and that the jic had failed to prove by convincing evidence that he violated the canons of judicial conduct moore also argued that his suspension from the bench for the remainder of his term was de facto removal from office which required unanimous agreement of the members of the coj and therefore was improper under alabama law9192939495 on december 14 eight current and retired alabama justices filed an amicus curiae brief in support of moore asserting in their filings that moores suspension was in fact a removal from office and contrary to alabama law since it required unanimous agreement of the coj despite the fact the coj did unanimously agree in their final judgment to suspend moore for the remainder of his term9697 on february 22 2017 moore filed a motion with the special alabama supreme court asking that it dispose of the appeal based on the merits contained in the parties briefs and cancel oral

april 20 the special alabama supreme court upheld moores suspension102 in its opinion the special alabama supreme court ruled that all of the judicial inquiry commission charges against moore were supported by clear and convincing evidence moore had argued that it required unanimous agreement of all the members of the jic to remove a judge from the bench but the special alabama supreme court ruled that it did not have authority to rescind the sanctions imposed on moore because the charges were amply supported by clear and convincing evidence and that the jic was unanimous in their decision to suspend moore for the remainder of his term103 on april 26 2017 roy moore resigned from the alabama supreme court and announced he would be running for the united states senate1041415

states republican party of bias towards riley and called on her to resign he also criticized president bush for his support of riley in the race his criticism of the state republican machine was so harsh that he eventually had to call a press conference to quell rumors that he would run as an independent if he lost the republican primary112 despite moores predictions that his initial low polling

white and colored children a practice already outlawed due to civil rightsera legislation during the civil rights movement moore and other opponents of the measure argued that the amendments wording
