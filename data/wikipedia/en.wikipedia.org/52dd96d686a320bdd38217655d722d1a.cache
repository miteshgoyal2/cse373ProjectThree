libertas freedom is a collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle1 libertarians seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy emphasizing freedom of choice voluntary association individual judgment and selfownership23456 libertarians share a skepticism of authority and state power however they diverge on the scope of their opposition to existing political and economic systems various schools of libertarian thought offer a range of views regarding the legitimate functions of state and private power often calling to restrict or to dissolve coercive social institutions some libertarians advocate laissezfaire capitalism and strong private property rights7 such as in land infrastructure and natural resources others notably libertarian socialists8 seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production in favor of their common or cooperative ownership and management viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty9101112 an additional line of division is between minarchists and anarchists while minarchists think that a minimal centralized government is necessary anarchists and

bibliography 12 external links etymologyedit the 17 august 1860 edition of le libertaire journal du mouvement social a libertarian communist publication in new york city the first recorded use of the term libertarian was in 1789 when william belsham wrote about libertarianism in the context of metaphysics15 libertarian came to mean an advocate or defender of liberty especially in the political and social spheres as early as 1796 when the london packet printed on 12 february lately marched out of the prison at bristol 450 of the french libertarians16 the word was again used in a political sense in 1802 in a short piece critiquing a poem by the author of gebir and has since been used with this meaning171819 the use of the word libertarian to describe a new set of political positions has been traced to the french cognate libertaire coined in a letter french libertarian communist joseph déjacque wrote to mutualist pierrejoseph proudhon in 1857202122 déjacque also used the term for his anarchist publication le libertaire journal du mouvement social which was printed from 9 june 1858 to 4 february 1861 in new york city2324 in the mid1890s sébastien faure began publishing a new le libertaire while frances third republic enacted the lois scélérates villainous laws which banned anarchist publications in france libertarianism has frequently been used as a synonym for anarchism since this time252627 the term libertarianism was first used in the united states as a synonym for classic liberalism in may 1955 by writer dean russell a colleague of leonard read and a classic liberal himself he justified the choice of the word as follows “ many of us call ourselves liberals and it is true that the word liberal once described persons who respected the individual and feared the use of mass compulsions but the leftists have now corrupted that onceproud term to identify themselves and their program of more government ownership of property and more controls over persons as a result those of us who believe in freedom must explain that when we call ourselves liberals we mean liberals in the uncorrupted classical sense at best this is awkward and subject to misunderstanding here is a suggestion let those of us who love liberty trademark and reserve for our own use the good and honorable word libertarian ” — jeffrey tucker 28 subsequently a growing number of americans with classical liberal beliefs in the united states began to describe themselves as libertarian the person most responsible for popularizing the term libertarian was murray rothbard29 who started publishing libertarian works in the 1960s libertarianism in the united states has been described as conservative on economic issues and liberal on personal freedom30 for common meanings of conservative and liberal in the united states but it is also often associated with a foreign policy of noninterventionism3132 although the word libertarian has been used to refer to socialists internationally its meaning in the united states has deviated from its political origins3334 philosophyedit there is contention about whether right left and socialist libertarianism represent distinct ideologies as opposed to variations on a theme35 all libertarians begin with a conception of personal autonomy from which they argue in favor of civil liberties and a reduction or elimination of the state rightlibertarianism36 developed in the united states in the mid20th century and is the most popular conception of libertarianism in that region37 it is commonly referred to as a continuation or radicalization of classical liberalism3839 rightlibertarians value the social institutions that enforce conditions of capitalism while rejecting institutions that function in opposition to these institutions anarchocapitalists4041 seek complete elimination of the state in favor of privately funded security services while minarchists defend nightwatchman states which maintain only those functions of government necessary to maintain conditions of capitalism critics such as corey robin describe rightlibertarianism as fundamentally a reactionary conservative ideology united with more traditional conservative thought and goals by a desire to enforce hierarchical power and social relations42 conservatism then is not a commitment to limited government and liberty—or a wariness of change a belief in evolutionary reform or a politics of virtue these may be the byproducts of conservatism one or more of its historically specific and everchanging modes of expression but they are not its animating purpose neither is conservatism a makeshift fusion of capitalists christians and warriors for that fusion is impelled by a more elemental force—the opposition to the liberation of men and women from the fetters of their superiors particularly in the private sphere such a view might seem miles away from the libertarian defense of the free market with its celebration of the atomistic and autonomous individual but it is not when the libertarian looks out upon society he does not see isolated individuals he sees private often hierarchical groups where a father governs his family and an owner his employees leftlibertarianism encompasses those libertarian beliefs that claim the earths natural resources belong to everyone in an egalitarian manner either unowned or owned collectively contemporary leftlibertarians such as hillel steiner peter vallentyne philippe van parijs michael otsuka and david ellerman believe the appropriation of land must leave enough and as good for others or be taxed by society to compensate for the exclusionary effects of private property libertarian socialists social and individualist anarchists libertarian marxists council communists luxemburgists and deleonists promote usufruct and socialist economic theories including communism collectivism syndicalism and mutualism they criticize the state for being the defender of private property and believe capitalism entails wage slavery personal autonomyedit anarchism envisages freedom as a form of autonomy43 which paul goodman describes as the ability to initiate a task and do it ones own way without orders from authorities who do not know the actual problem and the available means44 all anarchists oppose political and legal authority but collectivist strains also oppose the economic authority of private property45 these social anarchists emphasize mutual aid whereas individualist anarchists extoll individual sovereignty46 some rightlibertarians consider the nonaggression principle nap to be a core part of their beliefs4748 civil libertiesedit american anarchist emma goldman prominent anarchafeminist free love and freethought activist libertarians have been advocates and activists of civil liberties including free love and free thought4950 advocates of free love viewed sexual freedom as a clear direct expression of individual sovereignty they particularly stressed womens rights as most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and antibirth control measures51 free love appeared alongside anarchafeminism and advocacy of lgbt rights anarchafeminism developed as a synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism and views patriarchy as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government it was inspired by the late19thcentury writings of early feminist anarchists such as lucy parsons emma goldman voltairine de cleyre and virginia bolten anarchafeminists like other radical feminists criticise and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family education and gender roles free society 1895–1897 as the firebrand 1897–1904 as free society was an anarchist newspaper in the united states that staunchly advocated free love and womens rights while criticizing comstockery the censorship of sexual information52 in recent times anarchism has also voiced opinions and taken action around certain sexrelated subjects such as pornography53 bdsm54 and the sex industry54 free thought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds opinions should be formed on the basis of science logic and reason in contrast with authority tradition or other dogmas5556 in the united states free thought was an antichristian anticlerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide on religious matters a number of contributors to liberty were prominent figures in both free thought and anarchism in 1901 catalan anarchist and freethinker francesc ferrer i guàrdia established modern or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church57 fiercely anticlerical ferrer believed in freedom in education ie education free from the authority of the church and state58 the schools stated goal was to educate the working class in a rational secular and noncoercive setting later in the 20th century austrian freudomarxist wilhelm reich became a consistent propagandist for sexual freedom going as far as opening free sexcounselling clinics in vienna for workingclass patients59 as well as coining the phrase sexual revolution in one of his books from the 1940s60 during the early 1970s the english anarchist and pacifist alex comfort achieved international celebrity for writing the sex manuals the joy of sex and more joy of sex stateedit most leftlibertarians are anarchists and believe the state inherently violates personal autonomy as robert paul wolff has argued since the state is authority the right to rule anarchism which rejects the state is the only political doctrine consistent with autonomy in which the individual alone is the judge of his moral constraints45 social anarchists believe the state defends private property which they view as intrinsically harmful while marketoriented leftlibertarians argue that socalled free markets actually consist of economic privileges granted by the state these latter libertarians advocate instead for freed markets which are freed from these privileges61 there is a debate amongst rightlibertarians as to whether or not the state is legitimate while anarchocapitalists advocate its abolition minarchists support minimal states often referred to as nightwatchman states libertarians take a skeptical view of government authority62unreliable source minarchists maintain that the state is necessary for the protection of individuals from aggression theft breach of contract and fraud they believe the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military police and courts though some expand this list to include fire departments prisons and the executive and legislative branches63 they justify the state on the grounds that it is the logical consequence of adhering to the nonaggression principle and argue that anarchism is immoral because it implies that the nonaggression principle is optional that the enforcement of laws under anarchism is open to competitioncitation needed another common justification is that private defense agencies and court firms would tend to represent the interests of those who pay them enough64 anarchocapitalists argue that the state violates the nonaggression principle by its nature because governments use force against those who have not stolen or vandalized private property assaulted anyone or committed fraud6566 linda morris tannehill argue that no coercive monopoly of force can arise on a truly free market and that a governments citizenry can not desert them in favor of a competent protection and defense agency67 property rightsedit rightlibertarians maintain that unowned natural resources may be appropriated by the first person who discovers them mixes his labor with them or merely claims them—without the consent of others and with little or no payment to them they believe that natural resources are originally unowned and therefore private parties may appropriate them at will without the consent of or owing to others68 leftlibertarians believe that neither claiming nor mixing ones labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights6970 and maintain that natural resources ought to be held in some egalitarian manner either unowned or owned collectively71 economicsedit rightlibertarians are economic liberals of either the austrian school or chicago school and support laissezfaire capitalism72 leftlibertarians social and individualist anarchists libertarian marxists and leftwing market anarchists argue in favor of socialist theories such as communism syndicalism and mutualism anarchist economics daniel guérin writes that anarchism is really a synonym for socialism the anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the state73 wage labouredit wage labour has long been compared by socialists and anarchosyndicalists to slavery74757677 as a result the term wage slavery is often utilised as a pejorative for wage labor78 advocates of slavery looked upon the comparative evils of slave society and of free society of slavery to human masters and slavery to capital79 and proceeded to argue that wage slavery was actually worse than chattel slavery80 slavery apologists like george fitzhugh contended that workers only accepted wage labour with the passage of time as they became familiarized and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhaled79 according to noam chomsky analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the enlightenment era in his 1791 book on the limits of state action classical liberal thinker wilhelm von humboldt explained how whatever does not spring from a mans free choice or is only the result of instruction and guidance does not enter into his very nature he does not perform it with truly human energies but merely with mechanical exactness and so when the labourer works under external control we may admire what he does but we despise what he is81 for marxists labourascommodity which is how they regard wage labour82 provides an absolutely fundamental point of attack against capitalism83 it can be persuasively argued noted philosopher john nelson that the conception of the workers labour as a commodity confirms marxs stigmatization of the wage system of private capitalism as wageslavery that is as an instrument of the capitalists for reducing the workers condition to that of a slave if not below it84 that this objection is fundamental follows immediately from marxs conclusion that wage labour is the very foundation of capitalism without a class dependent on wages the moment individuals confront each other as free persons there can be no production of surplus value without the production of surplusvalue there can be no capitalist production and hence no capital and no capitalist85 prominent currentsedit rightlibertarianismedit main article rightlibertarianism paleolibertarianismedit paleolibertarianism is a variety of libertarianism developed by capitalist theorists murray rothbard and llewellyn rockwell that combines conservative cultural values and social philosophy with a libertarian opposition to government intervention paleolibertarianism is a controversial current due its connections to the tea party movement and the altright however these movements are united by an antiobama stance and liberal gun laws instead of further ideological overlaps in the essay rightwing populism a strategy for the paleo movement rothbard reflected on the ability of paleolibertarians to engage in an outreach to rednecks founded on social conservatism and radical libertarianism he cited former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke and former us senator joseph mccarthy as models for the new movement86 in europe european unionparliamentarian janusz korwinmikke supports both libertarian economics and antiimmigration and misogynistic positions one of korwinmikkes idiosyncratic claims that caught public attention was him denying the basis for womens suffrage as according to him most women were not interested in politics anyway and would more often vote for a welfare state87 he pointed out that in the top 100 chess players there is only one woman88 on 8 september 2015 korwinmikke was giving a speech in european parliament about the european migrant crisis during which he described immigrants unwilling to work and only interested in welfare as human garbage89 neoclassical liberalismedit friedrich hayek traditional classical liberalism is a political philosophy and ideology belonging to liberalism in which primary emphasis is placed on securing the freedom of the individual by limiting the power of the government and maximizing the power of capitalist market forces the philosophy emerged as a response to the industrial revolution and urbanization in the 19th century in europe and the united states90 it advocates civil liberties with a limited government under the rule of law and belief in laissezfaire economic policy919293 classical liberalism is built on ideas that had already arisen by the end of the 18th century such as selected ideas of adam smith john locke jeanbaptiste say thomas malthus and david ricardo stressing the belief in free market and natural law94 utilitarianism95 and progress96 classical liberals were more suspicious than conservatives of all but the most minimal government97 and adopting thomas hobbess theory of government they believed government had been created by individuals to protect themselves from one another98 neoliberalism neoliberalism emerged in the era following world war ii during which social liberalism and keynesianism were the dominant ideologies in the western world it was led by economists such as friedrich hayek and milton friedman99 who advocated the reduction of the state and a return to classical liberalism however it did accept some aspects of social liberalism such as some degree of welfare provision by the state but on a greatly reduced scale hayek and friedman used the term classical liberalism to refer to their ideas but others use the term to refer to all liberalism before the 20th century not to designate any particular set of political views and therefore see all modern developments as being by definition not classical100 as a result the term neoliberalism has often been used as an alternative though this term has developed negative connotations and is now usually only used as a pejorative anarchocapitalismedit main article anarchocapitalism murray rothbard anarchocapitalism also referred to as freemarket anarchism101 market anarchism102 and privateproperty anarchism103 is a political philosophy which advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty in a free market104105​106 in an anarchocapitalist society law enforcement courts and all other security services would be provided by privately funded competitors rather than through taxation and money would be privately and competitively provided in an open market107 therefore personal and economic activities under anarchocapitalism would be regulated by privately run law rather than through politics108 the most wellknown version of anarchocapitalism was formulated in the mid20th century by austrian school economist and libertarian murray rothbard murray coined the term and is widely regarded as its founder he combined the freemarket approach from the austrian school of economics classical liberalism with the human rights views and a rejection of the state he learned from 19thcentury american individualist anarchists such as lysander spooner and benjamin tucker though he rejected the anarchists anticapitalism along with the labor theory of value and the normative implications they derived from itnote 1109 in rothbardian anarchocapitalism there would first be the implementation of a mutually agreedupon libertarian legal code which would be generally accepted and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow110 this legal code would recognize sovereignty of the individual and the principle of nonaggression leftlibertarianismedit main article

circles is a group of antiauthoritarian116 political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy117 including criticism of wage labour relationships within the workplace118 as well as the state itself119 it emphasizes workers selfmanagement of the workplace119 and decentralized structures of political organization120 asserting that a society based on freedom and equality can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite121 libertarian socialists generally place their hopes in decentralized means of direct democracy and federal or confederal associations122 such as libertarian municipalism citizens assemblies trade unions and workers councils123124 all of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian125 and voluntary human relationships126 through the identification criticism and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life127128129130131132133134 as such libertarian socialism within the larger socialist movement seeks to distinguish itself both from leninismbolshevism and from social democracy135 past and present political philosophies and movements commonly described as libertarian socialist include

leftlibertarian scholars such as hillel steiner145 peter vallentyne146 philippe van parijs147 michael otsuka148 and david ellerman149150 root an economic egalitarianism in the classical liberal concepts of selfownership and land appropriation combined with geoist or physiocratic views regarding the ownership of land and natural resources eg those of john locke and henry georgenote 2 they hold that it is illegitimate for anyone to claim private ownership of natural resources to the detriment of others151note 3note 4 instead unappropriated natural resources are either unowned or owned in common and private appropriation is only legitimate if everyone can appropriate an equal amount or if private appropriation is taxed to compensate those who are excluded from natural resources most leftlibertarians support some form of income redistribution on the grounds of a claim by each individual to be entitled to an equal share of natural resources152 a number of leftlibertarians of this school argue for the desirability of some state social welfare programs153154 geolibertarianismedit see also geolibertarianism and georgism henry george geolibertarianism is a political movement and ideology that synthesizes libertarianism and geoist theory traditionally known as georgism155156 geolibertarians are advocates of geoism which is the position that all natural resources including land are common assets which all individuals have an equal right to access therefore individuals must pay rent to the community if they claim land as their private property rent need not be paid for the mere use of land but only for the right to exclude others from that land and for the protection of ones title by government they simultaneously agree with the rightlibertarian position that each individual has an exclusive right to the fruits of his or her labor as their private property as opposed to this product being owned collectively by society or the community and that ones labor wages and the products of labor should not be taxed as with traditional libertarians they advocate full civil liberties with no crimes unless there are victims who have been invaded155 geolibertarians generally advocate distributing the land rent to the community via a land value tax as proposed by henry george and others before him for this reason they are often called single taxers fred e foldvary coined the word geolibertarianism in an article so titled in land and liberty157 in the case of geoanarchism a proposed voluntaryist form of geolibertarianism as described by foldvary rent would be collected by private associations with the opportunity to secede from a geocommunity and not receive the geocommunitys services if desired158 historyedit age of enlightenmentedit see also age of enlightenment history of liberalism and french revolution john locke the father of classical liberalism elements of libertarianism can be traced as far back as the ancient chinese philosopher laotzu and the higherlaw concepts of the greeks and the israelites159160 in 17thcentury england libertarian ideas began to take modern form in the writings of the levellers and john locke in the middle of that century opponents of royal power began to be called whigs or sometimes simply opposition or country as opposed to court writers161 during the 18th century classical liberal ideas flourished in europe and north america162163 libertarians of various schools were influenced by classical liberal ideas164 for libertarian philosopher roderick t long both libertarian socialists and libertarian capitalists share a common—or at least an overlapping intellectual ancestry— both claim the seventeenth century english levellers and the eighteenth century french encyclopedists among their ideological forebears and also usually share an admiration for thomas jefferson165166167 and thomas paine168 thomas paine john locke greatly influenced both libertarianism and the modern world in his writings published before and after the english revolution of 1688 especially a letter concerning toleration 1667 two treatises of government 1689 and an essay concerning human understanding 1690 in the latter he established the basis of liberal political theory that peoples rights existed before government that the purpose of government is to protect personal and property rights that people may dissolve governments that do not do so and that representative government is the best form to protect rights169 the united states declaration of independence was inspired by locke in its statement to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it170 nevertheless scholar ellen meiksins wood says that there are doctrines of individualism that are opposed to lockean individualism and nonlockean individualism may encompass socialism171 according to murray rothbard the libertarian creed emerged from the classical liberal challenges to an absolute central state and a king ruling by divine right on top of an older restrictive web of feudal land monopolies and urban guild controls and restrictions the mercantilism of a bureaucratic warfaring state allied with privileged merchants the object of classical liberals was individual liberty in the economy in personal freedoms and civil liberty separation of state and religion and peace as an alternative to imperial aggrandizement he cites lockes contemporaries the levellers who held similar views also influential were the english catos letters during the early 1700s reprinted eagerly by american colonists who already were free of european aristocracy and feudal land monopolies170 in january of 1776 only two years after coming to america from england thomas paine published his pamphlet common sense calling for independence for the colonies172 paine promoted classical liberal ideas in clear concise language that allowed the general public to understand the debates among the political elites173 common sense was immensely popular in disseminating these ideas174 selling hundreds of thousands of copies175 paine later would write the rights of man and the age of reason and participate in the french revolution172 paines theory of property showed a libertarian concern with the redistribution of resources176 in 1793 william godwin wrote a libertarian philosophical treatise enquiry concerning political justice and its influence on morals and happiness which criticized ideas of human rights and of society by contract based on vague promises he took classical liberalism to its logical anarchic conclusion by rejecting all political institutions law government and apparatus of coercion as well as all political protest and insurrection instead of institutionalized justice godwin proposed that people influence one and other to moral goodness through informal reasoned persuasion including in the associations they joined and that this would facilitate human happiness177178 rise of anarchismedit main article history of anarchism pierrejoseph proudhon the first selfidentified anarchist modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jeanjacques rousseaus arguments for the moral centrality of freedom179 as part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the french revolution william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought180181 according to peter kropotkin godwin was the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work182 while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke183 godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism he argued in political justice 1793181184 that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power rather godwin advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution181185 his aversion to the imposition of a rulesbased society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the peoples mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage godwin considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment in france various anarchist currents were present during the revolutionary period with some revolutionaries using the term anarchiste in a positive light as early as september 1793186 the enragés opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms denouncing the jacobin dictatorship jean varlet wrote in 1794 that government and revolution are incompatible unless the people wishes to set its constituted authorities in permanent insurrection against itself187 in his manifesto of the equals sylvain maréchal looked forward to the disappearance once and for all of the revolting distinction between rich and poor of great and small of masters and valets of governors and governed187 libertarian socialismedit main article libertarian socialism sébastien faure prominent french theorist of libertarian communism and freethoughtatheist militant libertarian socialism libertarian communism and libertarian marxism are all phrases which activists with a variety of perspectives have applied to their views188 anarchist communist philosopher joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as a libertarian189 unlike mutualist anarchist philosopher pierrejoseph proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature190191 according to anarchist historian max nettlau the first use of the term libertarian communism was in november 1880 when a french anarchist congress employed it to more clearly identify its doctrines192 the french anarchist journalist sébastien faure started the weekly paper le libertaire the libertarian in 1895193 individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems194195 an influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism196 or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and bestknown proponents of individualist anarchism the german max stirner197 stirners the ego and its own published in 1844 is a founding text of the philosophy197 according to stirner the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire198 without regard for god state or morality199 stirner advocated selfassertion and foresaw unions of egoists nonsystematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will200 which stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state201 egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals202 egoism has inspired many interpretations of stirners philosophy it was rediscovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and lgbt activist john henry mackay josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist203 and the fourpage weekly paper he edited during 1833 the peaceful revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published204 for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster it is apparent that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews william b greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form205 later benjamin tucker fused stirners egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals206 free love and birth control advocates anarchism and issues related to love and sex207208 individualist naturists nudists anarchonaturism209210211 free thought and anticlerical activists212213 as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation214215 european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france these authors and activists included emile armand han ryner henri zisly renzo novatore miguel gimenez igualada adolf brand and lev chernyi among others in 1873 the follower and translator of proudhon the catalan francesc pi i margall became president of spain with a program which wanted to establish a decentralized or cantonalist political system on proudhonian lines216 who according to rudolf rocker had political ideasmuch in common with those of richard price joseph priestly sic thomas paine jefferson and other representatives of the angloamerican liberalism of the first period he wanted to limit the power of the state to a minimum and gradually replace it by a socialist economic order217 on the other hand fermín salvochea was a mayor of the city of cádiz and a president of the province of cádiz he was one of the main propagators of anarchist thought in that area in the late 19th century and is considered to be perhaps the most beloved figure in the spanish anarchist movement of the 19th century218219 ideologically he was influenced by bradlaugh owen and paine whose works he had studied during his stay in england and kropotkin whom he read later218 the revolutionary wave of 1917–1923 saw the active participation of anarchists in russia and europe russian anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both the february and october 1917 revolutions however bolsheviks in central russia quickly began to imprison or drive underground the libertarian anarchists many fled to the ukraine220 there in the ukrainian free territory they fought in the russian civil war against the white movement monarchists and other opponents of revolution and then against bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman protested bolshevik policy before they left russia221 the victory of the bolsheviks damaged anarchist movements internationally as workers and activists joined communist parties in france and the united states for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww joined the communist international222 in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno issued a 1926 manifesto the organizational platform of the general union of anarchists draft calling for new anarchist organizing structures223224 the bavarian soviet republic of 1918–1919 had libertarian socialist characteristics225226 in italy from 1918 to 1921 the anarchosyndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana grew to 800000 members227 in the 1920s and 1930s with the rise of fascism in europe anarchists began to fight fascists in italy228 in france during the february 1934 riots229 and in spain where the cnt confederación nacional del trabajo boycott of elections led to a rightwing victory and its later participation in voting in 1936 helped bring the popular front back to power this led to a ruling class attempted coup and the spanish civil war 1936–1939230 gruppo comunista anarchico di firenze held that the during early twentieth century the terms libertarian communism and anarchist communism became synonymous within the international anarchist movement as a result of the close connection they had in spain anarchism in spain with libertarian communism becoming the prevalent term231 murray bookchin wrote that the spanish libertarian movement of the mid1930s was unique because its workers control and collectives—which came out of a threegeneration massive libertarian movement—divided the republican camp and challenged the marxists urban anarchists created libertarian communist forms of organization which evolved into the cnt a syndicalist union providing the infrastructure for a libertarian society also formed were local bodies to administer of social and economic life on a decentralized libertarian basis much of the infrastructure was destroyed during the 1930s spanish civil war against authoritarian and fascist forces232 the iberian federation of libertarian youth233 fijl spanish federación ibérica de juventudes libertarias sometimes abbreviated as libertarian youth juventudes libertarias was a libertarian socialist234 organisation created in 1932 in madrid235 in february 1937 the fijl organised a plenum of regional organisations second congress of fijl in october 1938 from the 16th through the 30th in barcelona the fijl participated in a national plenum of the libertarian movement also attended by members of the cnt and the iberian anarchist federation fai236 the fijl exists until today when the republican forces lost the spanish civil war the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist forces in 1939 by the last nonfrancoist mayor of the city the anarchist melchor rodríguez garcía237 during autumn of 1931 the manifesto of the 30 was published by militants of the anarchist trade union cnt and among those who signed it there was the cnt general secretary 1922–1923 joan peiro angel pestaña cnt general secretary in 1929 and juan lopez sanchez they were called treintismo and they were calling for libertarian possibilism which advocated achieving libertarian socialist ends with participation inside structures of contemporary parliamentary democracy238 in 1932 they establish the syndicalist party which participates in the 1936 spanish general elections and proceed to be a part of the leftist coalition of parties known as the popular front obtaining 2 congressmen pestaña and benito pabon in 1938 horacio prieto general secretary of the cnt proposes that the iberian anarchist federation transforms itself into a libertarian socialist party and that it participates in the national elections239 murray bookchin american libertarian socialist theorist and proponent of libertarian municipalism the manifesto of libertarian communism was written in 1953 by georges fontenis for the federation communiste libertaire of france it is one of the key texts of the anarchistcommunist current known as platformism240 in 1968 in carrara italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference to advance libertarian solidarity it wanted to form a strong and organised workers movement agreeing with the libertarian ideas241242 in the united states the libertarian league was founded in new york city in 1954 as a leftlibertarian political organisation building on the libertarian book club243244 members included sam dolgoff245 russell blackwell dave van ronk enrico arrigoni246 and murray bookchin in australia the sydney push was a predominantly leftwing intellectual subculture in sydney from the late 1940s to the early 1970s which became associated with the label sydney libertarianism well known associates of the push include jim baker john flaus harry hooton margaret fink sasha soldatow247 lex banning eva cox richard appleton paddy mcguinness david makinson germaine greer clive james robert hughes frank moorhouse and lillian roxon amongst the key intellectual figures in push debates were philosophers david j ivison george molnar roelof smilde darcy waters and jim baker as recorded in bakers memoir sydney libertarians and the push published in the libertarian broadsheet in 1975248 an understanding of libertarian values and social theory can be obtained from their publications a few of which are available online249250 in 1969 french platformist anarchocommunist daniel guérin published an essay in 1969 called libertarian marxism in which he dealt with the debate between karl marx and mikhail bakunin at the first international and afterwards suggested that libertarian marxism rejects determinism and fatalism giving the greater place to individual will intuition imagination reflex speeds and to the deep instincts of the masses which are more farseeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the elites libertarian marxism thinks of the effects of surprise provocation and boldness refuses to be cluttered and paralysed by a heavy scientific apparatus doesnt equivocate or bluff and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown251 libertarian marxist currents often draw from marx and engels later works specifically the grundrisse and the civil war in france252 they emphasize the marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state253 libertarian marxism includes such currents as council communism left communism socialisme ou barbarie lettrismsituationism and operaismoautonomism and new left254unreliable source in the united states from 1970 to 1981 there existed the publication root branch255 which had as a subtitle a libertarian marxist journal256 in 1974 the libertarian communism journal was started in the united kingdom by a group inside the socialist party of great britain257 in 1986 the anarchosyndicalist sam dolgoff started and led the publication libertarian labor review in the united states258 which decided to rename itself as anarchosyndicalist review in order to avoid confusion with rightlibertarian views259 individualism in the united statesedit josiah warren the indigenous anarchist tradition in the united states was largely individualist260 in 1825 josiah warren became aware of the social system of utopian socialist robert owen and began to talk with others in cincinnati about founding a communist colony261 when this group failed to come to an agreement about the form and goals of their proposed community warren sold his factory after only two years of operation packed up his young family and took his place as one of 900 or so owenites who had decided to become part of the founding population of new harmony indiana262 warren termed the phrase cost the limit of price263 and proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did they could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce264 he put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental laborforlabor store called the cincinnati time store where trade was facilitated by labor notes the store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism including utopia and modern times after new harmony failed warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism which was no great leap given that owens socialism had been predicated on godwins anarchism265 warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist264 and the fourpage weekly paper the peaceful revolutionist he edited during 1833 was the first anarchist periodical published204 an enterprise for which he built his own printing press cast his own type and made his own printing plates204 catalan historian xavier diez reports that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by warren were influential in european individualist anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as émile armand and the intentional communities started by them266 warren said that stephen pearl andrews individualist anarchist and close associate wrote the most lucid and complete exposition of warrens own theories in the science of society published in 1852267 andrews was formerly associated with the fourierist movement but converted to radical individualism after becoming acquainted with the work of warren like warren he held the principle of individual sovereignty as being of paramount importance contemporary american anarchist hakim bey reports steven pearl andrews was not a fourierist but he lived through the brief craze for phalansteries in america and adopted a lot of fourierist principles and practices a maker of worlds out of words he syncretized abolitionism in the united states free love spiritual universalism warren and fourier into a grand utopian scheme he called the universal pantarchy he was instrumental in founding several intentional communities including the brownstone utopia on 14th st in new york and modern times in brentwood long island the latter became as famous as the bestknown fourierist communes brook farm in massachusetts the north american phalanx in new jersey—in fact modern times became downright notorious for free love and finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity andrews and victoria woodhull were members of the infamous section 12 of the 1st international expelled by marx for its anarchist feminist and spiritualist tendencies268 for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster it is apparent that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews william b greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form269 william batchelder greene was a 19thcentury mutualist individualist anarchist unitarian minister soldier and promoter of free banking in the united states greene is best known for the works mutual banking which proposed an interestfree banking system and transcendentalism a critique of the new england philosophical school after 1850 he became active in labor reform269 he was elected vicepresident of the new england labor reform league the majority of the members holding to proudhons scheme of mutual banking and in 1869 president of the massachusetts labor union269 greene then published socialistic mutualistic and financial fragments 1875269 he saw mutualism as the synthesis of liberty and order269 his associationism is checked by individualism mind your own business judge not that ye be not judged over matters which are purely personal as for example moral conduct the individual is sovereign as well as over that which he himself produces for this reason he demands mutuality in marriage—the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property269 poet naturalist and transcendentalist henry david thoreau was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe he is best known for his book walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience resistance to civil government an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state in walden thoreau advocates simple living and selfsufficiency among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization270 civil disobedience first published in 1849 argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice these works influenced green anarchism anarchoprimitivism and anarchopacifism271 as well as figures including mohandas gandhi martin luther king jr martin buber and leo tolstoy271 many have seen in thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarchoprimitivism represented today in john zerzan for george woodcock this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of american society in the mid19th century270 zerzan included thoreaus excursions in his edited compilation of anticivilization writings against civilization readings and reflections272 individualist anarchists such as thoreau273274 do not speak of economics but simply the right of disunion from the state and foresee the gradual elimination of the state through social evolution agorist author j neil schulman cites thoreau as a primary inspiration 275 economists since adam smith have known that—unlike other taxes—a land value tax would not cause economic inefficiency276 it would be a progressive tax277—primarily paid by the wealthy—and increase wages reduce economic inequality remove incentives to misuse real estate and reduce the vulnerability that economies face from credit and property bubbles278279 early proponents of this view include thomas paine herbert spencer and hugo grotius151 but the concept was widely popularized by the economist and social reformer henry george280 george believed that people ought to own the fruits of their labor and the value of the improvements they make thus he was opposed to income taxes sales taxes taxes on improvements and all other taxes on production labor trade or commerce george was among the staunchest defenders of free markets and his book protection or free trade was read into the us congressional record281 yet he did support direct management of natural monopolies as a last resort such as rightofway monopolies necessary for railroads george advocated for elimination of intellectual property arrangements in favor of government sponsored prizes for inventors282not in citation given early followers of georges philosophy called themselves single taxers because they believed that the only legitimate broadbased tax was land rent the term georgism was coined later though some modern proponents prefer the term geoism instead283 leaving the meaning of geo earth in greek deliberately ambiguous the terms earth sharing284 geonomics285 and geolibertarianism286 are used by some georgists to represent a difference of emphasis or real differences about how land rent should be spent but all agree that land rent should be recovered from its private owners benjamin tucker individualist anarchist and publisher of the periodical liberty individualist anarchism found in the united states an important space for discussion and development within the group known as the boston anarchists287 even among the 19thcentury american individualists there was no monolithic doctrine and they disagreed amongst each other on various issues including intellectual property rights and possession versus property in land288289290 some boston anarchists including benjamin tucker identified as socialists which in the 19th century was often used in the sense of a commitment to improving conditions of the working class ie the labor problem291 lysander spooner besides his individualist anarchist activism was also an antislavery activist and member of the first international292 tucker argued that the elimination of what he called the four monopolies—the land monopoly the money and banking monopoly the monopoly powers conferred by patents and the quasimonopolistic effects of tariffs—would undermine the power of the wealthy and big business making possible widespread property ownership and higher incomes for ordinary people while minimizing the power of wouldbe bosses and achieving socialist goals without state action tuckers anarchist periodical liberty was published from august 1881 to april 1908 the publication emblazoned with proudhons quote that liberty is not the daughter but the mother of order was instrumental in developing and formalizing the individualist anarchist philosophy through publishing essays and serving as a forum for debate contributors included benjamin tucker lysander spooner auberon herbert dyer lum joshua k ingalls john henry mackay victor yarros wordsworth donisthorpe james l walker j william lloyd florence finch kelly voltairine de cleyre steven t byington john beverley robinson jo labadie lillian harman and henry appleton293 later tucker and others abandoned their traditional support of natural rights and converted to an egoism modeled upon the philosophy of max stirner289 a number of natural rights proponents stopped contributing in protest and thereafter liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly294 several publications were undoubtedly influenced by libertys presentation of egoism they included i published by cl swartz edited by we gordak and jw lloyd all associates of liberty the ego and the egoist both of which were edited by edward h fulton among the egoist papers that tucker followed were the german der eigene edited by adolf brand and the eagle and the serpent issued from london the latter the most prominent englishlanguage egoist journal was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle a journal of egoistic philosophy and sociology294 modern american libertarianismedit main article libertarianism in the united states by around the start of the 20th century the heyday of individualist anarchism had passed295 h l mencken and albert jay nock were the first prominent figures in the united states to describe themselves as libertarians296 they believed franklin d roosevelt had coopted the word liberal for his new deal policies which they opposed and used libertarian to signify their allegiance to individualismcitation needed in 1914 nock joined the staff of the nation magazine which at the time was supportive of liberal capitalism a lifelong admirer of henry george nock went on to become coeditor of the freeman from 1920 to 1924 a publication initially conceived as a vehicle for the single tax movement financed by the wealthy wife of the magazines other editor francis neilson297 critic hl mencken wrote that his editorials during the three brief years of the freeman set a mark that no other man of his trade has ever quite managed to reach they were wellinformed and sometimes even learned but there was never the slightest trace of pedantry in them298 executive vicepresident of the cato institute david boaz writes in 1943 at one of the lowest points for liberty and humanity in history three remarkable women published books that could be said to have given birth to the modern libertarian movement299 isabel patersons the god of the machine rose wilder lanes the discovery of freedom and ayn rands the fountainhead each promoted individualism and capitalism none of the three used the term libertarianism to describe their beliefs and rand specifically rejected the label criticizing the burgeoning american libertarian movement as the hippies of the right300 rands own philosophy objectivism is notedly similar to libertarianism and she accused libertarians of plagiarizing her ideas300 rand stated that all kinds of people today call themselves libertarians especially something calling itself the new right which consists of hippies who are anarchists instead of leftist collectivists but anarchists are collectivists capitalism is the one system that requires absolute objective law yet libertarians combine capitalism and anarchism thats worse than anything the new left has proposed its a mockery of philosophy and ideology they sling slogans and try to ride on two bandwagons they want to be hippies but don’t want to preach collectivism because those jobs are already taken but anarchism is a logical outgrowth of the antiintellectual side of collectivism i could deal with a marxist with a greater chance of reaching some kind of understanding and with much greater respect anarchists are the scum of the intellectual world of the left which has given them up so the right picks up another leftist discard thats the libertarian movement301 in 1946 leonard e read founded the foundation for economic education fee an american nonprofit educational organization which promotes the principles of laissezfaire economics private property and limited government302 according to gary north former fee director of seminars and a current ludwig von mises institute scholar fee is the granddaddy of all libertarian organizations303 the initial officers of fee were leonard e read as president austrian school economist henry hazlitt as vicepresident and chairman david goodrich of b f goodrich other trustees on the fee board have included wealthy industrialist jasper crane of dupont h w luhnow of william volker co and robert welch founder of the john birch society304305306 austrian school economist murray rothbard was initially an enthusiastic partisan of the old right particularly because of its general opposition to war and imperialism307 but long embraced a reading of american history that emphasized the role of elite privilege in shaping legal and political institutions he was part of ayn rands circle for a brief period but later harshly criticized objectivism308 he praised rands atlas shrugged and wrote that she introduced me to the whole field of natural rights and natural law philosophy prompting him to learn the glorious natural rights tradition309pp121 132–34 he soon broke with rand over various differences including his defense of anarchism rothbard was influenced by the work of the 19thcentury american individualist anarchists310 and sought to meld their advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of austrian economics311 this new philosophy he called anarchocapitalism karl hess a speechwriter for barry goldwater and primary author of the republican partys 1960 and 1964 platforms became disillusioned with traditional politics following the 1964 presidential campaign in which goldwater lost to lyndon johnson he parted with the republicans altogether after being rejected for employment with the party and began work as a heavyduty welder hess began reading american anarchists largely due to the recommendations of his friend murray rothbard and said that upon reading the works of communist anarchist emma goldman he discovered that anarchists believed everything he had hoped the republican party would represent for hess goldman was the source for the best and most essential theories of ayn rand without any of the crazy solipsism that rand was so fond of312 hess and rothbard founded the journal left and right a journal of libertarian thought which was published from 1965 to 1968 with george resch and leonard p liggio in 1969 they edited the libertarian forum 1969 which hess left in 1971 hess eventually put his focus on the small scale stating that society is people together making culture he deemed two of his cardinal social principles to be opposition to central political authority and concern for people as individuals his rejection of standard american party politics was reflected in a lecture he gave during which he said the democrats or liberals think that everybody is stupid and therefore they need somebody to tell them how to behave themselves the republicans think everybody is lazy313 the nolan chart created by libertarian david nolan expands the leftright line into a twodimensional chart classifying the political spectrum by degrees of personal and economic freedom the vietnam war split the uneasy alliance between growing numbers of american libertarians and conservatives who believed in limiting liberty to uphold moral virtues libertarians opposed to the war joined the draft resistance and peace movements as well as organizations such as students for a democratic society sds in 1969 and 1970 hess joined with others including murray rothbard robert lefevre dana rohrabacher samuel edward konkin iii and former sds leader carl oglesby to speak at two leftright conferences which brought together activists from both the old right and the new left in what was emerging as a nascent libertarian movement314 as part of his effort to unite right and leftlibertarianism hess would join the sds as well as the industrial workers of the world iww of which he explained we used to have a labor movement in this country until iww leaders were killed or imprisoned you could tell labor unions had become captive when business and government began to praise them theyre destroying the militant black leaders the same way now if the slaughter continues before long liberals will be asking what happened to the blacks why arent they militant anymore315 rothbard ultimately broke with the left allying himself instead with the burgeoning paleoconservative movement316 he criticized the tendency of these leftlibertarians to appeal to free spirits to people who dont want to push other people around and who dont want to be pushed around themselves in contrast to the bulk of americans who might well be tightassed conformists who want to stamp out drugs in their vicinity kick out people with strange dress habits etc317 this leftlibertarian tradition has been carried to the present day by samuel edward konkin iiis agorists contemporary mutualists such as kevin carson and roderick t long and other leftwing market anarchists318 in 1971 a small group of americans led by david nolan formed the libertarian party319 which has run a presidential candidate every election year since 1972 other libertarian organizations such as the center for libertarian studies and the cato institute were also formed in the 1970s320 philosopher john hospers a onetime member of rands inner circle proposed a noninitiation of force principle to unite both groups but this statement later became a required pledge for candidates of the libertarian party and hospers became its first presidential candidate in 1972citation needed in the 1980s hess joined the libertarian party and served as editor of its newspaper from 1986 to 1990 modern libertarianism gained significant recognition in academia with the publication of harvard university professor robert nozicks anarchy state and utopia in 1974 for which he received a national book award in 1975321 in response to john rawlss a theory of justice nozicks book supported a nightwatchman state on the grounds that it was an inevitable phenomenon which could arise without violating individual rights322 in the early 1970s rothbard wrote that one gratifying aspect of our rise to some prominence is that for the first time in my memory we our side had captured a crucial word from the enemy libertarians had long been simply a polite word for leftwing anarchists that is for antiprivate property anarchists either of the communist or syndicalist variety but now we had taken it over323 since the resurgence of neoliberalism in the 1970s this modern american libertarianism has spread beyond north america via think tanks and political parties324325 contemporary

in the late sixties students and workers revolts330 in 1968 in carrara italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing european federations of france the italian and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile242331 the uprisings of may 1968 also led to a small resurgence of interest in left communist ideas various small left communist groups emerged around the world predominantly in the leading capitalist countries a series of conferences of the communist left began in 1976 with the aim of promoting international and crosstendency discussion but these petered out in the 1980s without having increased the profile of the movement or its unity of ideas332 left communist groups existing today include the international communist party international communist current and the internationalist communist tendency the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona spain in denmark squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the freetown christiania an autonomous haven in central copenhagen around the turn of the 21st century libertarian socialism grew in popularity and influence as part of the antiwar anticapitalist and antiglobalisation movements333 anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization wto group of eight and the world economic forum some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police these actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs and other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet333 a significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in 1999333 for english anarchist scholar simon critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudolibertarianism of contemporary neoliberalismone might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socioeconomic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally334 this might also have been motivated by the collapse of ‘really existing socialism’ and the capitulation to neoliberalism of western social democracy335 libertarian socialists in the early 21st century have been involved in the alterglobalization movement squatter movement social centers infoshops antipoverty groups such as ontario coalition against poverty and food not bombs tenants unions housing

socially liberal based on the common united states meanings of the terms and against government intervention in economic affairs and for expansion of personal freedoms336 through 20 polls on this topic spanning 13 years gallup found that voters who are libertarian on the political spectrum ranged from 17–23 of the united states electorate338 however a 2014 pew poll found that 23 of americans

national debt and federal budget deficit by reducing government spending and taxes which had a significant libertarian component340 despite having contrasts with libertarian values and views in some areas such as nationalism free trade social issues and immigration341 a 2011 reasonrupe poll found that among those who selfidentified as tea party supporters 41 percent leaned libertarian and 59 percent socially conservative342 the movement named after the boston tea party also contains conservative343 and populist elements344 and has sponsored multiple protests and supported various political candidates since 2009 tea party activities have declined since 2010 with the number of chapters across the country slipping from about 1000 to 600345346 mostly tea party organizations are said to have shifted away from national demonstrations to local issues345 following the selection of paul ryan as mitt romneys 2012 vicepresidential running mate the new york times declared that tea

received 1 of the popular vote amounting to more than 12 million votes349350 johnson has expressed a desire to win at least 5 percent of the vote so that the libertarian party candidates could get

criticismedit main article criticism of libertarianism criticism of libertarianism includes ethical economic environmental and pragmatic concerns it has also been arguedby whom that laissezfaire capitalism does not necessarily produce the best or most efficient outcome nor does its policy of deregulation prevent the abuse of natural resources furthermore libertarianism has been criticized as utopian due to the lack of any such societies today libertarianism particularly the right wing and free market variant of the ideology has also been criticized by author michael lind as being incompatible with democracy and apologetic towards autocracy360 government decentralizationedit further information decentralization john donahue argues that if political power were radically shifted

american anarchists of the 19th century such as lysander spooner and benjamin tucker scholars representing this school of leftlibertarianism often understand their position in contrast to other libertarians who maintain that there are no fair share constraints on use or appropriation that individuals have the power to appropriate unowned things by claiming them usually by mixing their labor with them and deny any other conditions or considerations are relevant and that there is no justification for the state to redistribute resources to the needy or to overcome market failures

will be equality by abolition of private property while retaining respect for personal property and liberty by abolition of authority we therefore foresee a society in which all activities will be coordinated a structure that has at the same time sufficient flexibility to permit the greatest possible autonomy for social life or for the life of each enterprise and enough cohesiveness to prevent all disorderin a wellorganized society all of these things must be systematically accomplished by means of parallel federations vertically united at the highest levels constituting one vast organism

unending struggle since progress in achieving a more just society will lead to new insight and understanding of forms of oppression that may be concealed in traditional practice and consciousness  authority is defined in terms of the right to exercise social control as explored in the sociology of power and the correlative duty to obey as explred in the philosophy of practical reason anarchism is distinguished philosophically by its scepticism towards such moral relations—by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power—and practically by its challenge to those authoritative

that they must turn either to the right or to the left —follow either the path of authority or the path of liberty marx went one way warren and proudhon the other thus were born state socialism and anarchismauthority takes many shapes but broadly speaking her enemies divide themselves into three classes first those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress opposing her openly avowedly sincerely consistently universally second those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world third those who distrust her as a means of progress believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon violating and outraging her these three phases of opposition to liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity good representatives of the first are seen in the catholic church and the russian
