in south africa 1975 peter andreas thiel was born in frankfurt am main west germany on october 11 1967 to susanne and klaus friedrich thiel678 the family migrated to the united states when peter was aged one and lived in cleveland where klaus worked as a chemical engineer klaus then worked for various mining companies which caused an itinerant upbringing for thiel and his younger brother patrick michael thiel910 thiels mother naturalized as a us citizen but his father did not8 before settling in foster city california in 1977 the thiels had lived in south africa and southwest africa and peter had to change elementary schools seven times one of peters elementary schools a strict establishment in swakopmund required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment such as striking students hands with a ruler for mistakes this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in thiels support for individualism and libertarianism as an adult1112 in his youth thiel played dungeons dragons was an avid reader of science fiction with isaac asimov and robert a heinlein among his favorite authors and a fan of j r r tolkiens works stating as an adult that he had read the lord of the rings over ten times during his childhood13 he has since founded 6 firms palantir technologies valar ventures mithril capital lembas llc rivendell llc and arda capital whose names originate from tolkien14 education in school thiel excelled in mathematics and scored first in a californiawide mathematics competition while attending middle school in san mateo15 at the san mateo high school he read ayn rand admired the optimism and anticommunism of thenpresident ronald reagan and was valedictorian of his graduating class in 19851516 after graduating from san mateo high school thiel went on to study philosophy at stanford university during thiels time at stanford debates on identity politics and political correctness were ongoing at the university and a western culture program which was criticized by the rainbow agenda because of a perceived overrepresentation of the achievements made by european men was replaced with a culture ideas and values course which instead pushed diversity and multiculturalism this replacement provoked controversy on the campus and led to thiel founding the stanford review a paper for conservative and libertarian viewpoints in 1987 through the funding of irving kristol17 thiel served as the stanford reviews first editorinchief and remained in that post until he received his bachelor of arts in 1989 at which point his friend david o sacks became the new editorinchief18 thiel then continued on to the stanford law school and acquired his doctor of jurisprudence in 199219 while at stanford thiel encountered rené girard whose mimetic theory influenced him20 mimetic theory posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis and that imitation can engender pointless conflict girard notes the productive potential of competition it is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially if not individually acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another21 thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures stating the big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us and while we get better at the things were competing on we lose sight of anything thats important or transcendent or truly meaningful in our world2223 career early career after graduating from the stanford law school thiel had interviews with supreme court justices antonin scalia and anthony kennedy24 after not being hired he instead took up a post as a judicial clerk for judge james larry edmondson of the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit but soon moved to new york to work as a securities lawyer for sullivan cromwell after seven months and three days he left the law firm citing a lack of transcendental value in his work25 he then took a job as a derivatives trader in currency options at credit suisse working there from 1993 on while also operating as a speechwriter for formerunited states secretary of education william bennett before again feeling as though his work lacked meaningful value and returning to california in 199626 upon returning to the bay area thiel noticed that the development of the internet and personal computer had already altered the economic landscape and the dotcom boom was well underway with financial support from friends and family he was able to raise 1 million toward the establishment of thiel capital management and embark on his venture capital career early on he experienced a setback after investing 100000 in his friend luke noseks unsuccessful webbased calendar project however his luck changed when max levchin a friend of noseks introduced him to his cryptographyrelated company idea which later became their first venture called confinity in 1998 paypal further information paypal § early history with confinity thiel realized they could develop a software to solve a gap in making online payments although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more available payment options not all merchants could gain the necessary hardware to accept credit cards thus consumers were often left with little choice and instead had to pay with exact cash or personal checks thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet in the hopes of ensuring more consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices and in 1999 confinity launched paypal paypal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money and according to eric m jacksons account in his book the paypal wars thiel viewed paypals mission as liberating people throughout the world from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation jackson recalls an inspirational speech by thiel in 1999 were definitely onto something big the need paypal answers is monumental everyone in the world needs money – to get paid to trade to live paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment you can run out of it it wears out it can get lost or stolen in the twentyfirst century people need a form of money thats more convenient and secure something that can be accessed from anywhere with a pda or an internet connection of course what were calling convenient for american users will be revolutionary for the developing world many of these countries governments play fast and loose with their currencies they use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations like we saw in russia and several southeast asian countries last year referring to the 1998 russian and 1997 asian financial crisis to take wealth away from their citizens most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like us dollars eventually paypal will be able to change this in the future when we make our service available outside the us and as internet penetration continues to expand to all economic tiers of people paypal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before it will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or pounds or yen in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure27 when paypal launched at a successful press conference in 1999 representatives from nokia and deutsche bank sent 3 million in venture funding to thiel using paypal on their palmpilots paypal then continued to grow through mergers with elon musk’s financial services company xcom and with pixo a company specializing in mobile commerce in 2000 these mergers allowed paypal to expand into the wireless phone market and transformed it into a safer and more userfriendly tool by enabling users to transfer money via a free online registration and email rather than by exchanging bank account information by 2001 paypal served over 65 million customers and had expanded its services to private consumers and businesses in twentysix countries paypal went public on february 15 2002 and was sold to ebay for 15 billion in october of that year28 thiels 37 stake was worth 55 million at the time of the acquisition29 clarium capital further information clarium capital following paypals sale to ebay in 2002 thiel devoted 10 million of his proceeds to establish clarium capital management a global macro hedge fund focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies interest rates commodities and equities thiel stated that the big macroeconomic idea that we had at clarium—the idée fixe—was the peakoil theory which was basically that the world was running out of oil and that there were no easy alternatives in 2003 clarium capital reflected a return of 656 as thiel successfully bet that the united states dollar would weaken in 2004 thiel spoke of the dotcom bubble having migrated in effect into a growing bubble in the financial sector and specified general electric and walmart as vulnerable in 2005 clarium saw a 571 return as thiel predicted that the dollar would rally this success saw clarium honored as global macro hedge fund of the year by marhedge and absolute return alpha however clariums faltered in 2006 with a 78 loss during this time the firm sought to profit in the longterm from its petrodollar analysis which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies and the unsustainable bubble growing in the us housing market clariums assets under management indeed after achieving a 403 return in 2007 grew to over 7 billion by 2008 but plummeted as financial markets collapsed near the start of 2009 by 2011 after missing out on the economic rebound many key investors pulled out causing clariums assets to be valued at 350 million over half of which was thiels own money30 palantir further information palantir technologies in may 2003 thiel incorporated palantir technologies a big data analysis company named after the tolkien artifact and continues to serves as its chairman as of 2016 thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that the approaches that paypal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts like fighting terrorism he also stated that after the september 11 attacks the debate in the united states was will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy and saw palantir as being able to provide data mining services to government intelligence agencies which were maximally unintrusive and traceable3132 at first palantirs only backers were the central intelligence agencys venture capital arm inqtel but the company

cofounder sean parker who at the time had assumed the title of president of facebook was seeking investors for facebook parker approached reid hoffman the ceo of workbased social network linkedin

their paypal days thiel met parker and mark zuckerberg the harvard student who had founded facebook thiel and zuckerberg got along well and thiel agreed to lead facebooks seed round with 500000 for 102 of the company the investment was originally in the form of a convertible note to be converted to equity if facebook reached 15 million users by the end of 2004 although facebook narrowly missed the target thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway38 thiel said of his investment i was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision and it was a very reasonable valuation i thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment38 in september 2010 thiel while expressing skepticism about the potential for growth in the consumer internet sector argued that relative to other internet companies facebook which then had a secondary market valuation of 30 billion was comparatively undervalued39 facebooks initial public offering was in may 2012 with a market cap of nearly 100

thiel for many young people college is the path to take when they have no idea what to do with their lives i feel i was personally very guilty of this you don’t know what to do with your life so you get a college degree you don’t know what you’re going to do with your college degree so you get a graduate degree in my case it was law school which is the classic thing one does when one has no idea what else to do i don’t have any big regrets but if i had to do it over i would try to think more about the future than i did at the time you cannot get out of student debt even if you personally go
