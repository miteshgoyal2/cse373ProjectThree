california for the united states on july 7 1846 during the mexican–american war and captain john b montgomery arrived to claim yerba buena two days later yerba buena was renamed san francisco on january 30 of the next year and mexico officially ceded the territory to the united states at the end of the war despite its attractive location as a port and naval base san francisco was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography32 francis samuel marryat hilltop of san francisco california looking toward the bay 1849 m n hanhart chromolithograph port of san francisco in 1851 the california gold rush brought a flood of treasure seekers known as fortyniners as in 1849 with their sourdough bread in tow33 prospectors accumulated in san francisco over rival benicia34 raising the population from 1000 in 1848 to 25000 by december 184935 the promise of fabulous riches was so strong that crews on arriving vessels deserted and rushed off to the gold fields leaving behind a forest of masts in san francisco harbor36 some of these approximately 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships saloons and hotels many were left to rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot by 1851 the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships by 1870 yerba buena cove had been filled to create new land buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings37 california was quickly granted statehood in 1850 and the us military built fort point at the golden gate and a fort on alcatraz island to secure the san francisco bay silver discoveries including the comstock lode in nevada in 1859 further drove rapid population growth38 with hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city lawlessness was common and the barbary coast section of town gained notoriety as a haven for criminals prostitution and gambling39 entrepreneurs sought to capitalize on the wealth generated by the gold rush early winners were the banking industry with the founding of wells fargo in 1852 and the bank of california in 1864 development of the port of san francisco and the establishment in 1869 of overland access to the eastern us rail system via the newly completed pacific railroad the construction of which the city only reluctantly helped support40 helped make the bay area a center for trade catering to the needs and tastes of the growing population levi strauss opened a dry goods business and domingo ghirardelli began manufacturing chocolate immigrant laborers made the city a polyglot culture with chinese railroad workers drawn to old gold mountain creating the citys chinatown quarter in 1870 asians made up 8 of the population41 the first cable cars carried san franciscans up clay street in 1873 the citys sea of victorian houses began to take shape and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park resulting in plans for golden gate park san franciscans built schools churches theaters and all the hallmarks of civic life the presidio developed into the most important american military installation on the pacific coast42 by 1890 san franciscos population approached 300000 making it the eighthlargest city in the united states at the time around 1901 san francisco was a major city known for its flamboyant style stately hotels ostentatious mansions on nob hill and a thriving arts scene43 the first north american plague epidemic was the san francisco plague of 1900–190444 at 512 am on april 18 1906 a major earthquake struck san francisco and northern california as buildings collapsed from the shaking ruptured gas lines ignited fires that spread across the city and burned out of control for several days with water mains out of service the presidio artillery corps attempted to contain the inferno by dynamiting blocks of buildings to create firebreaks45 more than threequarters of the city lay in ruins including almost all of the downtown core21 contemporary accounts reported that 498 people lost their lives though modern estimates put the number in the several thousands46 more than half of the citys population of 400000 was left homeless47 refugees settled temporarily in makeshift tent villages in golden gate park the presidio on the beaches and elsewhere many fled permanently to the east bay not in history has a modern imperial city been so completely destroyed san francisco is gone –jack london after the 1906 earthquake and fire48 the palace of fine arts at the 1915 panamapacific exposition rebuilding was rapid and performed on a grand scale rejecting calls to completely remake the street grid san franciscans opted for speed49 amadeo gianninis bank of italy later to become bank of america provided loans for many of those whose livelihoods had been devastated the influential san francisco planning and urban research association or spur was founded in 1910 to address the quality of housing after the earthquake50 the earthquake hastened development of western neighborhoods that survived the fire including pacific heights where many of the citys wealthy rebuilt their homes51 in turn the destroyed mansions of nob hill became grand hotels city hall rose again in splendid beaux arts style and the city celebrated its rebirth at the panamapacific international exposition in 191552 it was during this period san francisco built some of its most important infrastructure civil engineer michael oshaughnessy was hired by san francisco mayor james rolph as chief engineer for the city in september 1912 to supervise the construction of the twin peaks reservoir the stockton street tunnel the twin peaks tunnel the san francisco municipal railway the auxiliary water supply system and new sewers san franciscos streetcar system of which the j k l m and n lines survive today was pushed to completion by oshaughnessy between 1915 and 1927 it was the oshaughnessy dam hetch hetchy reservoir and hetch hetchy aqueduct that would have the largest effect on san francisco53 an abundant water supply enabled san francisco to develop into the city it has become today the bay bridge under construction in 1935 took forty months to complete in ensuing years the city solidified its standing as a financial capital in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash not a single san franciscobased bank failed54 indeed it was at the height of the great depression that san francisco undertook two great civil engineering projects simultaneously constructing the san francisco–oakland bay bridge and the golden gate bridge completing them in 1936 and 1937 respectively it was in this period that the island of alcatraz a former military stockade began its service as a federal maximum security prison housing notorious inmates such as al capone and robert franklin stroud the birdman of alcatraz san francisco later celebrated its regained grandeur with a worlds fair the golden gate international exposition in 1939–40 creating treasure island in the middle of the bay to house it the uss san francisco steams under the golden gate bridge in 1942 during world war ii during world war ii the hunters point naval shipyard became a hub of activity and fort mason became the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the pacific theater of operations22 the explosion of jobs drew many people especially african americans from the south to the area after the end of the war many military personnel returning from service abroad and civilians who had originally come to work decided to stay the united nations charter creating the united nations was drafted and signed in san francisco in 1945 and in 1951 the treaty of san francisco officially ended the war with japan urban planning projects in the 1950s and 1960s involved widespread destruction and redevelopment of westside neighborhoods and the construction of new freeways of which only a series of short segments were built before being halted by citizenled opposition55 the onset of containerization made san franciscos small piers obsolete and cargo activity moved to the larger port of oakland56 the city began to lose industrial jobs and turned to tourism as the most important segment of its economy57 the suburbs experienced rapid growth and san francisco underwent significant demographic change as large segments of the white population left the city supplanted by an increasing wave of immigration from asia and latin america5859 from 1950 to 1980 the city lost over 10 percent of its population over this period san francisco became a magnet for americas counterculture beat generation writers fueled the san francisco renaissance and centered on the north beach neighborhood in the 1950s60 hippies flocked to haightashbury in the 1960s reaching a peak with the 1967 summer of love61 in 1974 the zebra murders left at least 16 people dead62 in the 1970s the city became a center of the gay rights movement with the emergence of the castro as an urban gay village the election of harvey milk to the board of supervisors and his assassination along with that of mayor george moscone in 197863 bank of america completed 555 california street in 1969 and the transamerica pyramid was completed in 197264 igniting a wave of manhattanization that lasted until the late 1980s a period of extensive highrise development downtown65 the 1980s also saw a dramatic increase in the number of homeless people in the city an issue that remains today despite many attempts to address it66 the 1989 loma prieta earthquake caused destruction and loss of life throughout the bay area in san francisco the quake severely damaged structures in the marina and south of market districts and precipitated the demolition of the damaged embarcadero freeway and much of the damaged central freeway allowing the city to reclaim the embarcadero as its historic downtown waterfront and revitalizing the hayes valley neighborhood two recent decades have seen two booms driven by the internet industry first was the dotcom boom of the late 1990s startup companies invigorated the san francisco economy large numbers of entrepreneurs and computer application developers moved into the city followed by marketing design and sales professionals changing the social landscape as oncepoorer neighborhoods became increasingly gentrified67 demand for new housing and office space ignited a second wave of highrise development this time in the south of market district68 by 2000 the citys population reached new highs surpassing the previous record set in 1950 when the bubble burst in 2001 many of these companies folded and their employees were laid off yet high technology and entrepreneurship remain mainstays of the san francisco economy by the mid2000s decade the social media boom had begun with san francisco becoming a popular location for tech offices and a popular place to live for people employed in silicon valley companies such as apple and google69 the ferry station post office building armour co building atherton house and ymca hotel are historic buildings among dozens of historical landmarks in the

this area is sutro tower a large red and white radio and television transmission tower the nearby san andreas and hayward faults are responsible for much earthquake activity although neither physically passes through the city itself the san andreas fault caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989 minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis the threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the citys infrastructure development the city constructed an auxiliary water supply system and has repeatedly upgraded its building codes requiring retrofits for older buildings and higher engineering standards for new construction72 however there are still thousands of smaller buildings that remain vulnerable to quake damage73 usgs has released the california earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in california74 san franciscos shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits entire neighborhoods such as the marina mission bay and hunters point as well as large sections of the embarcadero sit on areas of landfill treasure island was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from tunneling through yerba buena island during the construction of the bay bridge such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes the resulting soil liquefaction causes extensive damage to property built upon it as was evidenced in the marina district during the 1989 loma prieta earthquake75 most of the citys natural watercourses such as islais creek and mission creek have been culverted and built over although the public utilities commission is studying proposals to daylight or restore some creeks76 cityscapeedit main article list of landmarks and historic places in san francisco downtown san francisco seen from twin peaks in

franciscos weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the pacific ocean on the west side of the city and the water of san francisco bay to the north and east this moderates temperature swings and produces a remarkably mild yearround climate with little seasonal temperature variation fog is a regular feature of san francisco summers among major us cities san francisco has the coolest daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures for june july and august89 during the summer rising hot air in californias interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the north pacific high through the golden gate which creates the citys characteristic cool winds and fog90 the fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods and during the late summer and early fall as a result the years warmest month on average is september and on average october is warmer than july especially in daytime because of its sharp topography and maritime influences san francisco exhibits a multitude of distinct microclimates the high hills in the geographic center of the city are responsible for a 20 variance in annual rainfall between different parts of the city they also protect
