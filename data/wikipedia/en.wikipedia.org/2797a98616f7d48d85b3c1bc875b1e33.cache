progress administration wpa renamed in 1939 as the work projects administration was the largest and most ambitious american new deal agency employing millions of people mostly unskilled men to carry out public works projects1 including the construction of public buildings and roads in a much smaller project federal project number one the wpa employed musicians artists writers actors and directors in large arts drama media and literacy projects1 almost every community in the united states had a new park bridge or school constructed by the agency the wpas initial appropriation in 1935 was for 49 billion about 67 percent of the 1935 gdp2 headed by harry hopkins the wpa provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the great depression in the united states at its peak in 1938 it provided paid jobs for three million unemployed men and women as well as youth in a separate division the national youth administration between 1935 and 1943 when the agency was disbanded the wpa employed 85 million people3 most people who needed a job were eligible for employment in some capacity4 hourly wages were typically set to the prevailing wages in each area570 full employment which was reached in 1942 and emerged as a longterm national goal around 1944 was not the goal of the wpa rather it tried to provide one paid job for all families in which the breadwinner suffered longterm unemployment664 184 the stated goal of public building programs was to end the depression or at least alleviate its worst effects sociologist robert d leighninger asserted millions of people needed subsistence incomes work relief was preferred over public assistance the dole because it maintained selfrespect reinforced the work ethic and kept skills sharp7228 the wpa was a national program that operated its own projects in cooperation with state and local governments which provided 10–30 of the costs usually the local sponsor provided land and often trucks and supplies with the wpa responsible for wages and for the salaries of supervisors who were not on relief wpa sometimes took over state and local relief programs that had originated in the reconstruction finance corporation rfc or federal emergency relief administration programs663 it was liquidated on june 30 1943 as a result of low unemployment due to the worker shortage of world war ii the wpa had provided millions of americans with jobs for eight years671 contents 1 establishment 2 employment 3 projects 31 federal project number one 311 federal art project 312 federal music project 313 federal theatre project 314 federal writers

establishmentedit fdr prepares to speak about the establishment of the work relief program and social security at his fireside chat of april 28 1935 fera administrator and wpa head harry hopkins speaking to reporters november 1935 a joint resolution introduced january 21 19358 the emergency relief appropriation act of 1935 was passed by the united states congress and signed into law by president franklin d roosevelt on april 8 19359 on may 6 1935 fdr issued executive order 7034 establishing the works progress administration1011 the wpa superseded the work of the federal emergency relief administration which was dissolved direct relief assistance was permanently replaced by a national work relief program—a major public works program directed by the wpa12 the wpa was largely shaped by harry hopkins supervisor of the federal emergency relief administration and close adviser to roosevelt both roosevelt and hopkins believed that the route to economic recovery and the lessened importance of the dole would be in employment programs such as the wpa656–57 hallie flanagan national director of the federal theatre project wrote that for the first time in the relief experiments of this country the preservation of the skill of the worker and hence the preservation of his selfrespect became important1317 the wpa was organized into the following divisions the division of engineering and construction which planned and supervised construction projects including airports dams highways and sanitation systems14 the division of professional and service projects called the division of womens and professional projects in 1937 which was responsible for whitecollar projects including education programs recreation programs and the arts projects it was later named the division of community service programs and the service division15 the division of finance16 the division of information17 the division of investigation which succeeded a comparable division at fera and investigated fraud misappropriation of funds and disloyalty18 the division of statistics also known as the division of social research19 the project control division which processed project applications20 other divisions including the employment management safety supply and training and reemployment21 employmentedit wpa road development project these ordinary men and women proved to be extraordinary beyond all expectation they were golden threads woven in the national fabric in this they shamed the political philosophy that discounted their value and rewarded the one that placed its faith in them thus fulfilling the founding vision of a government by and for its people all its people — nick taylor americanmade the enduring legacy of the wpa22530 the goal of the wpa was to employ most of the unemployed people on relief until the economy recovered harry hopkins testified to congress in january 1935 why he set the number at 35 million using federal emergency relief administration data estimating costs at 1200 per worker per year 21 thousand in presentday terms23 he asked for and received 4 billion 699 billion in presentday terms23 many women were employed but they were few compared to men in 1935 there were 20 million people on relief in the united states of these 83 million were children under 16 years of age 38 million were persons between the ages of 16 and 65 who were not working or seeking work these included housewives students in school and incapacitated persons another 750000 were person age 65 or over24562 thus of the total of 20 million persons then receiving relief 13 million were not considered eligible for employment this left a total of 7 million presumably employable persons between the ages of 16 and 65 inclusive of these however 165 million were said to be farm operators or persons who had some nonrelief employment while another 350000 were despite the fact that they were already employed or seeking work considered incapacitated deducting this 2 million from the total of 715 million there remained 515 million persons age 16 to 65 unemployed looking for work and able to work24562 fdr and hopkins september 1938 because of the assumption that only one worker per family would be permitted to work under the proposed program this total of 515 million was further reduced by 16 million—the estimated number of workers who were members of families with two or more employable people thus there remained a net total of 355 million workers in as many households for whom jobs were to be provided24562 the wpa reached its peak employment of 3334594 people in november 193822547 to be eligible for wpa employment an individual had to be an american citizen 18 or older ablebodied unemployed and certified as in need by a local public relief agency approved by the wpa the wpa division of employment selected the workers placement to wpa projects based on previous experience or training worker pay was based on three factors the region of the country the degree of urbanization and the individuals skill it varied from 19 per month to 94 per month with the average wage being about 5250—89300 in presentday terms2325 the goal was to pay the local prevailing wage but limit the hours of work to 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week the stated minimum being 30 hours a week or 120 hours a month24213 projectsedit typical plaque on a wpa project griffith observatory timberline lodge wpa projects were administered by the division of engineering and construction and the division of professional and service projects most projects were initiated planned and sponsored by states counties or cities nationwide projects were sponsored until 193926 the wpa built traditional infrastructure of the new deal such as roads bridges schools courthouses hospitals sidewalks waterworks and postoffices but also constructed museums swimming pools parks community centers playgrounds coliseums markets fairgrounds tennis courts zoos botanical gardens auditoriums waterfronts city halls gyms and university unions most of these are still in use today7226 the amount of infrastructure projects of the wpa included 40000 new and 85000 improved buildings these new buildings included 5900 new schools 9300 new auditoriums gyms and recreational buildings 1000 new libraries 7000 new dormitories and 900 new armories in addition infrastructure projects included 2302 stadiums grandstands and bleachers 52 fairgrounds and rodeo grounds 1686 parks covering 75152 acres 3185 playgrounds 3026 athletic fields 805 swimming pools 1817 handball courts 10070 tennis courts 2261 horseshoe pits 1101 iceskating areas 138 outdoor theatres 254 golf courses and 65 ski jumps7227 total expenditures on wpa projects through june 1941 totaled approximately 114 billion—the equivalent of 186 billion today23 over 4 billion was spent on highway road and street projects more than 1 billion on public buildings including the iconic dock street theatre in charleston the griffith observatory in los angeles and timberline lodge in oregons mount hood national forest27252–253 more than 1 billion—163 billion today23—was spent on publicly owned or operated utilities and another 1 billion on welfare projects including sewing projects for women the distribution of surplus commodities and school lunch projects24129 one construction project was the merritt parkway in connecticut the bridges of which were each designed as architecturally unique28 in its eightyear run the wpa built 325 firehouses and renovated 2384 of them across the united states the 20000 miles of water mains installed by their hand as well contributed to increased fire protection across the country669 the direct focus of the wpa projects changed with need in 1935 priority projects were to improve infrastructure roads extension of electricity to rural areas water conservation sanitation and flood control in 1936 as outlined in that year’s emergency relief appropriations act public facilities became a focus parks and associated facilities public buildings utilities airports and transportation projects were funded the following year saw the introduction of agricultural improvements such as the production of marl fertilizer and the eradication of fungus pests as the second world war approached and then eventually began wpa projects became increasingly defense related670 one project of the wpa was funding statelevel library service demonstration projects to create new areas of library service to underserved populations and to extend rural service29 another project was the household service demonstration project which trained 30000 women for domestic employment south carolina had one of the larger statewide library service demonstration projects at the end of the project in 1943 south carolina had twelve publicly funded county libraries one regional library and a funded state library agency30 federal project number oneedit a significant aspect of the works progress administration was the federal project number one which had five different parts the federal art project the federal music project the federal theatre project the federal writers project and the historical records survey the government wanted to provide new federal cultural support instead of just providing direct grants to private institutions after only one year over 40000 artists and other talented workers had been employed through this project in the united states31 cedric larson stated that the impact made by the five major cultural projects of the wpa upon the national consciousness is probably greater in toto than anyone readily realizes as channels of communication between the administration and the country at large both directly and indirectly the importance of these projects cannot be overestimated for they all carry a tremendous appeal to the eye the ear or the intellect—or all three32491 federal art projectedit main article federal art project this project was directed by holger cahill and in 1936 the peak for employment in this federal project the federal art project employed over 5300 artists the arts service division created illustrations and posters for the wpa writers musicians and theaters the exhibition division had public exhibitions of artwork from the wpa and artists from the art teaching division were employed in settlement houses and community centers to give classes to an estimated 50000 children and adults they set up over 100 art centers around the country that served an estimated eight million individuals31 federal music projectedit noonhour wpa band concert in lafayette square new orleans 1940 main article federal music project directed by nikolai sokoloff former principal conductor of the cleveland orchestra the federal music project employed over 16000 musicians at its peak its purpose was to establish different ensembles such as chamber groups orchestras choral units opera units concert bands military bands dance bands and theater orchestras that gave an estimated 131000 performances and programs to 92 million people each week31 the federal music project performed plays and dances as well as radio dramas32494 in addition the federal music project gave music classes to an estimated 132000 children and adults every week recorded folk music served as copyists arrangers and librarians to expand the availability of music and experimented in music therapy31 sokoloff stated music can serve no useful purpose unless it is heard but these totals on the listeners side are more eloquent than statistics as they show that in this country there is a great hunger and eagerness for music32494 federal theatre projectedit main article federal theatre project this project was directed by iowan hallie flanagan and employed 12700 performers at its peak these performers presented more than 1000 performances each month to almost one million people produced 1200 plays in the four years it was established and introduced 100 new playwrights many performers later became successful in hollywood including orson welles john houseman burt lancaster joseph cotten canada lee will geer joseph losey virgil thompson nicholas ray eg marshall and sidney lumet the federal theatre project was the first project to end in june 1939 after four years from an end of funding from the federal government31 federal writers projectedit main article federal writers project this project was directed by henry alsberg and employed 6686 writers at its peak in 193631 by january 1939 more than 275 major books and booklets had been published by the fwp32494 most famously the fwp created the american guide series which produced thorough guidebooks for every state that include descriptions of towns waterways historic sites oral histories photographs and artwork31 an association or group that put up the cost of publication sponsored each book the cost was anywhere from 5000 to 10000 in almost all cases the book sales were able to reimburse their sponsors32494 additionally another important part of this project was to record oral histories to create archives such as the slave narratives and collections of folklore these writers also participated in research and editorial services to other government agencies31 historical records surveyedit main article historical records survey this project was the smallest of federal project number one and served to identify collect and conserve united states’ historical records31 it is one of the biggest bibliographical efforts and was directed by dr luther h evans at its peak this project employed more than 4400 workers32494 1940 wpa poster using little miss muffet to promote reading among children wpa health

federal emergency relief administration and wpa benefits for african americans exceeded their proportion of the general population the feras first relief census reported that more than two million african americans were on relief during early 1933 a proportion of the africanamerican population 178 that was nearly double the proportion of whites on relief 9533 this was during the period of jim crow and racial segregation in the south when blacks were largely disenfranchised by 1935 there were 3500000 african americans men women and children on relief almost 35 percent of the africanamerican population plus another 250000 africanamerican adults were working on wpa projects altogether during 1938 about 45 percent of the nations africanamerican families were either on relief or were employed by the wpa33 civil rights leaders initially objected that african americans were proportionally underrepresented african american leaders made such a claim with respect to wpa hires in new jersey stating in spite of the fact that blacks indubitably constitute more than 20 percent of the states unemployed they composed 159 of those assigned to wpa jobs during 193724287 nationwide in 1940 98 of the population were african american however by 1941 the perception of discrimination against african americans had changed to the point that the naacp magazine opportunity hailed the wpa it is to the eternal credit of the administrative officers of the wpa that discrimination on various projects because of race has been kept to a minimum and that in almost every community negroes have been given a chance to participate in the work program in the south as might have been expected this participation has been limited and differential wages on the basis of race have been more or less effectively established but in the northern communities particularly in the urban centers the negro has been afforded his first real opportunity for employment in whitecollar occupations24295 the wpa mostly operated segregated units as did its youth affiliate the national youth administration34 blacks were hired by the wpa as supervisors in the north however of 10000 wpa supervisors in the south only 11 were black35 historian anthony badger argues new deal programs in the south routinely discriminated against blacks and perpetuated segregation36 womenedit hispanic women in costilla new mexico weaving rag rugs in 1939 about 15 of the household heads on relief were women and youth programs were operated separately by the national youth administration the average worker was about 40 years old about the same as the average family head on relief wpa policies were consistent with the strong belief of the time that husbands and wives should not both be working because the second person working would take one job away from some other breadwinner a study of 2000 female workers in philadelphia showed that 90 were married but wives were reported as living with their husbands in only 18 percent of the cases only 2 percent of the husbands had private employment of the 2000 women all were responsible for one to five additional people in the household24283 in rural missouri 60 of the wpaemployed women were without husbands 12 were single 25 widowed and 23 divorced separated or deserted thus only 40 were married and living with their husbands but 59 of the husbands were permanently disabled 17 were temporarily disabled 13 were too old to work and remaining 10 were either unemployed or handicapped most of the women worked with sewing projects where they were taught to use sewing machines and made clothing and bedding as well as supplies for hospitals orphanages and adoption centers2428337 one wpafunded project the pack horse library project mainly employed women to deliver books to rural areas in eastern kentucky38 many of the women employed by the project were the sole breadwinners for their families39 criticismedit poster representing the wpa defending itself from attacks the wpa had numerous critics especially from conservatives the strongest attacks were that it was the prelude for a national political machine on behalf of roosevelt reformers secured the hatch act of 1939 that largely depoliticized the wpa40 others complained that far left elements played a major role especially in the new york city unit representative j parnell thomas of the house committee on unamerican activities claimed in 1938 that divisions of the wpa were a hotbed of communists and one more link in the vast and unparalleled new deal propaganda network41 much of the criticism of the distribution of projects and funding allotment is a result of the view that the decisions were politically motivated the south as the poorest region of the united states received 75 percent less in federal relief and public works funds per capita than the west critics would point to the fact that roosevelt’s democrats could be sure of voting support from the south whereas the west was less of a sure thing swing states took priority over the other states570 there was a perception that wpa employees were not diligent workers and that they had little incentive to give up their busy work in favor of productive jobs some employers said that the wpa instilled poor work habits and encouraged inefficiency42 some job applicants found that a wpa work history was viewed negatively by employers who said they had formed poor work habits43 a senate committee reported that to some extent the complaint that wpa workers do poor work is not without foundation … poor work habits and incorrect techniques are not remedied occasionally a supervisor or a foreman demands good work44 the wpa and its workers were ridiculed as being lazy the organizations initials were said to stand for we poke along or we putter along or we piddle around or whistle piss and argue these were sarcastic references to wpa projects that sometimes slowed down deliberately because foremen had an incentive to keep going rather than finish a project45 the wpas division of investigation proved so effective in preventing political corruption that a later congressional investigation couldnt find a single serious irregularity it had overlooked wrote economist paul krugman this dedication to honest government wasnt a sign of roosevelts personal virtue rather it reflected a political imperative fdrs mission in office was to show that government activism works to maintain that missions credibility he needed to keep his administrations record clean and he did46 evolutionedit francis c harrington wpa national administrator 1938–40 on december 23 1938 after leading the wpa for 35 years harry hopkins resigned and became the secretary of commerce to succeed him roosevelt appointed francis c harrington a colonel in the army corps of engineers and the wpas chief engineer who had been leading the division of engineering and construction22417–420 following the passage of the reorganization act of 1939 in april 1939 the wpa was grouped with the bureau of public roads public buildings branch of the procurement division branch of buildings management of the national park service united states housing authority and the public works administration under the newly created federal works agency created at the same time the federal security agency assumed the wpas responsibility for the national youth administration the name of the works progress administration has been changed to work projects administration in order to make its title more descriptive of its major purpose president roosevelt wrote when announcing the reorganization47 as wpa projects became more subject to the state local sponsors were called on to provide 25 of project costs as the number of public works projects slowly diminished more projects were dedicated to preparing for war7227 having languished since the end of world war i the american military services were depopulated and served by crumbling facilities when germany occupied czechoslovakia in 1938 the us army numbered only 176000 soldiers22494 wpa researchers and map makers prepare the air raid warning map for new orleans within days of the attack on pearl harbor december 11 1941 on may 26 1940 fdr delivered a fireside chat to the american people about the approaching storm48 and on june 6 harrington reprioritized wpa projects anticipating a major expansion of the us military types of wpa work to be expedited in every possible way to include in addition to airports and military airfields construction of housing and other facilities for enlarged military garrisons camp and cantonment construction and various improvements in navy yards harrington said he observed that the wpa had already made substantial contributions to national defense over its five years of existence by building 85 percent of the new airports in the us and making 420 million in improvements to military facilities he predicted there would be 500000 wpa workers on defenserelated projects over the next 12 months at a cost of 250 million22492–493 the estimated number of wpa workers needed for defense projects was soon revised to between 600000 and 700000 vocational training for war industries was also begun by the wpa with 50000 trainees in the program by october 194022494 only the wpa having employed millions of relief workers for more than five years had a comprehensive awareness of the skills that would be available in a fullscale national emergency wrote journalist nick taylor as the country began its preparedness buildup the wpa was uniquely positioned to become a major defense agency22494–495 harrington died suddenly aged 53 on september 30 1940 notably apolitical—he boasted that he had never voted49—he had deflected congressional criticism of the wpa by bringing attention to its building accomplishments and its role as an employer22504 harringtons successor howard o hunter served as head of the wpa until may 1 194222517 terminationedit unemployment ended with war production for world war ii as millions of men joined the services and costplus contracts made it attractive for companies to hire unemployed men and train them22page needed31 concluding that a national relief program was no longer needed roosevelt directed the federal works administrator to end the wpa in a letter december 4 1942 seven years ago i was convinced that providing useful work is superior to any and every kind of dole experience had amply justified this policy fdr wrote by building airports schools highways and parks by making huge quantities of clothing for the unfortunate by serving millions of lunches to school children by almost immeasurable kinds and quantities of service the work projects administration has reached a creative hand into every county in this nation it has added to the national wealth has repaired the wastage of depression and has strengthened the country to bear the burden of war by employing eight millions of americans with thirty millions of dependents it has brought to these people renewed hope and courage it has maintained and increased their working skills and it has enabled them once more to take their rightful places in public or in private employment50 roosevelt ordered a prompt end to wpa activities to conserve funds that had been appropriated operations in most states ended february 1 1943 with no funds budgeted for the next fiscal year the wpa ceased to exist after june 30 194350 legacyedit the agencies of the franklin d roosevelt administration had an enormous and largely unrecognized role in defining the public space we now use wrote sociologist robert d leighninger in a short period of ten years the public works administration the works progress administration and the civilian conservation corps built facilities in practically every community in the country most are still providing service half a century later it is time we recognized this legacy and attempted to comprehend its relationship to our contemporary situation7226 alabama national guard armory guntersville alabama 1936 prairie county
