1955 with a major in theater arts there he was awarded a scholarship in playwriting this furthered his interest in directing theater despite the disapproval of his father who wanted him to study engineering16 coppola was profoundly impressed after seeing sergei eisensteins october ten days that shook the world especially with the movies quality of editing it was at this time coppola decided he would go into cinema rather than theater16 coppola says he was tremendously influenced to become a writer early on by his brother august14 in whose footsteps he would also follow by attending both of his brothers alma maters hofstra and ucla coppola also gives credit to the work of elia kazan and for its influence on him as a director14 amongst coppolas classmates at hofstra were james caan

tonight for sure brought him back to recut a german film titled mit eva fing die sünde an directed by fritz umgelter he added some new 3d color footage and earned a writers and directors credit for the bellboy and the playgirls also a boxoffice failure coppola was hired as an assistant by roger corman and his first job for corman was to dub and reedit a russian science fiction film nebo zovyot which he turned into a sexandviolence monster movie entitled battle beyond the sun released in 19621521 impressed by coppolas perseverance and dedication corman hired him as dialogue director on tower of london 1962 sound man for the young racers 1963 and associate producer of the terror 196318 while on location in ireland for the young racers in 1963 corman ever alert for an opportunity to produce a decent movie on a shoestring budget persuaded coppola to make a lowbudget horror movie with funds left over from the movie18 coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night incorporating elements from hitchcocks psycho22 and the result impressed corman enough to give him the goahead on a budget of 40000 20000 from corman and 20000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movies english rights22 coppola directed in a period of nine days dementia 13 his first feature from his own screenplay the film recouped its expenses and later became a cult film among horror buffs it was on the sets of dementia 13 that he met his future wife eleanor jessie neil in 1965 coppola won the annual samuel goldwyn award for the best screenplay pilma pilma written by a ucla student12 this secured him a job as a scriptwriter with seven arts in between he cowrote the scripts for this property is condemned 1966 and is paris burning 1966 however with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation coppola bought the rights to the david benedictus novel youre a big boy now and fused it with a story idea of his own resulting in youre a big boy now 1966 this was his ucla thesis project that also received a theatrical release via warner bros15 this movie brought him some critical acclaim and eventually his master of fine arts degree from ucla school of theater film and television in 19671823 following the success of youre a big boy now coppola was offered the reins of the movie version of the broadway musical finians rainbow starring petula clark in her first american film and veteran fred astaire producer jack l warner was nonplussed by coppolas shaggyhaired bearded hippie appearance and generally left him to his own devices he took his cast to the napa valley for much of the outdoor shooting but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a hollywood soundstage resulting in a disjointed look to the film dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide coppolas result was only semisuccessful but his work with clark no doubtaccording to whom contributed to her golden globe best actress nomination the film introduced to him george lucas who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film the rain people in 1969 it was written directed and initially produced by coppola himself though as the movie advanced he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie15 the film won the golden shell at the 1969 san sebastian film festival in 1969 coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance offbeat projects and give firsttime directors their chance to direct he decided he would name his future studio zoetrope after receiving a gift of zoetropes from mogens scothansen founder of a studio called lanterna film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picturemaking equipment while touring europe coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of lanterna film he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative unconventional approaches to filmmaking upon his return home coppola and george lucas searched for a mansion in marin county to house the studio however in 1969 with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet the first home for zoetrope studio became a warehouse in san francisco on folsom street24 the studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking including some of the earliest uses of hdtv in his book the american cinema andrew sarris wrote coppola is probably the first reasonably talented and sensibly adaptable directorial talent to emerge from a university curriculum in filmmaking he may be heard from more decisively in the future25 1970sedit coppola in 1976 coppola epitomized a group of filmmakers known as the new hollywood that emerged in the early 1970s with ideas that challenged conventional filmmaking the group included steven spielberg martin scorsese brian de palma terrence malick robert altman woody allen william friedkin philip kaufman and george lucas1526 patton 1970edit main article patton film coppola cowrote the script for patton in 1970 along with edmund h north this earned him his first academy award for best original screenplay however it was not easy for coppola to convince franklin j schaffner that the opening scene would work coppola later revealed in an interview27 i wrote the script of patton and the script was very controversial when i wrote it because they thought it was so stylized it was supposed to be like sort of you know the longest day and my script of patton was—i was sort of interested in the reincarnation and i had this very bizarre opening where he stands up in front of an american flag and gives this speech ultimately i wasnt fired but i was fired meaning that when the script was done they said okay thank you very much and they went and hired another writer and that script was forgotten and i remember very vividly this long kind of being raked over the coals for this opening scene when the title role was offered to george c scott he remembered having read coppolas screenplay earlier he stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used coppolas script scott is the one who resurrected my version says coppola28 the movie opens with scotts rendering of pattons famous military pep talk to members of the third army set against a huge american flag coppola and north had to tone down pattons actual language to avoid an r rating in the opening monologue the word fornicating replaced fucking when criticizing the saturday evening post over the years this opening monologue has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films political cartoons and television shows the godfather 1972edit main article the godfather the release of the godfather in 1972 was a milestone in cinema the near 3hourlong epic which chronicled the saga of the corleone family received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and fetched coppola the academy award for best adapted screenplay which he shared with mario puzo and two golden globe awards for best director and best screenplay however coppola faced several difficulties while filming the godfather he was not paramounts first choice to direct the movie italian director sergio leone was initially offered the job but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus once upon a time in america29 peter bogdanovich was then approached but he also declined the offer and made whats up doc instead bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast edward g robinson in the lead had he accepted the film according to robert evans head of paramount pictures at the time coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his sicilian and italian heritage on the other hand evans specifically wanted an italianamerican to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the mafia that were directed by nonitalians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to in his own words smell the spaghetti when coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for american capitalism however he eagerly agreed to take the helm30 there was disagreement between paramount and coppola on the issue of casting coppola stuck to his plan of casting marlon brando as vito corleone though paramount wanted either ernest borgnine or danny thomas at one point coppola was told by the thenpresident of paramount that marlon brando will never appear in this motion picture after pleading with the executives coppola was allowed to cast brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films perform a screentest and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production as he had done on previous film sets31 coppola chose brando over ernest borgnine on the basis of brandos screen test which also won over the paramount leadership brando later won an academy award for his portrayal which he refused to accept coppola would later recollect22 the godfather was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it they were very unhappy with it they didnt like the cast they didnt like the way i was shooting it i was always on the verge of getting fired so it was an extremely nightmarish experience i had two little kids and the third one was born during that we lived in a little apartment and i was basically frightened that they didnt like it they had as much as said that so when it was all over i wasnt at all confident that it was going to be successful and that id ever get another job after it was released the film received widespread praise it went on to win multiple awards including academy award for best adapted screenplay for coppola the film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever it has been selected for preservation in the united states national film registry in addition it was ranked third behind citizen kane and casablanca on the initial afis 100 years…100

ever made and had without question the best cast33 the conversation 1974edit main article the conversation coppolas next film the conversation further cemented his position as one of the most talented auteurs of hollywood34 the movie was partly influenced by michelangelo antonionis blowup 196635 and generated much interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wiretapping equipment that members of the nixon administration used to spy on political opponents prior to the watergate scandal coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental the script for the conversation was completed in the mid1960s before the election of richard nixon the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by newspaper stories about the watergate breakin however the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the watergate scandal and its fallout the movie was a critical success and coppola won his first palme dor at the 1974 cannes film festival the great gatsby 1974edit main article the great gatsby 1974 film during the filming of the conversation coppola wrote the screenplay for the great gatsby

the godfather part ii parallel to the conversation and it was the last major american motion picture to be filmed in technicolor george lucas commented on the film after its fivehourlong preview telling coppola you have two films take one away it doesnt work referring to the movies portrayal of two parallel storylines one of a young vito corleone and the other of his son michael in the directors commentary on the dvd edition of the film released in 2002 coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use part ii in its title paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie the godfather part ii according to coppola the studios objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title as the audience would supposedly believe that having already seen the godfather there was little reason to see an addition to the original story however the success of the godfather part ii began the hollywood tradition of numbered sequels the movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim with many deeming it superior to its predecessor37 it was nominated for 11 academy
