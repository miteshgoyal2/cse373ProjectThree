historical inaccuraciesedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it december 2015 the group is shown making a record of wilbert harrisons kansas city kansas city was never covered by the jackson 5 although the band did multiple covers of early hits in the motown audition scene berry gordy was not actually in attendance instead the audition was videotaped and shown to gordy at a later time2 the jacksons are shown getting an audition for motown due to winning a talent show at the apollo theatre and joseph is touting it as their first signing in actuality the groups first recording contract was offered by steeltown records a smaller agency based in their native gary indiana in 1967 the group had done one audition for motown and was rejected following their moderate success with a couple of single tracks in steeltown the jackson 5 felt confident enough to audition a second time for motown after which they were signed in the film prior to the motown debut michael is seen in a recording studio which may have been reference to their early career with steeltown records in the scene where michael is seen shooting for the pepsi commercial which caused his scalp to catch fire it shows his body rolling down the stairs in fact he actually walked down the stairs with his hair on fire and later realized and did a one rotation spin not the usual spin move he did and shaking his head wildly from the pain the films depiction of michael performing billie jean at the motown 25 television special has jackson wearing his trademark white glove on his right hand in reality michael wore it on his left hand that night the style of the films glove is also notably different compared to the factual one when michael was born it says he was born in 1959 and in real
