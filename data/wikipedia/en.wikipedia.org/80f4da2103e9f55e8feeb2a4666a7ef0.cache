politics portal v t e traditionalist conservatism also known as traditional conservatism classical conservatism traditionalism and toryism in the united kingdom and canada is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of natural law and transcendent moral order tradition hierarchy organic unity classicism high culture and the intersecting spheres of loyalty1 some traditionalists have embraced the labels reactionary and counterrevolutionary defying the stigma attached to these terms since the enlightenment traditionalism developed throughout 18thcentury europe particularly in response to the disorder of the english civil war and the radicalism of the french revolution in the middle of the 20th century it started to organize itself in earnest as an intellectual and political force this more modern expression of traditionalist conservatism began among a group of us university professors labeled the new conservatives by the popular press not to be

key principlesedit natural law and transcendent moral orderedit belief in natural law and transcendent moral order lay the foundation for traditionalist conservative thought reason and divine revelation inform natural law and the universal truths of faith it is through these universal truths of faith that man orders himself and the world around him mankind organized society on the basis of these universal truths of faith the traditionalist holds axiomatic the belief that religion precedes civilization see t s eliots essays christianity and culture most traditionalist conservatives embrace high church christianity eg t s eliot an anglocatholic russell kirk a roman catholic and rod dreher an eastern orthodox christian however not all traditionalists are high church christians other traditionalists whose faith traditions are notable include caleb stegall who is an evangelical protestant many conservative mainline protestants are also traditionalist conservatives including some of the writers for touchstone magazine many traditionalists are jewish such as the late will herberg irving louis horowitz mordecai roshwald and paul gottfried tradition and customedit as the name suggests traditionalists believe that tradition and custom guide man and his worldview each generation inherits the experience and culture of its ancestors and through convention and precedence man is able to pass it down to his descendants to paraphrase edmund burke often regarded as the father of modern conservatism the individual is foolish but the species is wise hierarchy and organic unityedit traditionalist conservatives believe that human society is essentially hierarchical ie it always involves various interdependent inequalities degrees and classes and that political structures that recognize this fact prove the most just thriving and generally beneficial hierarchy allows for the preservation of the whole community simultaneously instead of protecting one part at the expense of the others agrarianismedit the countryside and the values of rural life are highly prized sometimes even being romanticized as in pastoral poetry the principles of agrarianism ie preserving the small family farm open land the conservation of natural resource and stewardship of the land are central to a traditionalists understanding of rural life classicism and high cultureedit traditionalists defend classical western civilization and value an education informed by the texts of the hebraic greek roman and medieval eras similarly traditionalists are classicists who revere high culture in all of its manifestations eg literature music architecture art and theatercitation needed patriotism localism and regionalismedit unlike nationalists who esteem the role of the state or nation over the local or regional community traditionalists hold up patriotism as a key principle traditionalist conservatives think that loyalty to a locality or region is more central than any commitment to a larger political entity traditionalists also welcome the value of subsidiarity and the intimacy of ones community preferring the civil society of burkes little platoons over the expanded state alternately nationalism leads to jingoism and views the state as abstract from the local community and family structure rather than as an outgrowth of these local realities intellectual inheritanceedit british influencesedit late 18th centuryedit edmund burkeedit edmund burke traditionalist conservatism began with the thought of angloirish whig statesman and philosopher edmund burke whose political principles were rooted in moral natural law and the western tradition burke believed in prescriptive rights and that those rights were godgiven he defended what he referred to as ordered liberty best reflected in the unwritten law of the british constitutional monarchy he also advocated for those transcendent values that found support in such institutions as the church the family and the state3 he was a fierce critic of the principles behind the french revolution and in 1790 his observations on its excesses and radicalism were collected in reflections on the revolution in france in reflections burke called for the constitutional enactment of specific concrete rights and warned that abstract rights could be easily abused to justify tyranny american social critic and historian russell kirk wrote the reflections burns with all the wrath and anguish of a prophet who saw the traditions of christendom and the fabric of civil society dissolving before his eyes4 burkes influence extended to later thinkers and writers both in his native britain and in continental europe among those influenced by his thought were the english romantic poets samuel taylor coleridge william wordsworth and robert southey scottish romantic author sir walter scott5 as well as the counterrevolutionaries writers the french françoisrené de chateaubriand and louis de bonald and the savoyard joseph de maistre6 in the united states the federalist party and its leaders such as president john adams and secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton best represented burkes legacy7 19th centuryedit coleridge carlyle newman and the critics of material progressedit burkes traditionalist conservatism found its fiercest defenders in three cultural conservatives and critics of material progress samuel taylor coleridge thomas carlyle and john henry newman according to traditionalist scholar peter viereck coleridge and his associate and fellow poet william wordsworth began as supporters of the french revolution and the radical utopianism it spawned however by 1798 their collection of poems lyrical ballads had rejected the enlightenment thesis of reason over faith and tradition coleridges later writings including lay sermons 1816 biographia literaria 1817 and aids to reflection 1825 justified traditional conservative positions on hierarchy and organic society criticism of materialism and the merchant class the need for inner growth that is rooted in a traditional and religious culture coleridge was a firm believer in social institutions and a harsh critic of jeremy bentham and his utilitarian philosophy8 writer historian and essayist thomas carlyle was also an early traditionalist thinker defending medieval notions such as aristocracy hierarchy organic society and class unity over socialism and the cash nexus of laissezfaire capitalism according to carlyle the cash nexus was when social relationships were merely reduced to economic gain a champion of the poor carlyle believed that the fabric of british society was being threatened by mobs plutocrats socialists and others who wanted to exploit them and perpetuate class resentment a devotee of germanic culture and romanticism carlyle is most known for his writings sartor resartus 1833–1834 and past and present 18439 in the mid19th century the church of england experienced a catholic revival in the form of the oxford movement a religious movement designed to restore the catholic nature of anglicanism led by john keble edward pusey and john henry newman the tractarians so called for the publication of their tracts for the times condemned religious liberalism while defending dogma ritual poetry and tradition like coleridge and carlyle newman who became a roman catholic in 1845 and eventually a cardinal in the church and the tractarians were critical of material progress or the notion that wealth prosperity and economic gain were the sum of human existence10 arnold and ruskin cultural and artistic criticismedit culture and the arts were also important to british traditionalist conservatives and two of the most prominent defenders of tradition in culture and the arts were matthew arnold and john ruskin matthew arnold a poet and cultural critic is best known for his poetry and literary social and religious criticism his book culture and anarchy 1869 took on the middleclass victorian values of the day arnold viewed middle class tastes in literature as philistinism and argued for a return to the classical literature of the past arnold also viewed with skepticism the plutocratic grasping in socioeconomic affairs which coleridge carlyle and the oxford movement criticized11 one of the themes that traditionalist conservatives have consistently reiterated has been the theme that industrial capitalism is as questionable as the classical liberalism which spawned it carrying on in this tradition was cultural and artistic critic john ruskin a medievalist who called himself a christian socialist and cared much for standards in culture the arts and society for ruskin as with all the 19thcentury cultural conservatives the industrial revolution had fomented dislocation rootlessness and the mass urbanization of the poor in his art criticism he wrote the stones of venice 1851–1853 which took on the classical tradition while defending gothic art and architecture his other works included the seven lamps of architecture and unto this last 186012 benjamin disraeli and onenation conservatismedit in politics the ideas of burke coleridge carlyle newman and other traditionalist conservatives were distilled into the policies and philosophy of former british prime minister benjamin disraeli disraeli in his younger years was an opponent of middle class capitalism and the industrial policies that were promoted by the manchester liberals the reform bill and the corn laws seeking a way to alleviate the suffering of the urban poor in the wake of the industrial revolution disraeli sought out to unify the nation by way of one nation conservatism where a coalition of aristocrats and the common working man would unite to stave off the influences of the liberal middle class this new coalition would serve as a way to work with the enfranchised masses while grounding them in ancient conservative traditions disraelis ideas including his criticism of utilitarianism found fruit in the young england movement and in writings such as vindication of the english constitution 1835 the radical tory 1837 and his social novels coningsby 1844 and sybil 184513 a few years later his one nation conservatism found new life in the tory democracy of lord randolph churchill and in the early 21st century in the progressive conservatism of the red tory thesis of british philosopher phillip blond 20th centuryedit the distributistsedit hilaire belloc in 1915 in the early 20th century traditionalist conservatism found its defenders through the efforts of hilaire belloc g k chesterton and other proponents of the socioeconomic system they advocated distributism originating in the papal encyclical rerum novarum distributism employed the concept of subsidiarity as a third way solution to the twin evils of socialism and capitalism it favors local economies small business the agrarian way of life and craftsmen and artists in such books as bellocs the servile state 1912 economics for helen 1924 and an essay on the restoration of property 1936 and chestertons the outline of sanity 1926 traditional communities that echoed those found in the middle ages were advocated and big business and big government condemned in the united states distributist ideas were embraced by the journalist herbert agar catholic activist dorothy day and through the influence of the germanborn british economist e f schumacher and were comparable to the work of wilhelm roepke14 t s eliot was a champion of the western tradition and orthodox christian culture eliot was a political reactionary who used modernist literary means for traditionalist ends his after strange gods 1934 and notes towards the definition of culture 1948 align with the grand tradition of christian humanism extending back to edmund burke samuel taylor coleridge thomas carlyle john ruskin g k chesterton and hilaire belloc educated by irving babbitt and george santayana at harvard university eliot was friends with allen tate and russell kirk15 praised by t s eliot as the most powerful intellectual influence in britain historian christopher dawson is a key figure in 20thcentury traditionalism central to his work was the idea that religion was at the heart of every culture especially western culture and his writings including the age of gods 1928 religion and culture 1948 and religion and the rise of western culture 1950 reflected this view a contributor to eliots criterion dawson believed that after world war ii religion and culture were central to rebuilding the west in the wake of fascism and the rise of communism16 american influencesedit 18th centuryedit in terms of classical conservatism the federalists had no truck with europeanstyle aristocracy monarchy or established religion historian john p diggins has said thanks to the framers american conservatism began on a genuinely lofty plane james madison alexander hamilton john marshall john jay james wilson and above all john adams aspired to create a republic in which the values so precious to conservatives might flourish harmony stability virtue reverence veneration loyalty selfdiscipline and moderation this was classical conservatism in its most authentic expression17 something akin to burkean traditionalism was transported to the american colonies through the policies and principles of the federalist party and its leadership as embodied by john adams and alexander hamilton federalists strongly opposed the french revolution defended traditional christian morality and supported a new natural aristocracy based on property education family status and sense of ethical responsibility18 john adams was one of the earliest defenders of a traditional social order in revolutionary america in his defence of the constitution 1787 adams attacked the ideas of radicals like thomas paine who advocated for a unicameral legislature adams deemed it too democratic his translation of discourses on davila 1790 which also contained his own commentary was an examination of human motivation in politics adams believed that human motivation inevitably led to dangerous impulses where the government would need to sometimes intervene19 the leader of the federalist party was alexander hamilton secretary of the treasury and coauthor of the federalist papers 1787–1788 which was then and to this day remains a major interpretation of the new 1789 constitution hamilton was critical of both jeffersonian classical liberalism and the radical ideas coming out of the french revolution he rejected laissezfaire economics and favored a strong central government20 19th centuryedit in the era after the revolutionary generation the whig party had an approach that resembled burkean conservatism although whigs rarely cited burke whig statesmen led the charge for tradition and custom against the prevailing democratic ethos of the jacksonian era standing for hierarchy and organic society in many ways their concepts of the union paralleled benjamin disraelis one nation conservatism along with henry clay the most noteworthy whig statesman was bostons daniel webster a firm unionist his most famous speech was his second reply to hayne 1829 where he criticized the argument from southerners such as john c calhoun that the states had a right to nullify the constitution and therefore were more important than the federal republic as a whole21 webster rarely mentioned burke but he occasionally followed similar lines of thought22 websters intellectual and political heir was rufus choate who admired burke23 choate was a part of the emerging legal culture in new england centered on the newly formed harvard law school he believed that lawyers were preservers and conservers of the constitution and that it was the duty of the educated to govern political institutions choates most famous address was the position and functions of the american bar as an element of conservatism in the state 184524 two figures in the northern antebellum period were what emory university professor patrick allitt referred to as the guardians of civilization george ticknor and edward everett george ticknor a dartmoutheducated academic at harvard was the chief purveyor of humane learning in the boston area a founder of the boston public library and the scion of an old federalist family ticknor educated his students in romance languages and the works of dante and cervantes at home while promoting america abroad to his many international friends including lord byron and talleyrand25 like ticknor edward everett was educated at the same german university goettigen and advocated for the us to follow same virtues as the ancient greeks and eventually went into politics as a whig a firm unionist like his friend daniel webster everett deplored the jacksonian democracy that swept the nation a famed orator in his own right he supported lincoln against southern secession26 american catholic journalist and political theorist and former political and religious radical orestes brownson is best known for writing the american republic an 1865 treatise examining how america fulfills catholic tradition and western civilization brownson was critical of both the northern abolitionists and the southern secessionists and was himself a solid unionist27 20th centuryedit in the 20th century traditionalist conservatism on both sides of the atlantic centered on two publications the bookman and its successor the american review owned and edited by the eccentric seward collins these journals published the writings of the british distributists the new humanists the southern agrarians t s eliot christopher dawson et al eventually collins drifted towards support of fascism and as a result lost the support of many of his traditionalist backers despite the decline of the journal due to collins increasingly radical political views the american review left a profound mark on the history of traditionalist conservatism28 another intellectual branch of early20thcentury traditionalist conservatism was known as the new humanism led by harvard university professor irving babbitt and princeton university professor paul elmer more the new humanism was a literary and social criticism movement that opposed both romanticism and naturalism beginning in the late 19th century the new humanism defended artistic standards and first principles babbitts phrase reaching an apogee in 1930 babbitt and more published a variety of books including babbitts literature and the american college 1908 rousseau and romanticism 1919 and democracy and leadership 1924 and mores shelburne essays 1904–192129 one other group of traditionalist conservatives were the southern agrarians originally a group of vanderbilt university poets and writers known as the fugitives they included john crowe ransom allen tate donald davidson and robert penn warren adhering to strict literary standards warren and traditionalist scholar cleanth brooks later formulated a form of literary criticism known as the new criticism in 1930 some of the fugitives joined other traditionalist southern writers to publish ill take my stand which applied standards sympathetic to local particularism and the agrarian way of life to politics and economics condemning northern industrialism and commercialism the twelve southerners who contributed to the book echoed earlier arguments made by the distributists a few years after the publication of ill take my stand some of the southern agrarians were joined by hilaire belloc and herbert agar in the publication of a new collection of essays entitled who owns america a new declaration of independence the southern agrarians had a great influence on new conservative scholar richard m weaver and writerfarmer wendell berry30 other influencesedit other traditionalist conservative influences on those who emerged in the 1940s and 1950s as the new conservatives included bernard iddings bell gordon keith chalmers grenville clark peter drucker will herberg and ross j s hoffman31 traditionalism in the united statesedit revival of conservative cultural criticismedit the new conservativesedit after the second world war the first stirrings of a traditionalist movement took place and among those who launched this movement and in effect the larger conservative movement in america was university of chicago professor richard m weaver weavers ideas have consequences 1948 chronicled the steady erosion of western cultural values since the middle ages32 in 1949 another professor peter viereck echoed the writings of weaver with his conservatism revisited which examined the conservative thought of prince klemens metternich after weaver and viereck a flowering of conservative scholarship occurred starting with the publication of 1953s the new science of politics by eric voegelin 1953s the quest for community by robert a nisbet and 1955s conservatism in america by clinton rossiter however the book that defined the traditionalist school was 1953s the conservative mind from burke to eliot written by russell kirk which gave a detailed analysis of the intellectual pedigree of angloamerican traditionalist conservatism33 when these thinkers appeared on the academic scene they became known for rebuking the progressive worldview inherent in an america comfortable with new deal economics a burgeoning militaryindustrial complex and a consumerist and commercialized citizenry these conservative scholars and writers garnered the attention of the popular press of the time and before long they were collectively referred to as the new conservatives among this group were not only weaver viereck voegelin nisbet rossiter and kirk but other lesser known thinkers such as john blum daniel boorstin mcgeorge bundy thomas cook raymond english john hallowell anthony harrigan august heckscher milton hindus klemens von klemperer erik von kuehneltleddihn richard leopold s a lukacs malcolm moos eliseo vivas geoffrey wagner chad walsh and francis wilson34 as well as arthur bestor mel bradford c p ives stanley jaki john lukacs forrest mcdonald thomas molnar gerhard neimeyer james v schall sj peter j stanlis stephen j tonsor and frederick wilhelmsen35 russell kirk the acknowledged leader of the new conservatives was independent scholar writer critic and man of letters russell kirk kirk was a key figure of the conservative movement he was a friend to william f buckley jr a columnist for national review an editor and a syndicated columnist as well as a historian and horror fiction writer his most famous work was 1953s the conservative mind from burke to santayana later republished as the conservative mind from burke to eliot kirks writings and legacy are interwoven with the history of traditionalist conservatism with his influence felt at the heritage foundation the intercollegiate studies institute and other conservative think tanks most especially the russell kirk center for cultural renewal the conservative mind was written by kirk as a doctoral dissertation while he was a student at the st andrews university in scotland previously the author of a biography of american conservative john randolph of roanoke kirks the conservative mind had laid out six canons of conservative thought in the book including belief that a divine intent rules society as well as conscience political problems at bottom are religious and moral problems affection for the proliferating variety and mystery of traditional life as distinguished from the narrowing uniformity and egalitarian and utilitarian aims of most radical systems conviction that civilized society requires orders and classes persuasion that property and freedom are inseparably connected and that economic leveling is not economic progress faith in prescription and distrust of sophisters and calculators man must put a control upon his will and his appetite tradition and sound prejudice provide checks upon mans anarchic impulse recognition that change and reform are not identical36 kirk goes on to examine the thought of a wide array of conservative thinkers including angloirish statesman edmund burke american federalists john adams and alexander hamilton british literati samuel taylor coleridge and robert southey southern conservatives john randolph of roanoke and john calhoun american catholic political thinker orestes brownson new england writer nathaniel hawthorne british prime minister benjamin disraeli british catholic john henry newman american historian henry adams scholars irving babbitt paul elmer more and george santayana and angloamerican poet and literary critic t s eliot a traditionalist counterestablishmentedit the new conservatives also contributed to the emerging conservative movement and formed a traditionalist counterestablishment creating and expanding traditionalist organizations and forming new journals and publications many traditionalists were contributors to william f buckleys national review including russell kirk and others the 1950s and early 1960s resulted in a traditionalist renaissance and laid the foundation for future traditionalist efforts to succeed the intercollegiate studies instituteedit among the organizations formed in the wake of traditionalist scholarship and public activity was frank chodorovs libertarianleaning student organization the intercollegiate society of individualists the organization formed in 1953 quickly changed philosophy from being an academic organization based in individualist principles to one of a more traditionalist bent largely due to the efforts of e victor milione eventually the organization changed its name to the intercollegiate studies institute and educated for liberty via the thought of such traditionalists as richard m weaver and russell kirk through kirks influence as well as other well known conservatives it has been a center for traditionalist students hosting lectures symposiums conferences and debates and publishing journals such as modern age the intercollegiate review the chesterton review and the university bookman as well as a variety of books by traditionalist scholars through its imprint isi books the president of the intercollegiate studies institute was for many years t kenneth cribb jr37 modern age a quarterly reviewedit in 1957 russell kirk cofounded with publisher henry regnery modern age a conservative academic quarterly which for over fifty years has

gregg mitch mcconnell chair in leadership at the university of louisville and director of the mcconnell center the philadelphia societyedit another traditionalist organization to appear was an intellectual forum called the philadelphia society similar in scope to the libertarian mont pelerin society the philadelphia society organized conferences where leading traditionalists could gather exchange ideas and lecture on topics and issues vital to the preservation of the american republic and the conservative movement to this day it is the leading intellectual organization of the traditionalist right renewal and consolidationedit after the intellectual pioneering of the new conservatives and the creation of the conservative counterestablishment younger scholars and academics came to the fore expanding and consolidating the traditionalist presence in the larger conservative movement and contributing to the further renewal of traditionalist scholarship these scholars and academics could be deemed the conservators or the keepers of the flame of conservatism as the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s approached the second generation the conservatorsedit this second generation appeared at a time when american society was experiencing the change and tumult of the 1960s the rising counterculture and the new left the emergence of the protest movement and race riots the war in vietnam and then the crisis of nixon and watergate and the malaise of jimmy carters presidency these conservators contributed in turn to preserving culture and educational renewal while simultaneously creating organizations and journals which would further the cause of traditionalist conservatism writers and thinkers of this caliber included political scientist george w carey moralist and literary critic george a panichas swedishamerican thinker claes g ryn catholic chestertonian fr ian boyd csb historian forrest mcdonald and others these new thinkers would join the new
