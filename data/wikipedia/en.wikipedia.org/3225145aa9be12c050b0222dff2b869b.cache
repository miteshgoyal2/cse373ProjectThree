brownback kansas also lowered the sales tax and eliminated a tax on small businesses91 the tax cuts helped contribute to moodys downgrading of the states bond rating in 201492 they also contributed to

collections receiving 369 million instead of the plannedfor 651 million94 the tax cuts and the effect on the economy of kansas received considerable criticism in the media including michael hiltzik in the los angeles times the editorial board of the washington post the new republic bloomberg businessweek80 and the new york times who described brownbacks conservative experiment as a laboratory for policies that are too far to the right and that as a result more than 100 current and former republican elected officials endorsed his opponent in the 2014 gubernatorial race democrat paul davis949596 grover norquist defended the tax cuts as a model for the nation97 educationedit in april 2014 brownback signed a controversial school finance bill that eliminated mandatory due process hearings which were previously required to fire experienced teachers according to the kansas city star the bill also allows school districts to hire unlicensed teachers for science and math classes and it creates a tax break for corporations that donate to private school scholarship funds98 the resulting cuts in funding caused districts to shut down the school year early99 health careedit in august 2011 over the objections of fellow republican kansas insurance commissioner sandy praeger34 brownback announced he was declining a 315 million grant from the us department of health and human services to set up an insurance exchange as part of the federal health care reform law100 in may 2011 brownback had directed the states insurance commissioner to slow the implementation timeline for the exchange development upon announcing the refusal of the budgeted grant money for the state his office stated there is much uncertainty surrounding the ability of the federal government to meet its already budgeted future spending obligations every state should be preparing for fewer federal resources not more to deal with that reality kansas needs to maintain maximum flexibility that requires freeing kansas from the strings attached to the early innovator grant17 the move was unanimously supported by the delegates of the state party central committee at its august 2011 meeting but a the new york times editorial criticized brownback for turning down the grant which could have helped ease the states own budget instead of letting kansas design its own model program for an online computer exchange to help people choose among health insurance providers mr brownback’s rebuff increases the likelihood that the state must design one at its own expense or see federal officials create an exchange as required under the new law10134 brownback also signed into law the health care freedom act based on model legislation published by the american legislative exchange council alec8788 abortionedit sam brownback speaking at the 2015 conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland on february 27 2015 brownback signed three antiabortion bills in 2011 in april

that represented the club davis was found to have no involvement in the cause for the raid and quickly allowed to leave118 the incident and its publication were seen as particularly advantageous for brownback who until then had trailed badly in polling as it could be expected to become the focus of a typical 30second campaign ad used to characterize his opponent119 responding to criticism of kecks involvement in the campaign brownback spokesman paul milburn commented that it was legal to use taxpayerpaid staff to campaign responding directly to the controversy saying paul davis must have spent too much time in vip rooms at strip clubs back in law school because he should know full well that the law allows personal staff of the governor’s office to work on campaign issues in kansas however getting records about crimes that law enforcement has investigated is typically difficult the legislature closed those records to the public over three decades earlier if members of the public desire incident reports and investigative files they normally have to sue to obtain them cases sometimes costing 25000 or more media law experts were amazed after learning montgomery countys sheriff released nonpublic investigative files from 1998 with just a records request “that is unusual” said mike merriam media lawyer for the kansas press association “they have denied releasing records

creation i dont think were really at the point of teaching this in the classroom i think what we passed in the us senate in 2002 the santorum amendment is really what we should be doing and that is that you teach the controversy you teach what is fact is fact and what is theory is theory and you move from that proceedings rather than from teaching some sort of different thought and this i really

removed the state from the program the federal office of refugee resettlement served notice that it would instead work directly with local refugee resettlement organizations mark greenberg of the federal administration for children and families said “if the state were to cease participating in the refugee resettlement program it would have no effect on the placement of refugees by the state department in kansas or the orrfunded benefits they can receive although states are legally entitled to withdraw from the program the initial withdrawal for claimed security reasons is the first in the nation micah kubic the kansas aclus executive director said brownback’s policy removed the state from the process of protecting those seeking safety jeopardized by their religious beliefs despite

brownback supported a political surge coupled with the military surge of 2007 in iraq and opposed the democratic partys strategy of timed withdrawal it does mean that there must be bipartisan agreement for our military commitment on iraq we cannot fight a war with the support of only one political party and it does mean that the parties in iraq – sunni shi’a and kurds – must get to a political agreement to a political equilibrium i think most people agree that a cut and run strategy does not serve our interest at all nor those of the world nor those of the region nor those of the iraqi people so i invite my colleagues all around particularly on the other side of the aisle to indicate what level of commitment they can support157 — senator sam brownback us senate floor speech
