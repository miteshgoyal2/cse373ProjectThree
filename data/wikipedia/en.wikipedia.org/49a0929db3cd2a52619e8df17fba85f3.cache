states department of justice doj also known as the justice department is a federal executive department of the us government responsible for the enforcement of the law and administration of justice in the united states equivalent to the justice or interior ministries of other countries the department was formed in 1870 during the ulysses s grant administration in its early years the doj vigorously prosecuted ku klux klan members the department of justice administers several federal law enforcement agencies including the federal bureau of investigation fbi and the drug enforcement administration dea the department is responsible for investigating instances of financial fraud representing the united states government in legal matters such as in cases before the supreme court and running the federal prison system34 the department is also responsible for reviewing the conduct of local law enforcement as directed by the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 19945 the department

external links historyedit the office of the attorney general was established by the judiciary act of 1789 as a parttime job for one person but grew with the bureaucracy at one time the attorney general gave legal advice to the us congress as well as the president but in 1819 the attorney general began advising congress alone to ensure a manageable workload6 until march 3 1853 the salary of the attorney general was set by statute at less than the amount paid to other cabinet members early attorneys general supplemented their salaries by running private law practices often arguing cases before the courts as attorneys for paying litigants7 following unsuccessful efforts in 1830 and 1846 to make attorney general a fulltime job8 in 1869 the us house committee on the judiciary led by congressman william lawrence conducted an inquiry into the creation of a law department headed by the attorney general and also composed of the various department solicitors and united states attorneys on february 19 1868 lawrence introduced a bill in congress to create the department of justice president ulysses s grant signed the bill into law on june 22 18709 the department of justice officially began operations on july 1 18706 just prior to the civil war in february 1861 the confederate states of america established a department of justice10 though the second american department of justice was brought into being on july 1 1870 fifty years of amendments were required before it reached a status comparable to that of its confederate predecessor11 grant appointed amos t akerman as attorney general and benjamin h bristow as americas first solicitor general both akerman and bristow used the department of justice to vigorously prosecute ku klux klan members in the early 1870s in the first few years of grants first term in office there were 1000 indictments against klan members with over 550 convictions from the department of justice by 1871 there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in albany new york the result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the south akerman gave credit to grant and told a friend that no one was better or stronger then grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists12 george h williams who succeeded akerman in december 1871 continued to prosecute the klan throughout 1872 until the spring of 1873 during grants second term in office13 williams then placed a moratorium on klan prosecutions partially because the justice department inundated by cases involving the klan did not have the manpower to continue prosecutions13 the act to establish the department of justice drastically increased the attorney generals responsibilities to include the supervision of all united states attorneys formerly under the department of the interior the prosecution of all federal crimes and the representation of the united states in all court actions barring the use of private attorneys by the federal government14 the law also created the office of solicitor general to supervise and conduct government litigation in the supreme court of the united states15 with the passage of the interstate commerce act in 1887 the federal government took on some law enforcement responsibilities and the department of justice tasked with performing these16 in 1884 control of federal prisons was transferred to the new department from the department of interior new facilities were built including the penitentiary at leavenworth in 1895 and a facility for women located in west virginia at alderson was established in 192417 in 1933 president franklin d roosevelt issued an executive order which gave the department of justice responsibility for the functions of prosecuting in the courts of the united states claims and demands by and offsenses sic against the government of the united states and of defending claims and demands against the government and of supervising the work of united states attorneys marshals and clerks in connection therewith now exercised by any agency or officer18 headquartersedit main article robert f kennedy department of justice building the us department of justice building was completed in 1935 from a design by milton bennett medary upon medarys death in 1929 the other partners of his philadelphia firm zantzinger borie and medary took over the project on a lot bordered by constitution and pennsylvania avenues and ninth and tenth streets northwest it holds over one million square feet 93000 m² of space the sculptor c paul jennewein served as overall design consultant for the entire building contributing more than 50 separate sculptural elements inside and outside various efforts none entirely successful have been made to determine the meaning of the latin motto appearing on the department of justice seal qui pro domina justitia sequitur it is not even known exactly when the original version of the doj seal itself was adopted or when the motto first appeared on the seal the most authoritative opinion of the doj suggests that the motto refers to the attorney general and thus by extension to the department of justice who prosecutes on behalf of justice or the lady justice19 the mottos conception of the prosecutor or government attorney as being the servant of justice itself finds concrete expression in a similarlyordered englishlanguage inscription the united states wins its point whenever justice is done its citizens in the courts in the
