commercial district in the university district of seattle washington located near the university of washington uw campus once a department store eight blocks long the ave has gradually turned into what now resembles an eightblocklong global food court3 the story of the ave reflects the dynamics of many urban neighborhoods and the social and economic problems of countless american cities though it is also a crossroads of diverse subcultures it is patronized by many of the nearly 96900 students faculty and staff of the uw4 and by a population of homeless or transient individuals most of whom are youth university way ne is a collector tertiary arterial5 running 12 miles 19 km from just below ne pacific street in the south to ne ravenna boulevard and cowen park in the north where it turns into cowen place ne1 originally platted as columbus avenue the street was renamed 14th avenue after the neighborhood was annexed by the city in 1891 locals came to feel that a numbered street name was inappropriate because of the thoroughfares importance so in 1919 the university commercial club held a contest that decided the new name of the street university way the street had been known as the ave for a time before this however and while it was no longer officially an avenue the nickname stuck contents 1 vitality 2 problems 3 architecture 4 see also 5 notes 6 bibliography 7 further reading vitalityedit on the ave during u district street fair 2007 this building in the 4200 block was built in 1924 as a mortuary it now contains restaurants and offices shigas import shop one of the aves longestlived retail stores andy shiga was for decades a leader of the neighborhoods retail community late in the 20th century the ave declined significantly due in significant part to the more competitive planning capital investment and popularity of university village and northgate mall from 2002 to 2004 the city and the neighborhood made some steps countering this trend by repaving the ave and adding benches bus bulbs and period lighting6 the ave remains at the heart of campus life for university students and is filled with busy restaurants mostly inexpensive new and used book and record stores clothing stores and movie theatres most densely between ne 41st and ne 50th streets among these are the varsity theatre 19407 and the university book store 19248 the ave is so full of salonstyle establishments that it has become its own sort of macro third place this is exemplified by the coffeehouse culture of the middle and lower ave with at least six cafes on the ave or its alleys by the remaining used bookstores with late hours and by the annual street fair and weekly saturday farmers market the ave is also home to one of seattles neighborhood service centers9 outposts of the city government originally known as little city halls10 still the ave is also plagued with the problems of urban neighborhoods the social and economic problems of disparities and of american cities in particular it is home to the ave rats the young alcohol and drug users that have been attracted to the street the ave is glorified by the seattle hip hop group blue scholars in their song the ave on their selftitled album fuck class get your education on the ave is a repeated lyric as they portray the ave as the last true cultural melting pot of seattle the business communities improvements of 2002 are lamented whatever happened to the avenue before the summer of 2002 as they feel the unique street society of studentspoetsdruggies was thrown away for a conformist corporate business facade blue scholars also reference several businesses on the ave including the university bookstore and the now closed used record store second time around problemsedit the ave is also the major hangout for homeless and transient teens and young adults in seattle the local seasonal and yearround homeless population referred to as ave rats11 is notorious for being a particularly countercultural crowd their numbers have dwindled somewhat in recent years due to increased police patrols tougher enforcement of loitering laws12 and designation of an alcohol impact area along with broadway on capitol hill and parts of downtown neighborhoods13 another factor contributing to the homeless youths decline was the extension of organized gangrelated criminal activity on the ave in recent years several groups whose signature graffiti tags can be seen throughout the u district contributed to the transition in drug sales from marijuana formerly sold by homeless youth and transients to include the organized sale of methamphetamine and cocaine this transition has resulted in multiple incidents of gunrelated violence as well as obvious deals occurring in broad daylight14 regular visitors to the ave could often recognize the same individuals standing at or patrolling the same areas day after daycitation needed the u district has seen these problems recur as reported in the university district herald in 1921 librarian miss mary baker asked for police protection from gangs of boys who were causing what is today described as vandalism and harassment librarian clara van sant wrote men hang outside the door to smoke gossip and pass comments to ladies coming into the library behavior that apparently continued through the early 1920s15 recent declines have been offset by gradually increasing social and economic problems3 were not an organized shopping district were very much like main street america said an independent retail business owner on the ave in 200116 its
