links history main article history of google googles original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in html the markup language used for designing web pages7 google began in january 1996 as a research project by larry page and sergey brin when they were both phd students at stanford university in stanford california8 while conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites9 they called this new technology pagerank it determined a websites relevance by the number of pages and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site1011 page and brin originally nicknamed their new search engine backrub because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site121314 eventually they changed the name to google the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word googol1516 the number 1 followed by 100 zeros which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information17 originally google ran under stanford universitys website with the domains googlestanfordedu and zstanfordedu1819 the domain name for google was registered on september 15 199720 and the company was incorporated on september 4 1998 it was based in the garage of a friend susan wojcicki8 in menlo park california craig silverstein a fellow phd student at stanford was hired as the first employee82122 financing 1998 and initial public

with shares hitting 350 for the first time on october 31 200746 primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market47 the surge in stock price was fueled mainly by

googles software code at an engineering conference she revealed that the entire google codebase which spans every single service it develops consists of over 2 billion lines of code all that code is stored on a code repository available to all 25000 google engineers and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 google data centers to keep control potvin said google has built its own version control system called piper and that when you start a new project you have a wealth of libraries already available to you almost everything has already been done engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time the only major exceptions are that the pagerank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access and the code for the android operating system and the google chrome browser are also stored separately as they dont run on the internet the piper system spans 85 tb of data google engineers make 25000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250000 files with that much code automated bots have to help potvin reported you need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health and this is not just humans maintaining code health but robots too” bots arent writing code but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the companys software not only is the size of the repository increasing potvin explained but the rate of change is also increasing this is an exponential curve8283 as of october 2016 google operates 70
