encrypted https connection will be used for the sending and receiving of all gmail emails and every single email message you send or receive —100 of them —is encrypted while moving internally through the companys systems78 whenever possible gmail uses transport layer security tls to automatically encrypt emails sent and received on the web and on android devices users can check if a message is

pornography pictures each one of the images is given a unique numerical number known as a hash google then scans gmail looking for the unique hashes when suspicious images are located google reports the incident to the authorities89 historyedit main article history of gmail the idea for gmail was developed by paul buchheit several years before it was announced to the public the project was known by the code name caribou during early development the project was kept secret from most of googles own engineers this changed once the project became better and better and by early 2004 almost everybody was using it to access the companys internal email system90 gmail was announced to the public by google on april 1 2004 as a limited beta release91 in november 2006 google began offering a javabased application of gmail for mobile phones92 in october 2007 google began a process of rewriting parts of the code that gmail used which would make the service faster and add new features such as custom keyboard shortcuts and the ability to bookmark specific messages and email searches93 gmail also added imap support in october 200794 an update around january 2008 changed elements of gmails use of javascript and resulted in the failure of a thirdparty script some users had been using google acknowledge the issue and helped users with workarounds95 gmail exited the beta status on july 7 200996 prior to december 2013 users had to approve to see images in emails which acted as a security measure this changed in december 2013 when google citing improved image handling enabled images to be visible without user approval images will be routed through googles secure proxy servers rather than the original external host servers97 marketingland noted that the change to image handling means email marketers will no longer be able to track the recipients ip address or information about what kind of device the recipient is using98 however wired stated that the new change means senders can track the time when an email is first opened as the initial loading of the images requires the system to make a callback to the original server99 gmail designedit before the introduction of gmail the product and graphic design firm gamil design in raleigh north carolina received 3000 hits per month a google engineer who had accidentally gone to the gamil site a number of times contacted the

criticismedit main article criticism of google privacyedit google has one privacy policy that cover all of its services122 google claims that gmail refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages such as those that mention race religion sexual orientation health or financial statements123 automated scanning of email contentedit googles mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes including to add contextsensitive advertisements next to emails and to filter spam and malware124125126 privacy advocates raised concerns about this practice concerns included that allowing email content to be read by a machine as opposed to a person can allow google to keep unlimited amounts of information forever the automated background scanning of data raises the risk that the expectation of privacy in email usage will be reduced or eroded information collected from emails could be retained by google for years after its current relevancy to build complete profiles on users emails sent by users from other email providers get scanned despite never having agreed to googles privacy policy or terms of service google can change its privacy policy unilaterally and for minor changes to the policy it can do so without informing users in court cases governments and organizations can potentially find it easier to legally monitor email communications at any time google can change its current company policies to allow combining information from emails with data gathered from use of its other services and any internal security problem on googles systems can potentially expose many or all of its users124126125127128 in 2004 thirtyone privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon google to suspend its gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed the letter also called upon google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units the organizations also voiced their concerns about googles plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting thirdparty ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider126 on june 23 2017 google announced that later in 2017 it will phase out the scanning of email content to generate contextual advertising relying on personal data collected through other google services instead the company stated that this change was meant to clarify its practices and quell concerns among enterprise g suite customers who felt an ambiguous distinction between the free consumer and paid professional variants the latter being advertisingfree2129 lawsuitsedit in march 2011 a former gmail user in texas sued google claiming that its gmail service violates users privacy by scanning email messages to serve relevant ads130 in july 2012 some california residents filed two class action lawsuits against google and yahoo claiming that they illegally intercept emails sent by individual nongmail or nonyahoo email users to gmail and yahoo recipients without the senders knowledge consent or permission131 a motion filed by googles attorneys in the case concedes that gmail users have no expectation of privacy132 a court filing uncovered by advocacy group consumer watchdog in august 2013 revealed that google stated in a court filing that no reasonable expectation exists among gmail users in regard to the assured confidentiality of their emails133 in response to a lawsuit filed in may 2013 google explained all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipients assistant opens the letter people who use webbased email today cannot be surprised if their communications are processed by the recipients ecs electronic communications service provider in the course of delivery133 a google spokesperson stated to the media on august 15 2013 that the corporation takes the privacy and security concerns of gmail users very seriously133 april 2014 terms of service updateedit google updated its terms of service for gmail in april 2014 to create full transparency for its users in regard to the scanning of email content the relevant revision states our automated systems analyse your content including emails to provide you personally relevant product features such as customised search results tailored advertising and spam and malware detection this analysis occurs as the content is sent received and when it is stored a google spokesperson explained that the corporation wishes for its policies to be simple and easy for users to understand in response to the update jim killock executive director of the open rights group stated the really dangerous things that google is doing are things like the information held in analytics cookies in advertising and the profiling that it is able to do on individual accounts125 microsoft ad campaign against googleedit in 2013 microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack google for scanning email messages arguing that most consumers are not aware that google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads microsoft claims that its email service outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy googles kryptonite in response google stated we work hard to make sure that ads are safe unobtrusive and relevant no humans read your email or google account information in order to show you advertisements or related information an automated algorithm — similar to that used for features like priority inbox or spam filtering — determines which ads are shown” the new york times cites google supporters who say that microsoft’s ads are distasteful the last resort of a company that has been unsuccessful at competing against google on the more noble battleground of products134 other privacy issuesedit 2010 attack from chinaedit in january 2010 google detected a highly sophisticated cyberattack on its infrastructure that originated from china the targets of the attack were chinese human rights activists but google discovered that accounts belonging to european american and chinese activists for human rights in china had been routinely accessed by third parties additionally google stated that their investigation revealed that at least 20 other large companies from a wide range of businesses including the internet finance technology media and chemical sectors had been similarly targeted google was in the process of notifying those companies and it was also working with relevant us authorities in light of the attacks google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure and advised individual users to install antivirus and antispyware on their computers update their operating systems and web browsers and be cautious when clicking on internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails135136 google buzzedit the february 2010 launch of google buzz a former social network that was linked to gmail immediately drew criticism for publicly sharing details of users contacts unless the default settings were changed137138 googleedit a new gmail feature was launched in january 2014 whereby users can email people with google accounts even though they do not know the email address of the recipient marc rotenberg president of the electronic privacy information center called the feature troubling and compared it to the google buzz initial launch privacy flaw139 update to doubleclick privacy policyedit in june 2016 julia angwin of propublica wrote about googles updated privacy policy which deleted a clause that had stated google would not combine doubleclick web browsing cookie information with personally identifiable information from its other services this change has allowed google to merge users’ personally identifiable information from different google services to create one unified ad profile for each user after publication of the article google reached out to propublica to say that the merge would not include gmail keywords in ad targeting140 outagesedit gmail suffered at least seven outages in 2009 alone causing doubts about the reliability of its service141142 it suffered a new outage on february 28 2011 in which a bug caused gmail accounts to be empty google stated in a blog post that email was never lost and restoration was in progress143 another outage occurred on april 17 2012144 september 24 2013145 and january 24 2014146 google has stated that gmail remains more than 999 available to all users and

problems is when you try to send outbound mail from your gmail universal inbox gmail adds a tag telling your recipients that youre actually using gmail and not your office email if your recipient is using microsoft outlook hell see a message like from yourofficedomaincom on behalf of yourgmailgmailcom manjoo further wrote that google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your email from being considered spam by your recipient the theory is that if the email is honest about its origins it shouldnt arouse suspicion by spam checking software148 the following july google announced a new option that would remove the on behalf of tag by sending the email from the server of the other email address instead of using gmails servers149 see alsoedit google portal internet portal list of
