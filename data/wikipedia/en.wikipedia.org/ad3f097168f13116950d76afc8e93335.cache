external links family backgroundedit horowitz is the son of phil and blanche horowitz who were high school teachers his father taught english and his mother taught stenography3 during years of labor organizing and the great depression phil and blanche horowitz were longstanding members of the american communist party and strong supporters of joseph stalin they left the party after khrushchev published his report in 1956 about the crimes stalin committed and terrorism of the soviet populations45 according to horowitz underneath the ordinary surfaces of their lives my parents and their friends thought of themselves as secret agents the mission they had undertaken and about which they could not speak freely except with each other was not just an idea to them it was more important to their sense of themselves than anything else they did nor were its tasks of a kind they could attend or ignore depending on their moods they were more like the obligations of a religious faith except that their faith was secular and the millennium they awaited was being instituted at that moment in the very country that had become americas enemy it was this fact that made their ordinary lives precarious and their secrecy necessary if they lived under a cloud of suspicion it was the result of more than just their political passions the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima had created a terror in the minds of ordinary people newspapers reported on american spy rings working to steal atomic secrets for the soviet state when people read these stories they inevitably thought of progressives like us and so did we ourselves even if we never encountered a soviet agent or engaged in a single illegal act each of us knew that our commitment to socialism implied the obligation to commit treason too6 after the death of stalin in 1953 his father phil horowitz commenting on how stalins numerous official titles had to be divided among his successors told his son you see what a genius stalin was it took five men to replace him7 according to horowitz the publication of the khrushchev report was probably the greatest blow struck against the soviet empire during the cold war when my parents and their friends opened the morning times and read its text their world collapsed—and along with it their will to struggle if the document was true almost everything they had said and believed was false their secret mission had led them into waters so deep that its tide had overwhelmed them taking with it the very meaning of their lives8 horowitz received a ba from columbia university in 1959 majoring in english and a masters degree in english literature at university of california berkeley9 career with the new leftedit after completing his graduate degree in the late 1960s horowitz lived in london and worked for the bertrand russell peace foundation1011 he identified as a serious marxist intellectual in 1966 ralph schoenman persuaded bertrand russell to convene a war crimes tribunal to judge united states involvement in the vietnam war12 horowitz would write three decades later that he had political reservations about the tribunal and did not take part he described the tribunals judges as formidable worldfamous and radical including isaac deutscher jeanpaul sartre stokely carmichael simone de beauvoir james baldwin and vladimir dedijer13 while in london horowitz became a close friend of deutscher and wrote a biography of him which was published in 19711415 horowitz wrote the free world colossus a critique of american foreign policy in the cold war in january 1968 horowitz returned to the united states where he became coeditor of the new left magazine ramparts based in northern california11 during the early 1970s horowitz developed a close friendship with huey p newton founder of the black panther party horowitz later portrayed newton as equal parts gangster terrorist intellectual and media celebrity11 as part of their work together horowitz helped raise money for and assisted the panthers with the running of a school for poor children in oakland he recommended that newton hire betty van patter as bookkeeper she was then working for ramparts in december 1974 van patters body was found floating in san francisco harbor she had been murdered horowitz has said he believes the panthers were behind the killing1116 in 1976 horowitz was a founding sponsor of james weinsteins magazine in these times17 writing on the rightedit following this period horowitz rejected karl marx and socialism but kept quiet about his changing politics for nearly a decade in early 1985 horowitz and longtime collaborator peter collier who also became a political conservative wrote an article for the washington post magazine entitled lefties for reagan later retitled as goodbye to all that the article explained their change of views and recent decision to vote for a second term for republican president ronald reagan181920 in 1986 horowitz published why i am no longer a leftist in the village voice21 in 1987 horowitz cohosted a second thoughts conference in washington dc described by sidney blumenthal in the washington post as his coming out as a conservative according to attendee alexander cockburn horowitz related how his stalinist parents had not permitted him or his sister to watch the popular doris day and rock hudson movies of his youth instead they watched propaganda films from the soviet union22 in may 1989 horowitz ronald radosh and peter collier travelled to poland for a conference in kraków calling for the end of communism23 after marching with polish dissidents in an antiregime protest horowitz spoke about his changing thoughts and why he believed that socialism could not create their future he said his dream was for the people of poland to be free24 in 1992 horowitz and collier founded heterodoxy a monthly magazine focused on exposing what it described as excessive political correctness on united states college and university campuses it was meant to have the feel of a samizdat publication inside the gulag of the pc politically correct university the tabloid was directed at university students whom horowitz viewed as being indoctrinated by the entrenched left in american academia25 he has maintained his assault on the political left to the present day writing in his memoir radical son that universities were no longer effective in presenting both sides of political arguments he stated that leftwing professors had created political terror on campuses26 in a column in salon2 he described his opposition to reparations for slavery stating it represented racism against blacks as it defined them only in terms of having descended from slaves he argued that applying labels like descendants of slaves to blacks was damaging and would serve to segregate them from mainstream society27 in 2001 during black history month horowitz purchased or attempted to purchase advertising space in several american university student publications to express his opposition to reparations for slavery2 many student papers refused to sell him ad space at some schools papers which carried his ads were stolen or destroyed227 editor joan walsh of salon said the furor had given horowitz an overwhelming amount of free publicity228 horowitz supported the interventionist foreign policy associated with the bush doctrine but wrote against us intervention in the kosovo war arguing that it was unnecessary and harmful to us interests2930 horowitz also strongly opposed the natoled intervention in the libyan war31 in the early 21st century he has written critically of libertarian antiwar views3233 in 2005 horowitz launched discover the networks a website that he has described as the largest publicly accessible database defining the chief groups and individuals of the left and their organizational interlocks34 in two books horowitz accused dana l cloud an associate professor of communication studies at the university of texas at austin and 99 other professors in his book the professors the 101 most dangerous academics in america of explicit introduction of political agendas into the classroom35 cloud replied in inside higher ed that her experience demonstrates that horowitz damages professors lives by his accusations and that he needs to be viewed as more than a political opponent horowitzs attacks have been significant people who read the book or his web site regularly send letters to university officials asking for her to be fired personally she has received—mostly via email—physical threats threats of removing my daughter from my custody threats of sexual assaults horrible disgusting gendered things she said that horowitz doesnt send these isnt the point she said he builds a climate and culture that emboldens people and as a result shouldnt be seen as a defender of academic freedom but as its enemy36 after discussion the national communication association decided against granting horowitz a spot as a panelist at its national conference in 2008 he had offered to forego the 7000 speaking fee originally requested he wrote in inside higher ed the fact that no academic group has had the balls to invite me says a lot about the ability of academic associations to discuss important issues if a political minority wants to censor them an association official said the decision was based in part on horowitzs request to be provided with a stipend for 500 to hire a personal bodyguard association officials decided that having a bodyguard present communicates the expectation of confrontation and violence36 horowitz appeared in occupy unmasked a 2012 documentary portraying the occupy wall street movement as a sinister organization formed to violently destroy the american government37 academic bill of rightsedit see also academic freedom in the early 21st century horowitz has concentrated on issues of academic

professors for as he alleges engaging in indoctrination rather than a disinterested pursuit of knowledge he says his campaign for academic freedom is ideologically neutral39 horowitz published an academic bill of rights abr which he proposes to eliminate political bias in university hiring and grading he says conservatives and particularly republican party members are systematically excluded from faculties citing statistical studies on faculty party affiliation40 in 2004 the georgia general assembly passed a resolution on a 41–5 vote to adopt a version of the abr for state educational institutions41 in pennsylvania the house of representatives created a special legislative committee to investigate issues of academic freedom including whether students who hold unpopular views need

locate the ladder of opportunity within reach of others69 horowitz published an open letter to morris dees president of the splc saying that this reminder that the slaves transported to america were bought from african and arab slavers was a response to demands that only whites pay reparations to blacks he said he never held africans and arabs solely responsible for slavery he said that berlets
