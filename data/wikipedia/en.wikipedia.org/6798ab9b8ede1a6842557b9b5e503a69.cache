branch of mathematical logic elementary function arithmetic also called efa elementary arithmetic and exponential function arithmetic is the system of arithmetic with the usual elementary properties of 0 1  × xy together with induction for formulas with bounded quantifiers efa is a very weak logical system whose proof theoretic ordinal is ω3 but still seems able to prove much of ordinary mathematics that can be stated in the language of firstorder arithmetic contents 1 definition 2 friedmans grand conjecture 3 related systems 4 see also 5 references definitionedit efa is a system in first order logic with equality its language contains two constants 0 1 three binary operations × exp with expxy usually written as xy a binary relation symbol this is not really necessary as it can be written in terms of the other operations and is sometimes omitted but is convenient for defining bounded quantifiers bounded quantifiers are those of the form ∀xy and ∃ xy which are abbreviations for ∀ x xy→… and ∃x xy∧… in the usual way the axioms of efa are the axioms of robinson arithmetic for 0 1 × the axioms for exponentiation x0 1 xy1 xy×x induction for formulas all of whose quantifiers are bounded but which may contain free variables friedmans grand conjectureedit harvey friedmans grand conjecture implies that many mathematical theorems such as fermats last theorem can be proved in very weak systems such as efa the original statement of the conjecture from friedman 1999 is every theorem published in the annals of mathematics whose statement involves only finitary mathematical objects ie what logicians call an arithmetical statement can be proved in efa efa is the weak fragment of peano arithmetic based on the usual quantifierfree axioms for 0 1  × exp together with the scheme of induction for all formulas in the language all of whose quantifiers are bounded while it is easy to construct artificial arithmetical statements that are true but not provable in efaexample needed the point of friedmans conjecture is that natural examples of such statements in mathematics seem to be rare some natural examples include consistency statements from logic several statements related to ramsey theory such as the szemerédi regularity lemma and the graph minor theorem and tarjans algorithm for the disjointset data structure related systemsedit several related computational complexity classes have similar properties to efa one can omit the binary function symbol exp from the language by taking robinson arithmetic together with induction for all formulas with bounded quantifiers and an axiom stating roughly that exponentiation is a function defined everywhere this is similar to efa and has the same proof theoretic strength but is more cumbersome to work with there are weak fragments of secondorder arithmetic called rca 0 and wkl 0 that have the same consistency strength as efa and are conservative over it for π0 2 sentencesfurther explanation needed which are sometimes studied in reverse mathematics simpson 2009 elementary recursive arithmetic era is a subsystem of primitive recursive arithmetic pra in which recursion is restricted to bounded sums and products this also has the same π0 2 sentences as efa in the sense that whenever efa proves ∀x∃y pxy with p quantifierfree era proves the open formula pxtx with t a term definable in era like pra era can be defined in an entirely logicfreeclarification needed manner with just the rules of substitution and induction and defining equations for all elementary recursive functions unlike pra however the elementary recursive functions can be characterized by the closure under composition and projection of a finite number of basis functions and thus only a finite number of defining equations are
