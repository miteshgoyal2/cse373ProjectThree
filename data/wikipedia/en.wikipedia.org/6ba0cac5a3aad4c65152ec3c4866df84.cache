secondary sources 8 external links causesedit one of the causes for the panic of 1893 can be traced back to argentina investment was encouraged by the argentine agent bank baring brothers however the 1890 wheat crop failure and a coup in buenos aires ended further investments because european investors were concerned that these problems might spread they started a run on gold in the us treasury at that time it was comparatively simple to cash in dollar investments for exportable gold2 during the gilded age of the 1870s and 1880s the united states had experienced economic growth and expansion but much of this expansion depended on high international commodity prices in 1893 wheat prices crashed3 one of the first clear signs of trouble came on february 20 18934 thirteen days before the inauguration of us president grover cleveland with the appointment of receivers for the philadelphia and reading railroad which had greatly overextended itself5 upon taking office cleveland dealt directly with the treasury crisis6 and successfully convinced congress to repeal the sherman silver purchase act legislation cleveland felt was mainly responsible for the economic crisis7 as concern for the state of the economy deepened people rushed to withdraw their money from banks and caused bank runs the credit crunch rippled through the economy a financial panic in london combined with a drop in continental european trade caused foreign investors to sell american stocks to obtain american funds backed by gold8 populistsedit the peoples party also known as the populists was an agrarianpopulist political party in the united states from 1892 to 1896 it played a major role as a leftwing force in american politics it drew support from angry farmers in the west and south it was highly critical of capitalism especially banks and railroads and allied itself with the labor movement established in 1891 as a result of the populist movement the peoples party reached its zenith in the 1892 presidential election when its ticket composed of james b weaver and james g field won 85 of the popular vote and carried five states colorado idaho kansas nevada and north dakota and the 1894 house of representatives elections when it won nine seats built on a coalition of poor white cotton farmers in the south especially north carolina alabama and texas and hardpressed wheat farmers in the plains states especially kansas and nebraska the populists represented a radical crusading form of agrarianism and hostility to elites cities banks railroads and gold silveredit the free silver movement arose from a synergy of farming and mining interests farmers sought to invigorate the economy and thereby end deflation which was forcing them to repay loans with increasingly valuable dollars mining interests sought the right to turn silver directly into money without a central minting institution the sherman silver purchase act of 1890 while falling short of the free silver movements goals required the us government to buy millions of ounces of silver above what was required by the 1878 bland–allison act driving up the price of silver and pleasing silver miners people attempted to redeem silver notes for gold ultimately the statutory limit for the minimum amount of gold in federal reserves was reached and us notes could no longer be successfully redeemed for gold8 investments during the time of the panic were heavily financed through bond issues with high interest payments rumors regarding the national cordage companys financial distress ncc was the most actively traded stock at the time caused its lenders to call in their loans immediately and ncc went into bankruptcy receivership as a result the company a rope manufacturer had tried to corner the market for imported hemp as demand for silver and silver notes fell the price and value of silver dropped holders worried about a loss of face value of bonds and many became worthless9 a series of bank failures followed and the northern pacific railway the union pacific railroad and the atchison topeka santa fe railroad failed this was followed by the bankruptcy of many other companies in total over 15000 companies and 500 banks many of them in the west failed according to high estimates about 17–19 of the workforce was unemployed at the panics peak the huge spike in unemployment combined with the loss of life savings kept in failed banks meant that a oncesecure middleclass could not meet their mortgage obligations many walked away from recently built homes as a result10 effectsedit the 1896 broadway melodrama the war of wealth was inspired by the panic of 1893 as a result of the panic stock prices declined 500 banks closed 15000 businesses failed and numerous farms ceased operation the unemployment rate hit 25 in pennsylvania 35 in new york and 43 in michigan soup kitchens were opened to help feed the destitute facing starvation people chopped wood broke rocks and sewed by hand with needle and thread in exchange for food in some cases women resorted to prostitution to feed their families to help the people of detroit mayor hazen pingree started pingrees potato patch which were community gardens for farming11 the sherman silver purchase act of 1890 perhaps along with the protectionist mckinley tariff of that year has been partially blamed for the panic passed in response to a large overproduction of silver by western mines the sherman act required the us treasury to purchase silver using notes backed by either silver or gold president grover cleveland a democrat was blamed for the depression he in turn blamed the sherman silver purchase act the decline of the gold reserves stored in the treasury fell to a dangerously low level this forced president cleveland to borrow 65 million in gold from wallstreet banker jp morgan and the rothschild banking family of england12 in the ensuing 1894 elections the democrats and populists lost heavily the election marked the largest republican gains in history1314 see alsoedit denver depression of 1893 panic of 1896 black friday 1869 — also referred to as the gold panic of 1869 secondterm curse
