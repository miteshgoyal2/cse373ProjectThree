into thirds the first of which was attorney and legal fees five million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7000 individual former community leaders the final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by hallissey and williams and then approved by the courts for distribution one such charity the remote area medical foundation wwwramusaorg received payments in excess of 12 million usd for the provision of medical services supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the united states and beyond prior to the 1999 class action lawsuit the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by aol community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice during this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena brian williams of dallas led many community leaders in a virtual strike or sitin to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay this protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in row 800 following the protest aol terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the community leaders involved quickly following the release of these community leaders each was reinstated with the exception of williams due to his role in the protest during this time williams role on aol was that of

over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled either by the company or the user in addition aol changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit previously aol would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute thus a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes aol claimed this was to account for sign onsign off time but because this practice was not made known to its customers the plaintiffs won some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds especially when connecting via another isp aol disclosed its connectiontime calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours in addition the aol software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged aol was sued by the ohio attorney general in october 2003 for improper billing practices the case was settled on june 8 2005 aol agreed to resolve any consumer complaints filed with the ohio ags office in december 2006 aol agreed to provide restitution to florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the florida attorney general125 account cancellationedit many customers complained that aol personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing in response to approximately 300 consumer complaints the new york attorney generals office began an inquiry of aols customer service policiescitation needed the investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to retain or save subscribers who had called to cancel their internet service in many instances such retention was done against subscribers wishes or without their consent under the scheme customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or save half of the people who called to cancel servicecitation needed for several years aol had instituted minimum retention or save percentages which consumer representatives were expected to meet these bonuses and the minimum save rates accompanying them had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers on august 24 2005 america online agreed to pay 125 million to the state of new york and reformed its customer service procedures under the agreement aol would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus125 however the agreement only covered people in the state of new york126 on june 13 2006 vincent ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post127 stating he had switched to broadband years earlier in the recorded phone call the aol representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30yearold ferrari explained why aol hours were still being recorded on it ferrari insisted that aol software was not even installed on the computer when ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless the aol representative asked to speak with ferraris father for whom the account had been set up the conversation was aired on cnbc when cnbc reporters tried to have an account on aol cancelled they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account128 on july 19 2006 aols entire retention manual was released on the internet129 on august 3 2006 time warner announced that the company would be dissolving aols retention centers due to its profits hinging on 1 billion in cost cuts the company estimated that it would lose more than six million subscribers over the following year130 direct marketing of disksedit a few promotional cdroms distributed in canada prior to 2006 aol was infamous for the unsolicited mass direct mail of 3½ floppy disks and cdroms containing their software they were the most frequent user of this marketing tactic and received criticism for the environmental cost of the campaign131 according to pc world in the 1990s you couldnt open a magazine pc world included or your mailbox without an aol disk falling out of it126 the mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by the public and led to protest groups one such was no more aol cds a webbased effort by two it workers132 to collect one million disks with the intent to return the disks to aol133 the website was started in august 2001 and an estimated 410176 cds were collected by august 2007 when the project was shut down133 aol cds were recognized as no1 on pcworlds top ten list of most annoying tech products134 common opinion of the mass disk distribution is also reflected in some popular media for example in episode 120 tiki lounge of malcolm in the middle malcolm complains that the booster club auction items are all embarrassingly worthless one of the items in the auction is an aol startup disk this sentiment is also recorded in urban dictionary where listed uses for the disks include flying disks135 pizza cutters sun catchers and microwave fodder136 softwareedit in 2000 aol was served with an 8 billion lawsuit alleging that its aol 50 software caused significant difficulties for users attempting to use thirdparty internet service providers the lawsuit sought damages of up to 1000 for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit aol later agreed to a settlement of 15 million without admission of wrongdoing137 the aol software then was given a feature called aol dialer or aol connect on mac os x this feature allowed users to connect to the isp without running the full interface this allowed users to use only the applications they wish to use especially if they do not favor the aol browser aol 90 was once identified by stopbadware as being under investigation138 for installing additional software without disclosure and modifying browser preferences toolbars and icons however as of the release of aol 90 vr vista ready on january 26 2007 it was no longer considered badware due to changes aol made in the software139 usenet newsgroupsedit when aol gave clients access to usenet in 1993 they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view altaolsucks aol did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view but changed the description to flames and complaints about america online with aol clients swarming usenet newsgroups the old existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both aol and its clients referring to the new state of affairs as eternal september140 aol discontinued access to usenet on june 25 2005141 no official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning usenet access except providing users the suggestion to access usenet services from a thirdparty google groups aol then provided communitybased message boards in lieu of usenet terms of service tosedit aol has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service known as the terms of service tos also known as conditions of service or cos in the uk it is separated into three different sections member agreement community guidelines and privacy policy142143 all three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the aol service during the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on terms of service violations there have been many complaints over rules that govern an aol users conduct some users disagree with the tos citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the tos may change without users being made aware a considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of usergenerated content during the earlier years of growth for aol144145146147 certified emailedit in early 2005 aol stated its intention to implement a certified email system called goodmail which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have preexisting business relationships with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by spam filters this decision drew fire from moveon which characterized the program as an email tax and the eff which characterized it as a shakedown of nonprofits148 a website called dearaolcom149 was launched with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to aols use of goodmail esther dyson defended the move in a new york times editorial saying i hope goodmail succeeds and that it has lots of competition i also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients instead of the fees going to goodmail and eon they will also be shared with the individual recipients150 tim lee of the technology liberation front151 posted an article that questioned the effs adopting a confrontational posture when dealing with private companies lees article cited a series of discussions152 on declan mccullaghs politechbot mailing list on this subject between the effs danny obrien and antispammer suresh ramasubramanian who has also compared153 the effs tactics in opposing goodmail to tactics used by republican political strategist karl rove spamassassin developer justin mason posted some criticism of the effs and moveons going overboard in their opposition to the scheme the dearaolcom campaign lost momentum and disappeared with the last post to the now defunct dearaolcom blog—aol starts the shakedown being made on may 9 2006 comcast who also used the service announced on its website that goodmail had ceased operations and as of february 4 2011 they no longer used the service154 search dataedit main article aol search data scandal on august 4 2006 aol released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing 20 million search keywords for over 650000 users over a 3month period between march 1 2006 and may 31 intended for research purposes aol pulled the file from public access by august 7 but not before its wide distribution on the internet by others derivative research titled a picture of search155 was published by authors pass chowdhury and torgeson for the first international conference on scalable information systems156 the data were used by websites such as aolstalker157 for entertainment purposes where users of aolstalker are encouraged to judge aol clients based on the humorousness of personal details revealed by search behavior user list exposureedit in 2003 jason smathers an aol employee was convicted of stealing america onlines 92 million screen names and selling them to a known spammer smathers pled guilty to conspiracy charges in 2005158159 smathers pled guilty to violations of the us canspam act of 2003160 he was sentenced in august 2005 to 15 months in prison the sentencing judge also recommended smathers be forced to pay 84000 in restitution triple the 28000 that he sold the addresses for161 aols computer checkup scarewareedit on february 27 2012 a class action lawsuit was filed against supportcom inc and partner aol inc the lawsuit alleged supportcom and aols computer checkup scareware which uses software developed by supportcom misrepresented that their software programs would identify and resolve a host of technical problems with computers offered to perform a free “scan” which often found problems with users computers the companies then offered to sell software—for which aol allegedly charged 499 a month and supportcom 29—to remedy those problems162 both aol inc and supportcom inc settled on may 30 2013 for 85 million this included 2500 to each valid class member and 100000 each to consumer watchdog and the electronic frontier foundation163 judge corley wrote “distributing a portion of the funds to consumer watchdog will meet the interests of the silent class members because the organization will use the funds to help protect consumers across the nation from being subject to the types of fraudulent and misleading conduct that is alleged here” and “eff’s mission includes a strong consumer protection component especially in regards to online protection”162 aol continues to market computer checkup164 it is not clear if this latest computer checkup continues to use scareware techniquescitation needed nsa prism programedit following media reports about prism nsas massive electronic surveillance program in june 2013 several technology companies were identified as participants including aol according to leaks of said program aol joined the prism program in 2011165 hosting of user profiles changed then discontinuededit at one time most aol users had an online profile hosted by the aol hometown service when aol hometown was discontinued users had to create a new profile on bebo this was an unsuccessful attempt to create a social network that would compete with facebook when the value of bebo decreased to a tiny fraction of the 850 million aol paid for it users were forced to recreate their profiles yet again on a new service called aol lifestream aol took the decision to shut down lifestream on 24 february 2017 and gave users one months notice to save off photos and videos that had been uploaded to lifestream166 following the shutdown aol no longer provides any option for hosting user profiles during the hometownbebolifestream era another users profile could be displayed by clicking the buddy info button in the aol desktop software after the shutdown of lifestream clicking buddy info does something that provides no information whatsoever
