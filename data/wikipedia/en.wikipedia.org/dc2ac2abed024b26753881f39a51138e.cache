codebreakers comprehensively chronicles the history of cryptography from ancient egypt to the time of its writing it is widely regarded as the best account of the history of cryptography up to its publication most of the editing german translating and insider contributions were from the american world war ii cryptographer bradford hardie iii william crowell the former deputy director of the national security agency was quoted in newsday as saying before he kahn came along the best you could do was buy an explanatory book that usually was too technical and terribly dull4 kahn then a newspaper journalist was contracted to write a book on cryptology in 1961 he began writing it parttime at one point quitting his regular job to work on it fulltime5 the book was to include information on the national security agency nsa and according to the author james bamford writing in 1982 the agency attempted to stop its publication and considered various options including publishing a negative review of kahns work in the press to discredit him6 a committee of the united states intelligence board concluded that the book was a possibly valuable support to foreign comsec communications security authorities and recommended further lowkey actions as possible but short of legal action to discourage mr kahn or his prospective publishers6 kahns publisher the macmillan company handed over the manuscript to the federal government for review without kahns permission on march 4 19666 kahn and macmillan eventually agreed to remove some material from the manuscript particularly concerning the relationship between the nsa and its british counterpart the gchq7 the codebreakers did not cover most of the history concerning the breaking of the german enigma machine which became public knowledge only in the 1970s nor did it cover the advent of strong cryptography in the public domain beginning with the invention of public key cryptography and the specification of the data encryption standard in the mid1970s the book was republished in 1996 and the new edition included an additional chapter briefly covering the events since the original publication8 the codebreakers was a finalist for the nonfiction pulitzer prize in 1968 later careeredit dr david kahn with a plaque from the national cryptologic museum foundation to commemorate his 80th birthday in
