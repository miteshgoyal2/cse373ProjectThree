november 1716 was a german polymath and philosopher who occupies a prominent place in the history of mathematics and the history of philosophy having developed differential and integral calculus independently of isaac newton10 leibnizs notation has been widely used ever since it was published it was only in the 20th century that his law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found mathematical implementation by means of nonstandard analysis he became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators while working on adding automatic multiplication and division to pascals calculator he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 168511 and invented the leibniz wheel used in the arithmometer the first massproduced mechanical calculator he also refined the binary number system which is the foundation of virtually all digital computers in philosophy leibniz is most noted for his optimism ie his conclusion that our universe is in a restricted sense the best possible one that god could have created an idea that was often lampooned by others such as voltaire leibniz along with rené descartes and baruch spinoza was one of the three great 17thcentury advocates of rationalism the work of leibniz anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence leibniz made major contributions to physics and technology and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in philosophy probability theory biology medicine geology psychology linguistics and computer science he wrote works on philosophy politics law ethics theology history and philology leibinz also contributed to the field of library science while serving as overseer of the wolfenbüttel library in germany he devised a cataloging system that would serve as a guide for many of europes largest libraries12 leibnizs contributions to this vast array of subjects were scattered in various learned journals in tens of thousands of letters and in unpublished manuscripts he wrote in several

1646 my son gottfried wilhelm is born into the world a quarter after six in the evening in aquarius1516 leibniz was baptized on 3 july of that year at st nicholas church leipzig his godfather was the lutheran theologian martin geier de17 his father died when he was six and a half years old and from that point on he was raised by his mother her teachings influenced leibnizs philosophical thoughts in his later lifecitation needed leibnizs father had been a professor of moral philosophy at the university of leipzig and the boy later inherited his fathers personal library he was given free access to it from the age of seven while leibnizs schoolwork was largely confined to the study of a small canon of authorities his fathers library enabled him to study a wide variety of advanced philosophical and theological works—ones that he would not have otherwise been able to read until his college years18 access to his fathers library largely written in latin also led to his proficiency in the latin language which he achieved by the age of 12 he also composed 300 hexameters of latin verse in a single morning for a special event at school at the age of 1319 in april 1661 he enrolled in his fathers former university at age 15120 and completed his bachelors degree in philosophy in december 1662 he defended his disputatio metaphysica de principio individui metaphysical disputation on the principle of individuation21 which addressed the principle of individuation on 9 june 1663 leibniz earned his masters degree in philosophy on 7 february 1664 he published and defended a dissertation specimen quaestionum philosophicarum ex jure collectarum an essay of collected philosophical problems of right21 arguing for both a theoretical and a pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law in december 1664 after one year of legal studies he was awarded his bachelors degree in law on 28 september 166522 his dissertation was titled de conditionibus on conditions21 in early 1666 at age 19 leibniz wrote his first book de arte combinatoria on the combinatorial art the first part of which was also his habilitation thesis in philosophy which he defended in march 16662123 his next goal was to earn his license and doctorate in law which normally required three years of study in 1666 the university of leipzig turned down leibnizs doctoral application and refused to grant him a doctorate in law most likely due to his relative youth2425 leibniz subsequently left leipzig26 leibniz then enrolled in the university of altdorf and quickly submitted a thesis which he had probably been working on earlier in leipzig27 the title of his thesis was disputatio inauguralis de casibus perplexis in jure inaugural disputation on ambiguous legal cases21 leibniz earned his license to practice law and his doctorate in law in november 1666 he next declined the offer of an academic appointment at altdorf saying that my thoughts were turned in an entirely different direction28 as an adult leibniz often introduced himself as gottfried von leibniz many posthumously published editions of his writings presented his name on the title page as freiherr g w von leibniz however no document has ever been found from any contemporary government that stated his appointment to any form of nobility29 1666–1676edit engraving of gottfried wilhelm leibniz leibnizs first position was as a salaried secretary to an alchemical society in nuremberg30 he knew fairly little about the subject at that time but presented himself as deeply learned he soon met johann christian von boyneburg 1622–1672 the dismissed chief minister of the elector of mainz johann philipp von schönborn31 von boyneburg hired leibniz as an assistant and shortly thereafter reconciled with the elector and introduced leibniz to him leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the elector in the hope of obtaining employment the stratagem worked the elector asked leibniz to assist with the redrafting of the legal code for the electorate32 in 1669 leibniz was appointed assessor in the court of appeal although von boyneburg died late in 1672 leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674citation needed von boyneburg did much to promote leibnizs reputation and the latters memoranda and letters began to attract favorable notice after leibnizs service to the elector there soon followed a diplomatic role he published an essay under the pseudonym of a fictitious polish nobleman arguing unsuccessfully for the german candidate for the polish crown the main force in european geopolitics during leibnizs adult life was the ambition of louis xiv of france backed by french military and economic might meanwhile the thirty years war had left germanspeaking europe exhausted fragmented and economically backward leibniz proposed to protect germanspeaking europe by distracting louis as follows france would be invited to take egypt as a stepping stone towards an eventual conquest of the dutch east indies in return france would agree to leave germany and the netherlands undisturbed this plan obtained the electors cautious support in 1672 the french government invited leibniz to paris for discussion33 but the plan was soon overtaken by the outbreak of the francodutch war and became irrelevant napoleons failed invasion of egypt in 1798 can be seen as an unwitting late implementation of leibnizs plan after the eastern hemisphere colonial supremacy in europe had already passed from the dutch to the britishcitation needed thus leibniz went to paris in 1672 soon after arriving he met dutch physicist and mathematician christiaan huygens and realised that his own knowledge of mathematics and physics was patchy with huygens as his mentor he began a program of selfstudy that soon pushed him to making major contributions to both subjects including discovering his version of the differential and integral calculus he met nicolas malebranche and antoine arnauld the leading french philosophers of the day and studied the writings of descartes and pascal unpublished as well as published he befriended a german mathematician ehrenfried walther von tschirnhaus they corresponded for the rest of their lives stepped reckoner when it became clear that france would not implement its part of leibnizs egyptian plan the elector sent his nephew escorted by leibniz on a related mission to the english government in london early in 167334 there leibniz came into acquaintance of henry oldenburg and john collins he met with the royal society where he demonstrated a calculating machine that he had designed and had been building since 1670 the machine was able to execute all four basic operations adding subtracting multiplying and dividing and the society quickly made him an external member the mission ended abruptly when news of the electors death 12 february 1673 reached them leibniz promptly returned to paris and not as had been planned to mainz35 the sudden deaths of his two patrons in the same winter meant that leibniz had to find a new basis for his career in this regard a 1669 invitation from the john frederick of brunswick to visit hanover proved to have been fateful leibniz had declined the invitation but had begun corresponding with the duke in 1671 in 1673 the duke offered leibniz the post of counsellor leibniz very reluctantly accepted the position two years later only after it became clear that no employment in paris whose intellectual stimulation he relished or with the habsburg imperial court was forthcomingcitation needed in 1675 he tried to get admitted to the french academy of sciences as a foreign honorary member but it was considered that there were already enough foreigners there and so no invitation came he left paris in october 1676 house of hanover 1676–1716edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed january 2014 learn how and when to remove this template message leibniz managed to delay his arrival in hanover until the end of 1676 after making one more short journey to london where newton accused him of having seen newtons unpublished work on calculus in advance36 this was alleged to be evidence supporting the accusation made decades later that he had stolen calculus from newton on the journey from london to hanover leibniz stopped in the hague where he met van leeuwenhoek the discoverer of microorganisms he also spent several days in intense discussion with spinoza who had just completed his masterwork the ethics37 in 1677 he was promoted at his request to privy counselor of justice a post he held for the rest of his life leibniz served three consecutive rulers of the house of brunswick as historian political adviser and most consequentially as librarian of the ducal library he thenceforth employed his pen on all the various political historical and theological matters involving the house of brunswick the resulting documents form a valuable part of the historical record for the period among the few people in north germany to accept leibniz were the electress sophia of hanover 1630–1714 her daughter sophia charlotte of hanover 1668–1705 the queen of prussia and his avowed disciple and caroline of ansbach the consort of her grandson the future george ii to each of these women he was correspondent adviser and friend in turn they all approved of leibniz more than did their spouses and the future king george i of great britain38 the population of hanover was only about 10000 and its provinciality eventually grated on leibniz nevertheless to be a major courtier to the house of brunswick was quite an honor especially in light of the meteoric rise in the prestige of that house during leibnizs association with it in 1692 the duke of brunswick became a hereditary elector of the holy roman empire the british act of settlement 1701 designated the electress sophia and her descent as the royal family of england once both king william iii and his sisterinlaw and successor queen anne were dead leibniz played a role in the initiatives and negotiations leading up to that act but not always an effective one for example something he published anonymously in england thinking to promote the brunswick cause was formally censured by the british parliament the brunswicks tolerated the enormous effort leibniz devoted to intellectual pursuits unrelated to his duties as a courtier pursuits such as perfecting calculus writing about other mathematics logic physics and philosophy and keeping up a vast correspondence he began working on calculus in 1674 the earliest evidence of its use in his surviving notebooks is 1675 by 1677 he had a coherent system in hand but did not publish it until 1684 leibnizs most important mathematical papers were published between 1682 and 1692 usually in a journal which he and otto mencke founded in 1682 the acta eruditorum that journal played a key role in advancing his mathematical and scientific reputation which in turn enhanced his eminence in diplomacy history theology and philosophy leibnizs correspondence papers and notes from 1669 to 1704 national library of poland the elector ernest augustus commissioned leibniz to write a history of the house of brunswick going back to the time of charlemagne or earlier hoping that the resulting book would advance his dynastic ambitions from 1687 to 1690 leibniz traveled extensively in germany austria and italy seeking and finding archival materials bearing on this project decades went by but no history appeared the next elector became quite annoyed at leibnizs apparent dilatoriness leibniz never finished the project in part because of his huge output on many other fronts but also because he insisted on writing a meticulously researched and erudite book based on archival sources when his patrons would have been quite happy with a short popular book one perhaps little more than a genealogy with commentary to be completed in three years or less they never knew that he had in fact carried out a fair part of his assigned task when the material leibniz had written and collected for his history of the house of brunswick was finally published in the 19th century it filled three volumes in 1708 john keill writing in the journal of the royal society and with newtons presumed blessing accused leibniz of having plagiarised newtons calculus39 thus began the calculus priority dispute which darkened the remainder of leibnizs life a formal investigation by the royal society in which newton was an unacknowledged participant undertaken in response to leibnizs demand for a retraction upheld keills charge historians of mathematics writing since 1900 or so have tended to acquit leibniz pointing to important differences between leibnizs and newtons versions of calculus in 1711 while traveling in northern europe the russian tsar peter the great stopped in hanover and met leibniz who then took some interest in russian matters for the rest of his life in 1712 leibniz began a twoyear residence in vienna where he was appointed imperial court councillor to the habsburgs on the death of queen anne in 1714 elector george louis became king george i of great britain under the terms of the 1701 act of settlement even though leibniz had done much to bring about this happy event it was not to be his hour of glory despite the intercession of the princess of wales caroline of ansbach george i forbade leibniz to join him in london until he completed at least one volume of the history of the brunswick family his father had commissioned nearly 30 years earlier moreover for george i to include leibniz in his london court would have been deemed insulting to newton who was seen as having won the calculus priority dispute and whose standing in british official circles could not have been higher finally his dear friend and defender the dowager electress sophia died in 1714 deathedit leibniz died in hanover in 1716 at the time he was so out of favor that neither george i who happened to be near hanover at that time nor any fellow courtier other than his personal secretary attended the funeral even though leibniz was a life member of the royal society and the berlin academy of sciences neither organization saw fit to honor his passing his grave went unmarked for more than 50 years leibniz was eulogized by fontenelle before the french academy of sciences in paris which had admitted him as a foreign member in 1700 the eulogy was composed at the behest of the duchess of orleans a niece of the electress sophia personal lifeedit leibniz never married he complained on occasion about money but the fair sum he left to his sole heir his sisters stepson proved that the brunswicks had by and large paid him well in his diplomatic endeavors he at times verged on the unscrupulous as was all too often the case with professional diplomats of his day on several occasions leibniz backdated and altered personal manuscripts actions which put him in a bad light during the calculus controversy on the other hand he was charming wellmannered and not without humor and imagination40 he had many friends and admirers all over europe on leibnizs religious views though he was a protestant leibniz learned to appreciate the good sides of catholicism through his patrons and colleagues he never admitted the protestant view of pope as an antichrist41 leibniz was claimed as a philosophical theist42434445 philosopheredit leibnizs philosophical thinking appears fragmented because his philosophical writings consist mainly of a multitude of short pieces journal articles manuscripts published long after his death and many letters to many correspondents he wrote only two booklength philosophical treatises of which only the théodicée of 1710 was published in his lifetime leibniz dated his beginning as a philosopher to his discourse on metaphysics which he composed in 1686 as a commentary on a running dispute between nicolas malebranche and antoine arnauld this led to an extensive and valuable correspondence with arnauld46 it and the discourse were not published until the 19th century in 1695 leibniz made his public entrée into european philosophy with a journal article titled new system of the nature and communication of substances47 between 1695 and 1705 he composed his new essays on human understanding a lengthy commentary on john lockes 1690 an essay concerning human understanding but upon learning of lockes 1704 death lost the desire to publish it so that the new essays were not published until 1765 the monadologie composed in 1714 and published posthumously consists of 90 aphorisms leibniz met spinoza in 1676 read some of his unpublished writings and has since been suspected of appropriating some of spinozas ideas while leibniz admired spinozas powerful intellect he was also forthrightly dismayed by spinozas conclusions48 especially when these were inconsistent with christian orthodoxy unlike descartes and spinoza leibniz had a thorough university education in philosophy he was influenced by his leipzig professor jakob thomasius who also supervised his ba thesis in philosophy3 leibniz also eagerly read francisco suárez a spanish jesuit respected even in lutheran universities leibniz was deeply interested in the new methods and conclusions of descartes huygens newton and boyle but viewed their work through a lens heavily tinted by scholastic notions yet it remains the case that leibnizs methods and concerns often anticipate the logic and analytic and linguistic philosophy of the 20th century the principlesedit leibniz variously invoked one or another of seven fundamental philosophical principles49 identitycontradiction if a proposition is true then its negation is false and vice versa identity of indiscernibles two distinct things cannot have all their properties in common if every predicate possessed by x is also possessed by y and vice versa then entities x and y are identical to suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing under two names frequently invoked in modern logic and philosophy the identity of indiscernibles is often referred to as leibnizs law it has attracted the most controversy and criticism especially from corpuscular philosophy and quantum mechanics sufficient reason there must be a sufficient reason for anything to exist for any event to occur for any truth to obtain50 preestablished harmony51 the appropriate nature of each substance brings it about that what happens to one corresponds to what happens to all the others without however their acting upon one another directly discourse on metaphysics xiv a dropped glass shatters because it knows it has hit the ground and not because the impact with the ground compels the glass to split law of continuity natura non facit saltus52 literally nature does not make jumps optimism god assuredly always chooses the best53 plenitude leibniz believed that the best of all possible worlds would actualize every genuine possibility and argued in théodicée that this best of all possible worlds will contain all possibilities with our finite experience of eternity giving no reason to dispute natures perfection54 leibniz would on occasion give a rational defense of a specific principle but more often took them for granted55 the monadsedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march 2017 learn how and when to remove this template message leibnizs best known contribution to metaphysics is his theory of monads as exposited in monadologie according to leibniz monads are elementary particles with blurred perceptions of one another monads can also be compared to the corpuscles of the mechanical philosophy of rené descartes and others monads are the ultimate elements of the universe the monads are substantial forms of being with the following properties they are eternal indecomposable individual subject to their own laws uninteracting and each reflecting the entire universe in a preestablished harmony a historically important example of panpsychism monads are centers of force substance is force while space matter and motion are merely phenomenal the ontological essence of a monad is its irreducible simplicity unlike atoms monads possess no material or spatial character they also differ from atoms by their complete mutual independence so that interactions among monads are only apparent instead by virtue of the principle of preestablished harmony each monad follows a preprogrammed set of instructions peculiar to itself so that a monad knows what to do at each moment by virtue of these intrinsic instructions each monad is like a little mirror of the universe monads need not be small eg each human being constitutes a monad in which case free will is problematic monads are purported to have gotten rid of the problematic interaction between mind and matter arising in the system of descartes lack of individuation inherent to the system of spinoza which represents individual creatures as merely accidental theodicy and optimismedit further information best of all possible worlds and philosophical optimism the theodicy56 tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is optimal among all possible worlds it must be the best possible and most balanced world because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing god who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist in effect apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world because otherwise god would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws leibniz asserted that the truths of theology religion and philosophy cannot contradict each other since reason and faith are both gifts of god so that their conflict would imply god contending against himself the theodicy is leibnizs attempt to reconcile his personal philosophical system with his interpretation of the tenets of christianity57 this project was motivated in part by leibnizs belief shared by many conservative philosophers and theologians during the enlightenment in the rational and enlightened nature of the christian religion as compared to its purportedly less advanced nonwestern counterparts it was also shaped by leibnizs belief in the perfectibility of human nature if humanity relied on correct philosophy and religion as a guide and by his belief that metaphysical necessity must have a rational or logical foundation even if this metaphysical causality seemed inexplicable in terms of physical necessity the natural laws identified by science because reason and faith must be entirely reconciled any tenet of faith which could not be defended by reason must be rejected leibniz then approached one of the central criticisms of christian theism58 if god is all good all wise and all powerful how did evil come into the world the answer according to leibniz is that while god is indeed unlimited in wisdom and power his human creations as creations are limited both in their wisdom and in their will power to act this predisposes humans to false beliefs wrong decisions and ineffective actions in the exercise of their free will god does not arbitrarily inflict pain and suffering on humans rather he permits both moral evil sin and physical evil pain and suffering as the necessary consequences of metaphysical evil imperfection as a means by which humans can identify and correct their erroneous decisions and as a contrast to true good further although human actions flow from prior causes that ultimately arise in god and therefore are known as a metaphysical certainty to god an individuals free will is exercised within natural laws where choices are merely contingently necessary to be decided in the event by a wonderful spontaneity that provides individuals an escape from rigorous predestination discourse on metaphysicsedit for leibniz god is an absolutely perfect being he describes this perfection later in section vi as the simplest form of something with the most substantial outcome vi along these lines he declares that every type of perfection pertains to him god in the highest degree i even though his types of perfections are not specifically drawn out leibniz highlights the one thing that to him does certify imperfections and proves that god is perfect that one acts imperfectly if he acts with less perfection than he is capable of and since god is a perfect being he cannot act imperfectly iii because god cannot act imperfectly the decisions he makes pertaining to the world must be perfect leibniz also comforts readers stating that because he has done everything to the most perfect degree those who love him cannot be injured however to love god is a subject of difficulty as leibniz believes that we are not disposed to wish for that which god desires because we have the ability to alter our disposition iv in accordance with this many act as rebels but leibniz says that the only way we can truly love god is by being content with all that comes to us according to his will iv because god is an absolutely perfect being i leibniz argues that god would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection than what he is able of iii his syllogism then ends with the statement that god has made the world perfectly in all ways this also effects how we should view god and his will leibniz states that in lieu of god’s will we have to understand that god is the best of all masters and he will know when his good succeeds so we therefore must act in conformity to his good will – or as much of it as we understand iv in our view of god leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker lest we mar the glory and love god in doing so instead we must admire the maker for the work he has done ii effectively leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of god and not good according to some standards of goodness then how can we praise god for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition ii leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of god but must follow from his understanding59 fundamental question of metaphysicsedit leibniz wrote why is there something rather than nothing the sufficient reason is found in a substance which is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself60 martin heidegger called this question the fundamental question of metaphysics6162 symbolic thoughtedit leibniz believed that much of human reasoning could be reduced to calculations of a sort and that such calculations could resolve many differences of opinion the only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as those of the mathematicians so that we can find our error at a glance and when there are disputes among persons we can simply say let us calculate calculemus without further ado to see who is right63 leibnizs calculus ratiocinator which resembles symbolic logic can be viewed as a way of making such calculations feasible leibniz wrote memoranda64 that can now be read as groping attempts to get symbolic logic—and thus his calculus—off the ground these writings remained unpublished until the appearance of a selection edited by ci gerhardt 1859 l couturat published a selection in 1901 by this time the main developments of modern logic had been created by charles sanders peirce and by gottlob frege leibniz thought symbols were important for human understanding he attached so much importance to the development of good notations that he attributed all his discoveries in mathematics to this his notation for calculus is an example of his skill in this regard peirce a 19thcentury pioneer of semiotics shared leibnizs passion for symbols and notation and his belief that these are essential to a wellrunning logic and mathematics but leibniz took his speculations much further defining a character as any written sign he then defined a real character as one that represents an idea directly and not simply as the word embodying the idea some real characters such as the notation of logic serve only to facilitate reasoning many characters well known in his day including egyptian hieroglyphics chinese characters and the symbols of astronomy and chemistry he deemed not real65 instead he proposed the creation of a characteristica universalis or universal characteristic built on an alphabet of human thought in which each fundamental concept would be represented by a unique real character it is obvious that if we could find characters or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines we could do in all matters insofar as they are subject to reasoning all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry for all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus66 complex thoughts would be represented by combining characters for simpler thoughts leibniz saw that the uniqueness of prime factorization suggests a central role for prime numbers in the universal characteristic a striking anticipation of gödel numbering granted there is no intuitive or mnemonic way to number any set of elementary concepts using the prime numbers leibnizs idea of reasoning through a universal language of symbols and calculations however remarkably foreshadows great 20th century developments in formal systems such as turing completeness where computation was used to define equivalent universal languages see turing degree because leibniz was a mathematical novice when he first wrote about the characteristic at first he did not conceive it as an algebra but rather as a universal language or script only in 1676 did he conceive of a kind of algebra of thought modeled on and including conventional algebra and its notation the resulting characteristic included a logical calculus some combinatorics algebra his analysis situs geometry of situation a universal concept language and more what leibniz actually intended by his characteristica universalis and calculus ratiocinator and the extent to which modern formal logic does justice to calculus may never be established67 formal logicedit main article algebraic logic leibniz is one of the most important logicians between aristotle and 1847 when george boole and augustus de morgan each published books that began modern formal logic leibniz enunciated the principal properties of what we now call conjunction disjunction negation identity set inclusion and the empty set the principles of leibnizs logic and arguably of his whole philosophy reduce to two all our ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas which form the alphabet of human thought complex ideas proceed from these simple ideas by a uniform and symmetrical combination analogous to arithmetical multiplication the formal logic that emerged early in the 20th century also requires at minimum unary negation and quantified variables ranging over some universe of discourse leibniz published nothing on formal logic in his lifetime most of what he wrote on the subject consists of working drafts in his book history of western philosophy bertrand russell went so far as to claim that leibniz had developed logic in his unpublished writings to a level which was reached only 200 years later mathematicianedit although the mathematical notion of function was implicit in trigonometric and logarithmic tables which existed in his day leibniz was the first in 1692 and 1694 to employ it explicitly to denote any of several geometric concepts derived from a curve such as abscissa ordinate tangent chord and the perpendicular68 in the 18th century function lost these geometrical associations leibniz was the first to see that the coefficients of a system of linear equations could be arranged into an array now called a matrix which can be manipulated to find the solution of the system if any this method was later called gaussian elimination leibnizs discoveries of boolean algebra and of symbolic logic also relevant to mathematics are discussed in the preceding section the best overview of leibnizs writings on calculus may be found in bos 197469 calculusedit leibniz is credited along with sir isaac newton with the discovery of calculus differential and integral calculus according to leibnizs notebooks a critical breakthrough occurred on 11 november 1675 when he employed integral calculus for the first time to find the area under the graph of a function y fx70 he introduced several notations used to this day for instance the integral sign ∫ representing an elongated s from the latin word summa and the d used for differentials from the latin word differentia this cleverly suggestive notation for calculus is probably his most enduring mathematical legacy leibniz did not publish anything about his calculus until 168471 leibniz expressed the inverse relation of integration and differentiation later called the fundamental theorem of calculus by means of a figure72 in his 1693 paper supplementum geometriae dimensoriae73 however james gregory is credited for the theorems discovery in geometric form isaac barrow proved a more generalized geometric version and newton developed supporting theory the concept became more transparent as developed through leibnizs formalism and new notation74 the product rule of differential calculus is still called leibnizs law in addition the theorem that tells how and when to differentiate under the integral sign is called the leibniz integral rule leibniz exploited infinitesimals in developing calculus manipulating them in ways suggesting that they had paradoxical algebraic properties george berkeley in a tract called the analyst and also in de motu criticized these a recent study argues that leibnizian calculus was free of contradictions and was better grounded than berkeleys empiricist criticisms75 from 1711 until his death leibniz was engaged in a dispute with john keill newton and others over whether leibniz had invented calculus independently of newton this subject is treated at length in the article leibniz–newton calculus controversy the use of infinitesimals in mathematics was frowned upon by followers of karl weierstrasscitation needed but survived in science and engineering and even in rigorous mathematics via the fundamental computational device known as the differential beginning in 1960 abraham robinson worked out a rigorous foundation for leibnizs infinitesimals using model theory in the context of a field of hyperreal numbers the resulting nonstandard analysis can be seen as a belated vindication of leibnizs mathematical reasoning robinsons transfer principle is a mathematical implementation of leibnizs heuristic law of continuity while the standard part function implements the leibnizian transcendental law of homogeneity topologyedit leibniz was the first to use the term analysis situs76 later used in the 19th century to refer to what is now known as topology there are two takes on this situation on the one hand mates citing a 1954 paper in german by jacob freudenthal argues although for leibniz the situs of a sequence of points is completely determined by the distance between them and is altered if those distances are altered his admirer euler in the famous 1736 paper solving the königsberg bridge problem and its generalizations used the term geometria situs in such a sense that the situs remains unchanged under topological deformations he mistakenly credits leibniz with originating this concept it is sometimes not realized that leibniz used the term in an entirely different sense and hence can hardly be considered the founder of that part of mathematics77 but hideaki hirano argues differently quoting mandelbrot78 to sample leibniz scientific works is a sobering experience next to calculus and to other thoughts that have been carried out to completion the number and variety of premonitory thrusts is overwhelming we saw examples in packing  my leibniz mania is further reinforced by finding that for one moment its hero attached importance to geometric scaling in euclidis prota  which is an attempt to tighten euclids axioms he states  i have diverse definitions for the straight line the straight line is a curve any part of which is similar to the whole and it alone has this property not only among curves but among sets this claim can be proved today79 thus the fractal geometry promoted by mandelbrot drew on leibnizs notions of selfsimilarity and the principle of continuity natura non facit saltus52 we also see that when leibniz wrote in a metaphysical vein that the straight line is a curve any part of which is similar to the whole he was anticipating topology by more than two centuries as for packing leibniz told his friend and correspondent des bosses to imagine a circle then to inscribe within it three congruent circles with maximum radius the latter smaller circles could be filled with three even smaller circles by the same procedure this process can be continued infinitely from which arises a good idea of selfsimilarity leibnizs improvement of euclids axiom contains the same concept scientist and engineeredit leibnizs writings are currently discussed not only for their anticipations and possible discoveries not yet recognized but as ways of advancing present knowledge much of his writing on physics is included in gerhardts mathematical writings physicsedit see also dynamism metaphysics and conatus § in leibniz leibniz contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him often disagreeing with descartes and newton he devised a new theory of motion dynamics based on kinetic energy and potential energy which posited space as relative whereas newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute an important example of leibnizs mature physical thinking is his specimen dynamicum of 169580 until the discovery of subatomic particles and the quantum mechanics governing them many of leibnizs speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense for instance he anticipated albert einstein by arguing against newton that space time and motion are relative not absolute as for my own opinion i have said more than once that i hold space to be something merely relative as time is that i hold it to be an order of coexistences as time is an order of successions81 leibniz held a relationist notion of space and time against newtons substantivalist views828384 according to newtons substantivalism space and time are entities in their own right existing independently of things leibnizs relationism on the other hand describes space and time as systems of relations that exist between objects the rise of general relativity and subsequent work in the history of physics has put leibnizs stance in a more favorable light one of leibnizs projects was to recast newtons theory as a vortex theory85 however his project went beyond vortex theory since at its heart there was an attempt to explain one of the most difficult problems in physics that of the origin of the cohesion of matter85 the principle of sufficient reason has been invoked in recent cosmology and his identity of indiscernibles in quantum mechanics a field some even credit him with having anticipated in some sense those who advocate digital philosophy a recent direction in cosmology claim leibniz as a precursor in addition to his theories about the nature of reality leibnizs contributions to the development of calculus have also had a major impact on physics the vis vivaedit leibnizs vis viva latin for living force is mv2 twice the modern kinetic energy he realized that the total energy would be conserved in certain mechanical systems so he considered it an innate motive characteristic of matter86 here too his thinking gave rise to another regrettable nationalistic dispute his vis viva was seen as rivaling the conservation of momentum championed by newton in england and by descartes in france hence academics in those countries tended to neglect leibnizs idea in reality both energy and momentum are conserved so the two approaches are equally valid other natural scienceedit by proposing that the earth has a molten core he anticipated modern geology in embryology he was a preformationist but also proposed that organisms are the outcome of a combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers in the life sciences and paleontology he revealed an amazing transformist intuition fueled by his study of comparative anatomy and fossils one of his principal works on this subject protogaea unpublished in his lifetime has recently been published in english for the first time he worked out a primal organismic theory87 in medicine he exhorted the physicians of his time—with some results—to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view psychologyedit psychology had been a central interest of leibniz8889 he appears to be an underappreciated pioneer of psychology 90 he wrote on topics which are now regarded as fields of psychology attention and consciousness memory learning association motivation the act of striving emergent individuality the general dynamics of development evolution his discussions in the new essays and monadology often rely on everyday observations such as the behaviour of a dog or the noise of the sea and he develops intuitive analogies the synchronous running of clocks or the balance spring of a clock he also devised postulates and principles that apply to psychology the continuum of the unnoticed petite perceptions to the distinct selfaware apperception and psychophysical parallelism from the point of view of causality and of purpose “souls act according to the laws of final causes through aspirations ends and means bodies act according to the laws of efficient causes ie the laws of motion and these two realms that of efficient causes and that of final causes harmonize with one another” 91 this idea refers to the mindbody problem stating that the mind and brain do not act upon each other but act alongside each other separately but in harmony92 leibniz however did not use the term psychologia93 leibniz’ epistemological position – against john locke and english empiricism sensualism – was made clear “nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu nisi intellectu ipse” – “nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses except the intellect itself” 94 principles that are not present in sensory impressions can be recognised in human perception and consciousness logical inferences categories of thought the principle of causality and the principle of purpose teleology leibniz found his most important interpreter in wilhelm wundt founder of psychology as a discipline wundt used the … nisi intellectu ipse quotation 1862 on the title page of his beiträge zur theorie der sinneswahrnehmung contributions on the theory of sensory perception and published a detailed and aspiring monograph on leibniz95 wundt shaped the term apperception introduced by leibniz into an experimental psychologically based apperception psychology that included neuropsychological modelling – an excellent example of how a concept created by a great philosopher could stimulate a psychological research program one principle in the thinking of leibniz played a fundamental role “the principle of equality of separate but corresponding viewpoints” wundt characterized this style of thought perspectivism in a way that also applied for him – viewpoints that supplement one another while also being able to appear as opposites that only resolve themselves when considered more deeply9697 much of leibnizs work went on to have a great impact on the field of psychology98 leibniz thought that there are many petites perceptions or small perceptions of which we perceive but of which we are unaware he believed that by the principle that phenomena found in nature were continuous by default it was likely that the transition between conscious and unconscious states had intermediary steps99 for this to be true there must also be a portion of the mind of which we are unaware at any given time his theory regarding consciousness in relation to the principle of continuity can be seen as an early theory regarding the stages of sleep in this way leibnizs theory of perception can be viewed as one of many theories leading up to the idea of the unconscious leibniz was a direct influence on ernst platner who is credited with originally coining the term unbewußtseyn unconscious100 additionally the idea of subliminal stimuli can be traced back to his theory of small perceptions101 leibnizs ideas regarding music and tonal perception went on to influence the laboratory studies of wilhelm wundt102 social scienceedit in public health he advocated establishing a medical administrative authority with powers over epidemiology and veterinary medicine he worked to set up a coherent medical training program oriented towards public health and preventive measures in economic policy he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program and discussed the balance of trade he even proposed something akin to what much later emerged as game theory in sociology he laid the ground for communication theory technologyedit in 1906 garland published a volume of leibnizs writings bearing on his many practical inventions and engineering work to date few of these writings have been translated into english nevertheless it is well understood that leibniz was a serious inventor engineer and applied scientist with great respect for practical life following the motto theoria cum praxi he urged that theory be combined with practical application and thus has been claimed as the father of applied science he designed winddriven propellers and water pumps mining machines to extract ore hydraulic presses lamps submarines clocks etc with denis papin he invented a steam engine he even proposed a method for desalinating water from 1680 to 1685 he struggled to overcome the chronic flooding that afflicted the ducal silver mines in the harz mountains but did not succeed103 computationedit leibniz may have been the first computer scientist and information theorist104 early in life he documented the binary numeral system base 2 then revisited that system throughout his career105 he anticipated lagrangian interpolation and algorithmic information theory his calculus ratiocinator anticipated aspects of the universal turing machine in 1961 norbert wiener suggested that leibniz should be considered the patron saint of cybernetics106 in 1671 leibniz began to invent a machine that could execute all four arithmetic operations gradually improving it over a number of years this stepped reckoner attracted fair attention and was the basis of his election to the royal society in 1673 a number of such machines were made during his years in hanover by a craftsman working under his supervision they were not an unambiguous success because they did not fully mechanize the carry operation couturat reported finding an unpublished note by leibniz dated 1674 describing a machine capable of performing some algebraic operations107 leibniz also devised a now reproduced cipher machine recovered by nicholas rescher in 2010108 in 1693 leibniz described a design of a machine which could in theory integrate differential equations which he called integraph109 leibniz was groping towards hardware and software concepts worked out much later by charles babbage and ada lovelace in 1679 while mulling over his binary arithmetic leibniz imagined a machine in which binary numbers were represented by marbles governed by a rudimentary sort of punched cards110 modern electronic digital computers replace leibnizs marbles moving by gravity with shift registers voltage gradients and pulses of electrons but otherwise they run roughly as leibniz envisioned in 1679 librarianedit later in leibniz’s career after the death of von boinburg leibniz moved to paris and accepted a position as a librarian in the hanoverian court of johann friedrich duke of brunswickluneburg leibniz’s predecessor tobias fleischer had already created a cataloging system for the duke’s library but it was a clumsy attempt at this library leibniz focused more on advancing the library than on the cataloging for instance within a month of taking the new position he developed a comprehensive plan to expand the library he was one of the first to consider developing a core collection for a library and felt “that a library for display and ostentation is a luxury and indeed superfluous but a wellstocked and organized library is important and useful for all areas of human endeavor and is to be regarded on the same level as schools and churches”111 unfortunately leibniz lacked the funds to develop the library in this manner after working at this library by the end of 1690 leibnez was appointed as privycouncilor and librarian of the bibliotheca augusta at wolfenbuettel it was an extensive library with at least 25946 printed volumes111 at this library leibniz sought to improve the catalog he was not allowed to make complete changes to the existing closed catalog but was allowed to improve upon it so he started on that task immediately he created an alphabetical author catalog and had also created other cataloging methods that were not implemented while serving as librarian of the ducal libraries in hanover and wolfenbuettel leibniz effectively became one of the founders of library science he also designed a book indexing system in ignorance of the only other such system then extant that of the bodleian library at oxford university he also called on publishers to distribute abstracts of all new titles they produced each year in a standard form that would facilitate indexing he hoped that this abstracting project would eventually include everything printed from his day back to gutenberg neither proposal met with success at the time but something like them became standard practice among english language publishers during the 20th century under the aegis of the library of congress and the british library he called for the creation of an empirical database as a way to further all sciences his characteristica universalis calculus ratiocinator and a community of minds—intended among other things to bring political and religious unity to europe—can be seen as distant unwitting anticipations of artificial languages eg esperanto and its rivals symbolic logic even the world wide web advocate of scientific societiesedit leibniz emphasized that research was a collaborative endeavor hence he warmly advocated the formation of national scientific societies along the lines of the british royal society and the french academie royale des sciences more specifically in his correspondence and travels he urged the creation of such societies in dresden saint petersburg vienna and berlin only one such project came to fruition in 1700 the berlin academy of sciences was created leibniz drew up its first statutes and served as its first president for the remainder of his life that academy evolved into the german academy of sciences the publisher of the ongoing critical edition of his works112 lawyer and moralistedit with the possible exception of marcus aurelius no philosopher has ever had as much experience with practical affairs of state as leibniz leibnizs writings on law ethics and politics113 were long overlooked by englishspeaking scholars but this has changed of late114 while leibniz was no apologist for absolute monarchy like hobbes or for tyranny in any form neither did he echo the political and constitutional views of his contemporary john locke views invoked in support of democracy in 18thcentury america and later elsewhere the following excerpt from a 1695 letter to baron j c boyneburgs son philipp is very revealing of leibnizs political sentiments as for  the great question of the power of sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them i usually say that it would be good for princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them and for the people on the other hand to be persuaded to obey them passively i am however quite of the opinion of grotius that one ought to obey as a rule the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it yet i recognize that a prince can go to such excess and place the wellbeing of the state in such danger that the obligation to endure ceases this is most rare however and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency115 in 1677 leibniz called for a european confederation governed by a council or senate whose members would represent entire nations and would be free to vote their consciences116 this is sometimes considered an anticipation of the european union he believed that europe would adopt a uniform religion he reiterated these proposals in 1715 but at the same time he arrived to propose an interreligious and multicultural project to create a universal system of justice which required from him a broad interdisciplinary perspective in order to propose it he combined linguistics especially sinology moral and law philosophy management economics and politics117 ecumenismedit leibniz devoted considerable intellectual and diplomatic effort to what would now be called ecumenical endeavor seeking to reconcile first the roman catholic and lutheran churches and later the lutheran and reformed churches in this respect he followed the example of his early patrons baron von boyneburg and the duke john frederick—both cradle lutherans who converted to catholicism as adults—who did what they could to encourage the reunion of the two faiths and who warmly welcomed such endeavors by others the house of brunswick remained lutheran because the dukes children did not follow their father these efforts included corresponding with the french bishop jacquesbénigne bossuet and involved leibniz in some theological controversy he evidently thought that the thoroughgoing application of reason would suffice to heal the breach caused by the reformation philologistedit leibniz the philologist was an avid student of languages eagerly latching on to any information about vocabulary and grammar that came his way he refuted the belief widely held by christian scholars in his day that hebrew was the primeval language of the human race he also refuted the argument advanced by swedish scholars in his day that a form of protoswedish was the ancestor of the germanic languages he puzzled over the origins of the slavic languages was aware of the existence of sanskrit and was fascinated by classical chinese he published the princeps editio first modern edition of the late medieval chronicon holtzatiae a latin chronicle of the county of holstein sinophileedit a diagram of i ching hexagrams sent to leibniz from joachim bouvet the arabic numerals were added by leibniz118 leibniz was perhaps the first major european intellectual to take a close interest in chinese civilization which he knew by corresponding with and reading other works by european christian missionaries posted in china having read confucius sinarum philosophus on the first year of its publication119 he concluded that europeans could learn much from the confucian ethical tradition he mulled over the possibility that the chinese characters were an unwitting form of his universal characteristic he noted with fascination how the i ching hexagrams correspond to the binary numbers from 000000 to 111111 and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired120 leibnizs attraction to chinese philosophy originates from his perception that chinese philosophy was similar to his own119 the historian er hughes suggests that leibnizs ideas of simple substance and preestablished harmony were directly influenced by confucianism pointing to the fact that they were conceived during the period that he was reading confucius sinarum philosophus119 as polymathedit while making his grand tour of european archives to research the brunswick family history that he never completed leibniz stopped in vienna between may 1688 and february 1689 where he did much legal and diplomatic work for the brunswicks he visited mines talked with mine engineers and tried to negotiate export contracts for lead from the ducal mines in the harz mountains his proposal that the streets of vienna be lit with lamps burning rapeseed oil was implemented during a formal audience with the austrian emperor and in subsequent memoranda he advocated reorganizing the austrian economy reforming the coinage of much of central europe negotiating a concordat between the habsburgs and the vatican and creating an imperial research library official archive and public insurance fund he wrote and published an important paper on mechanics leibniz also wrote a short paper primae veritates first published by louis couturat in 1903 pp 518–523121 summarizing his views on metaphysics the paper is undated that he wrote it while in vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999 when the ongoing critical edition finally published leibnizs philosophical writings for the period 1677–90122 couturats reading of this paper was the launching point for much 20thcentury thinking about leibniz especially among analytic philosophers but after a meticulous study of all of leibnizs philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—mercer 2001 begged to differ with couturats reading the jury is still out posthumous reputationedit when leibniz died his reputation was in decline he was remembered for only one book the théodicée123 whose supposed central argument voltaire lampooned in his popular book candide which concludes with the character candide saying non liquet it is not clear a term that was applied during the roman republic to a legal verdict of not proven voltaires depiction of leibnizs ideas was so influential that many believed it to be an accurate description thus voltaire and his candide bear some of the blame for the lingering failure to appreciate and understand leibnizs ideas leibniz had an ardent disciple christian wolff whose dogmatic and facile outlook did leibnizs reputation much harm he also influenced david hume who read his théodicée and used some of his ideas124 in any event philosophical fashion was moving away from the rationalism and system building of the 17th century of which leibniz had been such an ardent proponent his work on law diplomacy and history was seen as of ephemeral interest the vastness and richness of his correspondence went unrecognized much of europe came to doubt that leibniz had discovered calculus independently of newton and hence his whole work in mathematics and physics was neglected voltaire an admirer of newton also wrote candide at least in part to discredit leibnizs claim to having discovered calculus and leibnizs charge that newtons theory of universal gravitation was incorrectcitation needed leibnizs long march to his present glory began with the 1765 publication of the nouveaux essais which kant read closely in 1768 louis dutens edited the first multivolume edition of leibnizs writings followed in the 19th century by a number of editions including those edited by erdmann foucher de careil gerhardt gerland klopp and mollat publication of leibnizs correspondence with notables such as antoine arnauld samuel clarke sophia of hanover and her daughter sophia charlotte of hanover began in 1900 bertrand russell published a critical study of leibnizs metaphysics125 shortly thereafter louis couturat published an important study of leibniz and edited a volume of leibnizs heretofore unpublished writings mainly on logic they made leibniz somewhat respectable among 20thcentury analytical and linguistic philosophers in the englishspeaking world leibniz had already been of great influence to many germans such as bernhard riemann for example leibnizs phrase salva veritate meaning interchangeability without loss of or compromising the truth recurs in willard quines writings nevertheless the secondary literature on leibniz did not really blossom until after world war ii this is especially true of english speaking countries in gregory browns bibliography fewer than 30 of the english language entries were published before 1946 american leibniz studies owe much to leroy loemker 1904–1985 through his translations and his interpretive essays in leclerc 1973 nicholas jolley has surmised that leibnizs reputation as a philosopher is now perhaps higher than at any time since he was alive126 analytic and contemporary philosophy continue to invoke his notions of identity individuation and possible worlds work in the history of 17th and 18thcentury ideas has revealed more clearly the 17thcentury intellectual revolution that preceded the betterknown industrial and commercial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries in 1985 the german government created the leibniz prize offering an annual award of 155 million euros for experimental results and 770000 euros for theoretical ones it was the worlds largest prize for scientific achievement prior to the fundamental physics prize the collection of manuscript papers of leibniz at the gottfried wilhelm leibniz bibliothek – niedersächische landesbibliothek were inscribed on unescos memory of the world register in 2007127 writings and editionedit leibniz mainly wrote in three languages scholastic latin french and german during his lifetime he published many pamphlets and scholarly articles but only two philosophical books the combinatorial art and the théodicée he published numerous pamphlets often anonymous on behalf of the house of brunswicklüneburg most notably the de jure suprematum a major consideration of the nature of sovereignty one substantial book appeared posthumously his nouveaux essais sur lentendement humain which leibniz had withheld from publication after the death of john locke only in 1895 when bodemann completed his catalogue of leibnizs manuscripts and correspondence did the enormous extent of leibnizs nachlass become clear about 15000 letters to more than 1000 recipients plus more than 40000 other items moreover quite a few of these letters are of essay length much of his vast correspondence especially the letters dated after 1700 remains unpublished and much of what is published has been so only in recent decades the amount variety and disorder of leibnizs writings are a predictable result of a situation he described in a letter as follows i cannot tell you how extraordinarily distracted and spread out i am i am trying to find various things in the archives i look at old papers and hunt up unpublished documents from these i hope to shed some light on the history of the house of brunswick i receive and answer a huge number of letters at the same time i have so many mathematical results philosophical thoughts and other literary innovations that should not be allowed to vanish that i often do not know where

unreasonable to see him at least in theological terms as essentially a deist he is a determinist there are no miracles the events so called being merely instances of infrequently occurring natural laws christ has no real role in the system we live forever and hence we carry on after our deaths but then everything — every individual substance — carries on forever nonetheless leibniz is a theist his system is generated from and needs the postulate of a creative god in fact though despite leibnizs protestations his god is more the architect and engineer of the vast complex worldsystem than the embodiment of love of christian orthodoxy  christopher ernest cosans 2009 owens ape darwins bulldog beyond darwinism and creationism indiana university press pp 102–103 isbn 9780253220516 in advancing his system of mechanics newton claimed that collisions of celestial objects would cause a loss of energy that would require god to intervene from time to time to maintain order in the solar system vailati 1997 37–42 in criticizing this implication leibniz remarks sir isaac newton and his followers have also a very odd opinion concerning the work of god according to their doctrine god almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time otherwise it would cease to move leibniz 1715 675 leibniz argues that any scientific theory that relies on god to perform miracles after he had first made the universe indicates that god lacked sufficient foresight or power to establish adequate natural laws in the first place in defense of newtons theism clarke is unapologetic tis not a diminution but the true glory of his workmanship that nothing is done without his continual government and inspection leibniz 1715 676–677 clarke is believed to have consulted closely with newton on how to respond to leibniz he asserts that leibnizs deism leads to the notion of materialism and fate 1715 677 because it excludes god from the daily workings of nature  shelby d hunt 2003 controversy in marketing

scientific progress popper 1963 p69 although he was a great reader and admirer of spinoza leibniz being a confirmed deist rejected emphatically spinozas pantheism god and nature for leibniz were not
