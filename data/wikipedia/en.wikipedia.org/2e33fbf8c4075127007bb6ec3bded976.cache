service began in new york city and soon after in other major cities in the east and the midwest3 the use of common carrier for delivery between all customers placed ups in direct competition with the united states postal service and the interstate commerce commission the common carrier service was applied in cities where ups could use the service without the authority of the icc and state commerce commissions the first city for ups to use common carrier status outside of california was chicago illinois in 19539 ford model t ups delivery vehicle in 1921 air service through ups was first used in

such as ontrac eastern connection and lso formerly known as lonestar overnight in addition to these domestic carriers ups competes with a variety of international operators including canada post and its subsidiary purolator transforce deutsche post and its subsidiary dhl royal mail japan post india post and many other regional carriers national postal services and air cargo handlers see package delivery and mail pages historically the bulk of ups competition came from inexpensive groundbased delivery services such as parcel post usps or choice logistics but in 1998 fedex expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring rps originally roadway package system and rebranding it as fedex ground in 2000 in 2003 dhl expanded its us operations by acquiring airborne express significantly increasing its presence in the united states and adding more competition in the ground delivery market in response to this ups partnered with the us postal service to offer ups mail innovations32 a program that allows ups to pick up mail packages separately from the main ground network and transfer them to a usps center or destination delivery unit ddu33 for final distribution this process is also known as zone skipping34 long used by parcel consolidators35 ups also has a separate product called surepost which uses the ups ground network to deliver packages to the nearest ups package center which transfers them to the usps ddu for final mile delivery36 more recently the continued growth of online shopping combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation including package delivery has on the environment has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents for instance the us postal service claims greener delivery of parcels on the assumption that usps letter carriers deliver to each us address six days a week anyway and therefore offer the industrys lowest fuel consumption per delivery other carriers like parcelpoolcom37 which specializes in residential package delivery to apofpo addresses hawaii alaska puerto rico and other us territories arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online etailers for lowcost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery transportationedit delivery
