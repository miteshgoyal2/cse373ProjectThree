the american psychiatric associations diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm and the world health organizations international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems icd10 the first new category is disorder of attachment in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver parallel to rad in its inhibited and disinhibited forms as defined in dsm and icd the second is secure base distortion where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment the third is disrupted attachment disrupted attachment is not covered under icd10 and dsm criteria and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed8 this form of categorization may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current dsm and icd classifications but further research is required910 bibliographyedit
