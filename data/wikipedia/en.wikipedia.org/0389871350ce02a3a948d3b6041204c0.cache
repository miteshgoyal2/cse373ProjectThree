was included in michael jacksons this is it a commercially successful documentaryconcert film of the singers rehearsals for his london concert series18 critical receptionedit craig seymour of the buffalo news felt that the song was the only one from the album in which jackson successfully revisited his past the journalist said the song was reminiscent of the 1995 charttopper you are not alone as it sounded to him like a track that could have been written by r kelly who penned the number one hit19 writing for the chicago suntimes jim derogatis described speechless as a beautifully minimal heartfelt romantic ballad20 music journalist roger catlin stated that the song leaned toward neogospel10 the new york post said that speechless was lullabylike and the best song on invincible and jon pareles of the new york times praised jacksons long lines and creamy overdubbed choruses sailing weightlessly in the ballad that the journalist felt it was a love song to god2122 pop music critic robert hilburn described speechless and another song from invincible butterflies as being as woefully generic as their titles8 ben rayner of the toronto star contested that the a cappellas in speechless were enough to make a person wish that jackson actually was unable to make a sound23 michigan daily writer dustin j seibert wrote that the song was a shining example of what happens when the gloved one gets beside himself and writes smarmy crap that should be reserved for a cd changer somewhere in a preschool24 the fort worth startelegram said that speechless was one of the weaker tracks from invincible25 elliot sylvester of the independent felt that the song was pure jackson – almost to a formulaic fault26 the dallas morning news thor christensen said that speechless was produced by mr jackson in bombastic style à la celine dion he added that as the track ended with an emotional jackson it drew a parallel with the singers 1972 ode to a rat ben27 vaughn watson of the providence journal hailed speechless as invincibles best song and one of jacksons finest of any album he added that with the song the musician acknowledged the pain that accompanies isolation28 in a review of invincible the wichita eagle stated that speechless dont walk away and cry were among the sincere ballads in which jackson was exemplary29 ada anderson of the ball state daily news expressed the view that speechless would become a popular song and writers for the south florida sunsentinel stated that the ballad would take time to get used to3031 the dayton daily news ron rollins described the track as a pretty love song32 music critic kevin c johnson thought that speechless was one of jacksons typical whispery ballads that swells as it moves along33 a journalist for the olympian stated
