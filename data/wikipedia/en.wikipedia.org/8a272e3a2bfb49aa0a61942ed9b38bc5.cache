film festival scorsese was born in queens new york his family moved to little italy manhattan before he started school10 his father charles scorsese and mother catherine scorsese born cappa both worked in new yorks garment district his father was a clothes presser and an actor and his mother was a seamstress and an actress11 his fathers parents emigrated from polizzi generosa in the province of palermo sicily and his maternal grandparents were also from palermo precisely from ciminna scorsese was raised in a devoutly catholic environment3 as a boy he had asthma and could not play sports or do any activities with other children so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema as a teenager in the bronx scorsese frequently rented powell and pressburgers the tales of hoffmann 1951 from a store that had one copy of the reel scorsese was one of only two people who regularly rented that reel the other was future night of the living dead director george a romero12 scorsese has cited sabu and victor mature as his favorite actors during his youth he has also spoken of the influence of the 1947 powell and pressburger film black narcissus whose innovative techniques later impacted his filmmaking13 enamored of historical epics in his adolescence at least two films of the genre land of the pharaohs and el cid appear to have had a deep and lasting impact on his cinematic psyche scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time he recounted its influence in a documentary on italian neorealism and commented on how bicycle thieves alongside paisà rome open city inspired him and how this influenced his view or portrayal of his sicilian roots in his documentary il mio viaggio in italia scorsese noted that the sicilian episode of roberto rossellinis paisà which he first saw on television alongside his relatives who were themselves sicilian immigrants made a significant impact on his life14 he acknowledges owing a great debt to the french new wave and has stated that the french new wave has influenced all filmmakers who have worked since whether they saw the films or not15 he has also cited filmmakers including satyajit ray ingmar bergman michelangelo antonioni and federico fellini as a major influence on his career1416171819 his initial desire to become a priest20 initially attending preparatory seminary but failing after the first year 21 while attending cardinal hayes high school in the bronx gave way to cinema and consequently scorsese enrolled in nyus washington square college now known as the college of arts and science where he earned a ba in english in 1964 he went on to earn his mfa from nyus school of the arts now known as the tisch school of the arts in 1966 a year after the school was founded22 careeredit early careeredit scorsese attended new york universitys tisch school of the arts ba english 1964 mfa film 196623 making the short films whats a nice girl like you doing in a place like this 1963 and its not just you murray 1964 his most famous short of the period is the darkly comic the big shave 1967 which features peter bernuth the film is an indictment of americas involvement in vietnam suggested by its alternative title viet 6724 scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at new york university by his armenian american film professor haig p manoogian in 1967 scorsese made his first featurelength film the black and white i call first which was later retitled whos that knocking at my door with his fellow students actor harvey keitel and editor thelma schoonmaker both of whom were to become longterm collaborators this film was intended to be the first of scorseses semiautobiographical j r trilogy which also would have included a later film mean streets 1970sedit scorsese became friends with the influential movie brats of the 1970s brian de palma francis ford coppola george lucas and steven spielberg5 it was brian de palma who introduced scorsese to robert de niro during this period he worked as the assistant director and one of the editors on the documentary woodstock 1970 and met actor–director john cassavetes who would also go on to become a close friend and mentor in 1972 scorsese made the depressionera exploiter boxcar bertha for bmovie producer roger corman who also helped directors such as francis ford coppola james cameron and john sayles launch their careers25 it was corman who taught scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with very little money or time preparing the young director well for the challenges to come with mean streets following the films release cassavetes encouraged scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make rather than someone elses projects championed by influential film critic pauline kael mean streets was a breakthrough for scorsese de niro and keitel by now the signature scorsese style was in place macho posturing bloody violence catholic guilt and redemption gritty new york locale though the majority of mean streets was actually shot in los angeles rapidfire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music although the film was innovative its wired atmosphere edgy documentary style and gritty streetlevel direction owed a debt to directors cassavetes samuel fuller and early jeanluc godard26 in 1974 actress ellen burstyn chose scorsese to direct her in alice doesnt live here anymore for which she won an academy award for best actress although well regarded the film remains an anomaly in the directors early career as it focuses on a central female character returning to little italy to explore his ethnic roots scorsese next came up with italianamerican a documentary featuring his parents charles and catherine scorsese taxi driver followed in 1976‍—‌scorseses dark urban nightmare of one lonely mans slow descent into insanity the film established scorsese as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographer michael chapman whose style tends towards high contrasts strong colors and complex camera movements the film starred robert de niro as the troubled and psychotic travis bickle the film costarred jodie foster in a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute and harvey keitel as her pimp matthew called sport taxi driver also marked the start of a series of collaborations between scorsese and writer paul schrader whose influences included the diary of wouldbe assassin arthur bremer and pickpocket a film by the french director robert bresson writer–director schrader often returns to bressons work in films such as american gigolo light sleeper and scorseses later bringing out the dead27 already controversial upon its release taxi driver hit the headlines again five years later when john hinckley jr made an assassination attempt on thenpresident ronald reagan he subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with jodie fosters taxi driver character in the film de niros character travis bickle makes an assassination attempt on a senator28 taxi driver won the palme dor at the 1976 cannes film festival29 also receiving four oscar nominations including best picture the critical success of taxi driver encouraged scorsese to move ahead with his first bigbudget project the highly stylized musical new york new york this tribute to scorseses home town and the classic hollywood musical was a boxoffice failure the film was the directors third collaboration with robert de niro costarring with liza minnelli the film is best remembered today for the title theme song which was popularized by frank sinatra although possessing scorseses usual visual panache and stylistic bravura many critics felt its enclosed studiobound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work despite its weak reception the film is positively regarded by some critics richard brody in the new yorker wrote for scorsese a lifelong cinephile the essence of new york could be found in its depiction in classic hollywood movies remarkably his backwardlooking tribute to the golden age of musicals and noirish romantic melodramas turned out to be one of his most freewheeling and personal films30 the disappointing reception that new york new york received drove scorsese into depression by this stage the director had also developed a serious cocaine addiction however he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded the last waltz documenting the final concert by the band it was held at the winterland ballroom in san francisco and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert including bob dylan neil young ringo starr muddy waters joni mitchell van morrison paul butterfield neil diamond ronnie wood and eric clapton however scorseses commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978 other works in 1970s another scorsesedirected documentary titled american boy also appeared in 1978 focusing on steven prince the cocky gun salesman who appeared in taxi driver a period of wild partying followed damaging the directors already fragile health scorsese also helped provide footage for the documentary elvis on tour in 1977 he directed the broadway musical the act starring liza minnelli31 1980sedit by several accounts scorseses included robert de niro practically saved scorseses life when he persuaded scorsese to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film raging bull convinced that he would never make another movie he poured his energies into making this violent biopic of middleweight boxing champion jake lamotta calling it a kamikaze method of filmmaking32 the film is widely viewed as a masterpiece and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by britains sight sound magazine3334 it received eight oscar nominations including best picture best actor for robert de niro and scorseses first for best director de niro won as did thelma schoonmaker for editing but best director went to robert redford for ordinary people from this work onwards scorseses films are always labeled as a martin scorsese picture on promotional material raging bull filmed in high contrast black and white is where scorseses style reached its zenith taxi driver and new york new york had used elements of expressionism to replicate psychological points of view but here the style was taken to new extremes employing extensive slowmotion complex tracking shots and extravagant distortion of perspective for example the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight35 thematically too the concerns carried on from mean streets and taxi driver insecure males violence guilt and redemption although the screenplay for raging bull was credited to paul schrader and mardik martin who earlier cowrote mean streets the finished script differed extensively from schraders original draft it was rewritten several times by various writers including jay cocks who went on to coscript later scorsese films the age of innocence and gangs of new york the final draft was largely written by scorsese and robert de niro36 the american film institute chose raging bull as the no 1 american sports film on their list of the top 10 sports films in 1997 the institute ranked raging bull as the 24th greatest film of all time on their afis 100 years100 movies list in 2007 they ranked raging bull as the 4th greatest film of all time on their afis 100 years100 movies 10th anniversary edition list scorseses next project was his fifth collaboration with robert de niro the king of comedy 1983 it is a satire on the world of media and celebrity whose central character is a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act kidnapping37 the film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with visually it was far less kinetic than the style scorsese had developed up until this point often using a static camera and long takes38 the expressionism of his previous work here gave way to moments of almost total surrealism it still bore many of scorseses trademarks however the king of comedy failed at the box office but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release german director wim wenders numbered it among his 15 favorite films39 with after hours 1985 scorsese made an aesthetic shift back to a pareddown almost underground filmmaking style filmed on an extremely low budget on location and at night in the soho neighborhood of manhattan the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild new york word processor griffin dunne and featured cameos by such disparate actors as teri garr and cheech and chong along with the 1987 michael jackson music video bad in 1986 scorsese made the color of money a sequel to the much admired robert rossen film the hustler 1961 with paul newman which costarred tom cruise although adhering to scorseses established style the color of money was the directors first official foray into mainstream filmmaking the film finally won actor paul newman an oscar and gave scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him the last temptation of christ in 1983 scorsese began work on a longcherished personal project the last temptation of christ based on the 1951 novel written by nikos kazantzakis that retold the life of christ in human rather than divine terms barbara hershey recalls introducing scorsese to the book while they were filming boxcar bertha40 the film was slated to shoot under the paramount pictures banner but shortly before principal photography was to commence paramount pulled the plug on the project citing pressure from religious groups in this aborted 1983 version aidan quinn was cast as jesus and sting was cast as pontius pilate in the 1988 version these roles were played respectively by willem dafoe and david bowie however following his mid1980s flirtation with commercial hollywood scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project which was ultimately released in 1988 even prior to its release the film adapted by taxi driver and raging bull veteran paul schrader caused a massive furor with worldwide protests against its perceived blasphemy effectively turning a lowbudget independent film into a media sensation41 most controversy centered on the final passages of the film which depicted christ marrying and raising a family with mary magdalene in a sataninduced hallucination while on the cross looking past the controversy the last temptation of christ gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in scorseses canon an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point the director went on to receive his second nomination for a best director academy award again unsuccessfully this time losing to barry levinson for rain man other works in 1980s scorsese made a brief cameo appearance in the film anna pavlova also known as a woman for all time originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes michael powell this led to a more significant role in bertrand taverniers jazz film round midnight he also made a brief venture into television directing an episode of steven spielbergs amazing stories along with directors woody allen and francis ford coppola in 1989 scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film new york stories called life lessons 1990sedit after a decade of mostly mixed results gangster epic goodfellas 1990 was a return to form for scorsese and his most confident and fully realized film since raging bull de niro and joe pesci offered a virtuoso display of the directors bravura cinematic technique in the film and reestablished enhanced and consolidated his reputation after the film was released roger ebert a friend and supporter of scorsese named goodfellas the best mob movie ever and is ranked no 1 on rogers movie list for 1990 along with gene siskel and peter travers the film is widely considered one of the directors greatest achievements424344 the film was nominated for six academy awards including best picture and best director scorsese earned his third best director nomination for goodfellas but again lost to a firsttime director kevin costner dances with wolves joe pesci earned the academy award for best supporting actor for his performance in goodfellas scorsese and the film won numerous awards including five bafta awards a silver lion and more the american film institute put goodfellas at no 94 on the afis 100 years100 movies list on the 2007 updated version they moved goodfellas up to no 92 on the afis 100 years100 movies list 10th anniversary edition and they put goodfellas at no 2 on their list of the top 10 gangster films after the godfather in 1990 he also released his only shortform documentary made in milan about fashion designer giorgio armani the following year brought cape fear a remake of a cult 1962 movie of the same name and the directors seventh collaboration with de niro another foray into the mainstream the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from alfred hitchcock and charles laughtons the night of the hunter 1955 cape fear received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting misogynistic violence however the lurid subject matter gave scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects the film garnered two oscar nominations earning 80 million domestically it stood as scorseses most commercially successful release until the aviator 2004 and then the departed 2006 the film also marked the first time scorsese used widescreen panavision with an aspect ratio of 2351 the age of innocence 1993 was a significant departure for scorsese a period adaptation of the edith wharton novel about the constrictive high society of late19th century new york it was highly lauded by critics upon original release but was a box office bomb making an overall loss as noted in scorsese on scorsese by editor–interviewer ian christie the news that scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19thcentury romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity all the more when scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio forhire job scorsese was interested in doing a romantic piece his friend jay cocks gave him the wharton novel in 1980 suggesting that this should be the romantic piece scorsese should film as cocks felt it best represented his sensibility in scorsese on scorsese he noted that although the film deals with new york aristocracy and a period of new york history that has been neglected and although it deals with code and ritual and with love thats not unrequited but unconsummated—which pretty much covers all the themes i usually deal with—when i read the book i didnt say oh good all those themes are here scorsese who was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of whartons text wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works to this aim scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that made an emotional impact on him in scorsese on scorsese he documents influences from films such as luchino viscontis senso and his il gattopardo as well as orson welless the magnificent ambersons and also roberto rossellinis la prise de pouvoir par louis xiv although the age of innocence was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative story and thematic concern the presence of a lost society of lost values as well as detailed recreations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films it came back into the public eye especially in countries such as the uk and france but still is largely neglected in north america the film earned five academy award nominations including for scorsese for best adapted screenplay winning the costume design oscar this was his first collaboration with the academy award–winning actor daniel daylewis with whom he would work again in gangs of new york casino 1995 like the age of innocence before it focused on a tightly wound male whose wellordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces the fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film casino was a box office success45 but the film received mixed notices from critics in large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier goodfellas and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent american gangster film ever made indeed many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact most obviously the casting of both robert de niro and joe pesci pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath sharon stone was nominated for the best actress academy award for her performance during the filming scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables scorsese still found time for a fourhour documentary in 1995 titled a personal journey with martin scorsese through american movies offering a thorough trek through american cinema it covered the silent era to 1969 a year after which scorsese began his feature career stating i wouldnt feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries in the fourhour documentary scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as 1 the director as storyteller 2 the director as an illusionist dw griffith or f w murnau who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on 3 the director as a smuggler—filmmakers such as douglas sirk samuel fuller and vincente minnelli who used to hide subversive messages in their films and 4 the director as iconoclast if the age of innocence alienated and confused some fans then kundun 1997 went several steps further offering an account of the early life of tenzin gyatso the 14th dalai lama the peoples liberation armys entering of tibet and the dalai lamas subsequent exile to india not least a departure in subject matter kundun also saw scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trancelike meditation achieved through an elaborate tableau of colorful visual images46 the film was a source of turmoil for its distributor buena vista pictures which was planning significant expansion into the chinese market at the time initially defiant in the face of pressure from chinese officials disney has since distanced itself from the project hurting kundun’s commercial profile in the short term the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the directors reputation in the long term however it generally appears kundun has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour kundun was the directors second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader following the last temptation of christ bringing out the dead 1999 was a return to familiar territory with the director and writer paul schrader constructing a pitchblack comic take on their own earlier taxi driver47 like previous scorsese–schrader collaborations its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalled the films of robert bresson48 it is also worth noting that the films incidentfilled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of after hours it received generally positive reviews49 although not the universal critical acclaim of some of his other films it stars nicolas cage ving rhames john goodman tom sizemore and patricia arquette other works in 1990s in 1990 scorsese acted in a cameo role as vincent van gogh in the film dreams by japanese director akira kurosawa in 1994 scorseses cameo appearance in the robert redford film quiz show is remembered for the telling line you see the audience didnt tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability they just wanted to watch the money de finacappa was the production company he formed that same year with producer barbara de fina50 since the 1990s scorsese has increased his role as a film producer scorsese produced a wide range of films including major hollywood studio productions mad dog and glory clockers lowbudget independent films the grifters naked in new york grace of my heart search and destroy the hilo country and even foreign film con gli occhi chiusi 2000sedit at the gangs of new york screening at the cannes film festival with leonardo dicaprio and cameron diaz in 1999 scorsese also produced a documentary on italian filmmakers titled il mio viaggio in italia also known as my voyage to italy the documentary foreshadowed the directors next project the epic gangs of new york 2002 influenced by amongst many others major italian directors such as luchino visconti and filmed in its entirety at romes famous cinecittà film studios with a production budget said to be in excess of 100 million gangs of new york was scorseses biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date like the age of innocence it was set in 19thcentury new york although focusing on the other end of the social scale and like that film also starring daniel daylewis the film also marked the first collaboration between scorsese and actor leonardo dicaprio who since then has become a fixture in later scorsese films the production was highly troubled with many rumors referring to the directors conflict with miramax boss harvey weinstein51 despite denials of artistic compromise gangs of new york revealed itself to be the directors most conventional film standard film tropes that the director had traditionally avoided such as characters existing purely for exposition purposes and explanatory flashbacks here surfaced in abundance525354 the original score composed by regular scorsese collaborator elmer bernstein was rejected at a late stage for a score by howard shore and mainstream rock artists u2 and peter gabriel55 the final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes while the directors original cut was over 180 minutes in length52 the film still received generally positive reviews with the review tallying website rotten tomatoes reporting that 75 percent of the reviews they tallied for the film were positive and summarizing the critics by saying though flawed the sprawling messy gangs of new york is redeemed by impressive production design and daylewiss electrifying performance56 the themes central to the film were consistent with the directors established concerns new york violence as culturally endemic and subcultural divisions down ethnic lines originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 to qualify for academy award nominations scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002 the studio consequently delayed the film for nearly a year until its release in the oscar season of late 200257 gangs of new york earned scorsese his first golden globe for best director in february 2003 gangs of new york received 10 academy award nominations including best picture best director and best actor for daniel daylewis however it did not win in any category the following year scorsese completed production of the blues an expansive sevenpart documentary tracing the history of blues music from its african
