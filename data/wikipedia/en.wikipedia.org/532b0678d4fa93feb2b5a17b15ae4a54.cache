numbering plan nanp one of eight n11 codes like other emergency numbers around the world this number is intended for use in emergency circumstances only and using it for any other purpose such as making false or prank calls is a crime in certain jurisdictions in over 98 of locations in the united states and canada dialing 911 from any telephone will link the caller to an emergency dispatch office—called a publicsafety answering point psap by the telecom industry—which can send emergency responders to the callers location in an emergency in approximately 96 percent of the us the enhanced 911 system automatically pairs caller numbers with a physical address1 in the philippines the 911 emergency hotline has been available to the public since august 1 2016 although it was first available in davao city it is the first of its kind in asiapacific region3 it replaces the previous emergency number 117 used outside davao city as of 2017 a 911 system is in use in mexico where implementation in different states and municipalities is being conducted 999 is used in singapore malaysia hong kong the united kingdom and many british territories amongst other places 112 is the equivalent

telephone all telephone calls were operatorassisted to place a call the caller was required to pick up the telephone receiver sometimes turn a magneto crank and wait for the telephone operator to answer the caller would then ask to be connected to the number they wished to call and the operator would make the required connection manually by means of a switchboard in an emergency the caller might simply say get me the police i want to report a fire or i need an ambulance or doctor until dial service came into use one could not place calls without proper operator assistance5 emergency 911 displayed on the side of an upper dublin township pennsylvania police vehicle indicating that 911 is the number to dial in the event of an emergency the first known experiment with a national emergency telephone number occurred in the united kingdom in 1937 using the number 9996 in the united states the push for the development of a nationwide american emergency telephone number came in 1957 when the national association of fire chiefs recommended that a single number be used for reporting fires7 the first city in north america to use a central emergency number was the canadian city of winnipeg manitoba in 1959 which instituted the change at the urging of stephen juba mayor of winnipeg at the time8 winnipeg initially used 999 as the emergency number9 but switched numbers when 911 was proposed by the united states in 1967 the presidents commission on law enforcement and administration of justice recommended the creation of a single number that could be used nationwide for reporting emergencies10 the federal communications commission then met with att in november 1967 in order to choose the number in 1968 the number was agreed upon att chose the number 911 which was simple easy to remember dialed easily and worked well with the phone systems in place at the time just 35 days after atts announcement on february 16 1968 the firstever 911 call was placed by alabama speaker of the house rankin fite from haleyville city hall to us rep tom bevill at the citys police station bevill reportedly answered the phone with hello at the city hall with fite was haleyville mayor james whitt at the police station with bevill were gallagher and alabama public service commission director eugene bull connorcitation needed robert fitzgerald inside state plant manager for the alabama telephone company was at the atc central office serving haleyville and actually observed the call pass through the switching gear as the mechanical equipment clunked out 911 the phone used to answer the first 911 call a bright red model is now in a museum in haleyville while a duplicate phone is still in use at the police station public notice on highway in 1968 911 became the national emergency number for the united states calling this single number provided a caller access to police fire and ambulance services through what would become known as a common publicsafety answering point psap the number itself however did not become widely known until the 1970s and many municipalities did not have 911 service until well into the 1980scitation needed for example although the city of chicago illinois had access to 911 service as early as 1976 the illinois commerce commission did not authorize telephone service provider illinois bell to offer 911 to the chicago suburbs until 198111 implementation was not immediate even then by 1984 only eight chicago suburbs in cook county had 911 service12 as late as 1989 at least 28 chicago suburbs still lacked 911 service some of those towns had previously elected to decline 911 service due to costs and—according to emergency response personnel—failure to recognize the benefits of the 911 system13 conversion to 911 in canada began in 1972 and nowwhen virtually all areas except for some rural areaswhich are using 911 as of 2008update each year canadians make twelve million calls to 91114 on september 15 2010 att announced that the state of tennessee had approved a service to support a text to 911 trial statewide where att would be able to allow its users to send text messages to 911 publicsafety answering points psaps15 most british overseas territories in the caribbean use the north american numbering plan anguilla bermuda the british virgin islands and the cayman islands use 911 enhanced 911edit main article enhanced 911 the enhanced 911 system enhanced 911 e911 or e911 automatically gives the dispatcher the callers location if available1 enhanced 911 is available in most areas approximately 96 percent of the us in all north american jurisdictions special privacy legislation permits emergency operators to obtain a 911 callers telephone number and location information16 this information is gathered by mapping the calling phone number to an address in a database this database function is known as automatic location identification ali17 the database is generally maintained by the local telephone company under a contract with the psap each telephone company has its own standards for the formatting of the database most ali databases have a companion database known as the msag master street address guide the msag describes address elements including the exact spellings of street names and street number ranges in the case of mobile phones the associated billing address is not necessarily the location to which emergency responders should be sent since the device is portable this means that locating the caller is more complicated and there is a different set of legal and technical requirements to locate a mobile telephone geographically there are two general approaches to use some form of radiolocation from the cellular network or to use a global positioning system receiver built into the phone itself both approaches are described by the radio resource location services protocol lcs protocol depending on the mobile phone hardware one of two types of location information can be provided to the operator the first is wireless phase one wph1 which is the tower location and the direction the call came from and the second is wireless phase two wph2 which provides an estimated gps location as voice over internet protocol voip technology matured service providers began to interconnect voip with the public switched telephone network and marketed the voip service as a cheap replacement phone service however e911 regulations and legal penalties have severely hampered the more widespread adoption of voip voip is much more flexible than land line phone service and there is no easy way to verify the physical location of a caller on a nomadic voip network at any given time especially in the case of wireless networks and so many providers offered services which specifically excluded 911 service so as to avoid the severe e911 noncompliance penalties voip services tried to improvise such as routing 911 calls to the administrative phone number of the public safety answering point adding on software to track phone locations etccitation needed in response to the e911 challenges inherent to ip phone systems specialized technology has been developed to locate callers in the event of an emergency some of these new technologies allow the caller to be located down to the specific office on a particular floor of a building these solutions support a wide range of organizations with ip telephony networks the solutions are available for service providers offering hosted ip pbx and residential voip services this increasingly important segment in ip phone technology includes e911 call routing services and automated phone tracking appliances many of these solutions have been established according to fcc crtc and nena i2 standards in order to help enterprises and service providers reduce liability concerns and meet e911 regulations18 computeraided dispatchedit main article computeraided dispatch 911 dispatchers use computeraided dispatch cad to record a log of police fire and ems services it can either be used to send messages to the dispatchee via a mobile data terminal mdt andor used to store and retrieve data ie radio logs field interviews client information schedules etc a dispatcher may announce the call details to field units over a twoway radio some systems communicate using a twoway radio systems selective calling features cad systems may send text messages with callforservice details to alphanumeric pagers or wireless telephony text services like sms the central idea is that persons in a dispatch center are able to easily view and understand the status of all units being dispatched cad provides displays and tools so that the dispatcher has an opportunity to handle callsforservice as efficiently as possible funding 911 servicesedit in the united states 911 and enhanced 911 are typically funded based on state laws that impose monthly fees on local and wireless telephone customers in canada a similar fee for service structure is regulated by the federal canadian radio television and telecommunications commission crtc depending on the location counties and cities may also levy a fee which may be in addition to or in lieu of the federal fee the fees are collected by local telephone and wireless carriers through monthly surcharges on customer telephone bills the collected fees are remitted to 911 administrative bodies which may be statewide 911 boards state public utility commissions state revenue departments or local 911 agencies19 these agencies disburse the funds to the public safety answering points for 911 purposes as specified in the various statutes telephone companies in both the united states and canada including wireless carriers may be entitled to apply for and receive reimbursements for costs of their compliance with federal and state laws requiring that their networks be compatible with 911 and enhanced 911 fees vary widely by locality they may range from around 25 per month to 300 per month per line20 the average wireless 911 fee in the united states based on the fees for each state as published by the national emergency number association nena is around 72 monthly fees usually do not vary based on the customers usage of the network though some states do cap the number of lines subject to the fee for large multiline businesses emergency service responseedit reaching a 911 dispatcher does not guarantee that emergency services will actually be able to respond to the call as they are funded and operated separately one egregious example occurred during a budget crunch in josephine county oregon in 2013 when no county police were on duty and no state police were available to respond to a female caller whose abusive exboyfriend was in the process of breaking into her apartment after the caller spent ten minutes on the phone with the dispatcher the exboyfriend succeeded in breaking in and raping her21 in 2013 the nextofkin of detroit murder victim stacey hightower sued the city for its 90minute 911 response time22 for robert poff a patient experiencing problems breathing a twentyminute delay in summoning emergency medical aid proved fatal23 police emergency response times in the bankrupt city in 2013 were typically fifty minutes24 to one hour25 and ambulance response times at least twelve to twenty minutes26 problems with 911edit inactive telephonesedit in the us some states have rules requiring that every landline telephone that can access the network be able to dial 911 regardless of any reason that normal service may have been disconnected including nonpayment this only applies to states with a do not disconnect policy in place telephone companies in those states must provide a soft or warm dial tone service details can be found at fcc27 on wired land line phones this usually is accomplished by a soft dial tone which sounds normal but will allow only emergency calls often an unused and unpublished phone number will be issued to the line so that it will work properly with regard to mobile phones the rules require carriers to connect 911 calls from any mobile phone regardless of whether that phone is currently active28 similar rules for inactive telephones apply in canada29 when a cellular phone is deactivated the phone number is often recycled to a new user or to a new phone for the same user the deactivated cell phone will still complete a 911 call if it has battery power but the 911 operator will see a specialized number indicating the cell phone has been deactivated it is usually represented with an area code of 911xxxxxxxcitation needed if the call is disconnected the 911 operator will not be able to connect to the original caller also because the cell phone is no longer activated the 911 operator is often unable to get phase ii information30 cell phonesedit about 70 percent of 911 calls came from cell phones in 201431 and finding out where the calls came from required triangulation a usa today study showed that where information was compiled on the subject many of the calls from cell phones did not include information allowing the caller to be located chances of getting as close as 100 feet were higher in areas with more towers but if a call was made from a large building even that would not be enough to precisely locate the caller new federal rules which service providers helped with require location information for 40 percent of calls by 2017 and 80 percent by 202132 as recently as 21 april 2016 an unidentified caller dialing 911 to report the death of the musical artist prince still needed to provide the 911 dispatcher with the physical address of the building in which the musician had died because the dispatcher had no other means to determine the location of the callers cell phone the caller was asked to locate a piece of mail with the buildings address so that emergency responders could be sent33 internet telephonyedit this article appears to contradict the article voice over ipemergencycalls please see discussion on the linked talk page september 2009 learn how and when to remove this template message main article voice over ip if 911 is dialed from a commercial voice over internet protocol voip service depending on how the provider handles such calls the call may not go anywhere at all or it may go to a nonemergency number at the public safety answering point associated with the billing or service address of the caller34 because a voip adapter can be plugged into any broadband internet connection a caller could actually be hundreds or even thousands of miles away from home yet if the call goes to an answering point at all it would be the one associated with the callers address and not the actual location of the call it may never be possible to reliably and accurately identify the location of a voip user even if a gps receiver is installed in the voip adapter since such phones are normally used indoors and thus may be unable to get a signal in march 2005 commercial internet telephony provider vonage was sued by the texas attorney general who alleged that their website and other sales and service documentation did not make clear enough that vonages provision of 911 service was not done in the traditional manner in may 2005 the fcc issued an order requiring voip providers to offer 911 service to all their subscribers within 120 days of the order being published1 the order set off anxiety among many voip providers who felt it will be too expensive and require them to adopt solutions that wont support future voip productscitation needed in canada the federal regulators have required internet service providers isps to provide an equivalent service to the conventional psaps but even these encounter problems with caller location since their databases rely on company billing addresses35 in may 2010 most voip users who dial 911 are connected to a call center owned by their telephone company or contracted by them the operators are most often not trained emergency service providers and are only there to do their best to connect the caller to the appropriate emergency service if the call center is able to determine the location of the emergency they try to transfer the caller to the appropriate psap most often the caller ends up being directed to a psap in the general area of the emergencycitation needed a 911 operator at that psap must then determine the location of the emergency and either send help directly or transfer the caller to the appropriate emergency service voip services operating in canada are required to provide 911 emergency service36 in april 2008 an 18monthold boy in calgary alberta died after a toronto voip providers 911 operator had an ambulance dispatched to the address of the familys previous abode in mississauga ontario37 swattingedit main article swatting the us federal bureau of investigation has warned of an increase in deliberate false alarms in which a false origin is displayed on calls to emergency services to send swat teams or heavily armed police to unsuspecting citizens doorsteps38 voice over ip voip has contributed greatly to the problem by making call origin more difficult to determine quickly and reliably in california state governor jerry brown signed legislation imposing liability for the full cost of these false alarms which can reach 10000 or more per incident39 emergencies across jurisdictionsedit when a caller dials 911 the call is routed to the local public safety answering point however if the caller is reporting an emergency in another jurisdiction the dispatchers may or may not know how to contact the proper authorities the publicly posted phone numbers for most police departments in the us are nonemergency numbers that often specifically instruct callers to dial 911 in case of emergency which does not resolve the issue for callers outside of the jurisdiction in the age of both commercial and personal high speed internet communications this issue is becoming an increasing problem nena has developed the north american 911 resource database which includes the national psap registry psaps can query this database to obtain emergency contact information of a psap in another county or state when it receives a call involving another jurisdiction online access to this database is provided at no charge for authorized local and state 911 authorities40 misdialingedit in the 919 area code including raleigh north carolina and surrounding communities a second area code 984 was added using an overlay plan in 2011 starting in march 2012 people making calls from the 919 area code had to dial the entire number including area code even for local calls and many people started with 911 realized their mistake and disconnected three months after the change police in wake county were responding to six times as many hangups all of which required a response this response could be a callback from the dispatcher slowing down the ability to respond to actual emergencies or if that did not get a result a visit from the police a supervisor recommended that people remain on the line and explain the mistake4142 for all of 2012 the number of hangups in wake county was nearly three times what it had been before the switch over 30000 police responses resulted43 in 2014 hangup calls remained high at about four times the rate from before44 pbx systems requiring a 9 to reach an outside line and a 1 used to indicate an area code can be a problem if the telephone buttons dont take input correctly or the caller accidentally presses a button multiple times the caller might misdial 9911 rather than 91 if so the first 9 connects to the outside network and then a 911 call is placed making calls publicedit news programs and such shows as rescue 911 have broadcast actual calls to 911 centers ohio senator tom patton introduced a bill in 2009 which would have banned the broadcasting of 911 calls requiring the use of transcripts instead patton believed that people would be reluctant to make calls because of possible retaliation or threats against those who called he intended to seek proof of this idea to satisfy those who did not believe him or that broadcasting 911 calls hurt investigations the ohio fraternal order of police supported the bill because broadcasts of 911 calls have been sensationalized45 ohio association of broadcasters director chris merritt said the government should not have the right to decide how public records were used46 other opponents of such a ban point out that recordings hold dispatchers accountable and show when they are not doing their jobs properly in a way transcripts cannot4748 a bill signed by alabama governor bob riley on april 27 2010 requires a court order before recordings can be made public alaska florida kentucky and wisconsin also had bills banning the broadcasts49 mississippi missouri pennsylvania rhode island and wyoming already banned the broadcasts50 in april 2011 the tennessee senate passed a bill banning broadcasts of calls unless the caller gave permission51 north carolina law defines 911 recordings as public records but an exception allows officials to release either transcripts or distorted voices52 see alsoedit telecommunications portal
