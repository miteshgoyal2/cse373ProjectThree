graduates with their professors a doctor of philosophy phd phd or dphil latin philosophiae doctor is the highest academic degree awarded by universities in most countries phds are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fields the completion of a phd is often a requirement for employment as a university professor researcher or scientist in many fields individuals who have earned a doctor of philosophy degree may in most jurisdictions use the title of doctor often abbreviated dr or in nonenglish speaking countries variants such as dr phil with their name and may use postnominal letters such as phd phd depending on the awarding institute1 the requirements to earn a phd degree vary considerably according to the country institution and time period from entrylevel research degrees to higher doctorates during the studies that lead to the degree the student is called a doctoral student or phd student a student who has completed all of their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesisdissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or phd candidate see all but dissertation a student attaining this level may be granted a candidate of philosophy degree at some institutions a phd candidate must submit a project thesis or dissertation often consisting of a body of original academic research which is in principle worthy of publication in a peerreviewed journal2 in many countries a candidate must defend this work before a panel of expert examiners appointed by the university universities sometimes award other types of doctorate besides the phd such as the doctor of musical arts dma for music performers and the doctor of education edd for professional educators in 2005 the european universities association defined the salzburg principles ten basic principles for thirdcycle degrees doctorates within the bologna process3 these were followed in 2016 by the florence principles seven basic principles for doctorates in the arts laid out by the european league of institutes of the arts which have been endorsed by the european association of conservatoires the international association of film and television schools the international association of universities and colleges of art design and media and the society for artistic research4 in the context of the doctor of philosophy and other similarly titled degrees the term philosophy does not refer to the field or academic discipline of philosophy but is used in a broader sense in accordance with its original greek meaning which is love of wisdom in most of europe all fields history philosophy social sciences mathematics and natural philosophynatural sciences5 other than theology law and medicine the socalled professional vocational or technical

letters piːeɪtʃˈdiː678 the abbreviation dphil from the english doctor of philosophy9 is used by a small number of british universities including oxford and formerly york and sussex as the abbreviation for degrees from those institutions10 historyedit medieval and early modern europeedit in the universities of medieval europe study was organized in four faculties the basic faculty of arts and the three higher faculties of theology medicine and law canon law and civil law all of these faculties awarded intermediate degrees bachelor of arts of theology of laws of medicine and final degrees initially the titles of master and doctor were used interchangeably for the final degrees—the title doctor was merely a formality bestowed on a teachermaster of the art—but by the late middle ages the terms master of arts and doctor of theologydivinity doctor of law and doctor of medicine had become standard in most places though in the german and italian universities the term doctor was used for all faculties the doctorates in the higher faculties were quite different from the current phd degree in that they were awarded for advanced scholarship not original research no dissertation or original work was required only lengthy residency requirements and examinations besides these degrees there was the licentiate originally this was a license to teach awarded shortly before the award of the master or doctor degree by the diocese in which the university was located but later it evolved into an academic degree in its own right in particular in the continental universities according to keith allan noble 1994 the first doctoral degree was awarded in medieval paris around 115011 the doctorate of philosophy developed in germany as the terminal teachers credential in the 17th century c 1652 there were no phds in germany before the 1650s when they gradually started replacing the ma as the highest academic degree arguably one of the earliest german phd holders is erhard weigel dr phil hab leipzig 1652citation needed in theory the full course of studies might for example lead in succession to the degrees of bachelor of arts licentiate of arts master of arts or bachelor of medicine licentiate of medicine doctor of medicine but before the early modern era there were many exceptions to this most students left the university without becoming masters of arts whereas regulars members of monastic orders could skip the arts faculty entirely121314 educational reforms in germanyedit this situation changed in the early 19th century through the educational reforms in germany most strongly embodied in the model of the university of berlin founded and controlled by the prussian government in 1810 the arts faculty which in germany was labelled the faculty of philosophy started demanding contributions to research15 attested by a dissertation for the award of their final degree which was labelled doctor of philosophy abbreviated as phd—originally this was just the german equivalent of the master of arts degree whereas in the middle ages the arts faculty had a set curriculum based upon the trivium and the quadrivium by the 19th century it had come to house all the courses of study in subjects now commonly referred to as sciences and humanities16 professors across the humanities and sciences focused on their advanced research17 practically all the funding came from the central government and it could be cut off if the professor was politically unacceptablerelevant – discuss18 these reforms proved extremely successful and fairly quickly the german universities started attracting foreign students notably from the united states the american students would go to germany to obtain a phd after having studied for a bachelors degrees at an american college so influential was this practice that it was imported to the united states where in 1861 yale university started granting the phd degree to younger students who after having obtained the bachelors degree had completed a prescribed course of graduate study and successfully defended a thesis or dissertation containing original research in science or in the humanities19 in germany the name of the doctorate was adapted after the philosophy faculty started being split up − eg dr rer nat for doctorates in the faculty of natural sciences − but in most of the englishspeaking world the name doctor of philosophy was retained for research doctorates in all disciplines the phd degree and similar awards spread across europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries the degree was introduced in france in 1808 replacing diplomas as the highest academic degree into russia in 1819 when the doktor nauk degree roughly equivalent to a phd gradually started replacing the specialist diploma roughly equivalent to the ma as the highest academic degree and in italy in 1927 when phds gradually started replacing the laurea as the highest academic degreecitation needed history in the united kingdomedit research degrees first appeared in the uk in the late 19th century in the shape of the doctor of science dsc or scd and other such higher doctorates the university of london introduced the dsc in 1860 but as an advanced study course following on directly from the bsc rather than a research degree the first higher doctorate in the modern sense was durham universitys dsc introduced in 188220 this was soon followed by other universities including the university of cambridge establishing its scd in the same year and the university of london transforming its dsc into a research degree in 1885 these were however very advanced degrees rather than researchtraining degrees at the phd level—harold jeffreys said that getting a cambridge scd was more or less equivalent to being proposed for the royal society21 finally in 1917 the current degree of phd was introduced along the lines of the american and german model and quickly became popular with both british and foreign students22 the slightly older degrees of doctor of science and doctor of literatureletters still exist at british universities together with the much older degrees of doctor of divinity dd doctor of music dmus doctor of civil law dcl and doctor of medicine md they form the higher doctorates but apart from honorary degrees they are only infrequently awarded a new phd graduate from the university of birmingham shakes hands with the chancellor it should be noted that in the english but not the scottish universities the faculty of arts had become dominant by the early 19th century indeed the higher faculties had largely atrophied since medical training had shifted to teaching hospitals23 the legal training for the common law system was provided by the inns of court with some minor exceptions see doctors commons and few students undertook formal study in theology this contrasted with the situation in the continental european universities at the time where the preparatory role of the faculty of philosophy or arts was to a great extent taken over by secondary education in modern france the baccalauréat is the examination taken at the end of secondary studies the reforms at the humboldt university transformed the faculty of philosophy or arts and its more recent successors such as the faculty of sciences from a lower faculty into one on a par with the faculties of law and medicine there were similar developments in many other continental european universities and at least until reforms in the early 21st century many european countries eg belgium spain and the scandinavian countries had in all faculties triple degree structures of bachelor or candidate − licentiate − doctor as opposed to bachelor − master − doctor the meaning of the different degrees varied a lot from country to country however to this day this is also still the case for the pontifical degrees in theology and canon law for instance in sacred theology the degrees are bachelor of sacred theology stb licentiate of sacred theology stl and doctor of sacred theology std and in canon law bachelor of canon law jcb licentiate of canon law jcl and doctor of canon law jcd history in the united statesedit a yale university phd diploma from 1861 until the mid19th century advanced degrees were not a criterion for professorships at most colleges that began to change as the more ambitious scholars at major schools went to germany for 1 to 3 years to obtain a phd in the sciences or humanities2425 graduate schools slowly emerged in the united states in 1861 yale awarded the first three earned phds in north america to eugene schuyler arthur williams wright and james morris whiton26 although honorary phds had been awarded in the us for almost a decade with bucknell university awarding the first to ebenezer newton elliott in 185227 in the next two decades nyu the university of pennsylvania harvard and princeton also began granting the degree major shifts toward graduate education were foretold by the opening of clark university in 1887 which only offered graduate programs and the johns hopkins university which focused on its phd program by the 1890s harvard columbia michigan and wisconsin were building major graduate programs whose alumni were hired by new research universities by 1900 300 phds were awarded annually most of them by six universities it was no longer necessary to study in germany2829 however half of the institutions awarding earned phds in 1899 were undergraduate institutions that granted the degree for work done away from campus27 degrees awarded by universities without legitimate phd programs accounted for about a third of the 382 doctorates recorded by the us department of education in 1900 of which another 8–10 were honorary30 at the start of the 20th century us universities were held in low regard internationally and many american students were still traveling to europe for phds the lack of centralised authority meant anyone could start a university and award phds this led to the formation of the association of american universities by 14 leading research universities producing nearly 90 of the approximately 250 legitimate research doctorates awarded in 1900 with one of the main goals being to raise the opinion entertained abroad of our own doctors degree30 in germany the national government funded the universities and the research programs of the leading professors it was impossible for professors who were not approved by berlin to train graduate students in the united states by contrast private universities and state universities alike were independent of the federal government independence was high but funding was low the breakthrough came from private foundations which began regularly supporting research in science and history large corporations sometimes supported engineering programs the postdoctoral fellowship was established by the rockefeller foundation in 1919 meanwhile the leading universities in cooperation with the learned societies set up a network of scholarly journals publish or perish became the formula for faculty advancement in the research universities after world war ii state universities across the country expanded greatly in undergraduate enrollment and eagerly added research programs leading to masters or doctorate degrees their graduate faculties had to have a suitable record of publication and research grants late in the 20th century publish or perish became increasingly important in colleges and smaller universities31 requirementsedit a south african phd graduate on right wearing ceremonial gown detailed requirements for the award of a phd degree vary throughout the world and even from school to school it is usually required for the student to hold an honours degree or a masters degree with high academic standing in order to be considered for a phd programcitation needed in the us canada india and denmark for example many universities require coursework in addition to research for phd degrees in other countries such as the uk there is generally no such condition though this varies by university and field32 some individual universities or departments specify additional requirements for students not already in possession of a bachelors degree or equivalent or higher in order to submit a successful phd admission application copies of academic transcripts letters of recommendation a research proposal and a personal statement are often required most universities also invite for a special interview before admission a candidate must submit a project or thesis or dissertation often consisting of a body of original academic research which is in principle worthy of publication in a peerreviewed context2 in many countries a candidate must defend this work before a panel of expert examiners appointed by the university in other countries the dissertation is examined by a panel of expert examiners who stipulate whether the dissertation is in principle passable and any issues that need to be addressed before the dissertation can be passed some universities in the nonenglishspeaking world have begun adopting similar standards to those of the anglophone phd degree for their research doctorates see the bologna process33 a phd student or candidate is conventionally required to study on campus under close supervision with the popularity of distance education and elearning technologies some universities now accept students enrolled into a distance education parttime mode in a sandwich phd program phd candidates do not spend their entire study period at the same university instead the phd candidates spend the first and last periods of the program at their home universities and in between conduct research at another institution or field research34 occasionally a sandwich phd will be awarded by two universities35 phd confirmationedit a phd confirmation is a preliminary presentation or lecture that a phd candidate presents to faculty and possibly other interested memberswhere the lecture follows after a suitable topic has been identified and can include such matters as the aim of the research methodology first results planned or finished publications etc the confirmation lecture can be seen as a trial run for the final public defense though faculty members at this stage can still largely influence the direction of the research at the end of the lecture the phd candidate can be seen as confirmed – faculty members give their approval and trust that the study is well directed and will with high probability result in the candidate being successful in the united states this is generally called advancing to candidacy the confirmation event being called the candidacy examination value and criticismedit phd students are often motivated to pursue the phd by scientific and humanistic curiosity the desire to contribute to the academic community service to others or personal development a career in academia generally requires a phd though in some countries it is possible to reach relatively high positions without a doctorate in north america professors are increasingly being required to have a phd because the percentage of faculty with a phd is used as a university ratings measure36 the motivation may also include increased salary but in many cases this is not the result research by casey suggests that over all subjects phds provide an earnings premium of 26 over nonaccredited graduates but notes that masters degrees provide a premium of 23 and a bachelors 14 while this is a small return to the individual or even an overall deficit when tuition and lost earnings during training are accounted for he claims there are significant benefits to society for the extra research training37 however some research suggests that overqualified workers are often less satisfied and less productive at their jobs38 these difficulties are increasingly being felt by graduates of professional degrees such as law school looking to find employment phd students often have to take on debt to undertake their degreecitation needed a phd is also required in some positions outside academia such as research jobs in major international agencies in some cases the executive directors of some types of foundations may be expected to hold a phdcitation needed a phd is sometimes felt to be a necessary qualification in certain areas of employment such as in foreign policy thinktanks us news wrote in 2013 that if having a masters degree at the minimum is de rigueur in washingtons foreign policy world it is no wonder many are starting to feel that the phd is a necessary escalation another case of costly signaling to potential employers39 similarly an article on the australian public service states that credentialism in the public service is seeing a dramatic increase in the number of graduate positions going to phds and masters degrees becoming the base entry level qualification40 the economist published an article in 2010 citing various criticisms against the state of phds these included a prediction by economist richard b freeman that based on pre2000 data only 20 of life science phd students would gain a faculty job in the us and that in canada 80 of postdoctoral research fellows earned less than or equal to an average construction worker 38600 a year according to the article only the fastest developing countries eg china or brazil have a shortage of phds38 the us higher education systems often offers little incentive to move students through phd programs quickly and may even provide incentive to slow them down to counter this the united states introduced the doctor of arts degree in 1970 with seed money from the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching the aim of the doctor of arts degree was to shorten the time needed to complete the degree by focusing on pedagogy over research although the doctor of arts still contains a significant research component germany is one of the few nations engaging these issues and it has been doing so by reconceptualising phd programs to be training for careers outside academia but still at highlevel positions this development can be seen in the extensive number of phd holders typically from the fields of law engineering and economics at the very top corporate and administrative positions to a lesser extent the uk research councils have tackled the issue by introducing since 1992 the engdcitation neededclarification needed mark c taylor opined in 2011 in nature that total reform of phd programs in almost every field is necessary in the us and that pressure to make the necessary changes will need to come from many sources students administrators public and private sectors etc41 other articles in nature have also examined the issue of phd reform424344 freeman dyson professor emeritus at the institute for advanced study in princeton is opposed to the phd system and he never got his phd degree national variationsedit in germanspeaking nations most eastern european nations successor states of the former soviet union most parts of africa asia and many spanishspeaking countries the corresponding degree to a doctor of philosophy is simply called doctor doktor and the subject area is distinguished by a latin suffix eg dr med for doctor medicinae

international institutions such as the fulbright program and the organization of american states oas have been known to grant full scholarships for tuition with apportions for housing47 requirements for completionedit upon completion of at least two years research and coursework as a graduate student a candidate must demonstrate truthful and original contributions to his or her specific field of knowledge within a frame of academic excellence48 the doctoral candidates work should be presented in a dissertation or thesis prepared under the supervision of a tutor or director and reviewed by a doctoral committee this committee should be composed of examiners that are external to the program and at least one of them should also be external to the institution the academic degree of doctor respective to the correspondent field of science that the candidate has contributed with original and rigorous research is received after a successful defense of the candidates dissertation49 australiaedit see also education in australia and australian qualifications framework admissionedit admission to a phd program in australia requires applicants to demonstrate capacity to undertake research in the proposed field of study the standard requirement is a bachelors degree with either firstclass or upper secondclass honors research masters degrees and coursework masters degrees with a 25 research component are usually considered equivalent it is also possible for research masters degree students to upgrade to phd candidature after demonstrating sufficient progress scholarshipsedit phd students are sometimes offered a scholarship to study for their phd degree the most common of these are the governmentfunded australian postgraduate award apa which provides a living stipend to students of approximately a25800 a year taxfree apas are paid for a duration of 3 years while a 6month extension is usually possible upon citing delays out of the control of the student50 some universities also fund a similar scholarship that matches the apa amount due to a continual increase in living costs many phd students are forced to live under the poverty line51 in addition to the more common apa and university scholarships australian students have other sources of scholarship funding feesedit australian citizens permanent residents and new zealand citizens are not charged course fees for their phd or research masters degree with exception to the student services and amenities fee ssaf which is set by each university and typically involves the largest amount allowed by the australian government all fees are paid for by the australian government except for the ssaf under the research training scheme52 international students and coursework masters degree students must pay course fees unless they receive a scholarship to cover them requirements for completionedit completion requirements vary most australian phd programs do not have a required coursework component the credit points attached to the degree are all in the product of the research which is usually an 80000word thesis that makes a significant new contribution to the field the phd thesis is sent to external examiners who are experts in the field of research and who have not been involved in the work examiners are nominated by the candidates university and their identities are often not revealed to the candidate until the examination is complete a formal oral defence is generally not part of the examination of the thesis largely because of the distances that would need to be traveled by the overseas examiners recent pressure on higher degree by research hdr students to publish has resulted in increasing interest in phd by publication as opposed to the more traditional phd by dissertation

and when to remove this template message admissionedit admission to a doctoral programme at a canadian university usually requires completion of a masters degree in a related field with sufficiently high grades and proven research ability in some cases a student may progress directly from an honours bachelors degree to a phd program other programs allow a student to fasttrack to a doctoral program after one year of outstanding work in a masters program without having to complete the masters an application package typically includes a research proposal letters of reference transcripts and in some cases a writing sample or graduate record examinations scores a common criterion for prospective phd students is the comprehensive or qualifying examination a process that often commences in the second year of a graduate program generally successful completion of the qualifying exam permits continuance in the graduate program formats for this examination include oral examination by the students faculty committee or a separate qualifying committee or written tests designed to demonstrate the students knowledge in a specialized area see below or both at englishspeaking universities a student may also be required to demonstrate english language abilities usually by achieving an acceptable score on a standard examination for example the test of english as a foreign language depending on the field the student may also be required to demonstrate ability in one or more additional languages a prospective student applying to frenchspeaking universities may also have to demonstrate some english language ability fundingedit while some students work outside the university or at student jobs within the university in some programs students are advised or must agree not to devote more than ten hours per week to activities eg employment outside of their studies particularly if they have been given funding for large and prestigious scholarships such as those from nserc and fonds québécois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies this is an absolute requirement at some canadian universities most phd students receive an award equivalent to part or all of the tuition amount for the first four years this is sometimes called a tuition deferral or tuition waiver other sources of funding include teaching assistantships and research assistantships experience as a teaching assistant is encouraged but not requisite in many programs some programs may require all phd candidates to teach which may be done under the supervision of their supervisor or regular faculty besides these sources of funding there are also various competitive scholarships bursaries and awards available such as those offered by the federal government via nserc cihr or sshrc requirements for completionedit in general the first two years of study are devoted to completion of coursework and the comprehensive examinations at this stage the student is known as a phd student or doctoral student it is usually expected that the student will have completed most of his or her required coursework by the end of this stage furthermore it is usually required that by the end of eighteen to thirtysix months after the first registration the student will have successfully completed the comprehensive exams upon successful completion of the comprehensive exams the student becomes known as a phd candidate from this stage on the bulk of the students time will be devoted to his or her own research culminating in the completion of a phd thesis or dissertation the final requirement is an oral defense of the thesis which is open to the public in some but not all universities at most canadian universities the time needed to complete a phd degree typically ranges from four to six yearscitation needed it is however not uncommon for students to be unable to complete all the requirements within six years particularly given that funding packages often support students for only two to four years many departments will allow program extensions at the discretion of the thesis supervisor andor department chair alternate arrangements exist whereby a student is allowed to let their registration in the program lapse at the end of six years and reregister once the thesis is completed in draft form the general rule is that graduate students are obligated to pay tuition until the initial thesis submission has been received by the thesis office in other words if a phd student defers or delays the initial submission of their thesis they remain obligated to pay fees until such time that the thesis has been received in good standing colombiaedit admissionedit in colombia the phd course admission may require a masters degree magíster in some universities specially public universities however it could also be applied for a direct doctorate in specific cases according to the jurys recommendations on the thesis proposal fundingedit most of postgraduate students in colombia must finance their tuition fees by means of teaching assistant seats or research works some institutions such as colciencias colfuturo and icetex grant scholarships or provide awards in the form of forgivable loans54 requirements for completionedit after two or two and a half years it is expected the research work of the doctoral candidate to be submitted in the form of oral qualification where suggestions and corrections about the research hypothesis and methodology as well as on the course of the research work are performed the phd degree is only received after a successful defense of the candidates thesis is performed four or five years after the enrollment and most of the times also requiring the most important results having been published in at least one peerreviewed high impact international journal finlandedit in finland the degree of filosofian tohtori abbreviated ft is awarded by traditional universities such as university of helsinki a masters degree is required and the doctorate combines approximately 4–5 years of research amounting to 3–5 scientific articles some of which must be firstauthor and 60 ects points of studies55 other universities such as aalto university award degrees such as tekniikan tohtori tkt engineering taiteen tohtori tat art etc which are translated in english to doctor of science dsc and they are formally

state doctorate and the diploma of doctorengineer diplôme de docteuringénieur created in 1923 for technical research after 1984 only one type of doctoral degree remained called doctorate doctorat the latter is equivalent to the phd admissionedit students pursuing the phd degree must first complete a masters degree program which takes two years after graduation with a bachelors degree five years in total the candidate must find funding and a formal doctoral advisor directeur de thèse with an habilitation throughout the doctoral program the phd admission is granted by a graduate school in french école doctorale a phd candidate can follow some inservice training offered by the graduate school while continuing his or her research at laboratory his or her research may be carried out in a laboratory at a university or in a company in the last case the company hires the candidate and he or she is supervised by both the companys tutor and a labs professor the validation of the phd degree requires generally 3 to 4 years after the masters degree fundingedit the financing of phd research comes mainly from funds for research of the french ministry of higher education and research the most common procedure is a shortterm employment contract called doctoral contract the institution of higher education is the employer and the phd candidate the employee however the candidate can apply for funds from a company who can host him or her at its premises as in the case where phd candidates do their research in a company as another encountered situation the company and the institute can sign together a funding agreement so that the candidate still has a public doctoral contract but is daily located in the company for example it is particularly the case of french scientific cooperation

dissertation throughout the doctoral program called promotion this supervisor is informally referred to as doktorvater or doktormutter which literally translate to doctors father and doctors mother respectively while most german doctorates are considered equivalent to the phd an exception is the medical doctorate where doctoral dissertations are often written alongside undergraduate study the european research council decided in 2010 that those doctorates do not meet the international standards of a phd research degree5758 there are different forms of universitylevel institution in germany but only professors from universities univprof can serve as doctoral supervisors – universities of applied sciences fachhochschulen are not entitled to award doctorates59 although some exceptions

twotier system of doctoral degrees like russian federation some postsoviet states germany poland austria and switzerland should be considered for recognition at the level of the first doctoral degree and in countries with only one doctoral degree the degree of kandidat nauk should be considered for recognition as equivalent to this phd degree as most education systems only have one advanced research qualification granting doctoral degrees or equivalent qualifications isced 201162 par270 the degree of candidate of sciences kandidat nauk of the former ussr counties is usually considered at the same level as the doctorate or phd degrees of those countries6364 according to the joint statement by the permanent conference of the ministers for education and cultural affairs of the länder of the federal republic of germany kultusministerkonferenz kmk german rectors conference hrk and the ministry of general and professional education of the russian federation the degree of kandidat nauk is recognised in germany at the level of the german degree of doktor and the degree of doktor nauk at the level of german habilitation6566 the russian degree of kandidat nauk is also officially recognised by the government of the french republic as equivalent to french doctorate6768 according to the international standard classification of education isced 2011 for purposes of international educational statistics kandidat nauk candidate of sciences belongs to isced level 8 or doctoral or equivalent together with phd dphil dlitt dsc lld doctorate or similar it is mentioned in the russian version of isced 2011 par262 on the unesco website as an equivalent to phd belonging to this level62 in the same way as phd degrees awarded in many englishspeaking countries kandidat nauk candidate of sciences allows its holders to reach the level of the docent69 the second doctorate63 or postdoctoral degree7071 in some postsoviet states called doctor of sciences russian доктор наук doktor nauk is given as an example of second advanced research qualifications or higher doctorates in isced 201162 par270 and is similar to habilitation in germany poland and several other countries6371 it constitutes a higher qualification compared to phd as against the european qualifications framework eqf or dublin descriptors71 about 88 of russian students studying at state universities study at the expense of budget funds72 the average stipend in russia as of august 2011 is 430 a year 35month73 the average tuition fee in graduate school is 2000 per year74 italyedit historyedit the dottorato di ricerca research doctorate abbreviated to dott ric or phd is an academic title awarded at the end of a course of not less than three years admission to which is based on entrance examinations and academic rankings in the bachelor of arts laurea triennale and master of arts laurea magistrale or laurea specialistica while the standard phd follows the bologna process the mdphd programme may be completed in two years the first institution in italy to create a doctoral program phd was scuola normale superiore di pisa in 1927 under the historic name diploma di perfezionamento7576 further the research doctorates or phd dottorato di ricerca in italy were introduced by law and presidential decree in 19807778 referring to the reform of academic teaching training and experimentation in organisation and teaching methods7980 hence the superior graduate schools in italy81 scuola superiore universitaria82 also called schools of excellence scuole di eccellenza8183 such as scuola normale superiore di pisa and santanna school of advanced studies still keep their reputed historical diploma di perfezionamento phd title by law7684 and miur decree8586 admissionedit doctorate courses are open without age or citizenship limits to all those who already hold a laurea magistrale master degree or similar academic title awarded abroad which has been recognised as equivalent to an italian degree by the committee responsible for the entrance examinations the number of places on offer each year and details of the entrance examinations are set out in the examination announcement polandedit a doctoral degree pol doktor abbreviated to phd pol dr is an advanced academic degree awarded by universities in most fields8788899091 as well as by the polish academy of sciences92 regulated by the polish parliament acts93 and the government orders in particular by the ministry of science and higher education of the republic of poland commonly students with a masters degree or equivalent are accepted to a doctoral entrance exam the title of phd is awarded to a scientist who 1 completed a minimum of 3 years of phd studies pol studia doktoranckie not required to obtain phd 2 finished hisher theoretical andor laboratorys scientific work 3 passed all phd examinations 4 submitted hisher dissertation a document presenting the authors research and findings94 5 successfully defended hisher doctoral thesis typically upon completion the candidate undergoes an oral examination always public by hisher supervisory committee with expertise in the given discipline ukraineedit starting in 201695 in ukraine doctor of philosophy phd ukrainian доктор філософії is the highest education level and the first science degree phd is awarded in recognition of a substantial contribution to scientific knowledge origination of new directions and visions in science a phd degree is a prerequisite for heading a university department in ukraine upon completion of a phd a phd holder can elect to continue his studies and get a postdoctoral degree called doctor of sciences dsc ukrainian доктор наук which is the second and the highest science degree in ukraine scandinaviaedit the doctorate was introduced in sweden in 1477 and in denmarknorway in 1479 and awarded in theology law and medicine while the magisters degree was the highest degree at the faculty of philosophy equivalent to the doctorate scandinavian countries were among the early adopters of a degree known as a doctorate of philosophy based upon the german model denmark and norway both introduced the dr philos degree in 1824 replacing the magisters degree as the highest degree while uppsala university of sweden renamed its magisters degree filosofie doktor fil dr in 1863 these degrees however became comparable to the german habilitation rather than the doctorate as scandinavian countries did not have a separate habilitation96 the degrees were uncommon and not a prerequisite for employment as a professor rather they were seen as distinctions similar to the british higher doctorates dlitt dsc denmark introduced an americanstyle phd in 1989 it formally replaced the licentiates degree and is considered a lower degree than the dr phil degree officially the phd is not considered a doctorate but unofficially it is referred to as the smaller doctorate as opposed to the dr phil the grand doctorate holders of a phd degree are not entitled to style themselves as dr97 currently denmark distinctions between the dr phil as the proper doctorate and a higher degree than the phd whereas in norway the historically analogous dr philos degree is officially regarded as equivalent to the new phd in sweden the doctorate of philosophy was introduced at uppsala universitys faculty of philosophy in 1863 in sweden the latin term is officially translated into swedish filosofie doktor and commonly abbreviated fil dr or fd the degree represents the traditional faculty of philosophy and encompasses subjects from biology physics and chemistry to languages history and social sciences being the highest degree in these disciplines sweden currently has two researchlevel degrees the licentiates degree which is comparable to the danish degree formerly known as the licentiates degree and now as the phd and the higher doctorate of philosophy filosofie doktor some universities in sweden also use the term teknologie doktor for doctorates awarded by institutes of technology for doctorates in engineering or natural science related subjects such as materials science molecular biology computer science etc the swedish term fil dr is often also used as a translation of corresponding degrees from eg denmark and norway spainedit doctoral degrees are regulated by real decreto royal decree in spanish rd 992011 from the 20142015 academic year98 they are granted by a university on behalf of the king and its diploma has the force of a public document the ministry of science keeps a national registry of theses called teseo99 all doctoral programs are of a research nature a minimum of three years of study are required in one stage only a 3year or longer period of research extensions may be requested for maximum 5 years the student must write his thesis presenting a new discovery or original contribution to science if approved by her or his thesis director or directors the study will be presented to a panel of 5 distinguished scholars any doctor attending the public presentations is allowed to challenge the candidate with questions on his research if approved he will receive the doctorate four marks can be granted unsatisfactory pass satisfactory and excellent cum laude with all honours in latin denomination can be added to the excellent ones if all five members of the tribunal agree100 a doctoral degree is required to apply to a longterm teaching position at a university the social standing of doctors in spain is evidenced by the fact that only phd holders grandees and dukes can take seat and cover their heads in the presence of the king101 all doctor degree holders are reciprocally recognized as equivalent in germany and spain bonn agreement of november 14 1994102 united kingdomedit see also doctorates in the united kingdom admissionedit universities admit applicants to phd programs on a casebycase basis depending on the university admission is typically conditional on the prospective student having completed an undergraduate degree with at least upper secondclass honours or a postgraduate masters degree but requirements can vary in the case of the university of oxford for example the one essential condition of being accepted … is evidence of previous academic excellence and of future potential103 some uk universities eg oxford abbreviate their doctor of philosophy degree as dphil while most use the abbreviation phd these are in all other respects equivalent commonly students are first accepted onto an mphil or mres programme and may transfer to phd regulations upon satisfactory progress this is sometimes referred to as apg advanced postgraduate status this is typically done after one or two years and the research work done may count towards the phd degree if a student fails to make satisfactory progress he or she may be offered the opportunity to write up and submit for an mphil degree as is the case at the kings college london and university of manchester in many universities the mphil is also offered as a standalone research degree phd students from countries outside the euefta area are required to comply with the academic technology approval scheme atas which involves undergoing a security clearance process with the foreign office for certain courses in medicine mathematics engineering and material sciences104105 this requirement was introduced in 2007 due to concerns about overseas terrorism and weapons proliferation105 fundingedit in the united kingdom funding for phd students is sometimes provided by governmentfunded research councils or the european social fund usually in the form of a taxfree bursary which consists of tuition fees together with a stipend106 tuition fees are charged at different rates for homeeu and overseas students generally £3000–£6000 per year for the former and £9000–14500 for the latter which includes eu citizens who have not been normally resident in the eea for the last three years although this can rise to over £16000 at elite institutions higher fees are often charged for laboratorybased degrees107108 the stipend is around £13000 per year for three years106 sometimes higher by £2000–3000 in london whether or not the degree continues for longer within the usual fouryear span this implies that the fourth year of phd work is often unfunded a very small number of scientific studentships are sometimes paid at a higher rate for example in london cancer research uk the icr and the wellcome trust stipend rates start at around £19000 and progress annually to around £23000 a year an amount that is tax and national insurance free research council funding is sometimes earmarked for a particular department or research group who then allocate it to a chosen student although in doing so they are generally expected to abide by the usual minimum entry requirements typically a first degree with upper second class honours although successful completion of a postgraduate masters degree is usually counted as raising the class of the first degree by one division for these purposes the availability of funding in many disciplines especially humanities social studies and pure sciencecitation needed subjects means that in practice only those with the best research proposals references and backgrounds are likely to be awarded a studentship the esrc economic and social science research council explicitly state that a 21 minimum or 22 plus additional masters degree is required—no additional marks are given for students with a first class honours or a distinction at masters level since 2002 there has been a move by research councils to fund interdisciplinary doctoral training centres which concentrate resources on fewer higher quality centres many students who are not in receipt of external funding may choose to undertake the degree parttime thus reducing the tuition fees as well as creating free time in which to earn money for subsistence students may also take part in tutoring work as research assistants or occasionally deliver lectures at a rate of typically £1214 per hour either to supplement existing low income or as a sole means of funding109 completionedit phd gown university of cambridge there is usually a preliminary assessment to remain in the program and the thesis is submitted at the end of a three to fouryear program these periods are usually extended pro rata for parttime students with special dispensation the final date for the thesis can be extended for up to four additional years for a total of seven but this is rare110 for fulltime phds a 4year time limit has now been fixed and students must apply for an extension to submit a thesis past this point since the early 1990s british funding councils have adopted a policy of penalising departments where large proportions of students fail to submit their theses in four years after achieving phdstudent status or pro rata equivalent by reducing the number of funded places in subsequent years111 inadvertently this leads to significant pressure on the candidate to minimise the scope of projects with a view on thesis submission regardless of quality and discourage time spent on activities that would otherwise further the impact of the research on the community eg publications in high impact journals seminars workshops furthermore supervising staff are encouraged in their career progression to ensure that the phd students under their supervision finalise the projects in three rather than the four years that the program is permitted to cover these issues contribute to an overall discrepancy between supervisors and phd candidates in the priority they assign to the quality and impact of the research contained in a phd project the former favouring quick phd projects over several students and the latter favouring a larger scope for their own ambitious project training and impactcitation needed there has recently been an increase in the number of integrated phd programs available such as at the university of southampton these courses include a master of research mres in the first year which consists of a taught component as well as laboratory rotation projects the phd must then be completed within the next 3 years as this includes the mres all deadlines and timeframes are brought forward to encourage completion of both mres and phd within 4 years from commencement these programs are designed to provide students with a greater range of skills than a standard phd and for the university they are a means of gaining an extra years fees from public sources other doctoratesedit in the united kingdom phd degrees are distinct from other doctorates most notably the higher doctorates such as dlitt doctor of letters or dsc doctor of science which may be granted on the recommendation of a committee of examiners on the basis of a substantial portfolio of submitted and usually published research however some uk universities still maintain the option of submitting a thesis for the award of a higher doctorate recent years have seen the introduction of professional doctorates dprof or profd which are the same level as phds but more specific in their field112 these tend not to be solely academic but combine academic research a taught component and a professional qualification these are most notably in the fields of engineering engd education edd educational psychology dedpsych occupational psychology docc psych clinical psychology dclinpsych health psychology dhealthpsy social work dsw nursing dnp public administration dpa business administration dba and music dma these typically have a more formal taught component consisting of smaller research projects as well as a 40000–60000word thesis component which together are officially considered equivalent to a phd degree united statesedit main article graduate science education in the united states further information doctorate § united states in the united states the phd degree is the highest academic degree awarded by universities in most fields of study there are 282 universities in the united states that award the phd degree and those universities vary widely in their criteria for admission as well as the rigor of their academic programs113 requirements us students typically undergo a series of three phases in the course of their work toward the phd degree the first phase consists of coursework in the students field of study and requires one to three years to complete this often is followed by a preliminary a comprehensive examination or a series of cumulative examinations where the emphasis is on breadth rather than depth of knowledge the student is often later required to pass oral and written examinations in the field of specialization within the discipline and here depth is emphasized some phd programs require the candidate to successfully complete requirements in pedagogy taking courses on higher level teaching and teaching undergraduate courses or applied science eg clinical practice and predoctoral clinical internship in phd programs in clinical counseling or school psychologycitation needed another two to eight years are usually required for the composition of a substantial and original contribution to human knowledge in the form of a written dissertation which in the social sciences and humanities typically ranges from 50 to 450 pages in many cases depending on the discipline a dissertation consists of a comprehensive literature review an outline of methodology and several chapters of scientific social historical philosophical or literary analysis typically upon completion the candidate undergoes an oral examination sometimes public by his or her supervisory committee with expertise in the given discipline typically phd programs require applicants to have a bachelors degree in a relevant field and in many cases in the humanities a masters degree reasonably high grades several letters of recommendation relevant academic coursework a cogent statement of interest in the field of study and satisfactory performance on a graduatelevel exam specified by the respective program eg gre gmat114115 depending on the specific field of study completion of a phd program usually takes four to eight years of study after the bachelors degree those students who begin a phd program with a masters degree may complete their phd degree a year or two sooner116 as phd programs typically lack the formal structure of undergraduate education there are significant individual differences in the time taken to complete the degree overall 57 of students who begin a phd program in the us will complete their degree within ten years approximately 30 will drop out or be dismissed and the remaining 13 of students will continue on past ten years117 the number of phd diplomas awarded by us universities has risen nearly every year since 1957 according to data compiled by the us national science foundation in 1957 us universities awarded 8611 phd diplomas 20403 in 1967 31716 in 1977 32365 in 1987 42538 in 1997 48133 in 2007118 and 55006 in 2015119 funding phd students at us universities typically receive a tuition waiver and some form of annual stipendcitation needed many us phd students work as teaching assistants or research assistants graduate schools increasinglycitation needed encourage their students to seek outside funding many are supported by fellowships they obtain for themselves or by their advisers research grants from government agencies such as the national science foundation and the national institutes of health many ivy league and other wellendowed universities provide funding for the entire duration of the degree program if it is short or for most of itcitation needed models of supervisionedit at some universities there may be training for those wishing to supervise phd studies there is now a lot of literature published for academics who wish to do this such as delamont atkinson and parry 1997 indeed dinham and scott 2001 have argued that the worldwide growth in research students has been matched by increase in a number of what they term howto texts for both students and supervisors citing examples such as pugh and phillips 1987 these authors report empirical data on the benefits that a phd candidate may gain if he or she publishes work and note that phd students are more likely to do this with adequate encouragement from their supervisors wisker 2005 has noticed how research into this field has distinguished between two models of supervision the technicalrationality model of supervision emphasising technique the negotiated order model being less mechanistic and emphasising fluid and dynamic change in the phd process these two models were first distinguished by acker hill and black 1994 cited in wisker 2005 considerable literature exists on the expectations that supervisors may have of their students phillips pugh 1987 and the expectations that students may have of their supervisors phillips pugh 1987 wilkinson 2005 in the course of phd supervision similar expectations are implied by the quality assurance agencys code for supervision quality assurance agency 1999 cited in wilkinson 2005 international phd equivalent degreesedit afghanistan ډاکټر albania doktorature
