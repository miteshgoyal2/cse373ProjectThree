process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner the term refers to the delivery method of the medium rather than the medium itself and is an alternative to file downloading a process in which the enduser obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it a client enduser can use their media player to begin to play the data file such as a digital file of a movie or song before the entire file has been transmitted distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to telecommunications networks as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming eg radio television streaming apps or inherently nonstreaming eg books video cassettes audio cds for example in the 1930s elevator music was among the earliest popularly available streaming media nowadays internet television is a common form of streamed media the term streaming media can apply to media other than video and audio such as live closed captioning ticker tape and realtime text which are all considered streaming text the term streaming was first used for tape drives made by data electronics inc for drives meant to slowly ramp up and run for the entire track the slow ramp times resulted in lower drive costs making a more competitive product streaming was applied in the early 1990s as a better description for video on demand on ip networks at the time such video was usually referred to as store and forward video1 which was misleading nomenclature live streaming refers to internet content delivered in realtime as events happen much as live television broadcasts its contents over the airwaves via a television signal live internet streaming requires a form of source media eg a video camera an audio interface screen capture software an encoder to digitize the content a media publisher and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point although it frequently is as of 2017 streaming is generally taken to refer to cases where a user watches digital video content or listens to digital audio content on a computer screen and speakers ranging from a smartphone through a desktop computer to a largescreen home entertainment system over the internet with streaming content the user does not have to download the entire digital video or digital audio file before they start to watchlisten to it there are challenges with streaming content on the internet if the user does not have enough bandwidth in their internet connection they may experience stops in the content and some users may not be able to stream certain content due to not having compatible computer or software systems some popular streaming services are the video sharing website youtube which contains useruploaded videos on a huge range of topics twitch and mixer which live stream the playing of video games netflix which streams movies and tv shows and spotify and apple music

granted patents for a system for the transmission and distribution of signals over electrical lines2 which was the technical basis for what later became muzak a technology streaming continuous music to commercial customers without the use of radio attempts to display media on computers date back to the earliest days of computing in the mid20th century however little progress was made for several decades primarily due to the high cost and limited capabilities of computer hardware from the late 1980s through the 1990s consumergrade personal computers became powerful enough to display various media the primary technical issues related to streaming were having enough cpu power and bus bandwidth to support the required data rates and creating lowlatency interrupt paths in the operating system to prevent buffer underrun and thus enable skipfree streaming of the content however computer networks were still limited in the mid1990s and audio and video media were usually delivered over nonstreaming channels such as by downloading a digital file from a remote server and then saving it to a local drive on the end users computer or storing it as a digital file and playing it back from cdroms late 1990s – early 2000sedit during the late 1990s and early 2000s users had increased access to computer networks especially the internet and especially during the early 2000s users had access to increased network bandwidth especially in the last mile these technological improvement facilitated the streaming of audio and video content to computer users in their homes and workplaces as well there was an increasing use of standard protocols and formats such as tcpip http html and the internet became increasingly commercialized which led to an infusion of investment into the sector the band severe tire damage was the first group to perform live on the internet on june 24 1993 the band was playing a gig at xerox parc while elsewhere in the building scientists were discussing new technology the mbone for broadcasting on the internet using multicasting as proof of parcs technology the bands performance was broadcast and could be seen live in australia and elsewhere microsoft research developed a microsoft tv application which was compiled under ms windows studio suite and tested in conjunction with connectix quickcam realnetworks was also a pioneer in the streaming media markets when it broadcast a baseball game between the new york yankees and the seattle mariners over the internet in 19953 the first symphonic concert on the internet took place at the paramount theater in seattle washington on november 10 19954 the concert was a collaboration between the seattle symphony and various guest musicians such as slash guns n roses velvet revolver matt cameron soundgarden pearl jam and barrett martin screaming trees when word magazine launched in 1995 they featured the firstever streaming soundtracks on the internetcitation needed metropolitan opera live in hd is a program in which the metropolitan opera streams an opera performance live as the performance is taking place in 2013–2014 10 operas were transmitted via satellite into at least 2000 theaters in 66 countries5 business developmentsedit the first commercial streaming product appeared in late 1992 and was named starworks6 and enabled on demand mpeg1 full motion videos to be randomly accessed on corporate ethernet networks starworks was from starlight networks who also pioneered live video streaming on ethernet and via internet protocol over satellites with hughes network systems7 other early companies who created streaming media technology include realnetworks then known as progressive networks and protocomm both prior to wide spread world wide web usage and once the web became popular in the late 90s streaming video on the internet blossomed from startups such as vdonet acquired by realnetworks and precept acquired by cisco microsoft developed a media player known as activemovie in 1995 that allowed streaming media and included a proprietary streaming format which was the precursor to the streaming feature later in windows media player 64 in 1999 in june 1999 apple also introduced a streaming media format in its quicktime 4 application it was later also widely adopted on websites along with realplayer and windows media streaming formats the competing formats on websites required each user to download the respective applications for streaming and resulted in many users having to have all three applications on their computer for general compatibility in 2000 industryviewcom launched its worlds largest streaming video archive website to help businesses promote themselves 8 webcasting became an emerging tool for business marketing and advertising that combined the immersive nature of television with the interactivity of the web the ability to collect data and feedback from potential customers caused this technology to gain momentum quickly 9 around 2002 the interest in a single unified streaming format and the widespread adoption of adobe flash prompted the development of a video streaming format through flash which is the format used in flashbased players on many popular video hosting sites today such as youtube increasing consumer demand for live streaming has prompted youtube to implement a new live streaming service to users10 presently the company also offers a secured link returning the available connection speed of the user11 the recording industry association of america riaa revealed through its 2015 earnings report that streaming services were responsible for 343 percent of the years total music industrys revenue growing 29 percent from the previous year and becoming the largest source of income pulling in around 24 billion1213 us streaming revenue grew 57 percent to 16 billion in the first half of 2016 and accounted for almost half of industry sales14 use by consumersedit live streaming service at zoo by niconico these advances in computer networking combined with powerful home computers and modern operating systems made streaming media practical and affordable for ordinary consumers standalone internet radio devices emerged to offer listeners a nocomputer option for listening to audio streams these audio streaming services have become increasingly popular over recent years as streaming music hit a record of 1181 billion streams in 201315 in general multimedia content has a large volume so media storage and transmission costs are still significant to offset this somewhat media are generally compressed for both storage and streaming increasing consumer demand for streaming of high definition hd content has led the industry to develop a number of technologies such as wirelesshd  or itut ghn which are optimized for streaming hd content without forcing the user to install new networking cables in 1996 digital pioneer marc scarpa produced the first largescale online live broadcast in history the adam yauchled tibetan freedom concert an event that would define the format of social change broadcasts scarpa continued to pioneer in the streaming media world with projects such as woodstock 99 townhall with president clinton and more recently covered cas campaign tell a friend get covered which was live streamed on youtube as of 2016 a media stream can be streamed either live or on demand live streams are generally provided by a means called true streaming true streaming sends the information straight to the computer or device without saving the file to a hard disk ondemand streaming is provided by a means called progressive streaming or progressive download progressive streaming saves the file to a hard disk and then is played from that location ondemand streams are often saved to hard disks and servers for extended amounts of time while the live streams are only available at one time only eg during the football game16 streaming media is increasingly being coupled with use of social media for example sites such as youtube encourage social interaction in webcasts through features such as live chat online surveys user posting of comments online and more furthermore streaming media is increasingly being used for social business and elearning17 due the popularity of the streaming medias many developers have introduced free hd movie streaming apps for the people who use smaller devices such as tablets and smartphones for everyday purposes the horowitz research state of pay tv ott and svod 2017 report said that 70 percent of those viewing content did so through a streaming service and that 40 percent of tv viewing was done this way twice the number from five years earlier millennials the report said streamed 60 percent of content18 transition from a dvd based to streaming based viewing cultureedit one of the movie streaming industry’s largest impacts has been on the dvd industry which effectively met its demise with the mass popularization of online content the rise of media streaming has caused the downfall of many dvd rental companies such as blockbuster in july of 2015 an article from the new york times published an article about netflixs dvd services it stated that netflix is continuing their dvd services with 53 million subscribers which is a significant drop from the previous year on the other hand their streaming services have 65 million members19 in a march 2016 study assessing the “impact of movie streaming over traditional dvd movie rental” it was found that respondents do not purchase dvd movies nearly as much anymore if ever as streaming has taken over the market according to the study viewers did not find movie quality to be significantly different between dvd and online streaming issues that respondents believed needed improvement with movie streaming included functions of fast forwarding or rewinding as well as search functions 20 the article highlights that the quality of movie streaming as an industry will only increase in time as advertising revenue continues to soar on a yearly basis throughout the industry providing incentive for quality content production 20 bandwidth and storageedit unicast connections require multiple connections from the same streaming server even when it streams the same content a broadband speed of 2 mbits or more is recommended for streaming standard definition video without experiencing buffering or skips especially live video21 for example to a roku apple tv google tv or a sony tv bluray disc player 5 mbits is recommended for high definition content and 9 mbits for ultrahigh definition content22 streaming media storage size is calculated from the streaming bandwidth and length of the media using the following formula for a single user and file requires a storage size in megabytes which is equal to length in seconds × bit rate in bits 8 × 1024 × 1024 for example one hour of digital video encoded at 300 kbits this was a typical broadband video in 2005 and it was usually encoded in a 320 × 240 pixels window size will be 3600 s × 300000 bits 8×1024×1024 requires around 128 mb of storage if the file is stored on a server for ondemand streaming and this stream is viewed by 1000 people at the same time using a unicast protocol the requirement is 300 kbits × 1000 300000 kbits 300 mbits of bandwidth this is equivalent to around 135 gb per hour using a multicast protocol the server sends out only a single stream that is common to all users therefore such a stream would only use 300 kbits of serving bandwidth see below for more information on these protocols the calculation for live streaming is similar assuming that the seed at the encoder is 500 kbits and if the show lasts for 3 hours with 3000 viewers then the calculation is number of mbs transferred encoder speed in bits × number of seconds × number of viewers 810241024 the results of this calculation are as follows number of mbs transferred 500 x 1024 bits × 3 × 3600 3 hours × 3000 number of viewers 810241024 1977539 mb protocolsedit the audio stream is compressed to make the file size smaller using an audio coding format such as mp3 vorbis aac or opus the video stream is compressed using a video coding format to make the file size smaller video coding formats include h264 hevc vp8 or vp9 encoded audio and video streams are assembled in a container bitstream such as mp4 flv webm asf or isma the bitstream is delivered from a streaming server to a streaming client eg the computer user with their internetconnected laptop using a transport protocol such as adobes rtmp or rtp in the 2010s technologies such as apples hls microsofts smooth streaming adobes hds and nonproprietary formats such as mpegdash have emerged to enable adaptive bitrate streaming over http as an alternative to using proprietary transport protocols often a streaming transport protocol is used to send video from an event venue to a cloud transcoding service and cdn which then uses httpbased transport protocols to distribute the video to individual homes and users23 the streaming client the end user may interact with the streaming server using a control protocol such as mms or rtsp protocol challengesedit designing a network protocol to support streaming media raises many problems datagram protocols such as the user datagram protocol udp send the media stream as a series of small packets this is simple and efficient however there is no mechanism within the protocol to guarantee delivery it is up to the receiving application to detect loss or corruption and recover data using error correction techniques if data is lost the stream may suffer a dropout the realtime streaming protocol rtsp realtime transport protocol rtp and the realtime transport control protocol rtcp were specifically designed to stream media over networks rtsp runs over a variety of transport protocols while the latter two are built on top of udp another approach that seems to incorporate both the advantages of using a standard web protocol and the ability to be used for streaming even live content is adaptive bitrate streaming http adaptive bitrate streaming is based on http progressive download but contrary to the previous approach here the files are very small so that they can be compared to the streaming of packets much like the case of using rtsp and rtp24 reliable protocols such as the transmission control protocol tcp guarantee correct delivery of each bit in the media stream however they accomplish this with a system of timeouts and retries which makes them more complex to implement it also means that when there is data loss on the network the media stream stalls while the protocol handlers detect the loss and retransmit the missing data clients can minimize this effect by buffering data for display while delay due to buffering is acceptable in video on demand scenarios users of interactive applications such as video conferencing will experience a loss of fidelity if the delay caused by buffering exceeds 200 ms25 multicasting broadcasts the same copy of the multimedia over the entire network to a group of clients unicast protocols send a separate copy of the media stream from the server to each recipient unicast is the norm for most internet connections but does not scale well when many users want to view the same television program concurrently multicast protocols were developed to reduce the servernetwork loads resulting from duplicate data streams that occur when many recipients receive unicast content streams independently these protocols send a single stream from the source to a group of recipients depending on the network infrastructure and type multicast transmission may or may not be feasible one potential disadvantage of multicasting is the loss of video on demand functionality continuous streaming of radio or television material usually precludes the recipients ability to control playback however this problem can be mitigated by elements such as caching servers digital settop boxes and buffered media players ip multicast provides a means to send a single media stream to a group of recipients on a computer network a multicast protocol usually internet group management protocol is used to manage delivery of multicast streams to the groups of recipients on a lan one of the challenges in deploying ip multicast is that routers and firewalls between lans must allow the passage of packets destined to multicast groups if the organization that is serving the content has control over the network between server and recipients ie educational government and corporate intranets then routing protocols such as protocol independent multicast can be used to deliver stream content to multiple local area network segments as in mass delivery of content multicast protocols need much less energy and other resources widespread introduction of reliable multicast broadcastlike protocols and their preferential use wherever possible is a significant ecological and economic challengecitation needed peertopeer p2p protocols arrange for prerecorded streams to be sent between computers this prevents the server and its network connections from becoming a bottleneck however it raises technical performance security quality and business issues applications and marketingedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it december 2016 useful – and typical – applications of the streaming concept are for example long video lectures performed online on the internet26 an advantage of this presentation is that these lectures can be very long indeed although they can always be interrupted or repeated at arbitrary places there are also new marketing concepts for example the berlin philharmonic orchestra sells internet live streams of whole concerts instead of several cds or similar fixed media by their socalled digital concert hall 27 using youtube for trailing purposes only these online concerts are also spread over a lot of different places – cinemas – at various places on the globe a similar concept is used by the metropolitan opera in new york many successful startup ventures have based their business on streaming media28 there also is a livestream from the international space station2930 recordingedit media that is live streamed can be recorded through certain media players such as vlc player or through the use of a screen recorder livestreaming platforms such as twitch
