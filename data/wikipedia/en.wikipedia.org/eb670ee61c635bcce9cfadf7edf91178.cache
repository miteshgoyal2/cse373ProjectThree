ba at michigan state university and a ma at duke university during world war ii he served in the american armed forces and corresponded with a libertarian writer isabel paterson who helped to shape his early political thought after reading albert jay nocks book our enemy the state he engaged in a similar correspondence with him after the war he attended the university of st andrews in scotland in 1953 he became the only american to be awarded the degree of doctor of letters by that university3 kirk laid out a postworld war ii program for conservatives by warning them a handful of individuals some of them quite unused to moral responsibilities on such a scale made it their business to extirpate the populations of nagasaki and hiroshima we must make it our business to curtail the possibility of such snap decisions4 upon completing his studies kirk took up an academic position at his alma mater michigan state he resigned in 1959 after having become disenchanted with that universitys academic standards rapid growth in student numbers and emphasis on intercollegiate athletics and technical training at the expense of the traditional liberal arts thereafter he referred to michigan state as cow college or behemoth university he later wrote that academic political scientists and sociologists were as a breed—dull dogs5 late in life he taught one semester a year at hillsdale college where he was distinguished visiting professor of humanitiescitation needed kirk frequently published in two american conservative journals he helped found national review in 1955 and modern age in 1957 he was the founding editor of the latter 1957–59 later he was made a distinguished fellow of the heritage foundation where he gave a number of lectures6 after leaving michigan state

influence on american politics and intellectual life in 1963 kirk converted to catholicism and married annette courtemanche they had four daughters she and kirk became known for their hospitality welcoming many political philosophical and literary figures in their mecosta house known as piety hill and giving shelter to political refugees hoboes and others7 their home became the site of a sort of seminar on conservative thought for university students piety hill now houses the russell kirk center for cultural renewal after his conversion to catholicism kirk was a founding board member of una voce america8 kirk declined to drive calling cars mechanical jacobins and would have nothing to do with television and what he called electronic computerscitation needed kirk did not always

socialist party candidate9 in the 1976 presidential election he voted for eugene mccarthy10 in 1992 he supported pat buchanans primary challenge to incumbent george h w bush serving as state chair of

contributed materially to the 20th century burke revival it also drew attention to conservative statesmen such as john adams alexander hamilton fisher ames george canning john c calhoun john randolph of roanoke joseph de maistre benjamin disraeli and arthur balfour the conservative implications of writings by wellknown authors such as samuel taylor coleridge sir walter scott alexis de tocqueville james fenimore cooper nathaniel hawthorne james russell lowell george gissing george santayana robert frost and t s eliot british and american authors such as fisher ames john randolph of roanoke orestes brownson john henry newman walter bagehot henry james sumner maine william edward hartpole lecky edwin lawrence godkin william hurrell mallock leslie stephen albert venn dicey robert nisbet paul elmer more and irving babbitt the portable conservative reader 1982 which kirk edited contains sample writings by most of the above biographer bradley j birzer argues that for all his importance in inspiring the modern conservative movement not many of his followers agreed with his unusual approach to the history of conservatism as summarized by reviewer drew maciag as birzers study demonstrates kirks understanding of conservatism was so unique idiosyncratic transcendental elitist and in certain respects premodern and european that it bore little resemblance to political conservatism in the united states conservative mind successfully launched an intellectual challenge to postwar liberalism but the variety of conservatism kirk preferred found few takers even within the american right 12 harry jaffa a student of leo strauss wrote kirk was a poor burke scholar burkes attack on metaphysical reasoning related only to modern philosophys attempt to eliminate skeptical doubt from its premises and hence from its conclusions13 russello 2004 argues that kirk adapted what 19thcentury american catholic thinker orestes brownson called territorial democracy to articulate a version of federalism that was based on premises that differ in part from those of the founders and other conservatives kirk further believed that territorial democracy could reconcile the tension between treating the states as mere provinces of the central government and as autonomous political units independent of washington finally territorial democracy allowed kirk to set out a theory of individual rights grounded in the particular historical circumstances of the united states while rejecting a universal conception of such rights principlesedit kirk developed six canons of conservatism which russello 2004 described as follows a belief in a transcendent order which kirk described variously as based in tradition divine revelation or natural law an affection for the variety and mystery of human existence a conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions a belief that property and freedom are closely linked a faith in custom convention and prescription and a recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs which entails a respect for the political value of prudence kirk said that christianity and western civilization are unimaginable apart from one another14 and that all culture arises out of religion when religious faith decays culture must decline though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief15not in citation given kirk and libertarianismedit kirk grounded his burkean conservatism in tradition political philosophy belles lettres and the strong religious faith of his later years rather than libertarianism and free market economic reasoning the conservative mind hardly mentions economics at all in a polemic kirk quoting t s eliots expression called libertarians chirping sectaries adding that conservatives and libertarians share opposition to collectivism the totalist state and bureaucracy but otherwise have nothing in common he called the libertarian movement an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder but rarely conjugating he said a line of division exists between believers in some sort of transcendent moral order and utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct he included libertarians in the latter category16 kirk therefore questioned the fusionism between libertarians and traditional conservatives that marked much of postworld war ii conservatism in the united states17 kirks view of classical liberals is positive though he agrees with them on ordered liberty as they make common cause with regular conservatives against the menace of democratic despotism and economic collectivism18 tibor r machan defended libertarianism in response to kirks original heritage lecture machan argued that the right of individual sovereignty is perhaps most worthy of conserving from the american political heritage and that when conservatives themselves talk about preserving some tradition they cannot at the same time claim a disrespectful distrust of the individual human mind of rationalism itself19 jacob g hornberger of the future of freedom foundation also responded to kirk20 kirk and neoconservatismedit late in life kirk grew disenchanted with american neoconservatives as well21 as chronicles editor scott richert describes it one line helped define the emerging struggle between neoconservatives and paleoconservatives not seldom has it seemed kirk declared as if some eminent neoconservatives mistook tel aviv for the capital of the united states a few years later in another heritage foundation speech kirk repeated that line verbatim in the wake of the gulf war which he had opposed he clearly understood that those words carried even greater meaning22 he also commented the neoconservatives were often clever never wisecitation needed midge decter director of the committee for the free world called kirks remark a bloody outrage a piece of antisemitism by kirk that impugns the loyalty of neoconservatives23 she told the new republic its this notion of a christian civilization you have to be part of it or youre not really fit to conserve anything thats an old line and its very ignorant24 samuel t francis called kirks tel aviv remark a wisecrack about the slavishly proisrael sympathies among neoconservatives24 he described decters response as untrue reckless and vitriolic furthermore he argued that such a denunciation always plays into the hands of the left which is then able to repeat the charges and claim conservative endorsement of them24 kirk and the gulf waredit toward the end of his life russell kirk was highly critical of republican militarism president bush kirk said had embarked upon a radical course of intervention in the region of the persian gulf2526 excerpts from russell kirks lectures at the heritage foundation 199227 presidents woodrow wilson franklin roosevelt and lyndon johnson were enthusiasts for american domination of the world now george bush appears to be emulating those eminent democrats when the republicans once upon a time nominated for the presidency a one world candidate wendell willkie they were sadly trounced in general republicans throughout the twentieth century have been advocates of prudence and restraint in the conduct of foreign affairs28 unless the bush administration abruptly reverses its fiscal and military course i suggest the republican party must lose its former good repute for frugality and become the party of profligate expenditure butter and guns and public opinion would not long abide that nor would americas world influence and americas remaining prosperity28 yet presidents of the united states must not be encouraged to make perpetual war for perpetual peace nor to fancy that they can establish a new world order through eliminating dissenters in the second century before christ the romans generously liberated the greek citystates from the yoke of macedonia but it was not long before the romans felt it necessary to impose upon those quarrelsome greeks a domination more stifling to hellenic freedom and culture than ever macedon had been it is a duty of the congress of the united states to see that great american caesars do not act likewise28 man of lettersedit kirks other important books include eliot and his age t s eliots moral imagination in the twentieth century 1972 the roots of american order 1974 and the autobiographical sword of the imagination memoirs of a half century of literary conflict 1995 as was the case with his hero edmund burke kirk became renowned for the prose style of his intellectual and polemical writings29 fictionedit beyond his scholarly achievements kirk was talented both as an oral storyteller and as an author of genre fiction most notably in his telling of consummate ghost stories in the classic tradition of sheridan le fanu m r james oliver onions and h russell wakefield he also wrote other admired and muchanthologized works that are variously classified as horror fantasy science fiction and political satire these earned him plaudits from fellow creative writers as varied and distinguished as t s eliot robert aickman madeleine l’engle and ray bradbury though modest in quantity—it encompasses three novels and 22 short stories—kirks body of fiction was written amid a busy career as prolific nonfiction writer editor and speaker as with such other speculative fiction authors as g k chesterton c s lewis and j r r tolkien all of whom likewise wrote only nonfiction for their day jobs there are conservative undercurrents—social cultural religious and political—to kirks fiction his first novel old house of fear 1961 1965 as with so many of his short stories was written in a selfconsciously gothic vein here the plot is concerned with an american assigned by his employer to a bleak locale in rural scotland—the same country where kirk had attended graduate school this was kirks most commercially successful and critically acclaimed fictional work doing much to sustain him financially in subsequent years later novels were a creature of the twilight 1966 a dark comedy satirizing postcolonial african politics and lord of the hollow dark 1979 1989 set in scotland which explores the great evil inhabiting a haunted house during his lifetime kirk also oversaw the publication of three collections which together encompassed all his short stories three more such collections have been published posthumously but those only reprint stories found in the earlier volumes among his novels and stories certain characters tend to recur enriching the already considerable unity and resonance of his fictional canon though—through their themes and prosestyle—kirks fiction and nonfiction works are complementary many readers of the one have not known of his work in the other having begun to write fiction fairly early in his career kirk appears to have stopped after the early 1980s while continuing his nonfiction writing and research through his last year of life for a comprehensive bibliography of his fiction see the fiction section of his
