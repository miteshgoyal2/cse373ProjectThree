the united states postal service since 1963 the term zip an acronym for zone improvement plan1 was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and therefore more quickly zipping along when senders use the code in the postal address the basic format consists of five digits an extended zip4 code introduced in 1983 includes the five digits of the zip code a hyphen and four additional digits that determine a more specific location within a given zip code the term zip code was originally registered as a servicemark by the us postal service but its registration has since expired2

context of postal codes began with postal districtzone numbers the united states post office department uspod implemented postal zones for numerous large cities in 1943 for example mr john smith 3256 epiphenomenal avenue minneapolis 16 minnesota the 16 was the number of the postal zone from the specific city by the early 1960s a more organized system was needed and on july 1 1963 nonmandatory fivedigit zip codes were introduced nationwide three months later on october 1 1963 the us department of the post office issued its publication 59 abbreviations for use with zip code with the list of twoletter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized3 an earlier list in june had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five letters3 according to publication 59 the twoletter standard was based on a maximum 23position line because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems3 which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multiletter state abbreviation such as sacramento calif along with the zip code the abbreviations have remained unchanged with the exception that in 1969 at the request of the canadian postal administration the abbreviation for nebraska was changed from nb to ne to avoid confusion with the canadian province of new brunswick3 robert moon is considered the father of the zip code he submitted his proposal in 1944 while working as a postal inspector4 the post office gives credit to moon only for the first three digits of the zip code which describe the sectional center facility scf or sec center an scf is a central mail processing facility with those three digits the scf sorts mail to all post offices with those first three digits in their zip codes the mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the zip code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public though the building may include a post office open to the public and most of their employees work night shift mail picked up at post offices is sent to their own scf in the afternoon where the mail is sorted overnight in the cases of large cities the last two digits coincided with the older postal zone numbercitation needed thus mr john smith 3256 epiphenomenal avenue minneapolis mn 55416 in 1967 these became mandatory for second and thirdclass bulk mailers and the system was soon adopted generally the united states post office used a cartoon character which it called mr zip to promote the use of the zip code he was often depicted with a legend such as use zip code in the selvage of panes of stamps or on labels contained in or the covers of booklet panes of stamps zip4edit in 1983 the us postal service introduced an expanded zip code system that it called zip4 often called plusfour codes addon codes or addons a zip4 code uses the basic fivedigit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the fivedigit delivery area such as a city block a group of apartments an individual highvolume receiver of mail a post office box or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery but initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plusfour code is not required5 in general mail is read by a multiline optical character reader mlocr that almost instantly determines the correct zip4 code from the address—along with the even more specific delivery point—and sprays an intelligent mail barcode im on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits—nine for the zip4 code and two for the delivery point for post office boxes the general but not invariable rule is that each box has its own zip4 code the addon code is often one of the following the last four digits of the box number eg po box 107050 albany ny 122017050 zero plus the last three digits of the box number eg po box 17727 eagle river ak 995770727 or if the box number consists of fewer than four digits enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a fourdigit number eg po box 77 juneau ak 997500077 however there is no uniform rule so the zip4 code must be looked up individually for each boxcitation needed postal bar codeedit the zip code is often translated into an intelligent mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort a barcode can be printed by the sender some wordprocessing programs such as wordperfect6 and microsoft word7 include the feature but is not recommended as the address to zip lookup tables can be significantly out of date it is better to let the post office put one on when it processes the piece in general the post office uses ocr technology though in some cases a human may have to read and enter the address customers who send bulk mail can get a discount on postage if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail this requires more than just a simple font mailing lists must be standardized with uptodate coding accuracy support system casscertified software that adds and verifies a full correct zip4 code and an additional two digits representing the exact delivery pointcitation needed furthermore mail must be sorted in a specific scheme to an 11 digit zip with at least 150 mailpieces for each qualifying zip code and must be accompanied by documentation verifying this these steps are usually done with pavecertified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags this means that every single mailable point in the country has its own 12digit number at least in theory the deliverypoint digits the 10th and 11th digits are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address the usps publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the cass technical guide8 however when confronted with two addresses like 18 and 18c often cass will assign the same 12digit number to two distinct mail delivery points the last digit is always a check digit which is obtained by summing all 5 9 or 11 digits taking the residue modulo 10 of this sum ie the remainder after dividing by 10 and finally subtracting this from 10 thus the check digit for 100010001 00 would be 7 since 1113 3≡3mod 10 and 10–37 structure and allocationedit scope and international mailedit zip codes designate delivery points within the united states including territories and overseas stations of its armed forces there are also zip codes for independent countries of the federated states of micronesia the republic of the marshall islands and the republic of palau each of which is integrated into the us postal system under a compact of free association mail to us diplomatic missions overseas is addressed as if it was to a street address in washington dc the fourdigit diplomatic pouch number is used as a building number while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word place to form a street name each mission uses a zip4 code consisting of 20521 and the diplomatic pouch number for example the mailing address of the us embassy in new delhi india would be embassy of the united states of america 9000 new delhi place washington dc 2052190009 by type and useedit us postage stamp 1973 it all depends on zip code there are four types of zip codes unique assigned to a single highvolume address post office box only used only for po boxes at a given facility not for any other type of delivery military used to route mail for the us military standard all other zip codes unique zip codes are used for governmental agencies universities businesses or buildings that receive such extremely high volumes of mail that they need their own zip codes government examples include 20505 for the central intelligence agency in washington dc 81009 for the federal citizen information center of the us general services administration gsa10 in pueblo colorado examples of private address unique zip codes include the headquarters of walmart 72716 and the empire state building 10118 an example of a po box only zip code is 22313 which is used for po boxes at the main post office in alexandria virginia such as those used by the united states patent and trademark office in the area surrounding that post office home and business mail delivery addresses use zip code 22314 which is thus a standard zip code in certain exceptional cases a nominally standardtype zip code may in practice be used as one of the three other types for example the zip code 43210 in columbus ohio is listed as a standardtype zip code however since its geographic boundaries are essentially coterminous with those of the ohio state universitys main campus it is effectively exclusive to the university even though it is not officially a uniquetype zip code by geographyedit primary state prefixesedit zip codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of us states the second and third digits together representing a region in that group or perhaps a large city and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region the main town in a region if applicable often gets the first zip codes for that region afterward the numerical order often follows the alphabetical ordercitation needed because zip codes are intended for efficient postal delivery there are unusual cases where a zip code crosses state boundaries such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state for example zip code 42223 serves fort campbell which spans christian county kentucky and montgomery county tennessee and zip code 97635 includes portions of lake county oregon and modoc county california in general the first three digits designate a sectional center facility the mail sorting and distribution center for an area a sectional center facility may have more than one threedigit code assigned to it for example the northern virginia sectional center facility in merrifield is assigned codes 220 221 222 and 223 in some cases a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region for example 739 in oklahoma is assigned to liberal kansas 865 in arizona is assigned to gallup new mexico and 961 in california to reno nevada in terms of geographic location many of the lowest zip codes which begin with 0 are in the new england region also in the 0 region are new jersey noncontiguous with the remainder of the 0 area puerto rico the us virgin islands and apofpo military addresses for personnel stationed in europe africa southwest asia and aboard vessels based in the waters adjoining those lands the lowest zip code is in holtsville new york 00501 a zip code exclusively for the us internal revenue service center there11 other low zip codes are 00601 for adjuntas puerto rico 01001 for agawam massachusetts and the zip codes 01002 and 01003 for amherst massachusetts 01002 is used for mail in town while 01003 is reserved for the university of massachusetts amherst until 2001 there were six zip codes lower than 00501 that were numbered from 00210 to 00215 located in portsmouth new hampshire and were used by the diversity immigrant visa program to receive applications from nonus citizenscitation needed the numbers increase southward along the east coast such as 02115 boston 10001 new york city 19103 philadelphia 21201 baltimore 20008 washington dc 30303 atlanta and 33130 miami these are only examples as each of these cities contain several zip codes in the same range from there the numbers increase heading westward and northward east of the mississippi river southward west of the mississippi river and northward on the west coast for example 40202 is in louisville 50309 in des moines 60601 in chicago 63101 in st louis 77063 in houston 80202 in denver 94111 in san francisco 98101 in seattle and 99950 in ketchikan alaska the highest zip code zip code zones in the us the first digit of the zip code is allocated as follows 0 connecticut ct massachusetts ma maine me new hampshire nh new jersey

sectional center facilitys area crosses state lines that facility is assigned separate threedigit prefixes for the states that it serves in some urban areas like 462 for marion county indiana the threedigit prefix will often exist in one county while in rural and most suburban areas the prefix will exist in multiple counties for example the neighboring 476 prefix is found in part or entirely in six counties gibson pike posey spencer vanderburgh and warrick in some cases an urban county may have more than one prefix this is the case with allen 467 468 lake 464 463 st joseph 465 466 and vanderburgh 476 477 counties cities like chicago houston los angeles and new york city have multiple prefixes within their city limits in some cases these may be served from the same scf such as in san diego county california where the threedigit prefixes 919 and 920 are used for suburban and rural communities and 921 for the city of san diego itself although all three are processed through the same scf facilitycitation needed despite the geographic derivation of most zip codes the codes themselves do not represent geographic regions in general they correspond to address groups or delivery routes as a consequence zip code areas can overlap be subsets of each other or be artificial constructs with no geographic area such as 095 for mail to the navy which is not geographically fixed in similar fashion in areas without regular postal routes rural route areas or no mail delivery undeveloped areas zip codes are not assigned or are based on sparse delivery routes and hence the boundary between zip code areas is undefined for example some residents in or near haubstadt indiana which has the zip code 47639 have mailing addresses with 47648 the zip code for neighboring fort branch indiana while others living in or near fort branch have addresses with 47639 many rural counties have similar logistical inconsistencies caused by the aforementioned sparse delivery routes often known as rural routes or by some other similar designation for example almost all us government agencies in and around the capital are assigned zip codes starting with 20200 to 20599 which are washington dc zip codes even if they are not located in washington itself while the white house itself is located in zip code 20006 it has the zip code 20500 the nuclear regulatory commission is located in rockville maryland at zip code 20852 but has been assigned by the postal service the address washington dc 20555 in similar manner the zip code for the metropolitan washington airports authority a federally chartered independent authority is 20001600012 even though the physical address of the authoritys office 1 aviation circle13 is in arlington virginiacitation needed one current exception to this rule is the united states patent and trademark office uspto when the uspto was located in the crystal city neighborhood in arlington virginia it was assigned by the postal service the address washington dc 20231 despite being physically located in zip code 22202 however the uspto now uses a zip code 223131450 in zip4 assigned to its current po box in alexandria virginia14 in rare circumstances a locality is assigned a zip code that does not match the rest of the state in even rarer cases a zip code may cross state lines usually this occurs when the locality is so isolated that it is most conveniently served from a sectional center in another state examples fishers island new york bears the zip code 06390 and is served from connecticut because the only ferry service is to connecticut – all other new york zip codes excepting those at holtsville for the irs begin with 1 returned government parcels from washington dc are sent to zip codes beginning with 569 so that returned parcels are security checked at a remote facility this was put into place after the 2001 anthrax attacks some arkansas roads north of bull shoals lake can best be accessed by the protem missouri delivery unit zip code 65733 fort campbell zip code 42223 primarily in tennessee but the main entrance is in kentucky zip codes and previous zoning linesedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june 2013 learn how and when to remove this template message a zip codes address and the city name written on the same line do not necessarily mean that address is within the boundaries of that city the postal service designates one preferred place name for each zip code this may be an incorporated town or city a subentity of a large city or an unincorporated censusdesignated place or a small unincorporated community additional place names may be recognized as acceptable for a certain zip code still others are deemed not acceptable and if used may result in a delay in mail delivery preferred place names are generally the city or town in which the address is located however for many cities that have incorporated since zip codes were introduced the city name is not the preferred place name many databases automatically assign the preferred place name for a zip code without regard to any acceptable place names for example centennial colorado is divided among seven zip codes assigned to aurora englewood or littleton as its preferred place names none of these seven zip codes carries centennial as a preferred name and in the zip code directory centennial addresses are listed under those three cities since it is acceptable to write centennial in conjunction with any of the seven zip codes one can write centennial in an address in aurora englewood or littleton as long as it is in one of the shared zip codes acceptable place names are usually added to a zip code in cases where the zip code boundaries divide them between two or more cities as in the case of centennial however in many cases only the preferred name can be used even when many addresses in the zip code are in another city people sometimes must use the name of a post office rather than their own city one extreme example is zip code 85254 it was assigned the place name scottsdale arizona because it is served by the scottsdale post office but 85 of its territory is inside the city limits of neighboring phoenix another notorious example is an entire neighborhood of the city of los angeles known as beverly hills post office naturally its residents prefer the more glamorous beverly hills address and 90210 zip code but this regularly causes problems with an emergency response when dispatchers have to sort out whether a given home in 90210 is in los angeles or beverly hills similarly missouri city texas straddles harris and fort bend counties the portion within harris county is within the zip code 77071 which must use the city name of houston instead of missouri city at the same time a small portion of the city of houston is in fort bend county in the zip code 77489 and residents there must use the name missouri city for their address even though they are in houston this also occurs in some rural areas where portions of one town have their mail delivered to other post offices for example while most of the town of plainfield massachusetts is in zip code 01070 some sections of town are in the zip code area for the neighboring town of cummington with zip code 01026 only the preferred name of cummington is allowed in zip code 01026 so residents of parts of plainfield must list their address as being in cummington this phenomenon is repeated across the country the previously mentioned englewood colorado is an innerring suburb that was built out by the 1960s its post office served the area that is now the highgrowth southern tier of the denver metropolitan area and zip codes in this area were assigned englewood as their preferred place name a business community as large as downtown denver has grown in this area with headquarters for many internationally recognized corporations these companies indicate englewood as their location the preferred postal place name although they are located in other cities as a result there are really two englewoods – the city small and with a largely workingclass residential population and a number of miles away the postal englewood a vast suburban area of upscale subdivisions and office parks that have nothing to do with the city of englewood yet share a split identity with it solely because of zip codes people who say they live or work in englewood and identify closely with it may rarely enter the city in indiana the zip code for a town usually indicates the zip code for its corresponding township as nearly all of indianas small town post offices have rural routescitation needed acceptable place names also come into play in areas where citizens identify more strongly with a particular urban center than their own municipality for example allegheny county pennsylvania has 130 distinct municipalities yet many of the countys residents and even some residents of adjacent counties commonly use pittsburgh pennsylvania as their postal address on the opposite end of the spectrum in some urban areas neighborhood names may be acceptable even though they have no legal standing such as la jolla california which is the preferred place name for zip code 92037 despite the fact that la jolla is a district of san diego california and not a separate legal entity this zip code is also in the 919920 sequence used by san diego countys suburban and rural areas not in the 921 sequence used in the remainder of the city of san diego even though la jolla has always been part of san diego many zip codes are for villages censusdesignated places portions of cities or other entities that are not municipalities for example zip code 03750 is for etna new hampshire but etna is not a city or town it is a village district in the town of hanover which itself is assigned the zip code 03755 another example is zip code 08043 which corresponds to the censusdesignated place of kirkwood new jersey but serves the entirety of voorhees township this is also the case in lagrange new york a portion of which is served by the 12603 zip code based in the neighboring town of poughkeepsie the rest of lagrange is served by the lagrangeville post office lagrangeville is itself not a town at all but a section of lagrange willow grove pennsylvania served by the 19090 zip code is a village that straddles the border of upper moreland township and abington township and that post office also serves a small portion of upper dublin township furthermore nonmunicipal place names may also share zip codes with municipal place names for example west windsor township new jersey is commonly referred to in most mailing databases as princeton junction a censusdesignated place within west windsor postal designations for place names become de facto locations for their addresses and as a result it is difficult to convince residents and businesses that they are located in another city or town different from the preferred place name associated with their zip codes because of issues of confusion and lack of identity some cities such as signal hill california have successfully petitioned the postal service to change zip code boundaries or create new zip codes so their cities become the preferred place name for addresses within the zip code postal designation confusion may have financial implications for local governments because mail volume is one factor used by the us census bureau to estimate population changes between decennial census enumerationscitation needed sometimes local officials in a community that is not the preferred place name for a zip code but is an acceptable place name will advise residents to always use the name of the community because if the census estimate of that towns population is low they may receive fewer funds that are computed based on population a typical example is paddock lake wisconsin whose preferred place name is salem paddock lake is incorporated as a village within the town of salem even though there are more people in the village of paddock lake than there are in the unincorporated parts of the town of salem further confusion is caused because silver lake wisconsin which is also a village in the town of salem and is of similar size and status to paddock lake has its own zip code and post office in another case the us federal communications commission fcc denied a radio station now wnnx fm a move requiring a change in its city of license to sandy springs georgia largely because it was not a city until municipal incorporation in late 2005 despite being the seventhlargest place in the state by population the fcc cited the use of atlanta on letters of support from local organizations even though the usps forced them to use atlanta for 30328 until well after incorporation took effect currently sandy springs is only acceptable despite none of 30328 being in atlanta or anywhere else outside the sandy springs city limit this even applies to the zip code used only for po boxes at the sandy springs main post office because zip codes and their associated place names can ignore county lines problems may occur where street addresses are based on quadrant location within a county for example 30339 spans over vinings georgia and atlanta georgia in southeastern cobb county therefore every street address is labeled se and has a house number on that countys grid according to the distance from the town square in the county seat however because the usps demands the use of atlanta vinings addresses are written such that they appear to be in southeast atlanta instead of in the opposite northwest metro atlanta side division and reallocation of zip codesedit like area codes zip codes are sometimes divided and changed especially when a rural area becomes suburban typically the new codes become effective once announced and a grace period eg one year is provided in which the new and old codes are used concurrently so that postal patrons in the affected area can notify correspondents order new stationery etc15 in rapidly growing communities it is sometimes necessary to open a new sectional center facility which must then be allocated its own threedigit zipcode prefix or prefixes such allocation can be done in various ways for example when a new sectional center facility was opened at dulles airport in virginia the prefix 201 was allocated to that facility therefore for all post offices to be served by that sectional center facility the zip code changed from an old code beginning with 220 or 221 to a new code or codes beginning with 201 however when a new sectional center facility was opened to serve montgomery county maryland no new prefix was assigned instead zip codes in the 207 and 208 ranges which had previously been assigned alphabetically were reshuffled so that 207xx zip codes in the county was changed to 208xx codes while 208xx codes outside that county were changed to 207xx codes because silver spring whose postal area includes wheaton has its own prefix 209 there was no need to apply the reshuffling to silver spring instead all mail going to 209xx zip codes was simply rerouted to the new sectional center facility on the other hand depopulation may cause a post office to close and its associated zip code to be deallocated for example centralia pennsylvanias zip code 17927 was retired in 200216 elkins park pennsylvania was originally issued the 19117 zip code although it lies in montgomery county pennsylvania because of the 191 prefix which is found only in philadelphia with that lone exception auto insurance companies charged higher city premiums to that suburban location for that reason residents petitioned the usps for a 190prefix zip code which is common to the innerring pennsylvania suburbs of that city and after several attempts that were initially disapproved by the usps elkins park was finally reassigned to the 19027 zip code zip codes also change when postal boundaries are realigned for example at the same time at which the abovenoted change in montgomery county maryland took place and under pressure from thenmayor of washington dc marion barry the usps realigned the postal boundaries between washington dc and maryland to match the boundary previously many inner suburbs such as bethesda and takoma park oxon hill temple hills suitland and capitol heights had been in the washington dc postal area as a result of the change zip codes in maryland beginning with 200 were changed to new zip codes beginning with 207 208 or 209 depending on their location and zip codes straddling the dcmaryland line were split for example 20016 bethesda became 20816 while the maryland portion of 20012 takoma park became 20912 other usesedit delivery servicesedit delivery services other than the usps such as fedex united parcel service and dhl require a zip code for optimal internal routing of a package statisticsedit there are over 42000 zip codes in the united states17 zip codes are used not only for tracking of mail but also in gathering geographical statistics in the united states the us census bureau calculates approximate boundaries of zip codes areas which it calls zip code tabulation areas zctas statistical census data is then provided for these approximate areas the geographic data provided for these areas includes the latitude and longitude of the centerpoint of the zctas there are approximately 32000 zctas the reason that there is not one zcta for every zip code is that po boxes are excluded since only populated areas are included in the census data18 the census bureau provides many statistical data sets for zip codes but does not keep uptodate datasets of all zctas complete datasets providing a similar approximate geographic extent are commercially available zip codes are inherently discrete data or pointbased data as they are assigned only at the point of delivery not the spaces in between the delivery points the us census bureau then interpolates this discrete data set to create polygons or areal features representing the approximate extent of the zip code to use for mapping and data presentation zctas are not to be confused with zip codes and they are not updated as frequently as zip codes however for many research and planning purposes they are very useful and can be used with zip code data marketingedit the data is often used in direct mail marketing campaigns in a process called zipcode marketing pointofsale cashiers sometimes ask consumers their home zip code besides providing purchasingpattern data useful in determining the location of new business establishments retailers can use directories to correlate this zip code with the name on a credit card to obtain a consumers full address and telephone number zipcoded data are also used in analyzing geographic factors in risk an insuranceindustry and banking practice pejoratively known as redlining this can cause problems eg expensive insurance for people living near a town with a high crime rate and sharing its zip code while they live in a relatively crimefree town see elkins park pennsylvania above according to an online cnn news story by greg botelho posted on thursday february 10 2011 californias high court ruled thursday that retailers do not have the right to ask customers for their zip code while completing credit card transactions saying that doing so violates a cardholders right to protect his or her personal information19 legislative districtsedit zip codes cannot be used to identify legislative districts although the website of the us house of representatives has a find your representative feature that looks up congressional districts based on zip codes alone it often returns multiple districts corresponding to a single zip code2021 this is because different parts of one zip code can be in different districts22 internetedit a 1978 proposal for a nationwide system of community networks suggested using zip codes for routing23 zip code data is an integral part of dealerstore locator software on many web sites especially brickandclick websites this software processes a userinput zip code and returns a list of store or business locations usually in the order of increasing distance from the center of the input zip code as the zip system is confined to the us postal network websites that require zip codes cannot register customers outside the us many sites will either purchase postal code data of other countries or make allowances in cases where the zip code is not recognized zip codes can also be used to pull up local news stories and weather forecasts tailored to the zip code along with local television listings and channel lineups for cablesatellite or overtheair broadcast credit card securityedit main article address verification system zip codes are used in credit card authorization specifically address verification system avs when a merchant collects the entire address the zip code is an important part of avs in some cases the zip code is the only thing used for avs specifically where collecting a signature or other information is infeasible such as pay at the pump or vending machines insurance ratingedit zip codes are used by most insurance carriers to determine the rate the customer will receive higher populated areas will generally receive a higher rate but that is not always
