motown after he married berry gordys daughter hazel gordy after a couple of years of being with philly international the jacksons set their sights on one of cbs records most popular labels epic after having their previous albums spearheaded by legendary producers kenny gamble and leon huff epic allowed the jackson brothers to write and produce their own material fully for the first time in their career something that motown did not permit composing much of the album in their homemade recording studio in their gated hayvenhurst mansion the group finished recording the album within two months like many of the acts that had left motown the jacksons had to accept the possibility that they would no longer enjoy the same level of success they had while they were associated with the label—something motown itself reiterated upon hearing that longtime front man michael jackson had moved on to a fullfledged solo career following destinys release the albums lead single blame it on the boogie was written by mick jackson a germanybased british writerperformer who had his own version of the song in the uk charts at the same time as the jacksons septemberoctober 1978 it was the
