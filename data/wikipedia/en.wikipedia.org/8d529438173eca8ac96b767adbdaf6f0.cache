external links biographyedit randell was employed at english electric from 1957 to 1964 where he was working on compilers his work on algol 60 is particularly well known including the development of the compiler for the english electric kdf9 an early stack machine1 in 1964 he joined ibm where he worked at the thomas j watson research center on high performance computer architectures and also on operating system design methodology in may 1969 he became a professor of computing science at the university of newcastle upon tyne where he has been working ever since in the area of software fault tolerance and dependability he is a member of the special interest group on computers information and society sigcis of the society for the history of technology cis and a founding member of the editorial board of the ieee annals of the history of computing journal he was also a founding member of ifip wg23 programming methodology and is a founding member of ifip wg104 about dependability and fault tolerance he is a fellow of the association for computing machinery 2008 he is married to liz a teacher of french and has four children2 workedit brian randells main research interests are in the field of computer science specifically on system dependability and fault tolerance his interest in the history of computing was started by coming across the then almost unknown work of percy ludgate this was over thirty years ago when he was preparing an inaugural lecture and led to his producing the book the origins of computers this triggered his further investigation of the colossus wartime codebreaking machines1 software engineeringedit in the 1960s randell was involved in the original nato software engineering conferences in 1968 on software engineering at the time he was working at ibm in the very secret project y and then acs supercomputer projects software fault toleranceedit beginning in the 1970s randell set up the project that initiated research into the possibility of software fault tolerance and introduced the recovery block concept subsequent major developments included the newcastle connection34 and the prototype distributed secure system5 northern informatics applications agencyedit in the 1990s randell became involved in a project to improve data networking provisions in the north of england and to promote their effective use by all sectors of the community this project resulted in the setting up of niaa the northern informatics applications agency he wrote i served for several years as a member of niaas management group until my attempts to delegate this to others bore fruit niaa existed and worked to good effect for seven years6 work in genealogyedit brian randell has for many years been one of the leading members of the team of volunteers responsible for genuki the web portal for genealogy in the united kingdom and ireland he maintains the pages relating to the county of devon and has transcribed and made available online many documents of genealogical interest see alsoedit analytical engine algol algol 68 colossus computer dependability faulttolerant system friedrich l bauer national programme for it
