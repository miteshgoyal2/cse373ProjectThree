remarks about then us senator and democratic presidential candidate barack obama and his middle name hussein saying i dont want to disparage anyone because of their race their ethnicity their name—whatever their religion their father might have been ill just say this when you think about the optics of a barack obama potentially getting elected president of the united states – i mean what does this look like to the rest of the world what does it look like to the world of islam i will tell you that if he is elected president then the radical islamists the alqaida the radical islamists and their supporters will be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on september 1170 then on march 10 king defended his comments to the associated press saying obama will certainly be viewed as a savior for them thats why you will see them supporting him encouraging him71 obama said he did not take the comments too seriously describing king as an individual who thrives on making controversial statements to get media coverage he said i would hope sen mccain would want to distance himself from that kind of inflammatory and offensive remarks the mccain campaign disavowed kings comments saying john mccain rejects the type of politics that degrades our civics… and obviously that extends to congressman kings statement71 in midjanuary 2009 king acknowledged that terrorists were not dancing in the streets and in fact they have made statements against obama but he also claimed that he found obamas decision to use his middle name hussein when he was to be sworn in as the 44th

political lobbyingedit on february 26 2010 king went to the house floor to protest the democrats handling of health care reform and said lobbyists do a very effective and useful job on this hill

gates arrest controversy steve king said on the floor of the house on june 14 2010 that racial profiling was an important component of law enforcement some claim that the arizona law will bring about racial discrimination profiling first let me say mr speaker that profiling has always been an important component of legitimate law enforcement if you can’t profile someone you can’t use those common sense indicators that are before your very eyes now i think it’s wrong to use racial profiling for the reasons of discriminating against people but it’s not wrong to use race or other indicators for the sake of identifying people that are violating the law75 as an example of profiling king described an instance when a taxi driver would stop for him before he had to hail a cab just because he was in a business suit76 king said on a radio show on june 14 2010 that president barack obamas policies favored black people on g gordon liddys radio program he said the president has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race—on the side that favors the black person in the case of prof gates and officer crowley77 global warmingedit king dismissed the

reasserted that many scientists overreact when discussing the consequences of global warming80 king said that everything that might result from a warmer planet is always bad in environmentalists analysis there will be more photosynthesis going on if the earth gets warmer and if sea levels go up 4 or 6 inches i dont know if wed know that we dont know where sea level is even let alone be able to say that its going to come up an inch globally because some polar ice caps might melt because theres co2 suspended in the atmosphere81 confederate flagedit steve king displays the confederate flag

superiority of western civilizationedit king participated in a panel discussion on msnbc on july 18 201684 a panelist from esquire magazine suggested that the 2016 convention could be the last in which old white people would command the republican partys attention to which king responded this whole old white people business does get a little tired charlie id ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you are talking about where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization85 panel moderator chris hayes later described kings comments as odious and preposterous85 panel member april ryan described them as inmyface racism86 that evening king was asked about his comments during an interview with abc news king said he had meant to say that western civilization rather than white people is the superior culture he said that when you describe western civilization that can mean much of western civilization happens to be caucasians but we should not apologize for our culture or our civilization the contributions that were made by western civilization itself and by americans by americans of all races stand far above the rest of the world the western civilization and the american civilization are a superior culture878889 2016 presidential election supportedit
