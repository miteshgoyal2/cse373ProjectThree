white audience we have been proud and thought we were better than any other race any other people ladies and gentlemen we are going to stumble into hell because of our pride40 in 1957 grahams stance towards integration became more publicly shown when he allowed africanamerican ministers thomas kilgore and gardner taylor to serve as members of his new york crusades executive committee41 and invited the rev martin luther king jr whom he first met during the montgomery bus boycott in 195541 to join him in the pulpit at his 16week revival in new york city where 23 million gathered at madison square garden yankee stadium and times square to hear them8 graham recalled in his autobiography that during this time he and king developed a close friendship and that he was eventually one of the few people who referred to king as mike a nickname which king asked only his closest friends to call him42 following kings assassination in 1968 graham mourned that america had lost a social leader and a prophet41 in private graham would also advise king and other members of the southern christian leadership conference sclc43 despite their friendship tensions between graham and king emerged in 1958 when the sponsoring committee of a crusade which took place in san antonio texas on july 25 arranged for graham to be introduced by that states segregationist governor price daniel41 on july 23 king sent a letter to graham and informed him that allowing daniel to speak at a crusade which occurred the night before the states democratic primary can well be interpreted as your endorsement of racial segregation and discrimination44 grahams advisor grady wilson replied to king that even though we do not see eye to eye with him on every issue we still love him in christ45 though grahams appearance with daniel dashed kings hopes of holding joint crusades with graham in the deep south43 the two still remained friends and king told a canadian television audience the following year that graham had taken a very strong stance against segregation43 graham and king would also come to differ on the vietnam war41 after kings beyond vietnam speech denouncing us

aftermath of the bombing of the sixteenth street baptist church and toured alabama again in the wake of the violence that accompanied the first selma to montgomery march in 196541 grahams faith prompted his maturing view of race and segregation he told a member of the ku klux klan that integration was necessary primarily for religious reasons there is no scriptural basis for segregation graham argued the ground at the foot of the cross is level and it touches my heart when i see whites standing shoulder to shoulder with blacks at the cross47 lausanne movementedit the friendship between graham and john stott led to a further partnership in the lausanne movement of which graham was founder it built on grahams 1966 world congress on evangelism in berlinclarification needed in

nations gathering for the international congress on world evangelization this took place in lausanne switzerland july 16–25 1974 and the movement which ensued took its name from the host city its purpose was to strengthen the global church for world evangelization and to engage ideological and sociological trends which bore on this49 graham invited stott to be chief architect of the lausanne covenant which issued from the congress and which according to graham helped challenge and unite evangelical christians in the great task of world evangelization50 the movement remains a significant fruit of grahams legacy with a presence in nearly every nation51 multiple rolesedit graham with his son franklin at cleveland stadium june 1994 graham played multiple roles that reinforced each other grant wacker identifies eight major roles he played preacher icon southerner entrepreneur architect or bridge builder pilgrim pastor and finally his widely recognized status as americas protestant

partisanship bailey says he declined to sign or endorse political statements and he distanced himself from the christian righthis early years of fierce opposition to communism gave way to pleas for military disarmament and attention to aids poverty and environmental threats64 graham is a registered member of the democratic party65 in 1960 he was opposed to the candidacy of john f kennedy because as a catholic he was bound to follow the pope graham worked behind the scenes to encourage influential protestant ministers to speak out against him66 graham met with a conference of protestant ministers in montreux switzerland during the 1960 campaign to discuss their mobilizing congregations to defeat kennedy67 according to the pbs frontline program god in america 2010 episode 5 graham also organized a meeting in september 1960 of hundreds of protestant ministers in washington dc to this purpose norman vincent peale led the meeting66 this was shortly before kennedys speech on the separation of church and state in houston texas which was considered to be successful in meeting concerns of many voters graham leaned toward the republicans during the presidency of richard nixon whom he had met and befriended as vice president under dwight eisenhower68 he did not completely ally himself with the later religious right saying that jesus did not have a political party16 he has given his support to various political candidates over the years68 he refused to join jerry falwells moral majority in 1979 saying im for morality but morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice we as clergy know so very little to speak with authority on the panama canal or superiority of armaments evangelists cannot be closely identified with any particular party or person we have to stand in the middle in order to preach to all people right and left i havent been faithful to my own advice in the past i will be in the future47 according to a 2006 newsweek interview for graham politics is a secondary to the gospel when newsweek asked graham whether ministers—whether they think of themselves as evangelists pastors or a bit of both—should spend time engaged with politics he replied you know i think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the lord a lot of things that i commented on years ago would not have been of the lord im sure but i think you have some—like communism or segregation on which i think you have a responsibility to speak out69 in 2012 graham publicly endorsed the republican presidential candidate mitt romney70 shortly after apparently in order to accommodate romney who is a mormon references to mormonism as a religious cult a cult is any group which teaches doctrines or beliefs that deviate from the biblical message of the christian faith were removed from grahams website7172 observers have questioned whether the support of republican and religious right politics on issues such as samesex marriage coming from graham—who no longer speaks in public or to reporters—in fact reflects the views of his son franklin head of the bgea franklin has denied this and says that he will continue to act as his fathers spokesperson rather than allowing press conferences73 pastor to presidentsedit president ronald reagan and first lady nancy reagan greet graham at the national prayer breakfast of 1981 graham has had a personal audience with many sitting us presidents from harry s truman to barack obama—12 consecutive presidents after meeting with truman in 1950 graham told the press he had urged the president to counter communism in north korea truman disliked him and did not speak with him for years after that meeting16 later he always treated his conversations with presidents as confidential68 1966 graham became a regular visitor during the tenure of dwight d eisenhower he purportedly urged him to intervene with federal troops in the case of the little rock nine to gain admission of black students to public schools16 at that time graham met and would become close friends with vice president richard nixon68 after a special lawdubious – discuss was passed in 1952 graham conducted the first religious service on the steps of the capitol building16 the evangelist actively supported quaker nixon for the presidency in 1960 even to the extent of convening an august strategy session of evangelical leaders in montreaux switzerland to plan how best to oppose nixons roman catholic opponent senator john f kennedy74 eisenhower asked for graham while on his deathbed75 since the eisenhower years the preacher enjoyed a friendship with nixon76 he supported him over john f kennedy in the 1960 presidential election16 though a registered democrat graham also maintained firm support towards aggression against the foreign threat of communism and strongly sympathized with nixons views regarding american foreign policy76 thus he was more sympathetic to republican administrations6877 on december 16 1963 us president lyndon b johnson who was impressed by the way graham had praised the work of his greatgrandfather rev george washington baines invited graham to the white house to give him spiritual counseling5 after this visit johnson frequently would call on graham for more spiritual counseling as well as companionship78 as graham recalled to his biographer frady i almost used the white house as a hotel when johnson was president he was always trying to keep me there he just never wanted me to leave78 in striking contrast with his more limited access with truman eisenhower and kennedy graham would not only visit the white house private quarters but would also at times kneel at johnsons bedside and then pray with him whenever the president requested him to do so78 graham once recalled i have never had many people do that78 in addition to his white house visits graham would visit johnson at camp david and occasionally met with the president when he retreated to his private ranch in stonewall texas78 johnson would also become the first sitting president to attend one of grahams crusades which took place in houston texas in 196578 during the 1964 us presidential election supporters of republican nominee barry goldwater sent an estimate 2 million telegrams to grahams hometown of montreat north carolina and sought the preachers endorsement79 supportive of johnsons domestic policies80 and hoping to preserve his friendship with the president80 graham resisted pressure to endorse goldwater and stayed neutral in the election80 following johnsons election victory grahams role as the main white house pastor was solidified80 at one point johnson even considered making graham a member of his cabinet and grooming him to be his successor80 though graham insisted he had no political ambitions and wished to remain a preacher80 grahams biographer david aikman acknowledged that the preacher was closer to johnson than any other president he had ever known5 he spent the last night of johnsons presidency in the white house and he stayed for the first night of nixons75 after nixons victorious 1968 presidential campaign graham became an adviser regularly visiting the white house and leading the presidents private worship services68 in a meeting they had with golda meir nixon offered graham the ambassadorship to israel but he refused16 billy graham meeting with president barack obama in montreat april 2010 in 1970 nixon appeared at a graham revival in east tennessee which they thought safe politically it drew one of the largest crowds in tennessee and protesters against the vietnam war nixon was the first president to give a speech from an evangelists platform68 their friendship became strained in 1973 when graham rebuked nixon for his postwatergate behavior and the profanity heard on the watergate tapes81 they eventually reconciled after nixons resignation68 graham was criticized by some for being too attracted to the seat of political power graham officiated at one presidential burial and one presidential funeral he presided over the graveside services of president lyndon johnson in 1973 and took part in eulogizing the former president graham officiated at the funeral services of former first lady pat nixon in 199316 and the death and funeral of richard nixon in 1994 he was unable to attend the state funeral of ronald reagan on june 11 2004 as he was recovering from hip replacement surgery82 this was mentioned by george bush in his eulogy on april 25 2010 president barack obama visited graham at his home in montreat north carolina where they had a private prayer83 foreign policy viewsedit graham has been outspoken against communism and supported the american cold war policy including the vietnam war in a 1999 speech graham discussed his relationship with the late north korean leader kim ilsung praising him as a different kind of communist and one of the great fighters for freedom in his country against the japanese graham went on to note that although he had never met kims son and former north korean leader kim jongil he had exchanged gifts with him84 graham gave a globe surmounted with doves to the north korean friendship museum81 in 1982 graham preached in the soviet union and attended a wreathlaying ceremony to honor the war dead of world war ii when the soviets were american allies in the fight against nazism he voiced fear of a second holocaust not against jews but a nuclear holocaust and advised that our greatest contribution to world peace is to live with christ every day85 in march 1991 graham said in reference to the persian gulf war as president bush has said it is not the people of iraq we are at war with it is some of the people in that regime pray for peace in the middle east a just peace86 graham had earlier said that there come times when we have to fight for peace he went on to say that out of the war in the gulf may come a new peace and as suggested by the president a new world order87 controversyedit discussion of jews with president nixonedit during the watergate affair there were suggestions that graham had agreed with many of president richard nixons antisemitic opinions but he denied them and stressed his efforts to build bridges to the jewish community in 2002 the controversy was renewed when declassified richard nixon tapes confirmed remarks made by graham to nixon three decades earlier88 captured on the tapes graham agreed with nixon that jews control the american media calling it a stranglehold during a 1972 conversation with nixon89 when the tapes were made public graham apologized9091 and said although i have no memory of the occasion i deeply regret comments i apparently made in an oval office conversation with president nixon some 30 years ago they do not reflect my views and i sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks92 according to newsweek magazine the shock of the revelation was magnified because of grahams longtime support of israel and his refusal to join in calls for conversion of the jews91 in 2009 more nixon tapes were released in which graham is heard in a 1973 conversation with nixon referring to jews and the synagogue of satan a spokesman for graham said that graham has never been an antisemite and that the comparison in accord with the context of the quotation in the book of revelation93 was directed specifically at those claiming to be jews but not holding to traditional jewish values94 vietnam waredit a secret thirteenpage letter written on april 15 1969 by white house chaplain billy graham to us president richard nixon was released to the public by national archives and records administration in april 1989 in which graham had encouraged nixon to utilize a military campaign to bomb dikes across north vietnam should the paris peace talks fail to reach a negotiated settlement of the us war in southeast asia graham developed his dike bombing strategy during an earlier business meeting in bangkok with his evangelists assigned to southern vietnam95 graham would later advocate to nixon that this proposed escalation of the war in southeast asia was a plan that could overnight destroy the economy of north vietnam by employing tens of thousands of north vietnamese defectors to bomb and invade the north96 estimates from the nixon administration concluded that such a military aerial bombing campaign against dikes in north vietnam would have killed approximately one million north vietnamese95 ecumenismedit after a 1957 crusade in new york some more fundamentalist christians criticized graham for his ecumenism even calling him antichrist97 graham has expressed inclusivist views suggesting that people without explicit faith in jesus can be saved in a 1997 interview with robert schuller graham said i think that everybody that loves or knows christ whether they are conscious of it or not they are members of the body of christ god is calling people out of the world for his name whether they come from the muslim world or the buddhist world or the nonbelieving world they are members of the body of christ because they have been called by god they may not know the name of jesus but they know in their hearts that they need something they do not have and they turn to the only light they have and i think that they are
