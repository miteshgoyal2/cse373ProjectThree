etymologyedit the origin of this term is obscure but is often explained as being derived from the french expression voix de ville voice of the city a second speculation is that it comes from the fifteenthcentury songs on satire by poet olivier basselin vaux de vire2 in his connections television series science historian james burke claims that the term is a corruption of the french vau de vire vire river valley in english an area known for its bawdy drinking songs and where basselin lived3 jean le houx circa 1610 collected these works as le livre des chants nouveaux de vaudevire which is probably the direct origin of the word some however preferred the earlier term variety to what manager tony pastor called its sissy and frenchified successor thus vaudeville was marketed as variety well into the 20th century beginningsedit see also comédie en vaudevilles from newspaper promotional for vaudeville character actor charles grapewin circa 1900 with its first subtle appearances within the early 1860s vaudeville was not initially a common form of entertainment the form gradually evolved from the concert saloon and variety hall into its mature form throughout the 1870s and 1880s this more gentle form was known as polite vaudeville4 in the years before the american civil war entertainment existed on a different scale certainly variety theatre existed before 1860 in europe and elsewhere in the us as early as the first decades of the 19th century theatregoers could enjoy a performance consisting of shakespeare plays acrobatics singing dancing and comedycitation needed as the years progressed people seeking diversified amusement found an increasing number of ways to be entertained vaudeville was characterized by traveling companies touring through cities and towns5 a handful of circuses regularly toured the country dime museums appealed to the curious amusement parks riverboats and town halls often featured cleaner presentations of variety entertainment compared to saloons music halls and burlesque houses which catered to those with a taste for the risqué in the 1840s the minstrel show another type of variety performance and the first emanation of a pervasive and purely american mass culture grew to enormous popularity and formed what nick tosches called the heart of 19thcentury show business6 a significant influence also came from dutch minstrels and comedians7 medicine shows traveled the countryside offering programs of comedy music jugglers and other novelties along with displays of tonics salves and miracle elixirs while wild west shows provided romantic vistas of the disappearing frontier complete with trick riding music and drama vaudeville incorporated these various itinerant amusements into a stable institutionalized form centered in americas growing urban hubs in the early 1880s impresario tony pastor a circus ringmaster turned theatre manager capitalized on middle class sensibilities and spending power when he began to feature polite variety programs in several of his new york city theatres8 the usual date given for the birth of vaudeville is october 24 1881 at new yorks fourteenth street theater when pastor famously staged the first bill of selfproclaimed clean vaudeville in new york city2 hoping to draw a potential audience from female and familybased shopping traffic uptown pastor barred the sale of liquor in his theatres eliminated bawdy material from his shows and offered gifts of coal and hams to attendees pastors experiment proved successful and other managers soon followed suit popularityedit performance bill for temple theatre detroit december 1 1902 the managers comments sent back to the circuits central office weekly follow each acts description the bill illustrates the typical pattern of opening the show with a dumb act to allow patrons to find their seats placing strong acts in second and penultimate positions and leaving the weakest act for the end to clear the house as well note that in this bill as in many vaudeville shows acts often associated with lowbrow or popular entertainment acrobats a trained mule shared a stage with acts more usually regarded as highbrow or classical entertainment opera vocalists classical musicians 1 burt jordan and rosa crouch sensational grotesque and buck dancers a good act 2 the white tscherkess trio a man and two women who do a singing turn of the operatic order they carry special scenery which is very artistic and their costumes are original and neat their voices are good and blend exceedingly well the act goes big with the audience 3 sarah midgely and gertie carlisle presenting the sketch after school they are a knockout 4 theodor f smith and jenny st georgefuller refined instrumentalists 5 milly capell european equestrienne this is her second week on account of the very pretty picture that she makes she goes as strong as she did last week 6 r j jose tenor singer the very best of them all 7 the nelson family of acrobats this act is composed of three men two young women three boys and two small girls the greatest acrobatic act extant 8 james thornton monologist and vocalist he goes like a cyclone it is a case of continuous laughter from his entrance to his exit 9 burk and andrus and their trained mule this act if it can be so classed was closed after the evening performance typical provincial venue on the circuit the opera in kirksville missouri b f keith took the next step starting in boston where he built an empire of theatres and brought vaudeville to the us and canada later e f albee adoptive grandfather of the pulitzer prizewinning playwright edward albee managed the chain to its greatest success circuits such as those managed by keithalbee provided vaudevilles greatest economic innovation and the principal source of its industrial strength they enabled a chain of allied vaudeville houses that remedied the chaos of the singletheatre booking system by contracting acts for regional and national tours these could easily be lengthened from a few weeks to two years albee also gave national prominence to vaudevilles trumpeting polite entertainment a commitment to entertainment equally inoffensive to men women and children acts that violated this ethos eg those that used words such as hell were admonished and threatened with expulsion from the weeks remaining performances or were canceled altogether in spite of such threats performers routinely flouted this censorship often to the delight of the very audience members whose sensibilities were supposedly endangered he eventually instituted a set of guidelines to be an audience member at his show and these were reinforced by the ushers working in the theater2 this polite entertainment also extended to keiths company members he went to extreme measures to maintain this level of modesty keith even went as far as posting warnings backstage such as this dont say slob or son of a gun or hully gee on the stage unless you want to be canceled peremptorily  if you are guilty of uttering anything sacrilegious or even suggestive you will be immediately closed and will never again be allowed in a theater where mr keith is in authority along these same lines of discipline keiths theater managers would occasionally send out blue envelopes with orders to omit certain suggestive lines of songs and possible substitutions for those words if actors chose to ignore these orders or quit they would get a black mark on their name and would never again be allowed to work on the keith circuit thus actors learned to follow the instructions given them by b f keith for fear of losing their careers forever2 by the late 1890s vaudeville had large circuits houses small and large in almost every sizable location standardized booking broad pools of skilled acts and a loyal national following one of the biggest circuits was martin becks orpheum circuit it incorporated in 1919 and brought together 45 vaudeville theaters in 36 cities throughout the us and canada and a large interest in two vaudeville circuits another major circuit was that of alexander pantages in his heyday pantages owned more than 30 vaudeville theaters and controlled through management contracts perhaps 60 more in both the us and canada at its height vaudeville played across multiple strata of economic class and auditorium size on the vaudeville circuit it was said that if an act would succeed in peoria illinois it would work anywhere the question will it play in peoria has now become a metaphor for whether something appeals to the american mainstream public the three most common levels were the small time lowerpaying contracts for more frequent performances in rougher often converted theatres the medium time moderate wages for two performances each day in purposebuilt theatres and the big time possible remuneration of several thousand dollars per week in large urban theatres largely patronized by the middle and uppermiddle classes as performers rose in renown and established regional and national followings they worked their way into the less arduous working conditions and better pay of the big time the capital of the big time was new york citys palace theatre or just the palace in the slang of vaudevillians built by martin beck in 1913 and operated by keith featuring a bill stocked with inventive novelty acts national celebrities and acknowledged masters of vaudeville performance such as comedian and trick roper will rogers the palace provided what many vaudevillians considered the apotheosis of remarkable careers a standard show bill would begin with a sketch follow with a single an individual male or female performer next would be an alley oop an acrobatic act then another single followed by yet another sketch such as a blackface comedy the acts that followed these for the rest of the show would vary from musicals to jugglers to songanddance singles and end with a final extravaganza – either musical or drama – with the full company these shows would feature such stars as ragtime and jazz pianist eubie blake the famous and magical harry houdini and child star baby rose marie adds gilbert9 in the newyork tribunes article about vaudeville it is said that at any given time vaudeville was employing over twelve thousand different people throughout its entire industry each entertainer would be on the road 42 weeks at a time while working a particular circuit – or an individual theatre chain of a major company10 this 1913 howto booklet for wouldbe vaudevillians was recently republished while the neighborhood character of vaudeville attendance had always promoted a tendency to tailor fare to specific audiences mature vaudeville grew to feature houses and circuits specifically aimed at certain demographic groups black patrons often segregated into the rear of the second gallery in whiteoriented theatres had their own smaller circuits as did speakers of italian and yiddish for a brief discussion of black vaudeville see theater owners booking association this foreign addition combined with comedy produced such acts as minstrel shows of antebellum america and yiddish theater pbs adds that many of these ethnic families joined in on this entertainment business and for them this traveling lifestyle was simply a continuation of the adventures that brought them to america through these acts they were able to assimilate themselves into their new home while also bringing bits of their own culture into this new world11 whiteoriented regional circuits such as new englands peanut circuit also provided essential training grounds for new artists while allowing established acts to experiment with and polish new material at its height vaudeville was rivaled only by churches and public schools among the nations premiere public gathering places another slightly different aspect of vaudeville was an increasing intrigue with the female figure the previously mentioned ominous idea of the blue envelopes led to the phrase blue material which described the provocative subject matter present in many vaudeville acts of the time2 many managers even saw this scandalous material as a marketing strategy to attract many different audiences as stated in andrew erdmans book blue vaudeville the vaudeville stage was even marked with descriptions like a highly sexualized space  where unclad bodies provocative dancers and singers of blue lyrics all vied for attention such performances highlighted and objectified the female body as a sexual delight a phenomenon that historians believe emerged in the mid19th century but more than that these historians think that vaudeville marked a time in which the female body became its own sexual spectacle more than it ever had before this sexual image began sprouting everywhere an american went the shops a restaurant the grocery store etc the more this image brought in the highest revenue the more vaudeville focused on acts involving women even acts that were as innocent as a sister act were higher sellers than a good brother act consequently erdman adds that female vaudeville performers such as julie mackey and gibsons bathing girls began to focus less on talent and more on physical appeal through their figure tight gowns and other revealing attire it eventually came as a surprise to audience members when such beautiful women actually possessed talent in addition to their appealing looks this element of surprise colored much of the reaction to the female entertainment of this time12 selected vaudeville artistsedit list of vaudeville performers a–k list of vaudeville performers lz immigrant americaedit the racial relations of irish and african americans is showcased by the cover art and lyrics of st patricks day is a bad day for coons in addition to vaudevilles prominence as a form of american entertainment it reflected the newly evolving urban inner city culture and interaction of its operators and audience making up a large portion of immigration to the united states in the mid19th century irish americans interacted with established americans with the irish becoming subject to discrimination due to their ethnic physical and cultural characteristics the ethnic stereotypes of irish through their greenhorn depiction alluded to their newly arrived status as immigrant americans with the stereotype portrayed in avenues of entertainment13 following the irish immigration wave several waves followed in which new immigrants from different backgrounds came in contact with the irish in americas urban centers already settled and being native english speakers irish americans took hold of these advantages and began to assert their positions in the immigrant racial hierarchy based on skin tone and assimilation status cementing job positions that were previously unavailable to them as recently arrived immigrants14 as a result irish americans became prominent in vaudeville entertainment as curators and actors creating a unique ethnic interplay between irish american use of selfdeprecation as humor and their diverse inner city surroundings15 the interactions between newly arrived immigrants and settled immigrants within the backdrop of the unknown american urban landscape allowed vaudeville to be utilized as an avenue for expression and understanding the often hostile immigrant experience in their new country was now used for comic relief on the vaudeville stage where stereotypes of different ethnic groups were perpetuated16 the crude stereotypes that emerged were easily identifiable not only by their distinct ethnic cultural attributes but how those attributes differed from the mainstream established american culture and identity17 harry houdini and jennie the vanishing elephant january 7 1918 coupled with their historical presence on the english stage for comic relief15 and as operators and actors of the vaudeville stage irish americans became interpreters of immigrant cultural images in american popular culture new arrivals found their ethnic group status defined within the immigrant population and in their new country as a whole by the irish on stage18 unfortunately the same interactions between ethnic groups within the close living conditions of cities also created racial tensions which were reflected in vaudeville conflict between irish and african americans saw the promotion of blackface minstrelsy on the stage purposefully used to place african americans beneath the irish in the racial and social urban hierarchy19 although the irish had a strong celtic presence in vaudeville and in the promotion of ethnic stereotypes the ethnic groups that they were characterizing also utilized the same humor as the irish donned their ethnic costumes groups such as the chinese italians germans and jews utilized ethnic caricatures to understand themselves as well as the irish20 the urban diversity within the vaudeville stage and audience also reflected their societal status with the working class constituting 23 of the typical vaudeville audience20 the ethnic caricatures that now comprised american humor reflected the positive and negative interactions between ethnic groups in americas cities the caricatures served as a method of understanding different groups and their societal positions within their cities20 the use of the greenhorn immigrant for comedic effect showcased how immigrants were viewed as new arrivals but also what they could aspire to be in addition to interpreting visual ethnic caricatures the irish american ideal of transitioning from the shanty21 to the lace curtain17 became a model of economic upward mobility for immigrant groups declineedit the continued growth of the lowerpriced cinema in the early 1910s dealt the heaviest blow to vaudeville this was similar to the advent of free broadcast televisions diminishing the cultural and economic strength of the cinema cinema was first regularly commercially presented in the us in vaudeville halls the first public showing of movies projected on a screen took place at koster and bials music hall in 1896 lured by greater salaries and less arduous working conditions many performers and personalities such as al jolson w c fields mae west buster keaton the marx brothers jimmy durante bill bojangles robinson edgar bergen fanny brice burns and allen and eddie cantor used the prominence gained in live variety performance to vault into the new medium of cinema in doing so such performers often exhausted in a few moments of screen time the novelty of an act that might have kept them on tour for several years other performers who entered in vaudevilles later years including jack benny abbott and costello kate smith cary grant bob hope milton berle judy garland rose marie sammy davis jr red skelton and the three stooges used vaudeville only as a launching pad for later careers they left live performance before achieving the national celebrity of earlier vaudeville stars and found fame in new venues the line between live and filmed performances was blurred by the number of vaudeville entrepreneurs who made more or less successful forays into the movie business for example alexander pantages quickly realized the importance of motion pictures as a form of entertainment he incorporated them in his shows as early as 1902 later he entered into partnership with the famous playerslasky a major hollywood production company and an affiliate of paramount pictures by the late 1920s most vaudeville shows included a healthy selection of cinema earlier in the century many vaudevillians cognizant of the threat represented by cinema held out hope that the silent nature of the flickering shadow sweethearts would preclude their usurpation of the paramount place in the publics affection with the introduction of talking pictures in 1926 the burgeoning film studios removed what had remained the chief difference in favor of live theatrical performance spoken dialogue historian john kenrick wrote top vaudeville stars filmed their acts for onetime payoffs inadvertently helping to speed the death of vaudeville after all when small time theatres could offer big time performers on screen at a nickel a seat who could ask audiences to pay higher amounts for less impressive live talent the newlyformed rko studios took over the famed orpheum vaudeville circuit and swiftly turned it into a chain of fulltime movie theaters the halfcentury tradition of vaudeville was effectively wiped out within less than four years22 inevitably managers further trimmed costs by eliminating the last of the live performances vaudeville also suffered due to the rise of broadcast radio following the greater availability of inexpensive receiver sets later in the decade even the hardiest in the vaudeville industry realized the form was in decline the perceptive understood the condition to be terminal the standardized film distribution and talking pictures of the 1930s confirmed the end of vaudeville by 1930 the vast majority of formerly live theatres had been wired for sound and none of the major studios were producing silent pictures for a time the most luxurious theatres continued to offer live entertainment but most theatres were forced by the great depression to economize some in the industry blamed cinemas drain of talent from the vaudeville circuits for the mediums demise others argued that vaudeville had allowed its performances to become too familiar to its famously loyal now seemingly fickle audiences there was no abrupt end to vaudeville though the form was clearly sagging by the late 1920s joseph kennedy sr in a hostile buyout acquired the keithalbeeorpheum theaters corporation kao which had more than 700 vaudeville theaters across the united states which had begun showing movies the shift of new york citys palace theatre vaudevilles epicenter to an exclusively cinema presentation on november 16 1932 is often considered to have been the death knell of vaudeville23 no single event is more reflective of its gradual withering though talk of its resurrection was heard during the 1930s and later the demise of the supporting apparatus of the circuits and the higher cost of live performance made any largescale renewal of vaudeville unrealistic architectureedit the most striking examples of gilded age theater architecture were commissioned by the big time vaudeville magnates and stood as monuments of their wealth and ambition examples of such architecture are the theaters built by impresario alexander pantages pantages often used architect b marcus priteca 1881–1971 who in turn regularly worked with muralist anthony heinsbergen priteca devised an exotic neoclassical style that his employer called pantages greek though classic vaudeville reached a zenith of capitalization and sophistication in urban areas dominated by national chains and commodious theatres smalltime vaudeville included countless more intimate and locally controlled houses smalltime houses were often converted saloons roughhewn theatres or multipurpose halls together catering to a wide range of clientele many small towns had purposebuilt theatres postvaudevilleedit as the genre declined most performers left the theatre the kid tap dancer ray wollbrinck once called the cleverest buckdancer on the vaudeville stage later became a bandleader and ended his days as a bank teller some of the most prominent vaudevillians successfully made the transition to cinema though others were not as successful some performers such as bert lahr fashioned careers out of combining live performance with radio and film roles many others later appeared in the catskill resorts that constituted the borscht belt vaudeville was instrumental in the success of the newer media of film radio and television comedies of the new era adopted many of the dramatic and musical tropes of classic vaudeville acts the rich repertoire of the vaudeville tradition was mined for prominent primetime radio variety shows such as the rudy vallée show the structure of a single host introducing a series of acts became a popular television style and can be seen consistently in the development of television from the milton berle show in 1948 to late night with david letterman in the 1980s24 the multiact format had renewed success in shows such as your show of shows with sid caesar and the ed sullivan show today performers such as bill irwin a macarthur fellow and tony awardwinning actor are frequently lauded as new vaudevillians2526 references to vaudeville and the use of its distinctive argot continue throughout western popular culture words such as flop and gag were terms created from the vaudeville era and have entered the american idiom though not credited often vaudevillian techniques can commonly be witnessed on television and in movies archivesedit the records of the tivoli
