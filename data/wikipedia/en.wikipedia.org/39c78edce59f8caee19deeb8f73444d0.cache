relocation and incarceration in camps in the western interior of the country of between 110000 and 1200005 people of japanese ancestry most of whom lived on the pacific coast 62 percent of the internees were united states citizens67 these actions were ordered by president franklin d roosevelt shortly after imperial japans attack on pearl harbor8 japanese americans were incarcerated based on local population concentrations and regional politics more than 110000 japanese americans in the mainland us who mostly lived on the west coast were forced into interior camps however in hawaii where 150000plus japanese americans composed over onethird of the population only 1200 to 1800 were also interned9 the internment is considered to have resulted more from racism than from any security risk posed by japanese americans1011 those who were as little as 116 japanese12 and orphaned infants with one drop of japanese blood were placed in internment camps13 roosevelt authorized the deportation and incarceration with executive order 9066 issued on february 19 1942 which allowed regional military commanders to designate military areas from which any or all persons may be excluded14 this authority was used to declare that all people of japanese ancestry were excluded from the west coast including all of california and parts of oregon washington and arizona except for those in government camps15 approximately 5000 japanese americans voluntarily relocated outside the exclusion zone before march 194216 while some 5500 community leaders arrested immediately after the pearl harbor attack were already in custody17 the majority of nearly 130000 japanese americans living in the us mainland were forcibly relocated from their west coast homes during the spring of 1942 the united states census bureau assisted the internment efforts by providing confidential neighborhood information on japanese americans the bureau denied its role for decades but it became public in 20071819 in 1944 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the removal by ruling against fred korematsus appeal for violating an exclusion order20 the court limited its decision to the validity of the exclusion orders avoiding the issue of the incarceration of us citizens without due process21 in 1980 under mounting pressure from the japanese american citizens league and redress organizations22 president jimmy carter opened an investigation to determine whether the decision to put japanese americans into internment camps had been justified by the government he appointed the commission on wartime relocation and internment of civilians cwric to investigate the camps the commissions report titled personal justice denied found little evidence of japanese disloyalty at the time and concluded that the incarceration had been the product of racism it recommended that the government pay reparations to the survivors in 1988 president ronald reagan signed into law the civil liberties act of 1988 which apologized for the internment on behalf of the us government and authorized a payment of 20000 equivalent to 41000 in 2016 to each camp survivor the legislation admitted that government actions were based on race prejudice war hysteria and a failure of political leadership23 the us government eventually disbursed more than 16 billion equivalent to 3240000000 in 2016 in reparations to 82219 japanese americans who had been interned and their heirs2224 of 127000 japanese americans living in the continental united states at the time of the pearl harbor attack 112000

meiji restoration—and a recession caused by the abrupt opening of japans economy to the world market—people began emigrating from the empire of japan in 1868 to find work to survive27better source needed from 1869 to 1924 approximately 200000 immigrated to the islands of hawaii mostly laborers expecting to work on the islands sugar plantations some 180000 went to the us mainland with the majority settling on the west coast and establishing farms or small businesses17 most arrived before 1908 when the gentlemens agreement between japan and the united states banned the immigration of unskilled laborers a loophole allowed the wives of men already in the us to join their husbands the practice of women marrying by proxy and immigrating to the us resulted in a large increase in the number of picture brides2728better source needed as the japaneseamerican population continued to grow european americans on the west coast resisted the new group fearing competition and exaggerating the idea of hordes of asians keen to take over whiteowned farmland and businesses groups such as the asiatic exclusion league the california joint immigration committee and the native sons of the golden west organized in response to this yellow peril they lobbied successfully to restrict the property and citizenship rights of japanese immigrants as similar groups had previously organized against chinese immigrants29 several laws and treaties attempting to slow immigration from japan were introduced beginning in the late 19th century the immigration act of 1924 following the example of the 1882 chinese exclusion act effectively banned all immigration from japan and other undesirable asian countries the 1924 ban on immigration produced unusually welldefined generational groups within the japaneseamerican community the issei were exclusively those who had immigrated before 1924 some desired to return to their homeland because no new immigration was permitted all japanese americans born after 1924 were by definition born in the us and automatically us citizens this nisei generation were a distinct cohort from their parents in addition to the usual generational differences issei men had been typically ten to fifteen years older than their wives making them significantly older than the younger children of their often large families28 us law prohibited japanese immigrants from becoming naturalized citizens making them dependent on their children to rent or purchase property communication between englishspeaking children and parents who spoke mostly or completely in japanese was often difficult a significant number of older nisei many of whom were born prior to the immigration ban had married and already started families of their own by the time the us joined world war ii30 despite racist legislation that prevented issei from becoming naturalized citizens and therefore from owning property voting or running for political office these japanese immigrants established communities in their new hometowns japanese americans contributed to the agriculture of california and other western states by introducing irrigation methods that enabled the cultivation of fruits vegetables and flowers on previously inhospitable land31 in both rural and urban areas kenjinkai community groups for immigrants from the same japanese prefecture and fujinkai buddhist womens associations organized community events and charitable work provided loans and financial assistance and built japanese language schools for their children excluded from setting up shop in white neighborhoods nikkeiowned small businesses thrived in the nihonmachi or japantowns of urban centers such as los angeles san francisco and seattlecitation needed in the 1930s the office of naval intelligence oni concerned by imperial japans rising military power in asia began conducting surveillance on japaneseamerican communities in hawaii from 1936 at the behest of president roosevelt the oni began compiling a special list of those who would be the first to be placed in a concentration camp in the event of trouble between japan and the united states in 1939 again by order of the president the oni military intelligence division and fbi began working together to compile a larger custodial detention index32 early in 1941 roosevelt commissioned curtis munson to conduct an investigation on japanese americans living on the west coast and in hawaii after working with fbi and oni officials and interviewing japanese americans and those familiar with them munson determined that the japanese problem was nonexistent his final report to the president submitted november 7 1941 certified a remarkable even extraordinary degree of loyalty among this generally suspect ethnic group33 a subsequent report by kenneth ringle delivered to the president in january 1942 also found little evidence to support claims of japaneseamerican disloyalty and argued against mass incarceration34 after pearl harboredit san francisco examiner february 1942 a japanese american unfurled this banner the day after the pearl harbor attack this dorothea lange photograph was taken in

taken by russell lee this photograph is labeled tagged for evacuation salinas california may 1942 the attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 led military and political leaders to suspect that imperial japan was preparing a fullscale attack on the west coast of the united states due to japans rapid military conquest of a large portion of asia and the pacific between 1936 and 1942 some americans feared that its military forces were unstoppable american public opinion initially stood by the large population of japanese americans living on the west coast with the los angeles times characterizing them as good americans born and educated as such many americans believed that their loyalty to the united states was unquestionable35 but six weeks after the attack public opinion along the pacific began to turn against japanese americans living on the west coast as the press and other americanscitation needed became nervous about the potential for fifth column activity though the administration including the president franklin d roosevelt and fbi director j edgar hoover dismissed all rumors of japaneseamerican espionage on behalf of the japanese war effort pressure mounted upon the administration as the tide of public opinion turned against japanese americans civilian and military officials had serious concerns about the loyalty of the ethnic japanese after the niihau incident which immediately followed the attack on pearl harbor when a civilian japanese national and two hawaiianborn ethnic japanese on the island of niihau violently freed a downed and captured japanese naval airman attacking their fellow niihau islanders in the process36 several concerns over the loyalty of ethnic japanese seemed to stem from racial prejudice rather than any evidence of malfeasance major karl bendetsen and lieutenant general john l dewitt head of the western command each questioned japaneseamerican loyalty dewitt who administered the internment program repeatedly told newspapers that a japs a jap and testified to congress i dont want any of them persons of japanese ancestry here they are a dangerous element there is no way to determine their loyalty it makes no difference whether he is an american citizen he is still a japanese american citizenship does not necessarily determine loyalty but we must worry about the japanese all the time until he is wiped off the map3738 dewitt also sought approval to conduct search and seizure operations aimed at preventing alien japanese from making radio transmissions to japanese ships39 the justice department declined stating that there was no probable cause to support dewitts assertion as the fbi concluded that there was no security threat39 on january 2 the joint immigration committee of the california legislature sent a manifesto to california newspapers which attacked the ethnic japanese who it alleged were totally unassimilable39 this manifesto further argued that all people of japanese heritage were loyal subjects of the emperor of japan the manifesto contended that japanese language schools were bastions of racism which advanced doctrines of japanese racial superiority39 the manifesto was backed by the native sons and daughters of the golden west and the california department of the american legion which in january demanded that all japanese with dual citizenship be placed in concentration camps39 internment was not limited to those who had been to japan but included a very small number of german and italian enemy aliens39 by february earl warren the attorney general of california had begun his efforts to persuade the federal government to remove all people of japanese ethnicity from the west coast39 those who were as little as 116 japanese could be placed in internment camps12 there is evidence supporting the argument that the measures were racially motivated rather than a military necessity bendetsen promoted to colonel said in 1942 i am determined that if they have one drop of japanese blood in them they must go to camp13 upon the bombing of pearl harbor and pursuant to the alien enemies act presidential proclamations 2525 2526 and 2527 were issued designating japanese german and italian nationals as enemy aliens40 information from the cdi was used to locate and incarcerate foreign nationals from japan germany and italy although germany and italy did not declare war on the us until december 11 presidential proclamation 2537 was issued on january 14 1942 requiring aliens to report any change of address employment or name to the fbi enemy aliens were not allowed to enter restricted areas violators of these regulations were subject to arrest detention and internment for the duration of the war41 executive order 9066 and related actionsedit executive order 9066 signed by franklin d roosevelt on february 19 1942 authorized military commanders to designate military areas at their discretion from which any or all persons may be excluded these exclusion zones unlike the alien enemy roundups were applicable to anyone that an authorized military commander might choose whether citizen or noncitizen eventually such zones would include parts of both the east and west coasts totaling about 13 of the country by area unlike the subsequent deportation and incarceration programs that would come to be applied to large numbers of japanese americans detentions and restrictions directly under this individual exclusion program were placed primarily on individuals of german or italian ancestry including american citizens42 march 2 1942 lieutenant general john l dewitt issued public proclamation no 1 declaring that such person or classes of persons as the situation may require would at some later point be subject to exclusion orders from military area no 1 essentially the entire pacific coast to about 1002 miles 1613 km inland and requiring anyone who had enemy ancestry to file a change of residence notice if they planned to move15 a second exclusion zone was designated several months later which included the areas chosen by most of the japanese americans who had managed to leave the first zone march 11 1942 executive order 9095 created the office of the alien property custodian and gave it discretionary plenary authority over all alien property interests many assets were frozen creating immediate financial difficulty for the affected aliens preventing most from moving out of the exclusion zones15 march 24 1942 public proclamation no 3 declares an 800 pm to 600 am curfew for all enemy aliens and all persons of japanese ancestry within the military areas43 a group of young evacuees wave from the window of a special train as it leaves seattle with bainbridge island evacuees march 30 1942 march 24 1942 general dewitt began to issue civilian exclusion orders for specific areas within military area no 143 japanese americans on bainbridge island washington were the first in the country to be subject to such an order due to the islands proximity to naval bases they were given until march 30 to prepare for removal from the island an event commemorated by the bainbridge island japanese american exclusion memorial4445 march 27 1942 general dewitts proclamation no 4 prohibited all those of japanese ancestry from leaving military area no 1 for any purpose until and to the extent that a future proclamation or order of this headquarters shall so permit or direct15 may 3 1942 general dewitt issued civilian exclusion order no 34 ordering all people of japanese ancestry whether citizens or noncitizens who were still living in military area no 1 to report to assembly centers where they would live until being moved to permanent relocation centers15 these edicts included persons of partjapanese ancestry as well anyone with at least onesixteenth equivalent to having one greatgreat grandparent japanese ancestry was eligible46 koreanamericans and taiwanese47 classified as ethnically japanese because both korea and taiwan were japanese colonies at the time were also included nonmilitary advocates for exclusion removal and detentionedit the deportation and incarceration were popular among many white farmers who resented the japanese american farmers white american farmers admitted that their selfinterest required removal of the japanese39 these individuals saw internment as a convenient means of uprooting their japaneseamerican competitors austin e anson managing secretary of the salinas vegetable growershipper association told the saturday evening post in 1942 were charged with wanting to get rid of the japs for selfish reasons we do its a question of whether the white man lives on the pacific coast or the brown men they came into this valley to work and they stayed to take over if all the japs were removed tomorrow wed never miss them in two weeks because the white farmers can take over and produce everything the jap grows and we do not want them back when the war ends either48 the roberts commission report prepared at president franklin d roosevelts request has been cited as an example of the fear and prejudice informing the thinking behind the internment program39 the report sought to link japanese americans with espionage activity and to associate them with the bombing of pearl harbor39 columnist henry mclemore who wrote for the hearst newspapers reflected the growing public sentiment that was fueled by this report i am for the immediate removal of every japanese on the west coast to a point deep in the interior i dont mean a nice part of the interior either herd em up pack em off and give em the inside room in the badlands personally i hate the japanese and that goes for all of them49 other california newspapers also embraced this view according to a los angeles times editorial a viper is nonetheless a viper wherever the egg is hatched so a japanese american born of japanese parents nurtured upon japanese traditions living in a transplanted japanese atmospherenotwithstanding his nominal brand of accidental citizenship almost inevitably and with the rarest exceptions grows up to be a japanese and not an american thus while it might cause injustice to a few to treat them all as potential enemies i cannot escape the conclusionthat such treatmentshould be accorded to each and all of them while we are at war with their race50 state politicians joined the bandwagon that was embraced by leland ford of los angeles who demanded that all japanese whether citizens or not be placed in inland concentration camps39 incarceration of japanese americans who provided critical agricultural labor on the west coast created a labor shortage which was exacerbated by the induction of many american laborers into the armed forces this vacuum precipitated a mass immigration of mexican workers into the united states to fill these jobs51 under the banner of what became known as the bracero program many japanese internees were temporarily released from their camps – for instance to harvest western beet crops – to address this wartime labor shortage52 nonmilitary advocates against exclusion removal and detentionedit like many white american farmers the white businessmen of hawaii had their own motives for determining how to deal with the japanese americans but they opposed internment instead these individuals gained passage of legislation to retain in freedom the nearly 150000 japanese americans who would have been otherwise sent to internment camps within hawaii53 as a result only 12009 to 1800 japanese americans in hawaii were interned the powerful businessmen of hawaii concluded that imprisonment of such a large proportion of the islands population would adversely affect the economic prosperity of the island state54 the japanese represented over 90 percent of the carpenters nearly all of the transportation workers and a significant portion of the agricultural laborers on the island54 general delos carleton emmons the military governor of hawaii also argued that japanese labor was ‘absolutely essential’ for rebuilding the defenses destroyed at pearl harbor54 recognizing the japaneseamerican community’s contribution to the affluence of the hawaiian economy general emmons fought against the internment of the japanese americans and had the support of most of the businessmen of hawaii54 coming to different conclusions about how to deal with the japaneseamerican community both the white farmers of the united states and the white businessmen of hawaii placed priority on protecting their own economic interests though internment was a generally popular policy in california support was not universal rc hoiles publisher of the orange county register argued during the war that the internment was unethical and unconstitutional it would seem that convicting people of disloyalty to our country without having specific evidence against them is too foreign to our way of life and too close akin to the kind of government we are fighting… we must realize as henry emerson fosdick so wisely said liberty is always dangerous but it is the safest thing we have55 statement of military necessity as justification for internmentedit play media a challenge to democracy was a twentyminute film produced in 1944 by the war relocation authority niihau incidentedit main article niihau incident the niihau incident occurred in december 1941 just after the japanese attack on pearl harbor three japanese americans on the hawaiian island of niihau assisted a japanese pilot shigenori nishikaichi who crashed there despite the incident the territorial governor of hawaii rejected calls for the mass internment of the japanese americans living there shigenori nishikaichi is buried in his hometown hashihama japan on his grave stone is written his meritorious deed will live forever56 cryptographyedit main article magic cryptography in magic the untold story of us intelligence and the evacuation of japanese residents from the west coast during world war ii david lowman a former national security agency nsa operative argues that magic magic was the codename for american codebreaking efforts intercepts posed frightening specter of massive espionage nets thus justifying internment57 lowman contended that incarceration served to ensure the secrecy of us codebreaking efforts because effective prosecution of japanese americans might necessitate disclosure of secret information if us codebreaking technology was revealed in the context of trials of individual spies the japanese imperial navy would change its codes thus undermining us strategic wartime advantage some scholars have criticized or dismissed lowmans reasoning that disloyalty among some individual japanese americans could legitimize incarcerating 120000 people including infants the elderly and the mentally ill585960 lowmans reading of the contents of the magic cables has also been challenged as some scholars contend that the cables demonstrate that japanese americans were not heeding the overtures of imperial japan to spy against the united states61 according to one critic lowmans book has long since been refuted and discredited62 the controversial conclusions drawn by lowman were defended by conservative commentator michelle malkin in her book in defense of internment the case for racial profiling in world war ii and the war on terror 200463 malkins defense of japanese internment was due in part to reaction to what she describes as the constant alarmism from bushbashers who argue that every counterterror measure in america is tantamount to the internment64 she criticized academias treatment of the subject and suggested that academics critical of japanese internment had ulterior motives her book was widely criticized particularly with regard to her reading of the magic cables656667 daniel pipes also drawing on lowman has defended malkin and said that japanese american internment was a good idea which offers lessons for today68 united states district court opinionsedit official notice of exclusion and removal a letter by general dewitt and colonel bendetsen expressing racist bias against japanese americans was circulated and then hastily redacted in 1943–1944 dewitts final report stated that because of their race it was impossible to determine the loyalty of japanese americans thus necessitating internment69 the original version was so offensive – even in the atmosphere of the wartime 1940s – that bendetsen ordered all copies to be destroyed70 in 1980 a copy of the original final report japanese evacuation from the west coast – 1942 was found in the national archives along with notes showing the numerous differences between the original and redacted versions71 this earlier racist and inflammatory version as well as the fbi and office of naval intelligence oni reports led to the coram nobis retrials which overturned the convictions of fred korematsu gordon hirabayashi and minoru yasui on all charges related to their refusal to submit to exclusion and internment72 the courts found that the government had intentionally withheld these reports and other critical evidence at trials all the way up to the supreme court which proved that there was no military necessity for the exclusion and internment of japanese americans in the words of department of justice officials writing during the war the justifications were based on willful historical inaccuracies and intentional falsehoods the ringle reportedit in may 2011 us solicitor general neal katyal after a year of investigation found charles fahy had intentionally withheld the ringle report drafted by the office of naval intelligence in order to justify the roosevelt administrations actions in the cases of hirabayashi v united states and korematsu v united states the report would have undermined the administrations position of the military necessity for such action as it concluded that most japanese americans were not a national security threat and that allegations of communication espionage had been found to be without basis by the fbi and federal communications commission73 newspaper editorialsedit editorials from major newspapers at the time were generally supportive of the internment of the japanese by the united states a los angeles times editorial dated february 19 1942 stated that “since dec 7 there has existed an obvious menace to the safety of this region in the presence of potential saboteurs and fifth columnists close to oil refineries and storage tanks airplane factories army posts navy facilities ports and communications systems under normal sensible procedure not one day would have elapsed after pearl harbor before the government had proceeded to round up and send to interior points all japanese aliens and their immediate descendants for classification and possible internment”74 an atlanta constitution editorial dated february 20 1942 stated that “the time to stop taking chances with japanese aliens and japaneseamericans has come while americans have an inate distaste for stringent measures every one must realize this is a total war that there are no americans running loose in japan or germany or italy and there is absolutely no sense in this country running even the slightest risk of a major disaster from enemy groups within the nation”75 a washington post editorial dated february 22 1942 stated that “there is but one way in which to regard the presidential order empowering the army to establish military areas from which citizens or aliens may be excluded that is to accept the order as a necessary accompaniment of total defense”76 a los angeles times editorial dated february 28 1942 stated that “as to a considerable number of japanese no matter where born there is unfortunately no doubt whatever they are for japan they will aid japan in every way possible by espionage sabotage and other activity and they need to be restrained for the safety of california and the united states and since there is no sure test for loyalty to the united states all must be restrained those truly loyal will understand and make no objection”77 a los angeles times editorial dated december 8 1942 stated that “the japs in these centers in the united states have been afforded the very best of treatment together with food and living quarters far better than many of them ever knew before and a minimum amount of restraint they have been as well fed as the army and as well as or better housed the american people can go without milk and butter but the japs will be supplied”78 a los angeles times editorial dated april 22 1943 stated that “as a race the japanese have made for themselves a record for conscienceless treachery unsurpassed in history whatever small theoretical advantages there might be in releasing those under restraint in this country would be enormously outweighed by the risks involved”79 facilitiesedit hayward california members of the mochida family awaiting evacuation bus identification tags are used to aid in keeping the family unit intact during all phases of evacuation mochida operated a nursery and five greenhouses on a twoacre site in eden township he raised snapdragons and sweet peas80 while this event is most commonly called the internment of japanese americans the government operated several different types of camps holding japanese americans the best known facilities were the militaryrun wartime civil control administration wcca assembly centers and the civilianrun war relocation authority wra relocation centers which are generally but unofficially referred to as internment camps scholars have urged dropping such euphemisms and refer to them as concentration camps and the people as incarcerated81 the department of justice doj operated camps officially called internment camps which were used to detain those suspected of crimes or of enemy sympathies the government also operated camps for a limited number of german americans and italian americans who sometimes were assigned to share facilities with the japanese americans the wcca and wra facilities were the largest and the most public the wcca assembly centers were temporary facilities that were first set up in horse racing tracks fairgrounds and other large public meeting places to assemble and organize internees before they were transported to wra relocation centers by truck bus or train the wra relocation centers were semipermanent camps that housed persons removed from the exclusion zone after march 1942 or until they were able to relocate elsewhere in the united states outside the exclusion zone doj and army internment campsedit eight us department of justice camps in texas idaho north dakota new mexico and montana held japanese americans primarily noncitizens and their families82 the camps were run by the immigration and naturalization service under the umbrella of the doj and guarded by border patrol agents rather than military police the population of these camps included approximately 3800 of the 5500 buddhist and christian ministers japaneselanguage school instructors newspaper workers fishermen and community leaders who had been accused of fifth column activity and arrested by the fbi after pearl harbor the remaining 1700 were released to wra relocation centers17 immigrants and nationals of german and italian ancestry were also held in these facilities often in the same camps as japanese americans approximately 7000 german americans and 3000 italian americans from hawaii and the us mainland were interned in doj camps along with 500 german seamen already in custody after being rescued from the ss columbus in 193883 in addition 2264

war and all civilian internees were transferred to doj camps82 wcca civilian assembly centersedit executive order 9066 authorized the removal of all persons of japanese ancestry from the west coast however it was signed before there were any facilities completed to house the displaced japanese americans after the voluntary evacuation program failed to result in many families leaving the exclusion zone the military took charge of the nowmandatory evacuation on april 9 1942 the wartime civilian control administration wcca86 was established by the western defense command to coordinate the forced removal of japanese americans to inland concentration camps the relocation centers faced opposition from inland communities near the proposed sites who disliked the idea of their new jap neighbors in addition government forces were struggling to build what would essentially be selfsufficient towns in very isolated undeveloped and harsh regions of the country they were not prepared to house the influx of over 110000 internees since japanese americans living in the restricted zone were considered too dangerous to conduct their daily business the military decided it had to house them in temporary centers until the relocation centers were completed87 under the direction of colonel karl bendetsen existing facilities had been designated for conversion to wcca use in march 1942 and the army corps of engineers finished construction on these sites on april 21 194288 all but four of the 15 confinement sites 12 in california and one each in washington oregon and arizona had previously been racetracks or fairgrounds the stables and livestock areas were cleaned out and hastily converted to living quarters for families of up to six while wood and tarpaper barracks were constructed for additional housing as well as communal latrines laundry facilities and mess halls8688 a total of 9219388 japanese americans were transferred to these temporary detention centers from march to august 1942 1802688 more had been taken directly to two reception centers that were developed as the manzanar and poston wra camps the wcca was dissolved on march 15 1943 when it became the

within nine months the wra had opened ten facilities in seven states and transferred over 100000 people from the wcca facilities the wra camp at tule lake though initially like the other camps eventually was used as a detention center for people believed to pose a security risk tule lake also served as a segregation center for individuals and families who were deemed disloyal and for those who were to be deported to japan list of campsedit there were three types of camps civilian assembly centers were temporary camps frequently located at horse tracks where japanese americans were sent

administration site where they are seeking instruction in regards to their evacuation somewhere between 110000 and 120000 people of japanese ancestry were subject to this mass exclusion program of whom about twothirds were us citizens5 the remaining onethird were noncitizens subject to internment under the alien enemies act many of these resident aliens had been inhabitants of the united states for decades but had been deprived by law of being able to become naturalized citizens also part of the west coast removal were 101 children of japanese descent taken from orphanages and foster homes within the exclusion zone94 internees of japanese descent were first sent to one of 17 temporary civilian assembly centers where most awaited transfer to more permanent relocation centers being constructed by the newly formed war relocation authority wra some of those who reported to the civilian assembly centers were not sent to relocation centers but were released under the condition that they remain outside the prohibited zone until the military orders were modified or lifted almost 1200005 japanese americans and resident japanese aliens were eventually removed from their homes in california the western halves of oregon and washington and southern arizona as part of the single largest forced relocation in us history most of these campsresidences gardens and stock areas were placed on native american reservations for which the native americans were formally compensated the native american councils disputed the amounts negotiated in absentia by us government authorities they later sued to gain relief and additional compensation for some items of dispute95 under the national student council relocation program supported primarily by the american friends service committee students of college age were permitted to leave the camps to attend institutions willing to accept students of japanese ancestry although the program initially granted leave permits to a very small number of students this eventually included 2263 students by december 31 194396 the baggage of japanese americans from the west coast at a makeshift reception center located at a racetrack an evacuee with family belongings en route to an assembly center spring 1942 curfew and exclusionedit on march 2 1942 general john dewitt commanding general of the western defense command publicly announced the creation of two military restricted zones97 military area no 1 consisted of the southern half of arizona and the western half of california oregon and washington as well as all of california south of los angeles military area no 2 covered the rest of those states dewitts proclamation informed japanese americans they would be required to leave military area 1 but stated that they could remain in the second restricted zone98 removal from military area no 1 initially occurred through voluntary evacuation16 japanese americans were free to go anywhere outside of the exclusion zone or inside area 2 with arrangements and costs of relocation to be borne by the individuals the policy was shortlived dewitt issued another proclamation on march 27 that prohibited japanese americans from leaving area 197 a nighttime curfew also initiated on march 27 1942 placed further restrictions on the movements and daily lives of japanese americans99 eviction from the west coast began on march 24 1942 with civilian exclusion order no 1 which gave the 227 japanese american residents of bainbridge island washington six days to prepare for their evacuation directly to manzanar100 colorado governor ralph lawrence carr was the only elected official to publicly denounce the internment of american citizens an act that cost his reelection but gained him the gratitude of the japanese american community such that a statue of him was erected in the denver japantowns sakura square101 a total of 108 exclusion orders issued by the western defense command over the next five months completed the removal of japanese americans from the west coast in august 1942102 conditions in the campsedit in 1943 secretary of the interior harold l ickes wrote the situation in at least some of the japanese internment camps is bad and is becoming worse rapidly103 the quality of life in the camps was heavily influenced by which government entity was responsible for them ins camps were regulated by international treaty the legal difference between interned and relocated had significant effects on those locked up ins camps were required to provide food quality and housing at the minimum equal to that experienced by the lowest ranked person in the military according to a 1943 war relocation authority report internees were housed in tar papercovered barracks of simple frame construction without plumbing or cooking facilities of any kind the spartan facilities met international laws but left much to be desired many camps were built quickly by civilian contractors during the summer of 1942 based on designs for military barracks making the buildings poorly equipped for cramped family livingcitation needed throughout many camps twentyfive people were forced to live in space built to contain four leaving no room for privacy104 dust storm at manzanar war relocation center trudging through the mud during rainy weather at the jerome relocation center the heart mountain war relocation center in northwestern wyoming was a barbedwiresurrounded enclave with unpartitioned toilets cots for beds and a budget of 45 cents daily per capita for food rationsclarification needed105 armed guards were posted at the camps which were all in remote desolate areas far from population centers internees were typically allowed to stay with their families and were treated decently unless they violated the rules there are documented instances of guards shooting internees who reportedly attempted to walk outside the fences one such shooting that of james wakasa at topaz led to a reevaluation of the security measures in the camps some camp administrations eventually allowed relatively free movement outside the marked boundaries of the camps nearly a quarter of the internees left the camps to live and work elsewhere in the united states outside the exclusion zone eventually some were authorized to return to their hometowns in the exclusion zone under supervision of a sponsoring american family or agency whose loyalty had been assured106 the phrase shikata ga nai loosely translated as it cannot be helped was commonly used to summarize the interned families resignation to their helplessness throughout these conditions this was noticed by their children as mentioned in the wellknown memoir farewell to manzanar by jeanne wakatsuki houston and james d houston further it is noted that parents may have internalized these emotions to withhold their disappointment and anguish from affecting their children nevertheless children still were cognizant of this emotional repression107 medical careedit before the war 87 physicians and surgeons 137 nurses 105 dentists 132 pharmacists 35 optometrists and 92 lab technicians provided healthcare to the japanese american population with most practicing in urban centers like los angeles san francisco and seattle as the eviction from the west coast was carried out the wartime civilian control administration worked with the united states public health service and many of these professionals to establish infirmaries within the temporary assembly centers an issei doctor was appointed to manage each facility and additional healthcare staff worked under his supervision although the usphs recommendation of one physician for every 1000 inmates and one nurse to 200 inmates was not met overcrowded and unsanitary conditions forced assembly center infirmaries to prioritize inoculations over general care obstetrics and surgeries at manzanar for example hospital staff performed over 40000 immunizations against typhoid and smallpox108clarification needed food poisoning was common and also demanded significant attention those who were interned in topaz minidoka and jerome experienced outbreaks of dysentery104 facilities in the more permanent relocation centers eventually surpassed the makeshift assembly center infirmaries but in many cases these hospitals were incomplete when inmates began to arrive and were not fully functional for several months additionally vital medical supplies such as medications and surgical and sterilization equipment were limited the staff shortages suffered in the assembly centers continued in the wra camps the administrations decision to invert the management structure and demote japanese american medical workers to positions below white employees while capping their pay rate at a 20month further exacerbated this problem at heart mountain for example japanese american doctors received 19month compared to white nurses 150month109110 the war had caused a shortage of healthcare professionals across the country and the camps often lost potential recruits to outside hospitals that offered better pay and living conditions when the wra began to allow some japanese americans to leave camp many nikkei medical professionals resettled outside camp those who remained had little authority in administration of the hospitals combined with the inequitable payment of salaries between white and japanese american employees conflicts arose at several hospitals and there were two japanese american walkouts at heart mountain in 1943108 despite a shortage of healthcare workers limited access to equipment and tension between white administrators and japanese american staff these hospitals provided much needed medical care in camp the extreme climates of the remote incarceration sites were hard on infants and elderly inmates the frequent dust storms of the high desert locations led to increased cases of asthma and coccidioidomycosis while the swampy mosquitoinfested arkansas camps exposed residents to malaria all of which were treated in camp almost 6000 live deliveries were performed in these hospitals and all mothers received pre and postnatal care the wra recorded 1862 deaths across the ten camps with cancer heart disease tuberculosis and vascular disease accounting for the majority108 education in the internment campsedit flag of allegiance pledge at raphael weill public school geary and buchanan streets april 20 1942 of the 110000 japanese americans detained by the united states government during world war ii 30000 were children111 most were schoolage children so educational facilities were set up in the camps allowing them to continue their education however did not erase the potential for traumatic experiences during their overall time in the camps112 the government had not adequately planned for the camps and no real budget or plan was set aside for the new camp educational facilities113 camp schoolhouses were crowded and had insufficient materials books notebooks and desks for students not only that the educationinstruction was all in english the schools in japanese internment camps also didnt have any books or supplies to go on as they opened the state decided to issue a few books only a month after the opening114 wood stoves were used to heat the buildings and instead of using separate rooms for different kinds of activities only partitions were used to accomplish that japanese internment camps also did not have any libraries and consequently no library books writing arm chairs or desks and no science equipment115 these ‘schoolhouses’ were essentially prison blocks that contained few windows in the southwest when temperatures rose and the schoolhouse filled the rooms would be sweltering and unbearable113 class sizes were immense at the height of it attendance the rohwer camp of arkansas reached 2339 with only 45 certified teachers116 the student to teacher ratio in the camps was 481 in elementary schools and 351 for secondary schools compared to the national average of 281117 this was due to a few things one of them was that there was a general teacher shortage in the us at the moment and the fact that the teachers were required to live in those poor conditions in the camps themselves114 “there was persistent mud or dust heat mosquitoes poor food and living conditions inadequate instructional supplies and a half mile or more walk each day just to and from the school block”118 despite the triple salary increase in the internment camps they were still unable to fill in all the needed teacher positions with certified personnel and so in the end they had to hire noncertified teacher detainees to help out the teachers as assistants114 the rhetorical curriculum of the schools was based mostly on the study of the democratic ideal and to discover its many implications119 english compositions researched at the jerome and rohwer camps in arkansas focused on these ‘american ideals’ and many of the compositions pertained to the camps responses were varied as schoolchildren of the topaz camp were patriotic and believed in the war effort but could not ignore the fact of their incarceration120 to build patriotism the japanese language was banned in the camps forcing the children to learn english and then go home and teach their parents121 sports in the internment campsedit a baseball game at manzanar picture by ansel adams c 1943 smithsonian photo of softball from heart mountain relocation center although life in the camps was very difficult japanese americans formed many different sports teams including baseball and football teams122 in january 1942 president franklin d roosevelt issued what came to be known as the green light letter to mlb commissioner kenesaw mountain landis which urged him to continue playing major league baseball games despite the ongoing war in it roosevelt said that baseball provides a recreation and this was true for japanese american incarcerees as well over 100 baseball teams were formed in the manzanar camp so that japanese americans could have some recreation and some of the team names were carryovers from teams formed before the incarceration123 both men and women participated in the sports in some cases the japanese american baseball teams from the camps traveled to outside communities to play other teams incarcerees from idaho competed in the state tournament in 1943 and there were games between the prison guards and the japanese american teams124 branch rickey who would be responsible for bringing jackie robinson into major league baseball in 1947 sent a letter to all of the wra camps expressing interest in scouting some of the nisei players in fall of 1943 three players tried out for the brooklyn dodgers in front of mlb scout george sisler however none of them made the team124 student leave to attend eastern collegesedit although most nisei college students followed their families into camp a small number tried to arrange for transfers to schools outside the exclusion zone in order to continue their education their initial efforts expanded as sympathetic college administrators and the american friends service committee began to coordinate a larger student relocation program the friends petitioned wra director milton eisenhower to place college students in eastern and midwestern academic institutions the national japanese american student relocation council was formed on may 29 1942 and the afsc administered the program125 by september 1942 after the initial roundup of japanese americans 250 students from assembly centers and wra camps were back at schoolcitation needed their tuition book costs and living expenses were absorbed by the us government private foundations and church scholarships in addition to significant fundraising efforts led by issei parents in camp outside camp the students took on the role of ambassadors of good will and the njasrc and wra promoted this image to soften antijapanese prejudice and prepare the public for the resettlement of japanese americans in their communities125 at earlham college president william dennis helped institute a program that enrolled several dozen japaneseamerican students in order to spare them from incarceration while this action was controversial in richmond indiana it helped strengthen the colleges ties to japan and the japaneseamerican community126 at oberlin college about 40 evacuated nisei students were enrolled one of them kenji okuda was elected as student council president127 in total over 600 institutions east of the exclusion zone opened their doors to more than 4000 collegeage youth who had been placed behind barbed wire many of whom were enrolled in west coast schools prior to their removal the njasrc ceased operations on june 7 1946125 loyalty questions and segregationedit in early 1943 war relocation authority officials working with the war department and the office of naval intelligence128 circulated a questionnaire in an attempt to determine the loyalty of incarcerated nisei men they hoped to recruit into military service the statement of united states citizen of japanese ancestry was initially given only to nisei who were eligible for service or would have been but for the 4c classification imposed on them at the start of the war authorities soon revised the questionnaire and required all adults in camp to complete the form most of the 28 questions were designed to assess the americanness of the respondent — had they been educated in japan or the us were they buddhist or christian did they practice judo or play on a baseball team128 the final two questions on the form which soon came to be known as the loyalty questionnaire were more direct question 27 are you willing to serve in the armed forces of the united states on combat duty wherever ordered question 28 will you swear unqualified allegiances to the united states of america and faithfully defend the united states from any and all attack by foreign or domestic forces and forswear any form of allegiance or obedience to the japanese emperor or other foreign government power or organization across the camps persons who answered no to both questions became known as no nos while most camp inmates simply answered yes to both questions several thousand — 17 percent of the total respondents 20 percent of the nisei129 — gave negative or qualified replies out of confusion fear or anger at the wording and implications of the questionnaire in regard to question 27 many worried that expressing a willingness to serve would be equated with volunteering for combat while others felt insulted at being asked to risk their lives for a country that had imprisoned them and their families an affirmative answer to question 28 brought up other issues some believed that renouncing their loyalty to japan would suggest that they had at some point been loyal to japan and disloyal to the united states many believed they were to be deported to japan no matter how they answered they feared an explicit disavowal of the emperor would become known and make such resettlement extremely difficult on july 15 1943 tule lake the site with the highest number of no responses to the questionnaire was designated to house inmates whose answers suggested they were disloyal129 during the remainder of 1943 and into early 1944 more than 12000 men women and children were transferred from other camps to the maximumsecurity tule lake segregation center after these insults the government passed the renunciation act of 1944 a law that made it possible for nisei and kibei to renounce their american citizenship a total of 5589 internees opted to do so 5461 of these were sent to tule lake130 of those who renounced us citizenship 1327 were repatriated to japan130 those persons who stayed in the us faced discrimination from the japaneseamerican community both during and after the war for having made that choice of renunciation at the time they feared what their futures held were they to remain american and remain interned130 these renunciations of american citizenship have been highly controversial for a number of reasons some apologists for internment have cited the renunciations as evidence that disloyalty or antiamericanism was well represented among the interned peoples thereby justifying the internment131 many historians have dismissed the latter argument for its failure to consider that the small number of individuals in question had been mistreated and persecuted by their own government at the time of the renunciation132133 the renunciations had little to do with loyalty or disloyalty to the united states but were instead the result of a series of complex conditions and factors that were beyond the control of those involved prior to discarding citizenship most or all of the renunciants had experienced the following misfortunes forced removal from homes loss of jobs government and public assumption of disloyalty to the land of their birth based on race alone and incarceration in a segregation center for disloyal issei or nisei133 minoru kiyota who was among those who renounced his citizenship and soon came to regret the decision has said that he wanted only to express my fury toward the government of the united states for his internment and for the mental and physical duress as well as the intimidation he was made to face134 my renunciation had been an expression of momentary emotional defiance in reaction to years of persecution suffered by myself and other japanese americans and in particular to the degrading interrogation by the fbi agent at topaz and being terrorized by the guards and gangs at tule lake135 civil rights attorney wayne m collins successfully challenged most of these renunciations as invalid owing to the conditions of duress and intimidation under which the government obtained them134136 many of the deportees were issei first generation or kibei who often had difficulty with english and often did not understand the questions they were asked even among those issei who had a clear understanding question 28 posed an awkward dilemma japanese immigrants were denied us citizenship at the time so when asked to renounce their japanese citizenship answering yes would have made them stateless persons137 when the government began seeking army volunteers from among the camps only 6 of militaryaged male inmates volunteered to serve in the us armed forcescitation needed most of those who refused tempered that refusal with statements of willingness to fight if they were restored their rights as american citizens eventually 20000 japaneseamerican men and many japaneseamerican women served in the us army during world war ii138 the 442nd regimental combat team which was composed primarily of japanese americans served with uncommon distinction in the european theatre of world war ii many of the us soldiers serving in the unit had families who were held in concentration camp in the united states while they fought abroad the 442nd regimental combat team which fought in europe was formed from those japanese americans who agreed to serve this unit was the most highly decorated us military unit of its size and duration139 the 442nds nisei segregated field artillery battalion then on detached service within the us army in bavaria liberated at least one of the satellite labor camps of the nazis original concentration camp at dachau on april 29 1945140 and only days later on may 2 halted a death march in southern bavaria141142 proving commitment to the united statesedit many nisei worked to prove themselves as loyal american citizens of the 20000 japanese americans who served in the army during world war ii138 many japaneseamerican soldiers had gone to war to fight racism at home143 and they were proving with their blood their limbs and their bodies that they were truly american144 it was not only men either some one hundred nisei women volunteered for the wac womans army corps where after undergoing rigorous basic training they had assignments as typists clerks and drivers104 satoshi ito an internment camp survivor reinforces the idea of the immigrants’ children striving to demonstrate their patriotism to the united states he notes that his mother would tell him ‘you’re here in the united states you need to do well in school you need to prepare yourself to get a good job when you get out into the larger society’145 he said she would tell him ‘don’t be a dumb farmer like me like us’146 to encourage ito to successfully assimilate into american society as a result he worked exceptionally hard to excel in school and later became a professor at the college of william mary his story along with the countless japanese americans willing to risk their lives in war demonstrate the lengths many in their community went to prove their american patriotism other concentration campsedit as early as 1939 when war broke out in europe and while armed conflict began to rage in east asia the fbi and branches of the department of justice and the armed forces began to collect information and surveil influential members of the japanese community in the united states these data were included in the custodial detention index cdi agents in the department of justices special defense unit classified the subjects into three groups a b and c with a being most dangerous and c being possibly dangerous after the pearl harbor attack roosevelt authorized his attorney general to put into motion a plan for the arrest of individuals on the potential enemy alien lists armed with a blanket arrest warrant the fbi seized these men on the eve of december 8 1941 these men were held in municipal jails and prisons until they were moved to department of justice detention camps separate from those of the wartime relocation authority wra these camps operated under far more stringent conditions and were subject to heightened criminalstyle guards despite the absence of criminal proceedings crystal city texas was one such camp where japanese americans german americans italian americans and a large number of usseized axisdescended nationals from several latinamerican countries were interned92147 the canadian government also confined citizens with japanese ancestry during world war ii see japanese canadian internment for much the same reasons of fear and prejudice some latin american countries of the pacific coast such as peru interned ethnic japanese or sent them to the united states for internment147 brazil also restricted its japanese brazilian population148 hawaiiedit although japanese americans in hawaii comprised more than one third of the population businessmen resisted their being interned or deported to mainland concentration camps as they recognized their contributions to the economy149 in the hysteria of the time some mainland congressmen hawaii was only a us territory at the time and did not have a voting representative or senator in congress promoted that all japanese americans and japanese immigrants should be removed from hawaii but were unsuccessful an estimated 1200 to 1800 japanese nationals and americanborn japanese from hawaii were interned either in five camps on the islands or in one of the mainland internment camps but this represented well under two percent of the total japanese american residents in the islands150 no serious explanations were offered as to why the internment of individuals of japanese descent was necessary on the mainland but not in hawaii where the large japanesehawaiian population went largely unmolested151 the vast majority of japanese americans and their immigrant parents in hawaii were not interned because the government had already declared martial law in hawaii and this allowed it to significantly reduce the supposed risk of espionage and sabotage by residents of japanese ancestry152 also japanese americans comprised over 35 of the territorys population with 157905 of hawaiis 423330 inhabitants at the time of the 1940 census153 making them the largest ethnic group at that time detaining so many people would have been enormously challenging in terms of logistics additionally the whole of hawaiian society was dependent on their productivity according to intelligence reports at the time the japanese through a concentration of effort in select industries had achieved a virtual stranglehold on several key sectors of the economy in hawaii154 and they had access to virtually all jobs in the economy including highstatus highpaying jobs eg professional and managerial jobs155 to imprison such a large percentage of the islands work force would have crippled the hawaiian economy thus the unfounded fear of japanese americans turning against the united states was overcome by the realitybased fear of massive economic loss lieutenant general delos c emmons commander of the hawaii department promised the local japaneseamerican community that they would be treated fairly so long as they remained loyal to the united states he succeeded in blocking efforts to relocate them to the outer islands or mainland by pointing out the logistical difficulties156 among the small number interned were community leaders and prominent politicians including territorial legislators thomas sakakihara and sanji abe157 a total of five internment camps operated in the territory of hawaii referred to as the hawaiian island detention camps158159 one camp was located at sand island at the mouth of honolulu harbor this camp was prepared in advance of the wars outbreak all prisoners held here were detained under military custody because of the imposition of martial law throughout the islands another hawaiian camp was the honouliuli internment camp near ewa on the southwestern shore of oahu it was opened in 1943 to replace the sand island camp another was located on the island of maui in the town of haiku160 in addition to the kilauea detention center on hawaii and camp kalaheo on kauai161 japanese latin americansedit during world war ii over 2200 japanese from latin america were held in internment camps run by the immigration and naturalization service part of the department of justice beginning in 1942 latin americans of japanese ancestry were rounded up and transported to american internment camps run by the ins and the us justice department84162163164 the majority of these internees approximately 1800 came from peru an additional 250 were from panama and bolivia colombia costa rica cuba ecuador el salvador mexico nicaragua and venezuela165 the first group of japanese latin americans arrived in san francisco on april 20 1942 on board the etolin along with 360 ethnic germans and 14 ethnic italians from peru ecuador and colombia166 the 151 men — ten from ecuador the rest from peru — had volunteered for deportation believing they were to be repatriated to japan they were denied visas by us immigration authorities and then detained on the grounds they had tried to enter the country illegally without a visa or passport166 subsequent transports brought additional volunteers including the wives and children of men who had been deported earlier a total of 2264 japanese latin americans about twothirds of them from peru were interned in facilities on the us mainland during the war84165167 the united states originally intended to trade these latin american internees as part of a hostage exchange program with japan and other axis nations168 a thorough examination of the documents shows at least one trade occurred162 over 1300 persons of japanese ancestry were exchanged for a like number of nonofficial americans in october 1943 at the port of marmagao india over half were japanese latin americans the rest being ethnic germans and italians and of that number onethird were japanese peruvians on september 2 1943 the swedish ship ms gripsholm departed the us with just over 1300 japanese nationals including nearly a hundred from canada and mexico en route for the exchange location marmagao the main port of the portuguese colony of goa on the west coast of india169170 after two more stops in south america to take on additional japanese nationals the passenger manifest reached 1340162 of that number latin american japanese numbered 55 percent of the gripsholms travelers 30 percent of whom were japanese peruvian162 arriving in marmagao on october 16 1943 the gripsholms passengers disembarked and then boarded the japanese ship teia maru in return nonofficial americans secretaries butlers cooks embassy staff workers etc previously held by the japanese army boarded the gripsholm while the teia maru headed for tokyo162 because this exchange was done with those of japanese ancestry officially described as volunteering to return to japan no legal challenges were encountered the us department of state was pleased with the first trade and immediately began to arrange a second exchange of nonofficials for february 1944 this exchange would involve 1500 nonvolunteer japanese who were to be exchanged for 1500 americans162 the us was busy with pacific naval activity and future trading plans stalled further slowing the program were legal and political turf battles between the state department the roosevelt administration and the doj whose officials were not convinced of the legality of the program the completed october 1943 trade took place at the height of the enemy alien deportation program japanese peruvians were still being rounded up for shipment to the us in previously unseen numbers despite logistical challenges facing the floundering prisoner exchange program deportation plans were moving ahead this is partly explained by an earlyinthewar revelation of the overall goal for latin americans of japanese ancestry under the enemy alien deportation program the goal that the hemisphere was to be free of japanese secretary of state cordell hull wrote an agreeing president roosevelt that the us must continue our efforts to remove all the japanese from these american republics for internment in the united states162171 native peruvians expressed extreme animosity toward their japanese citizens and expatriates and peru refused to accept the postwar return of japanese peruvians from the us although a small number asserting special circumstances such as marriage to a nonjapanese peruvian84 did return the majority were trapped their home country refused to take them back a political stance peru would maintain until 1950165 they were generally spanish speakers in the anglo us and in the postwar us the department of state started expatriating them to japan aclu lawyer wayne collins filed injunctions on behalf of the remaining internees147172 helping them obtain parole relocation to the laborstarved seabrook farms in new jersey173 he started a legal battle that would not be resolved until 1953 when after working as undocumented immigrants for almost ten years those japanese peruvians remaining in the us were finally offered citizenship162165 internment endsedit on december 18 1944 the supreme court handed down two decisions on the legality of the incarceration under executive order 9066 korematsu v united states a 6–3 decision upholding a niseis conviction for violating the military exclusion order stated that in general the removal of japanese americans from the west coast was constitutional however ex parte endo unanimously declared that loyal citizens of the united states regardless of cultural descent could not be detained without cause in effect the two rulings held that while the eviction of us citizens in the name of military necessity was legal the subsequent incarceration was not—thus paving the way for their release although wra director dillon myer and others had pushed for an earlier end to the incarceration the exclusion order was not rescinded until january 2 1945 postponed until after the november 1944 election so as not to impede roosevelts reelection campaign174 many younger internees had already resettled in midwest or eastern cities to pursue work or educational opportunities for example 20000 were sent to lake view chicago175 the remaining population began to leave the camps to try to rebuild their lives at home former inmates were given 25 and a train ticket to their prewar places of residence but many had little or nothing to return to having lost their homes and businesses some emigrated to japan although many of these individuals were repatriated against their will176177 the camps remained open for residents who were not ready to return mostly elderly issei and families with young children but the wra pressured stragglers to leave by gradually eliminating services in camp those who had not left by each camps close date were forcibly removed and sent back to the west coast178 nine of the ten wra camps were shut down by the end of 1945 although tule lake which held renunciants slated for deportation to japan was not closed until march 20 1946179 japanese latin americans brought to the us from peru and other countries who were still being held in the doj camps at santa fe and crystal city took legal action in april 1946 in an attempt to avoid deportation to japan180 following recognition of the injustices done to the japanese americans in 1992 manzanar camp was designated a national historic site to provide for the protection and interpretation of historic cultural and natural resources associated with the relocation of japanese americans during world war ii public law 102248 in 2001 the site of the minidoka war relocation center in idaho was designated the minidoka national historic site hardship and material lossedit graveyard at granada relocation center in amache colorado a monument at manzanar to console the souls of the dead many internees lost irreplaceable personal property due to restrictions that prohibited them from taking more than they could carry into the camps these losses were compounded by theft and destruction of items placed in governmental storage leading up to their incarceration nikkei were prohibited from leaving the military zones or traveling more than 5 miles 80 km from home forcing those who had to travel for work like truck farmers and residents of rural towns to quit their jobs181 many others were simply fired for their jap heritage182183184 alien land laws in the west coast states barred the issei from owning their prewar homes and farms many had cultivated land for decades as tenant farmers but they lost their rights to farm those lands when they were forced to leave other issei and nisei who were renting or had not completed payments on their property had found families willing to occupy their homes or tend their farms during their incarceration however those unable to strike a deal with caretakers had to sell their property often in a matter of days and at great financial loss to predatory land speculators who made huge profits in addition to these monetary and property losses a number of personswho died or suffered for lack of medical care in camp seven were shot and killed by sentries kanesaburo oshima 58 during an escape attempt from fort sill oklahoma toshio kobata 58 and hirota isomura 59 during transfer to lordsburg new mexico james ito 17 and katsuji james kanegawa 21 during the december 1942 manzanar riot james hatsuaki wakasa 65 while walking near the perimeter wire of topaz and shoichi james okamoto 30 during a verbal altercation with a sentry at the tule lake segregation center185 psychological injury was observed by dillon s myer director of the wra camps in june 1945 myer described how the japanese americans had grown increasingly depressed and overcome with feelings of helplessness and personal insecurity186 author betty furuta explains that the japanese used gaman loosely meaning perseverance to overcome hardships this was mistaken by nonjapanese as being introverted and lacking initiative187 japanese americans also encountered hostility and even violence when they returned to the west coast concentrated largely in rural areas of central california there were dozens of reports of gun shots fires and explosions aimed at japanese american homes businesses and places of worship in addition to nonviolent crimes like vandalism and the defacing of japanese graves in one of the only cases to go to trial four men were accused of attacking the doi family of placer county california setting off an explosion and starting a fire on the familys farm in january 1945 despite a confession from one of the men that implicated the others the jury accepted their defense attorneys framing of the attack as a justifiable attempt to keep california a white mans country and acquitted all four defendants188 to compensate former internees for their property losses the us congress on july 2 1948 passed the american japanese claims act allowing japanese americans to apply for compensation for property losses which occurred as a reasonable and natural consequence of the evacuation or exclusion by the time the act was passed the irs had already destroyed most of the internees 1939–42 tax records due to the time pressure and strict limits on how much they could take to the camps few were able to preserve detailed tax and financial records during the evacuation process therefore it was extremely difficult for claimants to establish that their claims were valid under the act japanese american families filed 26568 claims totaling 148 million in requests about 37 million was approved and disbursed189 the different placement for the interned had significant consequences for their lifetime outcomes190 a 2016 study finds using the random dispersal of internees into camps in seven different states that the people assigned to richer locations did better in terms of income education socioeconomic status house prices and housing quality roughly half a century later190 reparations and redressedit see also japanese american redress and court cases beginning in the 1960s a younger generation of japanese americans inspired by the civil rights movement began what is known as the redress movement an effort to obtain an official apology and reparations from the federal government for incarcerating their parents and grandparents during the war they focused not on documented property losses but on the broader injustice and mental suffering caused by the internment the movements first success was in 1976 when president gerald ford proclaimed that the internment was wrong and a national mistake which shall never again be repeated191 the campaign for redress was launched by japanese americans in 1978 the japanese american citizens league jacl which had cooperated with the administration during the war became part of the movement it asked for three measures 25000 to be awarded to each person who was detained an apology from congress acknowledging publicly that the us government had been wrong and the release of funds to set up an educational foundation for the children of japaneseamerican families in 1980 congress established the commission on wartime relocation and internment of civilians cwric to study the matter on february 24 1983 the commission issued a report entitled personal justice denied condemning the internment as unjust and motivated by racism and xenophobic ideas rather than factual military necessity192 internment camp survivors sued the federal government for 24 million in property loss but lost the case however the commission recommended that 20000 in reparations be paid to those japanese americans who had suffered internment193 the civil liberties act of 1988 exemplified the japanese american redress movement that impacted the large debate about the reparation bill whether or not it was going to pass during the 1980s due to the lack of federal budget that was at its alltime high and the low support of japanese americans covering 1 of the united states however with the support of democratic congressmen barney frank and four powerful japanese american democrats and republicans whom had war experience saw the bill and enlisted it as their top priority and making sure it passed congress194 us president ronald reagan signs the civil liberties act of 1988 which granted reparations for the internment of japanese americans in 1988 us president ronald reagan signed the civil liberties act of 1988 which had been sponsored by representative norman mineta and senator alan k simpson who had met while mineta was interned at heart mountain relocation center in wyoming it provided financial redress of 20000 for each surviving detainee totaling 12 billion the question of to whom reparations should be given how much and even whether monetary reparations were appropriate were subjects of sometimes contentious debate within the japanese american community and congress195 on september 27 1992 the civil liberties act amendments of 1992 appropriating an additional 400 million to ensure all remaining internees received their 20000 redress payments was signed into law by president george h w bush he issued another formal apology from the us government on december 7 1991 on the 50thanniversary of the pearl harbor attack saying in remembering it is important to come to grips with the past no nation can fully understand itself or find its place in the world if it does not look with clear eyes at all the glories and disgraces of its past we in the united states acknowledge such an injustice in our history the internment of americans of japanese ancestry was a great injustice and it will never be repeated over 81800 people were qualified by 1998 and 16 billion was distributed among them196 under the 2001 budget of the united states congress authorized that the ten detention sites are to be preserved as historical landmarks places like manzanar tule lake heart mountain topaz amache jerome and rohwer will forever stand as reminders that this nation failed in its most sacred duty to protect its citizens against prejudice greed and political expediency197 on january 30 2011 california first observed an annual fred korematsu day of civil liberties and the constitution the first such commemoration for an asian american in the us198 on june 14 2011 peruvian president alan garcía apologized for his countrys internment of japanese immigrants during world war ii most of whom were transferred to the united states148 legal legacyedit grandfather and grandson at manzanar july 2 1942 several significant legal decisions arose out of japaneseamerican internment relating to the powers of the government to detain citizens in wartime among the cases which reached the us supreme court were yasui v united states 1943 hirabayashi v united states 1943 ex parte endo 1944 and korematsu v united states 1944 in yasui and hirabayashi the court upheld the constitutionality of curfews based on japanese ancestry in korematsu the court upheld the constitutionality of the exclusion order in endo the court accepted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and ruled that the wra had no authority to subject a loyal citizen to its procedures korematsus and hirabayashis convictions were vacated in a series of coram nobis cases in the early 1980s199 in the coram nobis cases federal district and appellate courts ruled that newly uncovered evidence revealed an unfairness which had it been known at the time would likely have changed the supreme courts decisions in the yasui hirabayashi and korematsu cases2043 these new court decisions rested on a series of documents recovered from the national archives showing that the government had altered suppressed and withheld important and relevant information from the supreme court including the final report by general dewitt justifying the internment program199 the army had destroyed documents in an effort to hide alterations that had been made to the report to reduce their racist content43 the coram nobis cases vacated the convictions of korematsu and hirabayashi yasui died before his case was heard rendering it moot and are regarded as part of the impetus to gain passage of the civil liberties act of 1988199 the rulings of the us supreme court in the korematsu and hirabayashi cases specifically in its expansive interpretation of government powers in wartime have yet to be overturned they are still the law of the land because a lower court cannot overturn a ruling by the us supreme court the coram nobis cases totally undermined the factual underpinnings of the 1944 cases leaving the original decisions without much logical basis199 as these 1944 decisions prevail a number of legal scholars have expressed the opinion that the original korematsu and hirabayashi decisions have taken on renewed relevance in the context of the war on terror former supreme court justice tom c clark who represented the us department of justice in the relocation writes in the epilogue to the 1992 book executive order 9066 the internment of 110000 japanese americans200 the truth is—as this deplorable experience proves—that constitutions and laws are not sufficient of themselvesdespite the unequivocal language of the constitution of the united states that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended and despite the fifth amendments command that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law both of these constitutional safeguards were denied by military action under executive order 9066201 terminology debateedit since the end of world war ii there has been debate over the terminology used to refer to camps in which americans of japanese ancestry and their immigrant parents were incarcerated by the united states government during the war202203204 these camps have been referred to as war relocation centers relocation camps relocation centers internment camps and concentration camps and the controversy over which term is the most accurate and appropriate continues to the present day81205206207 dr james hirabayashi professor emeritus and former dean of ethnic studies at san francisco state university wrote an article in 1994 in which he stated that he wonders why euphemistic terms are still used to describe these camps208 in 1998 use of the term concentration camps gained greater credibility prior to the opening of an exhibit about the american camps at ellis island initially the american jewish committee ajc and the national park service which manages ellis island objected to the use of the term in the exhibit209 however during a subsequent meeting held at the offices of the ajc in new york city leaders representing japanese americans and jewish americans reached an understanding about the use of the term210 the new york times published an unsigned editorial supporting the use of concentration camp in the exhibit211 an article quoted jonathan mark a columnist for the jewish week who wrote can no one else speak of slavery gas trains camps its jewish malpractice to monopolize pain and minimize victims212 ajc executive director david a harris stated during the controversy we have not claimed jewish exclusivity for the term concentration camps213 on july 7 2012 at their annual convention the national council of the japanese american citizens league unanimously ratified the power of words handbook calling for the use of truthful and accurate terms and retiring the misleading euphemisms created by the government to cover up the denial of constitutional and human rights the force oppressive conditions and racism against 120000 innocent people of japanese ancestry locked up in americas world war ii concentration camps214 expulsions and population transfers of world war iiedit main articles world war ii evacuation and expulsion and population transfers in the soviet union the internment of japanese americans has sometimes been compared to the persecutions expulsions and dislocations of other ethnic minorities in the context of world war ii in europe and asia215216217218 an estimated 500000 volga germans were rounded up and deported to siberia and kazakhstan when germany invaded the soviet union with many of them dying en route215 in 1942 nearly all the ablebodied german population was conscripted to the nkvd labor columns about onethird did not survive the camps219 the volga germans were deported prior to the battle of stalingrad as they were regarded in the war hysteria of the moment as a potential fifth column216 in 1944 the red army rounded up about 500000 chechens and ingushes for relocation a third of this population perished in the first year from starvation cold and disease217 other nationalities which faced ethnic cleansing for having been identified as potential collaborators with the germans were the balkars crimean tatars karachi kalmyks and meskhetians218 exhibitions and collectionsedit the smithsonian institutions national museum of american history has more than 800 artifacts from its a more perfect union collection

had already begun on april 24 jewish prisoners from the outer dachau camps were marched to dachau and then 70 miles south many of the jewish marchers weighed less than 80 pounds shivering in their tattered striped uniforms the skeletons marched 10 to 15 hours a day passing more than a dozen bavarian towns if they stopped or fell behind the ss guards shot them and left their corpses along the road thousands died from exposure exhaustion and starvation on may 2 the death march was outside waakirchen germany near the austrian border when the 522nd came across the marchers that day soldiers from the 522nd were patrolling near waakirchen the nisei saw an open field with several hundred lumps in the snow when the soldiers looked closer they realized the lumps were people some were shot some were dead from exposure hundreds were alive but barely the 522nd discovered hundreds of prisoners with black and white prison garb shaven heads sunken eyes and hollowed cheeks some roamed aimlessly around the countryside some were too weak to move all were severely malnourished one soldier gave a starving jewish prisoner a candy bar but his system couldnt handle solid food then the americans were told not to give food to the prisoners because it could do them more harm than good for the next three days the nisei helped the prisoners to shelter and tended to their needs as best as they could they carried the survivors into warm houses and barns the soldiers gave them blankets water and tiny bits of food to ease them back from starvation the soldiers left waakirchen on may 4
