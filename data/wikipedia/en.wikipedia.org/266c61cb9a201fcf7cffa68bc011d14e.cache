foundation of the icrcedit jeanhenri dunant author of a memory of solferino until the middle of the 19th century there were no organized andor wellestablished army nursing systems for casualties and no safe and protected institutions to accommodate and treat those who were wounded on the battlefield a devout reformed christian the swiss businessman jeanhenri dunant in june 1859 traveled to italy to meet french emperor napoléon iii with the intention of discussing difficulties in conducting business in algeria at that time occupied by france4 when he arrived in the small town of solferino on the evening of 24 june he toured the field of the battle of solferino an engagement in the austrosardinian war in a single day about 40000 soldiers on both sides died or were left wounded on the field jeanhenri dunant was shocked by the terrible aftermath of the battle the suffering of the wounded soldiers and the neartotal lack of medical attendance and basic care he completely abandoned the original intent of his trip and for several days he devoted himself to helping with the treatment and care for the wounded he succeeded in organizing an overwhelming level of relief assistance by motivating the local villagers to aid without discrimination original document of the first geneva convention 1864 back in his home in geneva he decided to write a book entitled a memory of solferino which he published using his own money in 1862 he sent copies of the book to leading political and military figures throughout europe and people he thought could help him make a change in addition to penning a vivid description of his experiences in solferino in 1859 he explicitly advocated the formation of national voluntary relief organizations to help nurse wounded soldiers in the case of war an idea that was inspired by christian teaching regarding social responsibility as well as his experience seeing the battlefield of solferino564 in addition he called for the development of international treaties to guarantee the protection of neutral medics and field hospitals for soldiers wounded on the battlefield in 1863 gustave moynier a geneva lawyer and president of the geneva society for public welfare received a copy of dunants book and introduced it for discussion at a meeting of that society as a result of this initial discussion the society established an investigatory commission to examine the feasibility of dunants suggestions and eventually to organize an international conference about their possible implementation the members of this committee which has subsequently been referred to as the committee of the five aside from dunant and moynier were physician louis appia who had significant experience working as a field surgeon appias friend and colleague théodore maunoir from the geneva hygiene and health commission and guillaumehenri dufour a swiss army general of great renown eight days later the five men decided to rename the committee to the international committee for relief to the wounded in october 26–29 1863 the international conference organized by the committee was held in geneva to develop possible measures to improve medical services on the battlefield the conference was attended by 36 individuals eighteen official delegates from national governments six delegates from other nongovernmental organizations seven nonofficial foreign delegates and the five members of the international committee the states and kingdoms represented by official delegates were austrian empire grand duchy of baden kingdom of bavaria second french empire kingdom of hanover grand duchy of hesse kingdom of italy kingdom of the netherlands kingdom of prussia russian empire kingdom of saxony spanish empire united kingdoms of sweden and norway and united kingdom of great britain and irelandcitation needed after the battle of gravelotte during the franco–prussian war in 1870 among the proposals written in the final resolutions of the conference adopted on 29 october 1863 were the foundation of national relief societies for wounded soldiers neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers the utilization of volunteer forces for relief assistance on the battlefield the organization of additional conferences to enact these concepts in legally binding international treaties the introduction of a common distinctive protection symbol for medical personnel in the field namely a white armlet bearing a red cross memorial commemorating the first use of the red cross symbol in an armed conflict during the battle of dybbøl denmark in 1864 jointly erected in 1989 by the national red cross societies of denmark and germany a red cross nurse theodor grust late 19th early 20th century only one year later the swiss government invited the governments of all european countries as well as the united states brazil and mexico to attend an official diplomatic conference sixteen countries sent a total of twentysix delegates to geneva on 22 august 1864 the conference adopted the first geneva convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded in armies in the field representatives of 12 states and kingdoms signed the convention7  grand duchy of baden  kingdom of belgium  kingdom of denmark  second french empire  grand duchy of hesse  kingdom of italy  kingdom of the netherlands  kingdom of portugal and the algarves  kingdom of prussia   switzerland  kingdom of spain  kingdom of württemberg the convention contained ten articles establishing for the first time legally binding rules guaranteeing neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers field medical personnel and specific humanitarian institutions in an armed conflict furthermore the convention defined two specific requirements for recognition of a national relief society by the international committee the national society must be recognized by its own national government as a relief society according to the convention the national government of the respective country must be a state party to the geneva convention directly following the establishment of the geneva convention the first national societies were founded in belgium denmark france oldenburg prussia spain and württemberg also in 1864 louis appia and charles van de velde a captain of the dutch army became the first independent and neutral delegates to work under the symbol of the red cross in an armed conflict three years later in 1867 the first international conference of national aid societies for the nursing of the war wounded was convened also in 1867 jeanhenri dunant was forced to declare bankruptcy due to business failures in algeria partly because he had neglected his business interests during his tireless activities for the international committee controversy surrounding dunants business dealings and the resulting negative public opinion combined with an ongoing conflict with gustave moynier led to dunants expulsion from his position as a member and secretary he was charged with fraudulent bankruptcy and a warrant for his arrest was issued thus he was forced to leave geneva and never returned to his home city in the following years national societies were founded in nearly every country in europe the project resonated well with patriotic sentiments that were on the rise in the latenineteenthcentury and national societies were often encouraged as signifiers of national moral superiority8 in 1876 the committee adopted the name international committee of the red cross icrc which is still its official designation today five years later the american red cross was founded through the efforts of clara barton9 more and more countries signed the geneva convention and began to respect it in practice during armed conflicts in a rather short period of time the red cross gained huge momentum as an internationally respected movement and the national societies became increasingly popular as a venue for volunteer work when the first nobel peace prize was awarded in 1901 the norwegian nobel committee opted to give it jointly to jeanhenri dunant and frédéric passy a leading international pacifist more significant than the honor of the prize itself the official congratulation from the international committee of the red cross marked the overdue rehabilitation of jeanhenri dunant and represented a tribute to his key role in the formation of the red cross dunant died nine years later in the small swiss health resort of heiden only two months earlier his longstanding adversary gustave moynier had also died leaving a mark in the history of the committee as its longestserving president ever in 1906 the 1864 geneva convention was revised for the first time one year later the hague convention x adopted at the second international peace conference in the hague extended the scope of the geneva convention to naval warfare shortly before the beginning of the first world war in 1914 50 years after the foundation of the icrc and the adoption of the first geneva convention there were already 45 national relief societies throughout the world the movement had extended itself beyond europe and north america to central and south america argentina brazil chile cuba mexico peru el salvador uruguay venezuela asia the republic of china japan korea siam and africa union of south africa the icrc during world war iedit french postcard celebrating the role of red cross nurses during the first world war 1915 ernest hemingway in uniform as a red cross ambulance driver with the outbreak of world war i the icrc found itself confronted with enormous challenges that it could handle only by working closely with the national red cross societies red cross nurses from around the world including the united states and japan came to support the medical services of the armed forces of the european countries involved in the war on 15 october 1914 immediately after the start of the war the icrc set up its international prisonersofwar pow agency which had about 1200 mostly volunteer staff members by the end of 1914 by the end of the war the agency had transferred about 20 million letters and messages 19 million parcels and about 18 million swiss francs in monetary donations to pows of all affected countries furthermore due to the intervention of the agency about 200000 prisoners were exchanged between the warring parties released from captivity and returned to their home country the organizational card index of the agency accumulated about 7 million records from 1914 to 1923 each card representing an individual prisoner or missing person the card index led to the identification of about 2 million pows and the ability to contact their families the complete index is on loan today from the icrc to the international red cross and red crescent museum in geneva the right to access the index is still strictly restricted to the icrc french war casualty wearing a prosthetic mask provided by the american red cross 1918 the same man without his mask during the entire war the icrc monitored warring parties’ compliance with the geneva conventions of the 1907 revision and forwarded complaints about violations to the respective country when chemical weapons were used in this war for the first time in history the icrc vigorously protested against this new type of warfare even without having a mandate from the geneva conventions the icrc tried to ameliorate the suffering of civil populations in territories that were officially designated as occupied territories the icrc could assist the civilian population on the basis of the hague conventions laws and customs of war on land of 1907 this convention was also the legal basis for the icrcs work for prisoners of war in addition to the work of the international prisonerofwar agency as described above this included inspection visits to pow camps a total of 524 camps throughout europe were visited by 41 delegates from the icrc until the end of the war between 1916 and 1918 the icrc published a number of postcards with scenes from the pow camps the pictures showed the prisoners in daytoday activities such as the distribution of letters from home the intention of the icrc was to provide the families of the prisoners with some hope and solace and to alleviate their uncertainties about the fate of their loved ones after the end of the war the icrc organized the return of about 420000 prisoners to their home countries in 1920 the task of repatriation was handed over to the newly founded league of nations which appointed the norwegian diplomat and scientist fridtjof nansen as its high commissioner for repatriation of the war prisoners his legal mandate was later extended to support and care for war refugees and displaced persons when his office became that of the league of nations high commissioner for refugees nansen who invented the nansen passport for stateless refugees and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1922 appointed two delegates from the icrc as his deputies red cross ambulance from 1917 a year before the end of the war the icrc received the 1917 nobel peace prize for its outstanding wartime work it was the only nobel peace prize awarded in the period from 1914 to 1918 in 1923 the international committee of the red cross adopted a change in its policy regarding the selection of new members until then only citizens from the city of geneva could serve in the committee this limitation was expanded to include swiss citizens as a direct consequence of world war i an additional protocol to the geneva convention was adopted in 1925 which outlawed the use of suffocating or poisonous gases and biological agents as weapons four years later the original convention was revised and the second geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war was established the events of world war i and the respective activities of the icrc significantly increased the reputation and authority of the committee among the international community and led to an extension of its competencies as early as in 1934 a draft proposal for an additional convention for the protection of the civil population during an armed conflict was adopted by the international red cross conference unfortunately most governments had little interest in implementing this convention and it was thus prevented from entering into force before the beginning of world war ii the icrc and world war iiedit red cross message from łódź poland 1940 the legal basis of the work of the icrc during world war ii were the geneva conventions in their 1929 revision the activities of the committee were similar to those during world war i visiting and monitoring pow camps organizing relief assistance for civilian populations and administering the exchange of messages regarding prisoners and missing persons by the end of the war 179 delegates had conducted 12750 visits to pow camps in 41 countries the central information agency on prisonersofwar zentralauskunftsstelle für kriegsgefangene had a staff of 3000 the card index tracking prisoners contained 45 million cards and 120 million messages were exchanged by the agency one major obstacle was that the nazicontrolled german red cross refused to cooperate with the geneva statutes including blatant violations such as the deportation of jews from germany and the mass murders conducted in the nazi concentration camps moreover two other main parties to the conflict the soviet union and japan were not party to the 1929 geneva conventions and were not legally required to follow the rules of the conventions during the war the icrc was unable to obtain an agreement with nazi germany about the treatment of detainees in concentration camps and it eventually abandoned applying pressure in order to avoid disrupting its work with pows the icrc was also unable to obtain a response to reliable information about the extermination camps and the mass killing of european jews roma et al after november 1943 the icrc achieved permission to send parcels to concentration camp detainees with known names and locations because the notices of receipt for these parcels were often signed by other inmates the icrc managed to register the identities of about 105000 detainees in the concentration camps and delivered about 11 million parcels primarily to the camps dachau buchenwald ravensbrück and sachsenhausen it is known that swiss army officer maurice rossel during world war ii had been sent to berlin as a delegate of the international red cross as such he visited auschwitz 1943 and theresienstadt 1944 claude lanzmann recorded his experiences in 1979 producing a documentary entitled visitor from the living10 marcel junod delegate of the icrc visiting pows in germany on 12 march 1945 icrc president jacob burckhardt received a message from ss general ernst kaltenbrunner accepting the icrcs demand to allow delegates to visit the concentration camps this agreement was bound by the condition that these delegates would have to stay in the camps until the end of the war ten delegates among them louis haefliger camp mauthausen paul dunant camp theresienstadt and victor maurer camp dachau accepted the assignment and visited the camps louis haefliger prevented the forceful eviction or blasting of mauthausengusen by alerting american troops thereby saving the lives of about 60000 inmates his actions were condemned by the icrc because they were deemed as acting unduly on his own authority and risking the icrcs neutrality only in 1990 his reputation was finally rehabilitated by icrc president cornelio sommaruga another example of great humanitarian spirit was friedrich born 1903–1963 an icrc delegate in budapest who saved the lives of about 11000 to 15000 jewish people in hungary marcel junod 1904–1961 a physician from geneva was another famous delegate during the second world war an account of his experiences which included being one of the first foreigners to visit hiroshima after the atomic bomb was dropped can be found in the book warrior without weapons in 1944 the icrc received its second nobel peace prize as in world war i it received the only peace prize awarded during the main period of war 1939 to 1945 at the end of the war the icrc worked with national red cross societies to organize relief assistance to those countries most severely affected in 1948 the committee published a report reviewing its warera activities from 1 september 1939 to 30 june 1947 since january 1996 the icrc archive for this period has been open to academic and public research the icrc after world war iiedit the icrc headquarters in geneva on 12 august 1949 further revisions to the existing two geneva conventions were adopted an additional convention for the amelioration of the condition of wounded sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea now called the second geneva convention was brought under the geneva convention umbrella as a successor to the 1907 hague convention x the 1929 geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war may have been the second geneva convention from a historical point of view because it was actually formulated in geneva but after 1949 it came to be called the third convention because it came later chronologically than the hague convention reacting to the experience of world war ii the fourth geneva convention a new convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war was established also the additional protocols of 8 june 1977 were intended to make the conventions apply to internal conflicts such as civil wars today the four conventions and their added protocols contain more than 600 articles a remarkable expansion when compared to the mere 10 articles in the first 1864 convention in celebration of its centennial in 1963 the icrc together with the league of red cross societies received its third nobel peace prize since 1993 nonswiss individuals have been allowed to serve as committee delegates abroad a task which was previously restricted to swiss citizens indeed since then the share of staff without swiss citizenship has increased to about 35 on 16 october 1990 the un general assembly decided to grant the icrc observer status for its assembly sessions and subcommittee meetings the first observer status given to a private organization the resolution was jointly proposed by 138 member states and introduced by the italian ambassador vieri traxler in memory of the organizations origins in the battle of solferino an agreement with the swiss government signed on 19 march 1993 affirmed the already longstanding policy of full independence of the committee from any possible interference by switzerland the agreement protects the full sanctity of all icrc property in switzerland including its headquarters and archive grants members and staff legal immunity exempts the icrc from all taxes and fees guarantees the protected and dutyfree transfer of goods services and money provides the icrc with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies and simplifies committee travel in and out of switzerland at the end of the cold war the icrcs work actually became more dangerous in the 1990s more delegates lost their lives than at any point in its history especially when working in local and internal armed conflicts these incidents often demonstrated a lack of respect for the rules of the geneva conventions and their protection symbols among the slain delegates were frédéric maurice he died on 19 may 1992 at the age of 39 one day after a red cross transport he was escorting was attacked in the bosnian city of sarajevo fernanda calado spain ingeborg

their support extends to the national and international armed forces civilians and the armed opposition they regularly visit detainees under the custody of the afghan government and the international armed forces but have also occasionally had access since 2009 to people detained by the taliban12 they have provided basic first aid training and aid kits to both the afghan security forces and taliban members because according to an icrc spokesperson icrcs constitution stipulates that all parties harmed by warfare will be treated as fairly as possible13 the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifrcedit historyedit henry davison founding father of the league of red cross societies in 1919 representatives from the national red cross societies of britain france italy japan and the us came together in paris to found the league of red cross societies the original idea was henry davisons then president of the american red cross this move led by the american red cross expanded the international activities of the red cross movement beyond the strict mission of the icrc to include relief assistance in response to emergency situations which were not caused by war such as manmade or natural disasters the arc already had great disaster relief mission experience extending back to its foundation the formation of the league as an additional international red cross organization alongside the icrc was not without controversy for a number of reasons the icrc had to some extent valid concerns about a possible rivalry between both organizations the foundation of the league was seen as an attempt to undermine the leadership position of the icrc within the movement and to gradually transfer most of its tasks and competencies to a multilateral institution in addition to that all founding members of the league were national societies from countries of the entente or from associated partners of the entente the original statutes of the league from may 1919 contained further regulations which gave the five founding societies a privileged status and due to the efforts of henry p davison the right to permanently exclude the national red cross societies from the countries of the central powers namely germany austria hungary bulgaria and turkey and in addition to that the national red cross society of russia these rules were contrary to the red cross principles of universality and equality among all national societies a situation which furthered the concerns of the icrc the first relief assistance mission organized by the league was an aid mission for the victims of a famine and subsequent typhus epidemic in poland only five years after its foundation the league had already issued 47 donation appeals for missions in 34 countries an impressive indication of the need for this type of red cross work the total sum raised by these appeals reached 685 million swiss francs which were used to bring emergency supplies to the victims of famines in russia germany and albania earthquakes in chile persia japan colombia ecuador costa rica and turkey and refugee flows in greece and turkey the first largescale disaster mission of the league came after the 1923 earthquake in japan which killed about 200000 people and left countless more wounded and without shelter due to the leagues coordination the red cross society of japan received goods from its sister societies reaching a total worth of about 100 million another important new field initiated by the league was the creation of youth red cross organizations within the national societies a stamp from turkey to support the red crescent 1938 a joint mission of the icrc and the league in the russian civil war from 1917 to 1922 marked the first time the movement was involved in an internal conflict although still without an explicit mandate from the geneva conventions the league with support from more than 25 national societies organized assistance missions and the distribution of food and other aid goods for civil populations affected by hunger and disease the icrc worked with the russian red cross society and later the society of the soviet union constantly emphasizing the icrcs neutrality in 1928 the international council was founded to coordinate cooperation between the icrc and the league a task which was later taken over by the standing commission in the same year a common statute for the movement was adopted for the first time defining the respective roles of the icrc and the league within the movement during the abyssinian war between ethiopia and italy from 1935 to 1936 the league contributed aid supplies worth about 17 million swiss francs because the italian fascist regime under benito mussolini refused any cooperation with the red cross these goods were delivered solely to ethiopia during the war an estimated 29 people lost their lives while being under explicit protection of the red cross symbol most of them due to attacks by the italian army during the civil war in spain from 1936 to 1939 the league once again joined forces with the icrc with the support of 41 national societies in 1939 on the brink of the second world war the league relocated its headquarters from paris to geneva to take advantage of swiss neutrality peace nobel prize ceremony in 1963 from left to right crown prince harald of norway king olav of norway icrc president leopold boissier league chairman john a macaulay in 1952 the 1928 common statute of the movement was revised for the first time also the period of decolonization from 1960 to 1970 was marked by a huge jump in the number of recognized national red cross and red crescent societies by the end of the 1960s there were more than 100 societies around the world on december 10 1963 the federation and the icrc received the nobel peace prize in 1983 the league was renamed to the league of red cross and red crescent societies to reflect the growing number of national societies operating under the red crescent symbol three years later the seven basic principles of the movement as adopted in 1965 were incorporated into its statutes the name of the league was changed again in 1991 to its current official designation the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies in 1997 the icrc and the ifrc signed the seville agreement which further defined the responsibilities of both organizations within the movement in 2004 the ifrc began its largest mission to date after the tsunami disaster in south asia more than 40 national societies have worked with more than 22000 volunteers to bring relief to the countless victims left without food and shelter and endangered by the risk of epidemics presidents of the ifrcedit as of november 2009 the president

the icrc the international federation and the national societies the majority with the latter the 1965 international conference in vienna adopted seven basic principles which should be shared by all parts of the movement and they were added to the official statutes of the movement in 1986 fundamental principles of the international red cross and red crescent movementedit at the 20th international conference in neue hofburg vienna from 2–9 october 1965 proclaimed seven fundamental principles which are shared by all components of the movement and they were added to the official statutes of the movement in 1986 the durability and universal acceptance is a result of the process through which they came into being in the form they have rather than an effort to arrive at agreement it was an attempt to answer the question of what did they have in common over the past 100 years those operations and organisational units that were successful as a result the fundamental principles of the red cross and red crescent were not revealed but found through a deliberate and participative process of discovery that makes it even more important to note that the text that appears under each heading

assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield endeavours in its international and national capacity to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being it promotes mutual understanding friendship cooperation and lasting peace amongst all peoples impartiality it makes no

additional humanitarian tasks within their home countries such as blood donation services or acting as civilian emergency medical service ems providers the icrc and the international federation cooperate with the national societies in their international missions especially with human material and financial resources and organizing onsite logistics history of the emblemsedit for more details on this topic see emblems of the international red cross and red crescent movement emblems in useedit the red crossedit the flag of switzerland is where the original red cross was derived from the red cross emblem was officially approved in geneva in 186318 the red cross flag is not to be confused with the saint georges cross which is on the flag of england barcelona georgia freiburg im breisgau and several other places in order to avoid this confusion the protected symbol is sometimes referred to as the greek red cross now hellenic red cross that term is also used in united states law to describe the red cross the red cross of the saint george cross extends to the edge of the flag whereas the red cross on the red cross flag does not the red cross flag is the colourswitched version of the flag of switzerland in 1906 to put an end to the argument of the ottoman empire that the flag took its roots from christianity it was decided to promote officially the idea that the red cross flag had been formed by reversing the federal colours of switzerland although no clear evidence of this origin had ever been found19 the red crescentedit flag of the ottoman empire this is where the original red crescent was derived from the red crescent emblem was first used by icrc volunteers during the armed conflict between the ottoman empire and russia 1876–1878 the symbol was officially adopted in 1929 and so far 33 states in the muslim world have recognized it in common with the official promotion of the red cross symbol as a colour reversal of the swiss flag rather than a religious symbol the red crescent is similarly presented as being derived from a colour reversal of the flag of the ottoman empire nowadays the red crescent symbol is used within a few muslim countries including turkey afghanistan pakistan malaysia and bangladeshcitation needed the red crystaledit international emblem for magen david adom outside israel on 8 december 2005 in response to growing pressure to accommodate magen david adom mda israels national emergency medical disaster ambulance and blood bank service as a full member of the red cross and red crescent movement a new emblem officially the third protocol emblem but more commonly known as the red crystal was adopted by an amendment of the geneva conventions known as protocol iii recognized emblems in disuseedit the red lion and sunedit the red lion and sun society of iran was established in 1922 and admitted to the red cross and red crescent movement in 192320 however some report the symbol was introduced at geneva in 1864citation needed21 as a counter example to the crescent and cross used by two of irans rivals the ottoman and the russian empires though that claim is inconsistent with the red crescents history that history also suggests that the red lion and sun like the red crescent may have been conceived during the 1877–1878 war between russia and turkey due to the emblems association with the iranian monarchy the islamic republic of iran replaced the red lion and sun with the red crescent in 1980 consistent with two existing red cross and red crescent symbols though the red lion and sun has now fallen into disuse iran has in the past reserved the right to take it up again at any time the geneva conventions continue to recognize it as an official emblem and that status was confirmed by protocol iii in 2005 even as it added the red crystal22 unrecognized emblemsedit the red star of david magen david adomedit a magen david adom worker in the tel aviv civil defense 1939 for over 50 years israel requested the addition of a red star of david arguing that since christian and muslim emblems were recognized the corresponding jewish emblem should be as well this emblem has been used since 1935 by magen david adom mda or red star of david the national firstaid society of israel but it is not recognized by the geneva conventions as a protected symbol23 the red cross and red crescent movement repeatedly rejected israels request over the years stating that the red cross and red crescent emblems were not meant to represent christianity and islam but was colour reversals of the swiss and the ottoman flags and also that if jews or another group were to be given another emblem there would be no end to the number of religious or other groups claiming an emblem for themselves they reasoned that a proliferation of red symbols would detract from the original intention of the red cross emblem which was to be a single emblem to mark vehicles and buildings protected on humanitarian grounds certain arab nations such as syria also protested against the entry of mda into the red cross movement making consensus impossible for a time however from 2000 to 2006 the american red cross withheld its dues a total of 42 million to the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifrc because of ifrcs refusal to admit mda24 this ultimately led to the creation of the red crystal emblem and the admission of mda on june 22 2006 the red star of david is not recognized as a protected symbol outside israel instead the mda uses the red crystal emblem during international operations in order to ensure protection depending on the circumstances it may place the red star of david inside the red crystal or use the red crystal alone 1996 hostage crisis allegationsedit the australian tv network abc and the indigenous rights group friends of peoples close to nature released a documentary called blood on the cross in 1999 it alleged the involvement of the red cross with the british and indonesian military in a massacre in the southern highlands of west papua during the world wildlife fund hostage crisis of may 1996 when western and indonesian activists were held hostage by separatists2526 following the broadcast of the documentary the red cross announced publicly that it would appoint an individual outside the organization to investigate the allegations made in the film and any responsibility on its part piotr obuchowicz was appointed to investigate the matter27 the report categorically states that the red cross personnel accused of involvement were proven not to have been present that a white helicopter was probably used in a military operation but the helicopter was not a red cross helicopter and must have been painted by one of several military organizations operating in the region at the time perhaps the red cross logo itself was also used although no hard evidence was found for this that this was part of the military operation to free the hostages but was clearly intended to achieve surprise by deceiving the local people into thinking that a red cross helicopter was landing and that the red cross should have responded more quickly and thoroughly to investigate the allegations than it did28 see alsoedit emblems of the international red cross and red crescent movement first aid convention europe
