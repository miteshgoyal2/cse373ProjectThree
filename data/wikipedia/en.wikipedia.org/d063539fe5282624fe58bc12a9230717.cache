civilian conservation corps from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search poster by albert m bender illinois wpa art project chicago 1935 the civilian conservation corps ccc was a public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the united states for unemployed unmarried men from relief families as part of the new deal originally for young men ages 18–25 it was eventually expanded to young men ages 17–281 robert fechner was the first director of the agency succeeded by james mcentee following fechners death the ccc was a major part of president franklin d roosevelts new deal that provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal state and local governments the ccc was designed to provide jobs for young men and to relieve families who had difficulty finding jobs during the great depression in the united states at the same time it implemented a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory maximum enrollment at any one time was 300000 over the course of its nine years in operation 3 million young men participated in the ccc which provided them with shelter clothing and food together with a small wage of 30 about 547 in 20152 a month 25 of which had to be sent home to their families3 cccbuilt bridge across rock creek in little rock arkansas the american public made the ccc the most popular of all the new deal programs4 sources written at the time claimed5 an individuals enrollment in the ccc led to improved physical condition heightened morale and increased employability the ccc also led to a greater public awareness and appreciation of the outdoors and the nations natural resources and the continued need for a carefully planned comprehensive national program for the protection and development of natural resources6 during the time of the ccc enrollees planted nearly 3 billion trees to help reforest america constructed trails lodges and related facilities in more than 800 parks nationwide and upgraded most state parks updated forest fire fighting methods and built a network of service buildings and public roadways in remote areas7 ccc workers constructing a road 1933 154th co ccc eagle lake camp np1me bar harbor maine february 1940 ccc camps in michigan the tents were soon replaced by barracks built by army contractors for the enrollees8 the ccc operated separate programs for veterans and native americans approximately 15000 native americans participated in the program helping them weather the great depression9 despite its popular support the ccc was never a permanent agency it depended on emergency and temporary congressional legislation and funding to operate by 1942 with world war ii and the draft in operation the need for work relief declined and congress voted to close the program10 contents 1 founding 2 us army 3 history 31 early years 1933–1934 32 enrollees 33 camps 34 work

104 documentary feature and tv movies foundingedit as governor of new york roosevelt had run a similar program on a much smaller scale long interested in conservation11 as president he proposed to congress a fullscale national program on march 21 193312 i propose to create the ccc to be used in complex work not interfering with abnormal employment and confining itself to forestry the prevention of soil erosion flood control and similar projects i call your attention to the fact that this type of work is of definite practical value not only through the prevention of great present financial loss but also as a means of creating future national wealth he promised this law would provide 250000 young men with meals housing uniforms and medical care for working in the national forests and other government properties the emergency conservation work ecw act was introduced to congress the same day and enacted by voice vote on march 31 roosevelt issued executive order 6101 on april 5 1933 which established the ccc organization and appointed a director robert fechner a former labor union official who served until 1939 the organization and administration of the ccc was a new experiment in operations for a federal government agency the order indicated that the program was to be supervised jointly by four government departments labor which recruited the young men war which operated the camps and agriculture and interior which organized and supervised the work projects a ccc advisory council was composed of a representative from each of the supervising departments in addition the office of education and veterans administration participated in the program to end the opposition from labor unions which wanted no training programs started when so many of their men were unemployed13 roosevelt chose robert fechner vice president of the american machinists union as director of the corps william green head of the american federation of labor was taken to the first camp to demonstrate that there would be no job training involved beyond simple manual labor14 us armyedit reserve officers from the us army were in charge of the camps but there was no military training general douglas macarthur was placed in charge of the program15 but said that the number of army officers and soldiers assigned to the camps was affecting the readiness of the regular army16 but the army also found numerous benefits in the program when the draft began in 1940 the policy was to make ccc alumni corporals and sergeants ccc also provided command experience to organized reserve corps officers through the ccc the regular army could assess the leadership performance of both regular and reserve officers the ccc provided lessons which the army used in developing its wartime and mobilization plans for training camps17 historyedit early years 1933–1934edit a ccc map of the planned route of a parkway in texas drafted in 1934 the corps worked in numerous parks throughout the state during the early 1930s constructing everything from benches to highways the legislation and mobilization of the program occurred quite rapidly roosevelt made his request to congress on march 21 1933 the legislation was submitted to congress the same day congress passed it by voice vote on march 31 roosevelt signed it the same day then issued an executive order on april 5 creating the agency appointing its director fechner and assigning war department corps area commanders to begin enrollment the first ccc enrollee was selected april 8 and subsequent lists of unemployed men were supplied by state and local welfare and relief agencies for immediate enrollment on april 17 the first camp nf1 camp roosevelt18 was established at george washington national forest near luray virginia on june 18 the first of 161 soil erosion control camps was opened in clayton alabama19 by july 1 1933 there were 1463 working camps with 250000 junior enrollees 18–25 years of age 28000 veterans 14000 american indians and 25000 locally enrolled or experienced men lem2021 enrolleesedit the typical ccc enrollee was a us citizen unmarried unemployed male 18–25 years of age normally his family was on local relief each enrollee volunteered and upon passing a physical exam andor a period of conditioning was required to serve a minimum sixmonth period with the option to serve as many as four periods or up to two years if employment outside the corps was not possible enrollees worked 40 hours a week over five days sometimes including saturdays if poor weather dictated in return they received 30 a month with a compulsory allotment of 22–25 sent to a family dependent as well as food clothing and medical care22 following the second bonus army march on washington dc president roosevelt issued executive order 6129 may 11 1933 to amend the ccc program to include work opportunities for veterans veteran qualifications differed from the junior enrollee one needed to be certified by the veterans administration by an application they could be any age and married or single as long as they were in need of work veterans were generally assigned to entire veteran camps23 enrollees were eligible for the following rated positions to help with camp administration senior leader mess steward storekeeper and two cooks assistant leader company clerk assistant educational advisor and three second cooks these men received additional pay ranging from 36 to 45 per month depending on their rating campsedit inside of ccc barracks at milford utah two of the men are sitting on footlockers that were used by the ccc workers to hold their personal possessions each ccc camp was located in the area of particular conservation work to be performed and organized around a complement of up to 200 civilian enrollees in a designated numbered company unit the ccc camp was a temporary community in itself structured to have barracks initially army tents for 50 enrollees each officertechnical staff quarters medical dispensary mess hall recreation hall educational building lavatory and showers technicaladministrative offices tool roomblacksmith shop and motor pool garages the company organization of each camp had a dualauthority supervisory staff firstly department of war personnel or reserve officers until july 1 1939 a company commander and junior officer who were responsible for overall camp operation logistics education and training and secondly ten to fourteen technical service civilians including a camp superintendent and foreman employed by either the departments of interior or agriculture responsible for the particular fieldwork also included in camp operation were several nontechnical supervisor lems who provided knowledge of the work at hand lay of the land and paternal guidance for inexperienced enrollees2425 enrollees were organized into work detail units called sections of 25 men each according to the barracks they resided in26 each section had an enrollee senior

enthusiastic on october 1 1933 director fechner was directed to arrange for the second period of enrollment by january 1934 300000 men were enrolled in july 1934 this cap was increased by 50000 to include men from midwest states that had been affected by drought the temporary tent camps had also developed to include wooden barracks an education program had been established emphasizing job training and literacy2110 approximately 55 of enrollees were from rural communities a majority of which were nonfarm 45 came from urban areas28 level of education for the enrollee averaged 3 illiterate 38 less than eight years of school 48 did not complete high school 11 were high school graduates23 at the time of entry 70 of enrollees were malnourished and poorly clothed few had work experience beyond occasional odd jobs peace was maintained by the threat of dishonorable discharge this is a training station were going to leave morally and physically fit to lick old man depression boasted the newsletter happy days of a north carolina camp minoritiesedit because of the power of the solid south white democrats in congress who insisted on racial segregation the new deal programs were racially segregated blacks and whites rarely worked alongside each other at this time all the states of the south had passed legislation imposing racial segregation and since the turn of the century laws and constitutional provisions that disenfranchised most blacks they were excluded from formal politics because of discrimination by white officials at the local and state levels blacks in the south did not receive as many benefits as whites from new deal programs in the first few weeks of operation ccc camps in the north were integrated by july 1935 however all the camps in the united states were segregated29 a total of 200000 blacks were enrolled in the ccc they served in 143 allblack campscitation needed and received equal pay and housing black leaders lobbied to secure leadership roles adult white men held the major leadership roles in all the camps director robert fechner refused to appoint black adults to any supervisory positions except that of education director in the allblack camps30 indian divisionedit the ccc operated an entirely separate division for members of federally recognized tribes the indian emergency conservation work iecw or cccid native men from reservations worked on roads bridges clinics shelters and other public works near their reservations although they were organized as groups classified as camps no permanent camps were established for native americans instead organized groups moved with their families from project to project and were provided with an additional rental allowance in their pay31 the ccc often provided the only paid work as many reservations were in remote rural areas enrollees had to be between the ages of 17 and 35 during 1933 about half the male heads of households on the sioux reservations in south dakota were employed by the cccid32 with grants from the public works administration pwa the indian division built schools and conducted an extensive roadbuilding program in and around many reservations to improve infrastructure the mission was to reduce erosion and improve the value of indian lands crews built dams of many types on creeks then sowed grass on the eroded areas from which the damming materials had been taken they built roads and planted shelterbelts on federal lands the steady income helped participants regain selfrespect and many used the funds to improve their lives john collier the federal commissioner of indian affairs and daniel murphy the director of the cccid both based the program on indian selfrule and the restoration of tribal lands governments and cultures the next year congress passed the indian reorganization act of 1934 which ended allotments and helped preserve tribal lands and encouraged tribes to reestablish selfgovernment collier said of the cccindian division no previous undertaking in indian service has so largely been the indians own undertaking education programs also trained participants in gardening stock raising safety native arts and some academic subjects33 iecw differed from other ccc activities in that it explicitly trained men in skills to be carpenters truck drivers radio operators mechanics surveyors and technicians with the passage of the national defense vocational training act of 1941 enrollees began participating in defenseoriented training the government paid for the classes and after individuals completed courses and passed a competency test guaranteed automatic employment in the defense work a total of 85000 native americans were enrolled in this training this proved valuable social capital for the 24000 alumni who later served in the military and the 40000 who left the reservations for city jobs supporting the war effort program expansion 1935–1936edit responding to favorable public opinion to alleviate unemployment congress approved the emergency relief appropriation act of 1935 on april 8 1935 which included continued funding for the ccc program through march 31 1937 the age limit was expanded to 1828 to include more men211134 from april 1 1935 to march 31 1936 was the period of greatest activity and work accomplished by the ccc program enrollment had peaked at 505782 in about 2900 camps by august 31 1935 followed by a reduction to 350000 enrollees in 2019 camps by june 30 193635 during this period the public response to the ccc program was overwhelmingly popular a gallup poll of april 18 1936 asked are you in favor of the ccc camps 82 of respondents said yes including 92 of democrats and 67 of republicans36 change of purpose 1937–1938edit on june 28 1937 the civilian conservation corps was legally established transferred from its original designation as the emergency conservation work program funding was extended for three more years by public law no 163 75th congress effective july 1 1937 congress changed the age limits to 17–23 years old and changed the requirement that enrollees be on relief to not regularly in attendance at school or possessing fulltime employment37 the 1937 law mandated the inclusion of vocational and academic training for a minimum of 10 hours per week students in school were allowed to enroll during summer vacation38 during this period the ccc forces contributed to disaster relief following 1937 floods in new york vermont and the ohio and mississippi river valleys and response and cleanup after the 1938 hurricane in new england conservation to defense 1939–1940edit in 1939 congress ended the independent status of the ccc transferring it to the control of the federal security agency the national youth administration us employment service the office of education and the works progress administration also had some responsibilities about 5000 reserve officers for the camps were affected as they were transferred to federal civil service and military ranks and titles were eliminated despite the loss of overt military leadership in the camps by july 1940 with war underway in europe and asia the government directed an increasing number of ccc projects on resources for national defense it developed infrastructure for military training facilities and forest protection by 1940 the ccc was no longer wholly a relief agency was rapidly losing its nonmilitary character and it was becoming a system for worktraining as its ranks had become increasingly younger with little experience39 decline and disbandment 1941–1942edit although the ccc was probably the most popular new deal program it never was authorized as a permanent agency the program was reduced in scale as the depression waned and employment opportunities improved after conscription the draft began in 1940 fewer eligible young men were available following the attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 the roosevelt administration directed all federal programs to emphasize the war effort most ccc work except for wildland firefighting was shifted onto us military bases to help with construction the ccc disbanded one year earlier than planned as the 77th united states congress ceased funding it operations were formally concluded at the end of the federal fiscal year on june 30 1942 the end of the ccc program and closing of the camps involved arrangements to leave the incomplete work projects in the best possible state the separation of about 1800 appointed employees the transfer of ccc property to the war and navy departments and other agencies and the preparation of final accountability records liquidation of the ccc was ordered by congress by the laborfederal security appropriation act 56 stat 569 on july 2 1942 and virtually completed on june 30 194340 liquidation appropriations for the ccc continued through april 20 1948 some former ccc sites in good condition were reactivated from 1941 to 1947 as civilian public service camps where conscientious objectors performed work of national importance as an alternative to military service other camps were used to hold japanese german and italian americans interned under the western defense commands enemy alien control program as well as axis prisoners of war41 most of the japanese american internment camps were built by the people held there after the ccc disbanded the federal agencies responsible for public lands organized their own seasonal fire crews modeled after the ccc these have performed a firefighting function formerly done by the ccc and provided the same sort of outdoor work experience for young people approximately 47 young men have died while in this line of dutycitation needed a ccc pillowcase on display at the ccc
