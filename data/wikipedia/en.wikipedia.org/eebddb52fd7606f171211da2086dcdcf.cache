located just outside olympia as is the capitol state forest artesian wateredit olympia was historically dependent on artesian waters early settlers in swantown and tumwater used artesian springs for their main water supply the artesian spring at fourth avenue and main street now called capitol way was the main community well where settlers gathered to socialize the artesian well at artesian commons park a former parking lot is active16 another still flows at the corner of olympia avenue and washington street a small park was constructed around another spring in the bigelow neighborhood the northeast end of capitol lake was the location of an artesian well until the construction of a new park that included changes to the shoreline mcallister springs the main water source for olympia is fed by artesian wells and the former olympia brewery is supplied by 26 artesian wells recent efforts to protect and preserve the free flowing artesian well on 4th ave in downtown olympia began in 1991 when jim ingersoll a local psychologist called on the city council to acquire the well and develop it as a community park ingersoll’s interest in the well started in a conversation with dick batdorf cofounder of batdorf and bronson coffee roasting batdorf told ingersoll that the secret to great coffee was great water – specifically artesian water subsequently ingersoll met at the spar restaurant with herb legg and john robinson both of whom had worked in the 1950s and 60s to protect the artesian wells in watershed park legg and robinson worked behind the scenes to get an article published in the olympian on february 24 1992 calling for community support of the well ingersoll was flooded with phone calls offering time talent resources and money following the publication herb legg and friends sponsored a public meeting at the library where more than 50 people each donated 50 and a single 3000 donation followed the next day with hundreds of people using the well every day community support grew to become “the friends of artesians” an informal organization of advocates who over the course of 20 years mapped and researched the history of artesian wells in olympia raised money to test water quality and make improvements to the site and kept the vision of a free flowing community well alive in the fall of 2008 the friends announced they would stop testing the water quality after february 2009 these actions renewed interest in protecting the well and lead to the creation of h2olympia a nonprofit organization17 in downtown olympia efforts to preserve the use of artesian water at the one remaining public well has been the mission of h2olympia artesian well advocates in 2011 the city of olympia committed 50000 towards improvements of an artesian well located in a parking lot that was recently purchased by the city18 renovations at the artesian well were completed in late 2011 including surface improvements solar lighting and a raised area to fill bottles in spring of 2012 seathemed mosaic artwork created by community members was also installed at the site of the well demographicsedit historical population census pop ± 1870 1203 — 1880 1232 24 1890
