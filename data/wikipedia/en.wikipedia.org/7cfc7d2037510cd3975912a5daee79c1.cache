ohio candidate john sherman accused michigan candidate millionaire russell a alger of buying the votes of southern delegates who had already confirmed their vote for sherman in shermans 1895 twovolume book recollections he asserted i believe and had as i thought conclusive proof that the friends of gen alger substantially purchased the votes of many of the delegates from the southern states who had been instructed by their conventions to vote for me once accused alger submitted correspondence to the new york times who published one letter from 1888 written after the convention to alger where sherman states if you bought some votes according to universal usage surely i dont blame you later in the same new york times article alger insisted neither he or friends bought a single vote the article also quotes another delegate james lewis who claimed that the colored delegates of the south will unite on a union soldier in preference instead of a civilian2 when sherman introduced his antitrust legislation two years later his main example of unlawful combination drew from a michigan supreme court case involving diamond match company and algers participation as president and stock
