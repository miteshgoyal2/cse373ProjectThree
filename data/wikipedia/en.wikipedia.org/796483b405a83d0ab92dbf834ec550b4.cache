ceo hadi partovi website codeorg codeorg is a nonprofit organization and eponymous website led by hadi partovi1 that aims to encourage people particularly school students in the united states to learn computer science2 the website includes free coding lessons and the initiative also targets schools in an attempt to encourage them to include more computer science classes in the curriculum3 on december 9 2013 they launched the hour of code 2013 nationwide to promote computer science during computer science education week until december 15 2013456 contents 1 history 2 hour of code 3 curriculum efforts 4 legislative efforts 5 goals 6 reception 7 see also 8 references 9 external links historyedit codeorg was launched in january 2013 by hadi and ali partovi as a nonprofit focused on making computer programming more accessible their initial focus was on creating a database of all computer science classrooms in the united states7 at the time hadi partovi stated that about ninety percent of us schools do not teach programming despite it now being a “foundational field”8 the idea for the organization came from hadi who states that he thought of it on the day of steve jobs’ death in 2011 while mulling over his own potential legacy9 after this hadi worked fulltime to bring the organization to fruition71011 in late february 2013 a month after launch they released a video featuring mark zuckerberg bill gates jack dorsey and other programmers and entrepreneurs on the importance of learning to code12131415 two weeks after the launch techcrunch reported that the video had gone viral and received a lot of positive attention16 partovi raised about 10 million for codeorg from various tech companies and tech company founders17 in 2014 codeorg posted a onehour tutorial to build and customize a flappy bird video game using the sites block visual programming language1819 codeorg has also created coding programs revolving around characters from the disney film frozen20 in addition to angry birds and plants vs zombies21 in december 2014 codeorg held a successful indiegogo crowdfunding campaign that raised over 5 million to help educate school children22 overall about 100 million students have been reached by codeorg efforts2324 on november 16 2015 microsoft announced a partnership with codeorg to launch minecraft as a tutorial to teach kids how to code25 in

for digital education27 in december 2016 codeorg was recognized by the nasdaq market by opening the stock market28 hour of codeedit during computer science education week 29 from december 9 to december 15 2013 codeorg launched the hour of code challenge on its website to teach computer science to school students enticing them to complete short programming tutorials30313233 the hour of code involved getting people to write short snippets of code to achieve prespecified goals using blockly a visual programming language of a similar flavor as logo the initiative had been announced about two months in advance34 and at the time of launch the initiative was supported by former united states president barack obama as well as executives from technology companies such as microsoft and apple inc3536 about 20 million people participated and over 600 million lines of code had been written373839 the hour of code also offered participation gifts to some of the schools involved such as a set of fifty laptops or a conference call with one a tech “luminary” like gates or dorsey40 the crowdfunding effort for hour of code received the highest amount of funding ever raised on indiegogo41 by october 2014 about forty million students had taken the hour of code class42 and a second hour of code was held in december 201443 that year locations for hour of code lessons included apple retail stores44 in december 2016 canadian prime minister justin trudeau helped launch the international hour of code campaign for 201645 curriculum effortsedit the first step in the organization’s efforts as regards the curriculum of schools was to work with us school districts to add computer programming as a class most us schools did not have a course code for computer sciences in order for schools to be able to offer coding as a class after this the next step was to create free online teaching and learning materials for schools to use if instituting computer science classes46 by 2014 codeorg had launched computer courses in thirty us school districts to reach about 5 of all the students in us public schools about two million students47 and by 2015 codeorg had trained about 15000 teachers to teach computer sciences able to reach about 600000 new students previously unable to learn computer coding with large percentages of those being either female or minorities48 that year codeorg was partnered with about seventy of the largest us school districts including each of the seven largest representing several million students the company also partnered with other computer class businesses and private entities to provide additional computer learning materials and opportunities4950 as of 2015 six million students had been enrolled in codeorg curriculum classes51 that year codeorg partnered with college board in order to develop a slate of advanced placement computer classes52 codeorg has also trained at least 15000 educators to teach computer sciences53 the main platform used in codeorg instruction is code studio54 which according to techcrunch “teaches the underlying concepts in programming through the manipulation of blocks of logic that when stacked together in a particular order move a character around a scene or draw a shape”55 legislative effortsedit one of the main lobbying efforts of codeorg in state legislatures is to ensure that computer classes are not registered as foreign language classes but as science classes in order to ensure that more than coding is taught in computer courses56 codeorg also focuses specifically on female and minority students as the organization believes these are the students most at risk of not receiving computer science education before high school or college57 goalsedit according to its website codeorg has the following goals3 bringing computer science classes to every k12 school in the united states especially in urban and rural neighborhoods demonstrating the successful use of online curriculum in public school classrooms changing policies in all 50 states to categorize cs as part of the mathscience core curriculum harnessing the collective power of the tech community to celebrate and grow cs education worldwide increasing the representation of women and students of color in the field of computer science increasing their global outreach by making their courses available in more than 45 languages that are used in over 180 countries receptionedit writing for san jose mercury news mike cassidy praised codeorg and the hour of code writing a publicity stunt is what we need58 john
