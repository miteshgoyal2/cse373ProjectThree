in beverly massachusetts his father was john ellerton lodge his mother was anna cabot1 through whom he was a greatgrandson of george cabot lodge grew up on bostons beacon hill and spent part of his childhood in nahant massachusetts where he witnessed the 1860 kidnapping of a classmate and gave testimony leading to the arrest and conviction of the kidnappers2 he was cousin to the american polymath charles peirce in 1872 he graduated from harvard college where he was a member of delta kappa epsilon the porcellian club and the hasty pudding club in 1874 he graduated from harvard law school and was admitted to the bar in 1875 practicing at the boston firm now known as ropes gray3 historianedit after traveling through europe lodge returned to harvard and in 1876 became one of the first recipients of a phd in history and government from harvard4 his dissertation dealt with the germanic origins of anglosaxon land law his teacher and mentor during his graduate studies was henry adams lodge maintained a lifelong friendship with adams5 lodge was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 18786 in 1881 he was elected a member of the american antiquarian society7 political careeredit in 1880–1882 lodge served in the massachusetts house of representatives lodge represented his home state in the united states house of representatives from 1887 to 1893 and in the senate from 1893 to 1924 along with his close friend theodore roosevelt lodge was sympathetic to the concerns of the mugwump faction of the republican party nonetheless both reluctantly supported james blaine and protectionism in the 1884 election blaine lost narrowly8 lodge was a staunch supporter of the gold standard vehemently opposing the populists and the silverites who were led by the populist democrat william jennings bryan in 1896 lodge was easily reelected time and again but his greatest challenge came in his reelection bid in january 1911 the democrats had made significant gains in massachusetts and the republicans were split between the progressive and conservative wings with lodge trying to mollify both sides in a major speech before the legislature voted lodge took pride in his long selfless service to the state he emphasized that he had never engaged in corruption or selfdealing he rarely campaigned on his own behalf but now he made his case explaining his important roles in civil service reform maintaining the gold standard expanding the navy developing policies for the philippine islands and trying to restrict immigration by illiterate europeans as well as his support for some progressive reforms most of all he appealed to party loyalty lodge was reelected by five votes9 lodge in 1901 lodge was very close to theodore roosevelt for both of their entire careers however lodge was too conservative to accept roosevelts attacks on the judiciary in 1910 and his call for the initiative referendum and recall lodge stood silent when roosevelt broke with the party and ran as a thirdparty candidate in 1912 lodge voted for taft instead of roosevelt after woodrow wilson won the election the lodgeroosevelt friendship resumed10 civil rightsedit in 1890 lodge coauthored the federal elections bill along with sen george frisbie hoar that guaranteed federal protection for african american voting rights although the proposed legislation was supported by president benjamin harrison the bill was blocked by filibustering democrats in the senate11 in 1891 he became a member of the massachusetts society of the sons of the american revolution he was assigned national membership number 4901 that same year following the lynching of eleven italian americans in new orleans lodge published an article blaming the victims and proposing new restrictions on italian immigration1213 spanish–american waredit lodge was a strong backer of us intervention in cuba in 1898 arguing that it was the moral responsibility of the united states to do so of the sympathies of the american people generous libertyloving i have no question they are with the cubans in their struggle for freedom i believe our people would welcome any action on the part of the united states to put an end to the terrible state of things existing there we can stop it we can stop it peacefully we can stop it in my judgment by pursuing a proper diplomacy and offering our good offices let it once be understood that we mean to stop the horrible state of things in cuba and it will be stopped the great power of the united states if it is once invoked and uplifted is capable of greater things than that following american victory in the spanish–american war lodge came to represent the imperialist faction of the senate those who called for the annexation of the philippines lodge maintained that the united states needed to have a strong navy and be more involved in foreign affairs immigrationedit henry cabot lodge 1909 in encyclopædia britannica lodge was a vocal proponent of immigration restrictions for a number of reasons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries large numbers of immigrants primarily from eastern and southern europe were flooding into industrial centers lodge feared that unskilled foreign labor was undermining the standard of living for american workers and that a mass influx of uneducated immigrants would result in social conflict and national decline his position was also influenced by his beliefs about race in a may 1891 article on italian immigration lodge expressed his concern that immigration by the races who have peopled the united states was declining while the immigration of people removed from us in race and blood was on the rise14 he considered northern italians superior to southern italians not only because they tended to be better educated but because they were more teutonic than their southern counterparts whose immigration he sought to restrict1516 lodge was a supporter of 100 americanism a common theme in the nativist movement of the era in an address to the new england society of brooklyn in 1888 lodge stated let every man honor and love the land of his birth and the race from which he springs and keep their memory green it is a pious and honorable duty but let us have done with britishamericans and irishamericans and germanamericans and so on and all be americansif a man is going to be an american at all let him be so without any qualifying adjectives and if he is going to be something else let him drop the word american from his personal description17 he did not believe however that all races were equally capable or worthy of being assimilated in the great peril of unrestricted immigration he wrote that you can take a hindoo and give him the highest education the world can affordbut you cannot make him an englishman and cautioned against the mixing of higher and lower races on the moral qualities of the englishspeaking race therefore rest our history our victories and all our future there is only one way in which you can lower those qualities or weaken those characteristics and that is by breeding them out if a lower race mixes with a higher in sufficient numbers history teaches us that the lower race will prevail18 as the public voice of the immigration restriction league lodge argued in support of literacy tests for incoming immigrants the tests would be designed to exclude members of those races he deemed most alien to the body of the american people19 he proposed that the united states should temporarily shut out all further entries particularly persons of low education or skill the more efficiently to assimilate the millions who had come from 1907 to 1911 he served on the dillingham commission a joint congressional committee established to study the eras immigration patterns and make recommendations to congress based on its findings the commissions recommendations led to the immigration act of 1917 world war iedit lodge was a staunch advocate of entering world war i on the side of the allied powers attacking president woodrow wilson for poor military preparedness and accusing pacifists of undermining american patriotism after the united states entered the war lodge continued to attack wilson as hopelessly idealistic assailing wilsons fourteen points as unrealistic and weak he contended that germany needed to be militarily and economically crushed and saddled with harsh penalties so that it could never again be a threat to the stability of europe however apart from policy differences even before the end of wilsons first term and well before americas entry into the great war lodge confided to teddy roosevelt i never expected to hate anyone in politics with the hatred i feel toward wilson20 he served as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 1919–1924 he also served as chairman of the senate republican conference from 1918 to 1924 his leadership of the senate republicans has led some to retrospectively call him the de facto senate majority leader21 during his term in office he and another powerful senator albert j beveridge pushed for the construction of a new navy league of nationsedit main article lodge reservations the summit of lodges senate career came in 1919 when as the unofficial senate majority leader he dealt with the treaty of versailles he wanted to join the league of nations with reservations the democrats in the senate following wilsons direction rejected lodges proposal to join the league with reservations republicans opposed joining under wilsons terms of no reservations which meant the league could force the us to enter a war without approval of congress in the end the us never joined the league of nations22 lodge won in the long run—his reservations were incorporated into the united nations in 1945 where the us was given a veto23 lodges key objection to the league of nations was article x it required all signatory nations to repel aggression of any kind if ordered to do so by the league lodge rejected an openended commitment regardless of relevance to the national security interests of the united states he especially insisted that congress must approve lodge was also motivated by political concerns he strongly disliked president wilson24 and was eager to find an issue for the republican party to run on in the presidential election of 1920 senator lodge argued for a powerful american role in world affairs the united states is the worlds best hope but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations if you tangle her in the intrigues of europe you will destroy her powerful good and endanger her very existence leave her to march freely through the centuries to come as in the years that have gone strong generous and confident she has nobly served mankind beware how you trifle with your marvelous inheritance this great land of ordered liberty for if we stumble and fall freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin25 lodge appealed to the patriotism of american citizens by objecting to what he saw as the weakening of national sovereignty i have loved but one flag and i can not share that devotion and give affection to the mongrel banner invented for a league the senate was divided into a crazyquilt of positions on the versailles question26 it proved possible to build a majority coalition but impossible to build a two thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty27 one block of democrats strongly supported the versailles treaty a second group of democrats supported the treaty but followed wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations the largest bloc led by lodge comprised a majority of the republicans they wanted a treaty with reservations especially on article x which involved the power of the league of nations to make war without a vote by the united states congress finally a bipartisan group of 13 irreconcilables opposed a treaty in any form the closest the treaty came to passage was in midnovember 1919 when lodge and his republicans formed a coalition with the protreaty democrats and were close to a twothirds majority for a treaty with reservations but wilson rejected this compromise cooper and bailey suggest that wilsons stroke on september 25 1919 had so altered his personality that he was unable to effectively negotiate with lodge cooper says the psychological effects of a stroke were profound wilsons emotions were unbalanced and his judgment was warpedworse his denial of illness and limitations was starting to border on delusion28 the treaty of versailles went into effect but the united states did not sign it and made separate peace with germany and austriahungary the league of nations went into operation but the united states never joined historians agree that the league was ineffective in dealing with major issues but they debate whether american membership would have made much difference29 in 1945 it was replaced by the united nations which assumed many of the leagues procedures and peacekeeping functions although article x of the league of nations was notably absent from the un mandate that is the un was structured in accordance with lodges plan with the united states having a veto power in the un which it did not have in the old league of nations henry cabot lodge jr lodges grandson served as us ambassador to the united nations from 1953 to 1960 washington naval conferenceedit in 1922 president warren g harding appointed lodge as a delegate to the washington naval conference international conference on the limitation of armaments led by secretary of state charles evans hughes and included elihu root and oscar underwood this was the first disarmament conference in history and had a goal of world peace through arms reduction attended by nine nations the united states japan china france great britain italy belgium the netherlands and portugal the conference resulted in three major treaties fourpower treaty fivepower treaty more commonly known as the washington naval treaty and the ninepower treaty as well as a number of smaller agreements30 lodgefish resolutionedit in june 1922 he introduced the lodgefish resolution to illustrate american support for the british policy in palestine per the 1917 balfour declaration legacyedit historian george e mowry argues that henry cabot lodge was one of the best informed statesmen of his time he was an excellent parliamentarian and he brought to bear on foreign questions a mind that was at once razor sharp and devoid of much of the moral cant that was so typical of the ageyet lodge never made the contributions he should have made largely because of lodge the person he was opportunistic selfish jealous condescending supercilious and could never resist calling his opponents spade a dirty shovel small wonder that except for roosevelt and root most of his colleagues of both parties disliked him and many distrusted him31 personal lifeedit in 1871 he married anna nannie cabot mills davis32 daughter of admiral charles henry davis they had three children constance davis lodge 1872–1948 wife of us representative augustus peabody gardner from 1892 to 1918 and brigadier general clarence charles williams from 1923 to 1948 george cabot lodge 1873–1909 a noted poet and politician georges sons henry cabot lodge jr 1902–1985 and john davis lodge 1903–1985 also became politicians33 john ellerton lodge 1876–1942 an art curator34 on november 5 1924 lodge suffered a severe stroke while recovering in the hospital from surgery for gallstones35 he died four days later at the age of 7436 he was interred in the mount auburn cemetery in cambridge massachusetts37 ancestryedit ancestors of
