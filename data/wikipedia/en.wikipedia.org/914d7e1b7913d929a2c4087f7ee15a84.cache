in the united states and united kingdom during the mid1950s4 the terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles pop and rock were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s when they became increasingly differentiated from each other although pop music is seen as just the singles charts it is not the sum of all chart music pop music is eclectic and often borrows elements from other styles such as urban dance rock latin and country nonetheless there are core elements that define pop music identifying factors include generally short to mediumlength songs written in a basic format often the versechorus structure as well as common use of repeated choruses melodic tunes and hooks contents 1 definitions and etymology 2 characteristics 3 development and influence 31 stylistic evolution 32 technology and media 33 legitimacy in music criticism 34 international spread 4 see also 5 references 6 further reading 7 external links definitions and etymologyedit david hatch and stephen millward define pop music as a body of music which is distinguishable from popular jazz and folk musics5 according to pete seeger pop music is professional music which draws upon both folk music and fine arts music3 although pop music is seen as just the singles charts it is not the sum of all chart music the music charts contain songs from a variety of sources including classical jazz rock and novelty songs pop music as a genre is seen as existing and developing separately6 thus pop music may be used to describe a distinct genre designed to appeal to all often characterized as instant singlesbased music aimed at teenagers in contrast to rock music as albumbased music for adults48 pop music continuously evolves along with the terms definition according to the new grove dictionary of music and musicians popular music is defined as the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class9 the term pop song was first recorded as being used in 1926 in the sense of a piece of music having popular appeal10 hatch and millward indicate that many events in the history of recording in the 1920s can be seen as the birth of the modern pop music industry including in country blues and hillbilly music11 the oxford dictionary of music states that the term pop refers to music performed by such artists as the rolling stones pictured here in a 2006 performance according to the website of the new grove dictionary of music and musicians called grove music online the term pop music originated in britain in the mid1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced2 the oxford dictionary of music states that while pops earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience  since the late 1950s however pop has had the special meaning of nonclassical music usually in the form of songs performed by such artists as the beatles the rolling stones abba etc12 grove music online also states that  in the early 1960s the term pop music competed terminologically with beat music in england while in the usa its coverage overlapped as it still does with that of rock and roll2 from about 1967 the term was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music a division that gave generic significance to both terms13 whereas rock aspired to authenticity and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music13 pop was more commercial ephemeral and accessible14 according to british musicologist simon frith pop music is produced as a matter of enterprise not art is designed to appeal to everyone and doesnt come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste it is not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward  and in musical terms it is essentially conservative it is provided from on high by record companies radio programmers and concert promoters rather than being made from below  pop is not a doityourself music but is professionally produced and packaged4 characteristicsedit the righteous brothers – youve lost that lovin feelin 1965 as of 2011update youve lost that lovin feelin ranks as the most frequently played song in us radio history15 described by music writers nick logan and bob woffinden as the ultimate pop record16 problems playing this file see media help according to frith characteristics of pop music include an aim of appealing to a general audience rather than to a particular subculture or ideology and an emphasis on craftsmanship rather than formal artistic qualities4 music scholar timothy warner said it typically has an emphasis on recording production and technology rather than live performance a tendency to reflect existing trends rather than progressive developments and aims to encourage dancing or uses danceoriented rhythms14 the main medium of pop music is the song often between two and a half and three and a half minutes in length generally marked by a consistent and noticeable rhythmic element a mainstream style and a simple traditional structure17 common variants include the versechorus form and the thirtytwobar form with a focus on melodies and catchy hooks and a chorus that contrasts melodically rhythmically and harmonically with the verse18 the beat and the melodies tend to be simple with limited harmonic accompaniment19 the lyrics of modern pop songs typically focus on simple themes – often love and romantic relationships – although there are notable exceptions4 harmony and chord progressions in pop music are often that of classical european tonality only more simpleminded20 clichés include the barbershop quartetstyle harmony ie ii – v – i and blues scaleinfluenced harmony21 there was a lessening of the influence of traditional views of the circle of fifths between the mid1950s and the late 1970s including less predominance for the dominant function22 development and influenceedit stylistic evolutionedit see also traditional pop pop rock experimental pop orchestral pop progressive pop synthpop and indie pop this section is missing information about the 1980s–2000s please expand the section to include this information further details may exist on the talk page october 2017 throughout its development pop music has absorbed influences from other genres of popular music early pop music drew on the sentimental ballad for its form gained its use of vocal harmonies from gospel and soul music instrumentation from jazz and rock music orchestration from classical music tempo from dance music backing from electronic music rhythmic elements from hiphop music and spoken passages from rap4verification needed in the 1960s the majority of mainstream pop music fell in two categories guitar drum and bass groups or singers backed by a traditional orchestra23 since early in the decade it was common for pop producers songwriters and engineers to freely experiment with musical form orchestration unnatural reverb and other sound effects some of the best known examples are phil spectors wall of sound and joe meeks use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like the tornados24 at the same time pop music on radio and in both american and british film moved away from refined tin pan alley to more eccentric songwriting and incorporated reverbdrenched rock guitar symphonic strings and horns played by groups of properly arranged and rehearsed studio musicians25 during the mid1960s pop music made repeated forays into new sounds styles and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners the word progressive was frequently used and it was thought that every song and single was to be a progression from the last26 music critic simon reynolds writes that beginning with 1967 a divide would exist between progressive pop and masschart pop a separation which was also broadly one between boys and girls middleclass and workingclass27 before the progressive pop of the late 1960s performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music28 assisted by the mid1960s economic boom record labels began investing in artists giving them freedom to experiment and offering them limited control over their content and marketing29 this situation fell in disuse after the late 1970s and would not reemerge until the rise of internet stars29 indie pop which developed in the late 1970s marked another departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music with guitar bands formed on the thennovel premise that one could record and release their own music without having to procure a record contract from a major label30 in 2014 pop music worldwide was permeated by electronic dance music31 a scientific reports study that examined over 464000 recordings of popular music recorded between 1955 and 2010 found less variety in pitch progressions growing average loudness levels32 less diverse instrumentation and recording techniques and less timbral variety which declined after reaching a peak in the 1960s33 scientific americans john matson reported that this seems to support the popular anecdotal observation that pop music of yore was better or at least more varied than today’s top40 stuff33 technology and mediaedit left michael jackson right madonna known respectively as the king and queen of pop34 in the 1940s improved microphone design allowed a more intimate singing style35 and ten or twenty years later inexpensive and more durable 45 rpm records for singles revolutionized the manner in which pop has been disseminated and helped to move pop music to a recordradiofilm star system35 another technological change was the widespread availability of television in the 1950s with televised performances pop stars had to have a visual presence35 in the 1960s the introduction of inexpensive portable transistor radios meant that first world teenagers could listen to music outside of the home35 multitrack recording from the 1960s and digital sampling from the 1980s have also been utilized as methods for the creation and elaboration of pop music4 by the early 1980s the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of music television channels like mtv which favoured those artists such as michael jackson and madonna who had a strong visual appeal35 legitimacy in music criticismedit see also poptimism the latter half of the 20thcentury included a largescale trend in american culture in which the boundaries between art and pop music were increasingly blurred36 between 1950 and 1970 there was a debate of pop versus art37 since then certain music publications have embraced its legitimacy according to popmatters robert loss there’s a strong argument for the rockist mode in music criticism—that it exists and that it’s harmful—and poptimism has positioned itself as a corrective an antidote in general the old guard of rock critics and journalists is depicted as a bunch of bricklayers for the foundations of the rock and roll hall of fame true in part which is to say false like film studies rock criticism of the late ‘60s and the ‘70s was an attempt to make popular music worthy of study it was poptimism before its day37 international spreadedit the story of pop music is largely the story of the intertwining pop culture of the united states and the united kingdom in the postwar era “ ”  — bob stanley31 pop music has been dominated by the american and from the mid1960s british music industries whose influence has made pop music something of an international monoculture but most regions and countries have their own form of pop music sometimes producing local versions of wider trends and lending them local characteristics38 some of these trends for example europop have had a significant impact of the development of the genre39 according to grove music online westernderived pop styles whether coexisting with or marginalizing distinctively local genres have spread throughout the world and have come to constitute stylistic common denominators in global commercial music cultures40 some nonwestern countries such as japan have developed a thriving pop music industry most of which is devoted to westernstyle pop has for several years produced a greater quantity of music of everywhere except the usaclarification needed40 the spread of westernstyle pop music has been interpreted variously as representing processes of americanization homogenization modernization creative appropriation cultural imperialism or a more general process of globalization40 in korea pop musics influence has led to the birth of boy bands and girl groups which have gained overseas renown through both their music and aesthetics41 korean coed groups mixed gender groups have not been as successful42 see alsoedit music portal honorific nicknames in popular music origins of rock and roll
