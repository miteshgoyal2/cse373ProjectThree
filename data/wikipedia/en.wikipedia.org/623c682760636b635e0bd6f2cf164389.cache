1820–69 then a whig party member and later second chairman of the newly organized republican party national committee and former banker george jones other early investors of the company were edwin b morgan26 christopher morgan27 and edward b wesley28 sold for a penny equivalent to 29 cents today the inaugural edition attempted to address various speculations on its purpose and positions that preceded its release29 we shall be conservative in all cases where we think conservatism essential to the public good—and we shall be radical in everything which may seem to us to require radical treatment and radical reform we do not believe that everything in society is either exactly right or exactly wrong—what is good we desire to preserve and improve—what is evil to exterminate or reform in 1852 the newspaper started a western division the times of california that arrived whenever a mail boat got to california however when local california newspapers came into prominence the effort failed30 the newspaper shortened its name to the newyork times on september 14 1857 it dropped the hyphen in the city name on december 1 189631 on april 21 1861 the new york times departed from its original monday–saturday publishing schedule and joined other major dailies in adding a sunday edition to offer daily coverage of the civil war one of the earliest public controversies it was involved with was the mortara affair the subject of twenty editorials it published alone32 the main office of the new york times was attacked during the new york draft riots sparked by the beginning of military conscription for the northern union army now instituted in the midst of the civil war on july 13 1863 at newspaper row across from city hall henry raymond owner and editor of the new york times averted the rioters with gatling early machine rapidfiring guns one of which he manned himself the mob now diverted instead attacked the headquarters of abolitionist publisher horace greeleys

times square building the new york times publishing headquarters 1913–2007 the newspapers influence grew during 1870–1 when it published a series of exposés on william magear boss tweed leader of the citys democratic party—popularly known as tammany hall from its early 19th century meeting headquarters—that led to the end of the tweed rings domination of new yorks city hall35 tweed offered the new york times five million dollars equivalent to more than 100 million dollars today to not publish the story26 in the 1880s the new york times transitioned gradually from editorially supporting republican party candidates to becoming more politically independent and analytical36 in 1884 the paper supported democrat grover cleveland former mayor of buffalo and governor of new york state in his first presidential campaign37 while this move cost the new york times a portion of its readership among its more progressive and republican readers the revenue went down from 188000 to 56000 from 18834 however some part of this was due to the price going down to two cents in order to compete with the world and sun the paper eventually regained most of its lost ground within a few years38 ochs era after george jones died in 1891 charles ransom miller raised 1 million dollars to buy the times along with other fellow editors at the newspaper printing it under the new york times publishing company3940 however the newspaper was financially crippled by the panic of 189338 by 1896 the new york times had a circulation of less than 9000 and was losing 1000 a day when controlling interest in it was gained by adolph ochs publisher of the chattanooga times for 7500041 shortly after assuming control of the paper ochs coined the papers slogan all the news thats fit to print the slogan has appeared in the paper since september 189642 and has been printed in a box in the upper left hand corner of the front page since early 189737 this was a jab at competing papers such as joseph pulitzers new york world and william randolph hearsts new york journal which were now being known for a lurid sensationalist and often inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions known by the end of the century as yellow journalism43 under ochs guidance continuing and expanding upon the henry raymond tradition which were from the era of james gordon bennett of the new york herald which predated

times co v sullivan the papers involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key united states supreme court decisions supporting freedom of the press new york times co v sullivan in it the united states supreme court established the actual malice standard for press reports about public officials or public figures to be considered defamatory or libelous the malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity because of the high burden of proof on the plaintiff and difficulty in proving malicious intent such cases by public figures rarely succeed46 the pentagon papers main article pentagon papers in 1971 the pentagon papers a secret united

and offensive actions taken by us marines well before the public was told about the actions all while president lyndon b johnson had been promising not to expand the war the document increased the credibility gap for the us government and hurt efforts by the nixon administration to fight the ongoing war47 when the new york times began publishing its series president richard nixon became incensed his words to national security advisor henry kissinger included people have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing and lets get the sonofabitch in jail48 after failing to get the

the supreme court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required the justices wrote nine separate opinions disagreeing on significant substantive issues while it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the first amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech many felt it a

contributors such as carl bernstein christopher cerf tony hendra and george plimpton149150 editorial stance the new york times editorial page is often regarded as liberal151152 in mid2004 the newspapers then public editor ombudsman daniel okrent wrote that the oped page editors do an evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays from outsiders they publish – but you need an awfully heavy counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists only two of whom could be classified as conservative and even then of the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions and in the case of william safire opposes some central provisions of the patriot act153 the new york times has not endorsed a republican party member for president since dwight d eisenhower in 1956 since 1960 it has endorsed the democratic party nominee in every presidential election see new york times presidential endorsements154 however the times did

reelection in 2002158 coverage issues iraq war the new york times supported the 2003 invasion of iraq159 on may 26 2004 a year after the war started the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been and were insufficiently qualified frequently overly dependent upon information from iraqi exiles desiring regime change160 reporter judith miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the leadup to the iraq war was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the bush administrations position for which the new york times later apologized161162 one of millers prime sources was ahmed chalabi an iraqi expatriate who returned to iraq after the us invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from may 2005 until may 2006163164 iran a 2015 study found that the new york times fed into an overarching tendency towards national bias during the iranian nuclear crisis the newspaper minimized the negative processes of the united states while overemphasizing similar processes of iran this tendency was shared by other papers such as the guardian tehran times and the fars news agency while xinhua news agency was found to be more neutral while at the same time mimicking the foreign policy of the peoples republic of china165 israeli–palestinian conflict a 2003 study in the harvard international journal of presspolitics concluded that the new york times reporting was more favorable to israelis than to palestinians166 a 2002 study published in the journal journalism examined middle east coverage of the second intifada over a onemonth period in the times washington post and chicago tribune the study authors said that the times was the most slanted in a proisraeli direction with a bias reflected in its use of headlines photographs graphics sourcing practices and lead paragraphs167 for its coverage of the israeli–palestinian conflict some such as ed koch have claimed that the paper is propalestinian while others such as asad abukhalil have insisted that it is proisrael168169 the israel lobby and us foreign policy by political science professors john mearsheimer and stephen walt alleges that the new york times sometimes criticizes israeli policies but is not evenhanded and is generally proisrael170 on the other hand the simon wiesenthal center has criticized the new york times for printing cartoons regarding the israelipalestinian conflict that were claimed to be antisemitic171 israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity a piece in which thomas friedman commented that praise awarded to netanyahu during a speech at congress was paid for by the israel lobby elicited an apology and clarification from its writer172 the new york times public editor clark hoyt concluded in his january 10 2009 column though the most vociferous supporters of israel and the palestinians do not agree i think the new york times largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war has tried its best to do a fair balanced and complete job — and has largely succeeded173 world war ii on november 14 2001 in the new york times 150th anniversary issue former executive editor max frankel wrote that before and during world war ii the ny times had maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on the holocaust in their news pages174 laurel leff associate professor of journalism at northeastern university concluded that the newspaper had downplayed the third reich targeting of jews for genocide her 2005 book buried by the times documents the papers tendency before during and after world war ii to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of jews while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the nazis crimes on jews in particular leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of the newspapers jewish publisher arthur hays sulzberger concerning jewishness antisemitism and zionism175 during the war the new york times journalist william l laurence was on the payroll of the war department176177 criticism and controversies main article new york times controversies failure to report famine in ukraine the new

pulitzer prize for his work at that time however he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine most particularly the ukrainian famine in the 1930s178179180181 in 2003 after the pulitzer board began a renewed inquiry the times hired mark von hagen professor of russian history at columbia university to review durantys work von hagen found durantys reports to be unbalanced and uncritical and that they far too often gave voice to stalinist propaganda in comments to the press he stated for the sake of the new york times honor they should take the prize away182 fashion news articles promoting advertisers in the mid to late 1950s fashion writers were required to come up every month with articles whose total columninches reflected the relative advertising strength of every department or specialty store assigned to a writer the monitor of all this was the advertising director of the nyt however within this requirement story ideas may have been the reporters and editors own183 jayson blair plagiarism main article jayson blair § plagiarism and fabrication scandal in may 2003 the new york times reporter jayson blair was forced to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories some critics contended that africanamerican blairs race was a major factor in his hiring and in the new york times initial reluctance to fire him184 duke university lacrosse case the newspaper was criticized for largely reporting the prosecutors version of events in the 2006 duke lacrosse case185186 suzanne smalley of newsweek criticized the newspaper for its credulous187 coverage of the charges of rape against duke university lacrosse players stuart taylor jr and kc johnson in their book until proven innocent political correctness and the shameful injustices of the duke lacrosse rape case write at the head of the guiltpresuming pack the new york times vied in a race to the journalistic bottom with trashtv talk

in june 2010 the new york times magazine published a correction on its cover article of mia acknowledging that the interview conducted by current w editor and thentimes magazine contributor lynn

agency warrantless surveillance program196 exnsa officials blew the whistle on the program to journalists james risen and eric lichtblau who presented an investigative article to the newspaper in november 2004 weeks before americas presidential election contact with former agency officials began the previous summer197 former the new york times executive editor bill keller decided not to report the piece after being pressured by the bush administration and being advised not to do so by new york times washington bureau chief philip taubman keller explained the silences rationale in an interview with the newspaper in 2013 stating three years after 911 we as a country were still under the influence of that trauma and we as a newspaper were not immune198 in 2014 pbs frontline interviewed risen and lichtblau who said that the newspapers plan was to not publish the story at all the editors were furious at me risen said to the program they thought i was being insubordinate risen wrote a book about the mass surveillance revelations after the new york times declined the pieces publication and only released it after risen told them that he would publish the book another reporter told npr that the newspaper avoided disaster by ultimately publishing the story199 irish student controversy on june 16 2015 the new york times published an article reporting the deaths of six irish students staying in berkeley california when the balcony they were standing on collapsed the papers story insinuating that they were to blame for the collapse the paper stated that the behavior of irish students coming to the us on j1 visas was an embarrassment to ireland200 the irish taoiseach and former president of ireland criticized the newspaper for being insensitive and inaccurate in its handling of the story201 nail salon series in may 2015 a new york times exposé by sarah maslin nir on the working conditions of manicurists in new york city and elsewhere202 and the health hazards to which they are exposed203 attracted wide attention resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by new york governor andrew m cuomo204 in july 2015 the storys claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former new york times reporter richard bernstein in the new york review of books bernstein whose wife owns two nail salons asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience and were not evidenced by ads in the chineselanguage papers cited by the story205 the new york times editorial staff subsequently answered bernsteins criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy206 the independent nyt public editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with bernstein and looked into his complaints and expressed her belief that the storys reporting was sound207 in september and october 2015 nail salon owners and workers protested at the new york times offices several times in response to the story and the ensuing new york state crackdown208209 in october 2015 reason magazine published a three part rereporting of the story by jim epstein charging that the series was filled with misquotes and factual errors respecting both its claims of illegally low wages and health hazards epstein additionally argued that the new york times had mistranslated the ads cited in its answer to bernstein and that those ads actually validated bernsteins argument210211212 in november 2015 the new york times public editor concluded that the exposés findings and the language used to express them should have been dialed back — in some instances substantially and recommended that the times write further followup stories including some that reexamine its original findings and that take on the criticism from salon owners and others — not defensively but with an open mind213 hiring practices in april 2016 two black female employees in their sixties filed a federal class action lawsuit against the new york times company ceo mark thompson and chief revenue officer meredith levien claiming age gender and racial discrimination the plaintiffs claim that the times advertising department favored younger white employees over older black employees in making firing and promotion decisions214215 the times said that the suit was entirely without merit and was a series of recycled scurrilous and unjustified attacks215 accusations of bias new york times public editor ombudsman elizabeth spayd wrote in 2016 that conservatives and even many moderates see in the times a bluestate worldview and accuse it of harboring a liberal bias spayd did not analyze the substance of the claim but did opine that the times is part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country that in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources216 times executive editor dean baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias but that we have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in the new york times i want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world not just a segment of it its a really difficult goal do we pull it off all the time no216 times public editor arthur brisbane wrote in 2012 when the times covers a national presidential campaign i have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance and usually succeed in doing so across the papers many departments though so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism — for lack of a better term — that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of the times217 in mid2004 the newspapers thenpublic editor daniel okrent wrote an opinion piece in which he said that the new york times did have a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues such as abortion and samesex marriage he stated that this bias reflected the papers cosmopolitanism which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of new york city153 he wrote if youre examining the papers coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor northeastern nor culturally seenitall if you are among the groups the times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide devout catholics gun owners orthodox jews texans if your value system wouldnt wear well on a composite new york times journalist then a walk through this paper can make you feel youre traveling in a strange and forbidding world153 okrent wrote that the times arts leisure the sunday times magazine and culture coverage trend to the left218 in december 2004 a university of california los angeles study by former fellows of a conservative think tank gave the new york times a score of 737 on a 100point scale with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal making it the secondmost liberal major newspaper in the study after the wall street journal 851219 the validity of the study has been questioned however the liberal watchdog group media matters for america pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the authors funding and political scientists such as brendan nyhan cited flaws in the studys methodology220221 donald trump has frequently criticized the new york times on his twitter account before and during his presidency since november 2015 trump has referred to the times as the failing new york times in a series of tweets222 despite trumps criticism new york times editor mark thompson noted that the paper had enjoyed soaring digital readership with the fourth quarter of 2016 seeing the highest number of new digital subscribers to the newspaper since 2011223224225 critic matt taibbi accused the new york times of favoring hillary clinton over bernie sanders in the papers news coverage of the 2016 democratic presidential primaries226 responding to the complaints of many readers new york times public editor margaret sullivan wrote that the times has not ignored mr sanderss campaign but it hasnt always taken it very seriously the tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive even mocking at times some of that is focused on the candidates age appearance and style rather than what he has to say227 times senior editor carolyn ryan defended both the volume of new york times coverage noting that sanders had received about the same amount of article coverage as jeb bush and marco rubio and its tone228 reputation the times has developed a national and international reputation for thoroughness over time229 among journalists the paper is held in high regard a 1999 survey of newspaper editors conducted by the columbia journalism review found that the times was the best american paper ahead of the washington post the wall street journal and los angeles times230 the times also was ranked 1 in a 2011 quality ranking of us newspapers by daniel de vise of the washington post the objective ranking took into account the number of recent pulitzer prizes won circulation and perceived web site quality230 a 2012 report in wnyc called the times the most respected newspaper in the world231 nevertheless like many other us media sources the times had suffered from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the us from 2004 to 2012232 a pew research center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations among respondents who gave a rating 49 said that they believed all or most of the timess reporting while 50 disagreed a large percentage 19 of respondents were unable to rate believability the timess score was comparable to that of usa today232 media analyst brooke gladstone of wnycs on the media writing for the new york times says that the decline in us public trust of the mass media can be explained 1 by the rise of the polarized internetdriven news 2 by a decline in trust in us institutions more generally and 3 by the fact that americans say they want accuracy and impartiality but the polls suggest that actually most of us are seeking affirmation233 awards main article list of awards won by the new york times the new york times has won 122 pulitzer prizes more than any other newspaper the prize is awarded for excellence in journalism in a range of categories234 it has also won three
