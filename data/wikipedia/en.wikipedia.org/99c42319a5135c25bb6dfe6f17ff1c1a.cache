music video game from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search open source music video game stepmania a music video game also commonly known as a music game is a video game where the gameplay is meaningfully and often almost entirely oriented around the players interactions with a musical score or individual songs music video games may take a variety of forms and are often grouped with puzzle games123456 due to their common use of rhythmically generated puzzles78 music video games are distinct from purely audio games eg the 1997 sega saturn release real sound kaze no regret in that they feature a visual feedback to lead the player through the games soundtrack although eidetic music games can fall under both categoriescitation needed contents 1 major gameplay variations 11 music memory games 12 freeform music games 13 hybrid music games 2 see also 3 references 4 external links major gameplay variationsedit as the genre has gained popularity and expanded music video games have demonstrated the ability to support a range of different styles of gameplay while the oldest form of gameplay is eidetic in nature the most common form of music game today is rhythmic in nature and has been termed the rhythm game other common modes of gameplay in music video games include the sandbox style that encourages a freeform gameplay approach and the recent hybrid style that combines musical elements with more traditional genres such as the shooter or puzzle game music video games are also commonly included as minigames in party gamescitation needed music memory gamesedit main article rhythm game music memory games test a players musical memory sightreading music games take a variety of forms depending upon which aspect of the music serves as the focus of gameplay although the majority of such games primarily emphasize rhythm as the major gameplaydeterminative musical element other elements of musical notation and development such as pitch and volume also serve as points of emphasis in a number of games in all of these gameforms the goal of the player is to provide a direct injective response to each prompt linked to an element of the music from the gamecitation needed rhythmbased games range from dance games such as dance dance revolution and other musicbased games such as donkey konga and guitar hero these games challenge the player to press the right button at the right time the popularity of these rhythmbased games has created a market for specialty input devices such as dance mats and electronic drums9 early games include dance aerobics 1987 and parappa the rapper 199610 freeform music gamesedit freeform music games characterized by games such as simtunes are those in which the creation of music takes predominance over gameplay and as such these games are often more similar to nongame music synthesizers such as the tenorion free form music games occupy a position somewhere between generative hybrid music games and nongame utilities dependent upon the degree to which their gameplay relies upon a driving underlying plotline this form of music game is closely analogous to sandbox games in the realm of nonmusical games and the term sandbox has been used to describe this form of gameplay11 hybrid music gamesedit an offshoot of the serious games initiative12 hybrid forms of music video games such as otocky a generative hybrid and pteranodon a reactive hybrid are characterized by substantial and meaningful interactions between a player and the music in a game that ostensibly belongs to a nonmusical genrecitation needed generativeform hybrid music video games often make the concert music resulting from the interaction between performer and ingame dynamics a goal of the game13 to achieve this the nonmusical genres to which these games give the outward appearance of belonging are often characterized by simple straightforward dynamics14 in rez or free the beat for example the game takes the form of a simple rail shooter however by integrating sound effects created by the actions of the player as he completes the normal tasks of railshooting with the soundtrack as a whole the game is intended to permit the players direct interaction with the soundtrack and to encourage the creation of a synaesthetic experience15 the major difference between the generative and reactive forms of hybrid music video games is that games of the generative form allow for the creation of music as determined by gameplay whereas those of the reactive form employ music to determine gameplay reactiveform hybrid music video games such as pteranodon rhyme rider kerorican or is – internal section focus upon the underlying genre such that the music serves to determine the dynamics of the nonmusical components of the game in these games the player takes substantial cues from the soundtrack to devise his gameplay comparable reactiveform16 music video games such as vibribbon audiosurf or dance factory lack a differentiable underlying genre and as such cannot be considered hybrid music gamescitation needed see alsoedit video game music list of music video games referencesedit gamespots best of 2005 genre
