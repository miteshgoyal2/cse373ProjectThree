john law left and michael mikel one of the roots of the annual event now known as burning man began as a bonfire ritual on the summer solstice in 1986 when larry harvey jerry james and a few friends met on baker beach in san francisco9 and burned a 9foot 27meter wooden man as well as a smaller wooden dog harvey has described his inspiration for burning these effigies as a spontaneous act of radical selfexpression10 the event did have earlier roots though sculptor mary grauberger a friend of harveys girlfriend janet lohr held solstice bonfire gatherings on baker beach for several years prior to 1986 some of which harvey attended when grauberger stopped organizing it harvey picked up the torch so to speak and ran with it10 he and jerry james built the first wooden effigy on the afternoon of june 21 1986 cobbled together using scrap wood to be torched later that evening in 1987 the effigy grew to almost 15 feet 46 meters tall and by 1988 it had grown to around 40 feet 12 meters1112 by 1988 larry harvey formally named the summer solstice ritual burning man by titling flyers for the happening as such to ward off references such as wicker man referring to the practice of burning live sacrifices in wicker cages harvey has stated that he had not seen the 1973 cult film the wicker man until many years after and that it did not inspire the action1113 1990 to 1996edit in 1990 a separate event was planned by kevin evans and john law on the remote and largely unknown dry lake known as black rock desert about 110 miles north of reno nevada14 evans conceived it as a dadaist temporary autonomous zone with sculpture to be burned and situationist performance art he asked john law who also had experience on the dry lake and was a defining founder of cacophony society to take on central organizing functions in the cacophony societys newsletter it was announced as zone 4 a bad day at black rock inspired by the 1955 film of the same name meanwhile the beach burn was interrupted by the park police for not having a permit after striking a deal to raise the man but not to burn it event organizers disassembled the effigy and returned it to the vacant lot where it had been built shortly thereafter the legs and torso of the man were chainsawed and the pieces removed when the lot was unexpectedly leased as a parking lot the effigy was reconstructed led by dan miller harveys thenhousemate of many years just in time to take it to zone trip 415 michael mikel another active cacophonist realized that a group unfamiliar with the environment of the dry lake would be helped by knowledgeable persons to ensure they did not get lost in the deep dry lake and risk dehydration and death he took the name danger ranger and created the black rock rangers thus the seed of black rock city was germinated as a fellowship organized by law and mikel based on evans idea along with harvey and james symbolic man drawing on experience in the sign business and with light sculpture john law prepared custom neon tubes for the man in 1991 so it could be seen as a beacon at night in its first years the community grew by word of mouth alone all were considered participants by virtue of surviving in the desolate surreal trackless plain of the black rock desert there were no paid or scheduled performers or artists no separation between artspace and livingspace no rules other than dont interfere with anyone elses immediate experience and no guns in central camp 1991 marked the first year that the event had a legal permit through the blm the bureau of land management16 1992 saw the birth of a smaller intensive about 20 participants the first year about 100 in years two and three nearby event named desert siteworks conceived and directed by william binzen and coproduced in 1993 and 94 with judy west17 the annual several weekslong event was held over summer solstice at various fertile hot springs surrounding the desert participants built art and participated in selfdirected performances some key organizers of burning man were also part of desert siteworks john law michael mikel and william binzen was a friend of larry harvey hence the two events saw lots of crosspollination of ideas and participants18 the desert siteworks project ran for three years 1992–1994 1996 was the first year a formal partnership was created to own the name burning man and was also the last year that the event was held in the middle of the black rock desert with no fence around it before the event opened to the public in 1996 a festival worker named michael fury was killed in a motorcycle crash while riding from gerlach nevada to the burning man camp in the black rock desert harvey insisted that the death had not occurred at burning man since the gates were not yet open another couple was run over in their tent by an art car driving to rave camp which was at that time distant from the main camp after the 1996 event cofounder and partner john law broke with burning man and publicly said the event should not continue 1997 to presentedit the neontubed man at the 1999 event 1997 marked another major pivotal year for the event by 1996 the event had grown to 8000 attendees and unrestricted driving on the open playa was becoming a major safety hazard to implement a ban on driving and recreate the event as a pedestrianbicycleartcaronly event it was decided to move to private gated property fly ranch with the adjoining hualapai mini dry lakebed just west of the black rock desert was chosen this moved burning man from pershing countyfederal blm land into the jurisdiction of washoe county which brought a protracted list of permit requirements19 to comply with the new requirements and to manage the increased liability load the organizers formed black rock city llc will roger peterson and flynn mauthe created the department of public works dpw to build the city grid layout a requirement so that emergency vehicles could be directed to an address designed by rod garrett an architect rod continued as the city designer through 2011 until his death at 76 he is also credited with the design of all of the man bases from 2001 through 2012 the center camp cafe and first camp20 with the success of the driving ban having no vehicular incidents 1998 saw a return to the black rock desert along with a temporary perimeter fence the event has remained there since as the population of black rock city grew further rules were established in relation to its survival some critics of the event cite the addition of these rules as impinging on the original freedoms altering the experience unacceptably while others find the increased level of activity more than balances out the changes a grid street structure21 a speed limit of 5 mph 8 kmh22 a ban on driving except for approved mutant vehicles and service vehicles23 safety standards on mutant vehicles22 burning their own art must be done on an approved burn platform24 a ban on fireworks25 a ban on dogs26 light matter burning man 2004 another notable restriction to attendees is the 7mile11 km long temporary plastic fence that surrounds the event and defines the pentagon of land used by the event on the southern edge of the black rock dry lake27 this 4foot 12 meter high barrier is known as the trash fence because its initial use was to catch windblown debris that might escape from campsites during the event since 2002 the area beyond this fence has not been accessible to burning man participants during the week of the event28 one visitor who was accidentally burned at the 2005 event unsuccessfully sued black rock city llc in san francisco county superior court on june 30 2009 the california court of appeal for the first district upheld the trial courts grant of summary judgment to black rock city llc on the basis that visitors who deliberately walk towards the burning man after it is lit assume the risk of getting burned by such an obviously hazardous object29 transition to a nonprofit organizationedit in april 2011 larry harvey announced that the llc was beginning a threeyear process to transfer ownership and control of the event over to a new nonprofit organization called the burning man project the move towards becoming a nonprofit organization was the result of bitter infighting between members of the board at one point it looked like all of the board members were going to hire lawyers corporate appraisers were brought in to determine how much the company was worth which larry harvey found abhorrent and against all of the values that burning man stood for30 an earlier agreement stated that each member of the llc would only receive sole compensation for many years of service a golden parachute of 20000 but the members now agreed to an arrangement whereby each member of the llc would receive an undisclosed sum prior to the transfer of their ownership rights to the burning man project marian goodell board member and head of communication addressed concerns about the lack of transparency with this statement when you’re in the middle of a storm if you’re going to explain all of how you got there and how you’re going to get out it often sets more panic among the survivors than if you just sail the boat out of the darkness31 it was announced in march 2014 via the official burning man blog that the nonprofit transition was complete32 under the new nonprofit structure black rock city llc the longtime forprofit responsible for the event would be a subsidiary of the nonprofit burning man project although unmentioned in the initial announcement the terms and conditions for ticket buyers were changed to reflect an alteration in the structure of the business under the new terms it was made known that a new llc was created decommodification llc which in the new nonprofit business structure owns all of the intellectual property associated with the burning man brand including ownership over logos and trademarks and will be responsible for enforcement thereof33 the nonprofit burning man project licenses usage of all intellectual property associated with burning man from decommodification llc after questions were raised by the community about this new llc within the comment section on the original nonprofit announcement larry harvey confirmed that he and the other founders were the sole owners of this new llc timeline of the eventedit the statistics below illustrate the growth in attendance of the burning man event from a few handfuls of people to more than 70000 in 2015 as well as other facts and figures34 burning man 2006 was covered extensively for television for the first time by subscription television channel current tv which handed out cameras to participants and broadcast daily updates via satellite from the dry lake tv free burning man also provided tv viewers an hourlong live feed of the burn and was shown without commercial sponsorship tv free returned in

sale the main sale was originally planned to be followed by a secondary open sale of 10000 tickets however as the huge demand from the main sale left many veteran burners and theme camps without

goals fostered by participatory attendees known as burners burning man does not have a single focus features of the event are subject to the participants and include community artwork absurdity decommodification and revelry participation is encouraged8283 the burning man event and its affiliated communities are guided by ten principles that are meant to evoke the cultural ethos that has emerged from the event they were originally written by larry harvey in 200484 as guidelines for regional organizing then later became a universal criterion of the general culture of the multifaceted movement they are85 radical inclusion gifting decommodification radical selfreliance radical selfexpression communal effort civic responsibility leaving no trace participation immediacy the descriptions in quotes are the actual text radical inclusionedit anyone may be a part of burning man we welcome and respect the stranger no prerequisites exist for participation in our community this was written with a broad stroke for general organizing meaning anyone is welcome to the burning man culture prerequisites for the burning man85 event are participants expected to provide for their own basic needs follow the guidelines stated in the annually updated event survival guide and purchase a ticket to get in86 giftingedit burning man is devoted to acts of gift giving the value of a gift is unconditional gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value instead of cash participants at the burning man event in the black rock desert are encouraged to rely on a gift economy a sort of potlatch in the earliest days of the event an underground barter economy also existed in which burners exchanged favors with each other while this was originally supported by the burning man organization this is now largely discouraged instead burners are encouraged to give gifts to one another unconditionally decommodificationedit in order to preserve the spirit of gifting our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships transactions or advertising we stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation we resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience no cash transactions are permitted between attendees of the burning man event in the black rock desert cash can be used for a select few charity fuel and sanitation vendors as follows 87 café beverages such as coffee chai lemonade etc which are sold at center camp café operated by the organizers of the event88 ice sales benefit the local gerlachempire school system89 tickets for the shuttle bus to the nearest nevada communities of gerlach and empire which is operated by a contractor not participating in the event green tortoise90 a reentry wristband which allows a person to leave and reenter the event and may be purchased at the gate upon exit91 an airport use fee payable at the airport upon first entry92 diesel and biodiesel sold by thirdparty contractors rv dump service and camp graywater disposal service93 private portable toilets and servicing which can be arranged with the official contractor radical selfrelianceedit dust storms are common at burning man so many come prepared with appropriate provisions such as goggles and masks to reduce dust inhalation burning man encourages the individual to discover exercise and rely on his or her inner resources the events harsh environment and remote location the way it is makes participants expected to be responsible for their own subsistence since the llc forbids most commerce participants must be prepared and bring all their own supplies with the exception of the items stated in decommodification94 radical selfexpressionedit play media trojan horse pull burning man 2011 radical selfexpression arises from the unique gifts of the individual no one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content it is offered as a gift to others in this spirit the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient participants at the burning man event in the black rock desert are encouraged to express themselves in a number of ways through various art forms and projects the event is clothingoptional and public nudity is common though not practiced by the majority959697 communal effortedit our community values creative cooperation and collaboration we strive to produce promote and protect social networks public spaces works of art and methods of communication that support such interaction participants at the burning man event in the black rock desert are encouraged to work with and help fellow participants98 civic responsibilityedit we value civil society community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants they must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local state and federal laws leaving no traceedit burning man playa restoration 2015 – attendees carry moop matter out of place sticks and buckets and walk to pick up discarded materials as part of the leave no trace policy our community respects the environment we are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather we clean up after ourselves and endeavor whenever possible to leave such places in a better state than when we found them participationedit our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic we believe that transformative change whether in the individual or in society can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation we achieve being through doing everyone is invited to work everyone is invited to play we make the world real through actions that open the heart people are encouraged to participate rather than observe immediacyedit immediate experience is in many ways the most important touchstone of value in our culture we seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves the reality of those around us participation in society and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers no idea can substitute for this experience artedit coyote sculpture 2013 art on the dry lake is assisted by the artery which helps artists place their art in the desert and ensures lighting to prevent collisions burn platform to protect the integrity of the dry lake bed and fire safety requirements are met99 since 1995 a different theme has been created ostensibly by larry harvey for each years event for 2006 the theme was hope and fear100 and for 2007 it was the green man101102 the 2011 theme was rites of passage103 the 2012 theme was fertility 20104 it determines to some extent the design of the man although his design and construction while evolutionary has remained relatively unchanged and especially the structure on which he stands an observatory for vault of heaven a lighthouse for the floating world these themes also greatly affect the designs that participants employ in their artworks costumes camps and vehicles105 burning man primarily features outsider art and visionary art though a great variety of art forms appear during the event creative expression through the arts and interactive art are encouraged at burning man numerous theme camps registered and placed by organizers are created as event and residence centers by sizable subcommunities of participants and use extensive design and artistic elements to engage the greater community and meet interactivity requirements music performance and guerrilla street theatre are art forms commonly presented within the camps and developed areas of the city adjacent to the city the dry lake bed of lake lahontan serves as a tabula rasa for hundreds of isolated artworks ranging from small to very largescale art installations often sculptures with kinetic electronic and fire elements artwork is generally viewed as a freely given gift made by the artist to the community at his or her own expense art grants are however available to participants via a system of curation and oversight with application deadlines early in the year grants are intended to help artists produce work beyond the scope of their own means and are generally intended to cover only a portion of the costs associated with creation of the pieces usually requiring considerable reliance on an artists community resources aggregate funding for all grants varies depending on the number and quality of the submissions usually well over 100 but amounts to several percent on the order of 500000 in recent years of the gross receipts from ticket sales in 2006 29 pieces were funded various standards regarding the nature of the artworks eligible for grants are set by the art department but compliance with the theme and interactivity are important considerations this funding has fostered artistic communities most notably in the bay area of california the region that has historically provided a majority of the events participants there are active and successful outreach efforts to enlarge the regional scope of the event and the grant program among these is the black rock arts foundation braf while braf does not fund any installations for the event itself it relies on the donations from the burning man project for a significant portion of its funding and does facilitate presentation of work created for the event in outside venues as well as offering its own grants for artworks that typify interactivity and other principles and traditions the event mutant vehiclesedit praying mantis truck 2010 mutant vehicles often motorized are purposebuilt or creatively altered cars and trucks participants who wish to bring motorized mutant vehicles must submit their designs in advance to the events own dmv or department of mutant vehicles for approval and for physical inspection at the time of the event not all designs and proposals are accepted the event organizers and in turn the dmv have set the bar higher for what it deems an acceptable mv each year in effect capping the number of mutant vehicles this is in response to constraints imposed by the us bureau of land management which grants permits to hold the event on federal property and to participants who want to maintain a pedestrianfriendly environment vehicles that are minimally altered andor whose primary function is to transport participants are discouraged and rejected one of the criteria the dmv employs to determine whether an application for a proposed mutant vehicle is approved is can you recognize the base vehicle for example if a 1967 vw van covered with glitter dolls heads and old cooking utensils can still be recognized as a vw van it is considered to be decorated not mutated and is less likely to be approved this criterion led to the exclusion of some art cars which historically have been a staple of the event there were over six hundred approved mutant vehicles at the event in 2010 bicyclesedit cyclists at burning man 2010 bicycles and tricycles are popular for getting around on the dry lake mountain bikes are generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations using electroluminescent wire a thin flexible tube that glows with a neonlike effect when energized with electricity to create intricate patterns over the frame of the bike every night during burning man thousands of bikes and art cars drive around creating a visual display similar to las vegas at night except that the lights are mobile the templeedit the temple of joy 2002 temple of transition exterior 2011 temple of transition interior 2011

before and after the event122123 the remainder of the city including theme camps villages art installations and individual camping are all created by participants city planningedit oblique aerial photo of black rock city showing the familiar c pattern 2010 the developed part of the city is currently arranged as a series of concentric streets in an arc composing since 1999 twothirds of a 15mile 24km diameter circle with the man sculpture and his supporting complex at the very center 40°47′11″n 119°12′2340″w﻿ ﻿4078639°n 1192065000°w﻿ 4078639 1192065000 in 2012 radial streets sometimes called avenues extend from the man to the outermost circle the outlines of these streets are visible on aerial photographs the innermost street is named the esplanade and the remaining streets are given names to coincide with the overall theme of the burn and ordered in ways such as alphabetical order or stem to stern to make them easier to recall for example in 1999 for the wheel of time theme and again in 2004 for the vault of heaven theme the streets were named after the planets of the solar system the radial streets are usually given a clock designation for example 600 or 615 in which the man is at the center of the clock face and 1200 is in the middle of the third of the arc lacking streets usually at a bearing of 60° true from the man these avenues have been identified in other ways notably in 2002 in accordance with the floating world theme as the degrees of a compass for example 175 degrees and in 2003 as part of the beyond belief theme as adjectives rational absurd that caused every intersection with a concentric street named after concepts of belief such as authority creed to form a phrase such as absurd authority or rational creed however these proved unpopular with participants due to difficulty in navigating the city without the familiar clock layout the black rock city airport is constructed adjacent to the city typically on its southern side see transportation section below124 center campedit center camp is located along the mid line of black rock city facing the man at the 600 position on the esplanade this area serves as a central meeting

the blm and llcs insistence on the practice of lnt the amount of residual trash at the site has increased over the years the number of items per plot in the city consistently increased over the 2006 to 2009 although the observed trend was not statistically significant regression analysis indicated that the predicted trend explained over 97 of the variance in the data138 while fire is a primary component of many art exhibits and events materials must be burned on a burn platform24 from 1990 through 1999 burning was allowed to take place directly on the surface of the playa but this left burn

man has attracted a number of billionaires and celebrities many of them from silicon valley and hollywood147 it has become a networking event for them148 with tesla motors ceo elon musk once stating that burning man is silicon valley147 these billionaires have paid for more luxurious camps to be set up in recent years derisively nicknamed plugnplay or turnkey camps they in general consist of lavish rvs and luxury restroom trailers that are driven into the city and connected together to form de facto gated areas these billionaires then fly in to the airport on private planes are driven to their camps served by hired help nicknamed sherpas and sleep in airconditioned beds147 one venture capitalist billionaire threw a 16500perhead party at his camp149 despite allowing the rich to participate in burning man per the radical inclusion principle many traditional burners have spoken out against their exclusive practices150 larry harvey wrote that they also conflict with the radical selfreliance and other principles151 but has also stated that permitting the wealthy to attend is still beneficial for burning man152 vandalism that occurred at the white ocean sound camp in 2016 was said to have been a revolution against these attendees describing them as being a parasite class or rich parasites150153154 meanwhile the regular admission price has increased over the years in

restrictionsedit play media video of the man sculpture burning in 2011 the terms of the burning man ticket require that participants wishing to use photo and videorecording equipment share a joint copyright of their images of black rock city with burning man and forbid them from using their images for commercial purposes this has been criticized by many including the electronic frontier foundation eff159160 a burning man spokeswoman replied that the policies are not new were written by a former head of the eff were used when suing to block pornographic videos and ultimately arose from participant concerns we’re proud that black rock city a private event held on public land is widely acknowledged as a bastion of creative freedom but that protection of participants freedoms does necessitate the acceptance of some general terms of engagement when it comes to cameras eff seems to think that anyone attending any event somehow has an absolute right to take photographs and then to do whatever they want with those images without any effective restriction or manner of enforcement while we believe that such rights do make sense for any of us taking pictures in purely public spaces this is not true in the private space of burning man – if it were it would mean that burning man couldn’t protect participant privacy or prevent commercialization of imagery161 the burning man organization has since worked with the eff and with creative commons and other parties and has revised and clarified the photography policies162 regional eventsedit see also list of regional burning
