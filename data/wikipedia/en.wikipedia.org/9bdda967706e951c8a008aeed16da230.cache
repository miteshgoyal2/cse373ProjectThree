area of detroit his uncle claude gave him the nickname smokey joe when he was a child3 he attended northern high school where he was above average academically and a keen athlete though his main interest was music and he formed a doowop group named the five chimes at one point he and diana ross lived several houses from each other on belmont he once said he has known ross since she was about eight4 robinson said his interest in music started after hearing the groups nolan strong the diablos and billy ward and his dominoes on the radio as a child robinson later listed barrett strong a detroit native as a strong vocal influence in 1955 he formed the first lineup of the five chimes with childhood friend ronald white and classmate pete moore two years later in 1957 they were renamed the matadors and included bobby rogers another member emerson rogers was replaced by bobbys cousin claudette rogers the groups guitarist marv tarplin joined them sometime in 1958 the matadors began touring detroit venues around this time they later changed their name to the miracles careeredit the miracles and motownedit main article the miracles in august 1957 robinson and the miracles met songwriter berry gordy after a failed audition for brunswick records at that time during the audition robinson had brought along with him a big 10 notebook with 100 songs he wrote while in high school gordy was impressed with robinsons vocals and even more impressed with robinsons ambitious songwriting with his help the miracles released their first single got a job an answer song to the silhouettes hit single get a job5 on end records it was the beginning of a long and successful collaboration during this time robinson attended college and started classes in january 1959 studying electrical engineering6 robinson dropped out after only two months following the miracles release of their first record6 gordy formed tamla records which was later reincorporated as motown the miracles became one of the first acts signed to the label in point of fact they had actually been with gordy since before the formation of motown records7 in late 1960 the group recorded their first hit single shop around which became motowns first millionselling hit record5 between 1960 and 1970 robinson would produce 26 top forty hits with the miracles as lead singer chief songwriter and producer including several top ten hits such as youve really got a hold on me5 mickeys monkey i second that emotion baby baby dont cry and the groups only numberone hit during their robinson years the tears of a clown other notable hits such as ooo baby baby going to a gogo the tracks of my tears come round here im the one you need the love i saw in you was just a mirage and more love peaked in the top twenty in 1965 the miracles were the first motown group to change their name when they released their 1965 album going to a gogo as smokey robinson the miracles between 1962 and 1966 robinson was also one of the major songwriters and producers for motown penning several hit singles such as two lovers5 the one who really loves you you beat me to the punch and my guy for mary wells the way you do the things you do my girl5 since i lost my baby and get ready for the temptations when im gone and operator for brenda holloway dont mess with bill the hunter gets captured by the game and my baby must be a magician for the marvelettes and ill be doggone and aint that peculiar for marvin gaye after the arrival of holland–dozier–holland and the team of norman whitfield and barrett strong he was eclipsed as a top writer and producer for the label and other motown artists such as gaye and stevie wonder began to compose more original material later in his career robinson wrote lyrics and music for the contours such as first i look at the purse as well as the four tops still water and the supremes floy joy by 1969 robinson wanted to retire from touring to focus on raising his two children with his wife claudette and on his duties as motowns vice president a job he had taken on by the mid1960s after esther gordy edwards had left the position however the success of the groups tears of a clown made robinson stay with the group until 1972 robinsons last performance with the group was in july 1972 in washington dc solo careeredit after a year of retirement robinson announced his comeback with the release of the eponymous smokey album in 1973 the album included the miracles tribute song sweet harmony and the hit ballad baby come close in 1974 robinsons second album pure smokey was released but failed to produce hits robinson struggled to compete with his former collaborators marvin gaye stevie wonder and former temptations member eddie kendricks as all three had multiple hit singles during this period former beatle george harrison featured the track pure smokey on his 1976 album thirty three 13 as a tribute to robinson harrisons fellow beatles john lennon and paul mccartney were also fans of robinsons songwriting and the group covered you really gotta hold on me on their second uk album with the beatles robinson answered his critics the following year with a quiet storm released in 1975 the album launched three singles – the numberone rb hit baby thats backatcha the agony the ecstasy and quiet storm however robinsons solo career suffered from his work as motowns vice president and his own music took the backseat as a result several albums including smokeys family robinson deep in my soul love breeze and smokin saw poor promotion and received bad reviews at this point robinson relied on other writers and producers to help him with his albums following these albums robinson got out of a writers block after his close collaborator marv tarplin who joined him on the road in 1973 after robinson left the miracles presented him a tune he had composed on his guitar robinson later wrote the lyrics that became his first solo top ten pop single cruisin the song hit number one in cash box and peaked at number four on the billboard hot 100 it also became his first solo number one in new zealand robinson would follow a similar approach with his next album warm thoughts which produced another top 40 hit let me be the clock though it didnt repeat the success of cruisin in 1981 robinson topped the charts again with another sensual ballad being with you which was another number one hit in cash box and peaked at number two on the billboard hot 100 it also hit number one in the united kingdom becoming his most successful single to date the goldplus parent album sparked a partnership with george tobin and with tobin robinson released his next several motown albums yes its you lady which produced the hits tell me tomorrow touch the sky and essar in 1983 robinson teamed up with fellow motown label mate rick james recording the rb ballad ebony eyes in 1987 following a period of personal and professional issues robinson made a comeback with the album one heartbeat and the singles just to see her and one heartbeat which were top 10 hits on billboards pop soul and adult contemporary charts they were aided by hugely popular music videos just to see her won robinson his first grammy award in 1988 the album became one of his most successful ever selling over 900000 copies in the united states alone in the same year robinson released one heartbeat the uk group abc released a tribute song when smokey sings and he was inducted as a solo artist to the rock and roll hall of fame later igniting controversy as the committee had inducted only robinson and not members of his group the miracles which robinson was personally offended by89 in 2012 however the committee rectified the mistake announcing that the group would be inducted on their own merit though robinson was not listed as an inductee he was due to induct his former group at the ceremony in april 2012 after motown was sold off to mca in 1988 robinson relinquished his position as vice president following the release of the album love smokey in 1990 robinson left motown for a deal with sbk records in 1991 however the album double good everything failed to chart robinson remained virtually quiet during the nineties though he would make a notable cameo appearance in the temptations 1998 miniseries making a brief comeback in 1999 when he resigned with motown and issued the album intimate which included the song easy to love in 2003 he once again split ties with motown releasing the gospel album food for the soul on liquid 8 records in
