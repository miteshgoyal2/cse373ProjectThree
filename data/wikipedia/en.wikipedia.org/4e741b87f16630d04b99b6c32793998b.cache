roman citizens could be either free libertas or servile servitus but they all had rights in law5 after the edict of milan in 313 these rights included the freedom of religion6 roman legal doctrine was lost during the middle ages but claims of universal rights could still be made based on religious doctrine according to the leaders of ketts rebellion 1549 all bond men may be made free for god made all free with his precious bloodshedding7 in the 17th century english common law judge sir edward coke revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that englishmen had historically enjoyed such rights the parliament of england adopted the english bill of rights in 1689 the virginia declaration of rights by george mason and james madison was adopted in 1776 the virginia declaration is the direct ancestor and model for the us bill of rights 1789 the removal by legislation of a civil right constitutes a civil disability in early 19th century britain the phrase civil rights most commonly referred to the issue of such legal discrimination against catholics in the house of commons support for civil rights was divided with many politicians agreeing with the existing civil disabilities of catholics the roman catholic relief act 1829 restored their civil rights in the 1860s americans adapted this usage to newly freed blacks congress enacted civil rights acts in 1866 1871 1875 1957 1960 1964 1968 and 1991 protection of rightsedit t h marshall notes that civil rights were among the first to be recognized and codified followed later by political rights and still later by social rights in many countries they are constitutional rights and are included in a bill of rights or similar document they are also defined in international human rights instruments such as the 1948 universal declaration of human rights and the 1967 international covenant on civil and political rights civil and political rights need not be codified to be protected although most democracies worldwide do have formal written guarantees of civil and political rights civil rights are considered to be natural rights thomas jefferson wrote in his a summary view of the rights of british america that a free people claim their rights as derived from the laws of nature and not as the gift of their chief magistrate the question of to whom civil and political rights apply is a subject of controversy in many countries citizens have greater protections against infringement of rights than noncitizens at the same time civil and political rights are generally considered to be universal rights that apply to all persons according to political scientist salvador santino f regilme jr analyzing the causes of and lack of protection from human rights abuses in the global south should be focusing on the interactions of domestic and international factors—an important perspective that has usually been systematically neglected in the social science literature8 other rightsedit custom also plays a role implied or unenumerated rights are rights that courts may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom one example is the right to privacy in the united states and the ninth amendment explicitly shows that there are other rights that are also protected the united states declaration of independence states that people have unalienable rights including life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is considered by some that the sole purpose of government is the protection of life liberty and property9 ideas of selfownership and cognitive liberty affirm rights to choose the food one eats101112 the medicine one takes131415 the habit one indulges161718 social movements for civil rightsedit main article movements for civil rights savka dabčevićkučar croatian spring participant europes first female prime minister civil rights guarantee equal protection under the law when civil and political rights are not guaranteed to all as part of equal protection of laws or when such guarantees exist on paper but are not respected in practice opposition legal action and even social unrest may ensue some historians suggest that new orleans was the cradle of the civil rights movement in the united states due to the earliest efforts of creoles to integrate the military en masse19 wcc claiborne appointed by thomas jefferson to be governor of the territory of orleans formally accepted delivery of the french colony on december 20 1803 free men of color had been members of the militia for decades under both spanish and french control of the colony of louisiana they volunteered their services and pledged their loyalty to claiborne and to their newly adopted country20 but in early 1804 the new us administration in new orleans under governor claiborne was faced with a dilemma previously unknown in the united states ie the integration of the military by incorporating entire units of previously established colored militia21 see eg the february 20 1804 letter to claiborne from secretary of war henry dearborn that it would be prudent not to increase the corps but to diminish if it could be done without giving offense22 civil rights movements in the united states gathered steam by 1848 with such documents as the declaration of sentiment23full citation needed consciously modeled after the declaration of independence the declaration of rights and sentiments became the founding document of the american womens movement and it was adopted at the seneca falls convention july 19 and 20 184824full citation needed worldwide several political movements for equality before the law occurred between approximately 1950 and 1980 these movements had a legal and constitutional aspect and resulted in much lawmaking at both national and international levels they also had an activist side particularly in situations where violations of rights were widespread movements with the proclaimed aim of securing observance of civil and political rights included the civil rights movement in the united states where rights of black citizens had been violated the northern ireland civil rights association formed in 1967 following failures in this province of the united kingdom to respect the roman catholic minoritys rights and movements in many communist countries such as the prague spring and charter 77 in czechoslovakia and the uprisings in hungary most civil rights movements relied on the technique of civil resistance using nonviolent methods to achieve their aims25 in some countries struggles for civil rights were accompanied or followed by civil unrest and even armed rebellion while civil rights movements over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of civil and political rights the process was long and tenuous in many countries and many of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives currently there is a nonviolent civil rights movement going on it is called taking a knee and was started by nfl athlete colin kaepernick people of every race and nationality are participating it in it26 problems and analysisedit questions about civil and political rights have frequently emerged for example to what extent should the government intervene to protect individuals from infringement on their rights by other individuals or from corporations—eg in what way should employment discrimination in the private sector be dealt with political theory deals with civil and political rights robert nozick and john rawls expressed competing visions in nozicks anarchy state and utopia and rawls a theory of justice other influential authors in the area include wesley newcomb hohfeld and jean edward smith firstgeneration rightsedit firstgeneration rights often called blue rights deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life they are fundamentally civil and political in nature as well as strongly individualistic they serve negatively to protect the individual from excesses of the state firstgeneration rights include among other things freedom of speech the right to a fair trial in some countries the right to keep and bear arms freedom of religion and voting rights they were pioneered in the united states by the bill of rights and in france by the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen in the 18th century although some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the magna carta of 1215 and the rights of englishmen which were expressed in the english bill of rights in 1689 they were enshrined at the global level and given status in international law first by articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 universal declaration of human rights and later in the 1966 international covenant on civil and political rights in europe they were enshrined in the european convention on human rights in 1953 see alsoedit human rights portal discrimination portal politics portal social movements portal bill of rights calculating visions
