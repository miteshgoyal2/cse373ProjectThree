sensibilities than western cinema125 jigna desai holds that by the 21st century indian cinema had managed to become deterritorialized spreading over to the many parts of the world where indian diaspora was present in significant numbers and becoming an alternative to other international cinema159 indian cinema has more recently begun influencing western musical films and played a particularly instrumental role in the revival of the genre in the western world baz luhrmann stated that his successful musical film moulin rouge 2001 was directly inspired by bollywood musicals160 the critical and financial success of moulin rouge renewed interest in the thenmoribund western musical genre subsequently fuelling a renaissance of the genre161 danny boyles oscarwinning film slumdog millionaire 2008 was also directly inspired by indian films108162 and is considered to be a homage to hindi commercial cinema163 other indian filmmakers are also making attempts at reaching a more global audience with upcoming films by directors such as vidhu vinod chopra jahnu barua sudhir mishra and pan nalin164 indian cinema was also recognised at the american academy awards indian films mother india 1957 salaam bombay 1988 and lagaan 2001 were nominated for the academy award for best foreign language film indian winners of the academy awards include bhanu athaiya costume designer satyajit ray filmmaker a r rahman music composer resul pookutty sound editor and gulzar lyricist cottalango leon and rahul thakkar scitech award165 netflix have also entered india166 influencesedit victoria public hall is a historical building in chennai named after victoria empress of india it served as a theatre in the late 19th century and the early 20th century prasads imax theatre located at hyderabad is the worlds largest 3dimax screen and also the most attended screen in the world167168169 ramoji film city located in hyderabad holds guinness world record as the worlds largest film studio170 pvr cinemas is one of the largest cinema chains in india there have generally been six major influences that have shaped the conventions of indian popular cinema the first was the ancient indian epics of mahabharata and ramayana which have exerted a profound influence on the thought and imagination of indian popular cinema particularly in its narratives examples of this influence include the techniques of a side story backstory and story within a story indian popular films often have plots which branch off into subplots such narrative dispersals can clearly be seen in the 1993 films khalnayak and gardish the second influence was the impact of ancient sanskrit drama with its highly stylised nature and emphasis on spectacle where music dance and gesture combined to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience sanskrit dramas were known as natya derived from the root word nrit dance characterising them as spectacular dancedramas which has continued in indian cinema171 the rasa method of performance dating back to ancient sanskrit drama is one of the fundamental features that differentiate indian cinema from that of the western world in the rasa method empathetic emotions are conveyed by the performer and thus felt by the audience in contrast to the western stanislavski method where the actor must become a living breathing embodiment of a character rather than simply conveying emotion the rasa method of performance is clearly apparent in the performances of popular hindi film actors like amitabh bachchan shah rukh khan it is also evident in the nationally acclaimed hindi films like rang de basanti 2006 starring aamir khan in lead role172 and internationally acclaimed bengali films directed by satyajit ray173 the third influence was the traditional folk theatre of india which became popular from around the 10th century with the decline of sanskrit theatre these regional traditions include the yatra of west bengal the ramlila of uttar pradesh yakshagana of karnataka chindu natakam of andhra pradesh and the terukkuttu of tamil nadu the fourth influence was parsi theatre which blended realism and fantasy music and dance narrative and spectacle earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation integrating them into a dramatic discourse of melodrama the parsi plays contained crude humour melodious songs and music sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft171 all of these influences are clearly evident in the masala film genre that was popularised by manmohan desais films in the 1970s and early 1980s particularly in coolie 1983 and to an extent in more recent critically acclaimed films such as rang de basanti172 the fifth influence was hollywood where musicals were popular from the 1920s to the 1950s though indian filmmakers departed from their hollywood counterparts in several ways for example the hollywood musicals had as their plot the world of entertainment itself indian filmmakers while enhancing the elements of fantasy so pervasive in indian popular films used song and music as a natural mode of articulation in a given situation in their films there is a strong indian tradition of narrating mythology history fairy stories and so on through song and dance in addition whereas hollywood filmmakers strove to conceal the constructed nature of their work so that the realistic narrative was wholly dominant indian filmmakers made no attempt to conceal the fact that what was shown on the screen was a creation an illusion a fiction however they demonstrated how this creation intersected with peoples daytoday lives in complex and interesting ways174 the final influence was western musical television particularly mtv which has had an increasing influence since the 1990s as can be seen in the pace camera angles dance sequences and music of recent indian films an early example of this approach was in mani ratnams bombay 1995175 like mainstream indian popular cinema indian parallel cinema was also influenced also by a combination of indian theatre particularly sanskrit drama and indian literature particularly bengali literature but differs when it comes to foreign influences where it is more influenced by european cinema particularly italian neorealism and french poetic realism rather than hollywood satyajit ray cited italian filmmaker vittorio de sicas bicycle thieves 1948 and french filmmaker jean renoirs the river 1951 which he assisted as influences on his debut film pather panchali 1955 besides the influence of european cinema and bengali literature ray is also indebted to the indian theatrical tradition particularly the rasa method of classical sanskrit drama the complicated doctrine of rasa centers predominantly on feeling experienced not only by the characters but also conveyed in a certain artistic way to the spectator the duality of this kind of a rasa imbrication shows in the apu trilogy173 bimal roys two acres of land 1953 was also influenced by de sicas bicycle thieves and in turn paved the way for the indian new wave which began around the same time as the french new wave and the japanese new wave77 ray known as one of the most important influences to parallel cinema was depicted as an auteur wollen the focus of the majority of his stories portrayed the lower middle class and the unemployed wollen it wasnt until the late 1960s that parallel cinema support grew wollen176 multilingualsedit some indian films are known as multilinguals having been filmed in similar but nonidentical versions in different languages this was done in the 1930s according to rajadhyaksha and willemen in the encyclopaedia of indian cinema 1994 in its most precise form a multilingual is a bilingual or a trilingual that was the kind of film made in the 1930s in the studio era when different but identical takes were made of every shot in different languages often with different leading stars but identical technical crew and music17715 rajadhyaksha and willemen note that in seeking to construct their encyclopedia they often found it extremely difficult to distinguish multilinguals in this original sense from dubbed versions remakes reissues or in some cases the same film listed with different titles presented as separate versions in different languages  it will take years of scholarly work to establish definitive data in this respect17715 regional industriesedit films are made in many cities and regions in india including andhra pradesh and telangana assam bengal bihar gujarat haryana
