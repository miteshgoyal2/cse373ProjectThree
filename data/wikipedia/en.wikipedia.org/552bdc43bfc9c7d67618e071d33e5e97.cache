enrolled at harvard allen pursued a degree in computer science at washington state university though he later dropped out of school to work at honeywell20 the january 1975 issue of popular electronics featured micro instrumentation and telemetry systemss mits altair 8800 microcomputer21 which inspired allen to suggest that they could program a basic interpreter for the device after a call from gates claiming to have a working interpreter mits requested a demonstration since they didnt yet have one allen worked on a simulator for the altair while gates developed the interpreter although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device it worked flawlessly when they in march 1975 demonstrated the interpreter to mits in albuquerque new mexico mits agreed to distribute it marketing it as altair basic18108 112–114 gates and allen officially established microsoft on april 4 1975 with gates as the ceo22 the original name of microsoft was suggested by allen2324 in

digital research failed ibm awarded a contract to microsoft in november 1980 to provide a version of the cpm os which was set to be used in the upcoming ibm personal computer ibm pc27 for this deal microsoft purchased a cpm clone called 86dos from seattle computer products which it branded as msdos though ibm rebranded it to pc dos following the release of the ibm pc in august 1981 microsoft retained ownership of msdos since ibm had copyrighted the ibm pc bios other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for nonibm hardware to run as ibm pc compatibles but no such restriction applied to the operating systems due to various factors such as msdoss available software selection microsoft eventually became the leading pc operating systems vendor2829210 the company expanded into new markets with the release of the microsoft mouse in 1983 as well as with a publishing division named microsoft press18232 paul allen resigned from microsoft in 1983 after developing hodgkins

many oems to execute anticompetitive per processor licenses under a per processor license an oem pays microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor whether the oem sells the computer with a microsoft operating system or a nonmicrosoft operating system in effect the royalty payment to microsoft when no microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty or tax

their company ie lower tco124 this spurred a wave of related studies a study by the yankee group concluded that upgrading from one version of windows server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from windows server to linux although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of linux servers and concern about being locked into using microsoft products125
