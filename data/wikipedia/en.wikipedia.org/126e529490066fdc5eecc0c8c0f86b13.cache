congress of the kansasnebraska bill in january 1854 many meetings were held in protest across the country the meeting held in ripon wisconsin on march 20 1854 is commonly cited as the birth of the republican party in the united states due to it being the first publicized antislavery meeting to propose a new party with its name being republican origins of the republican party in wisconsinedit before the meeting in ripon an alliance existed between state whigs whose national party had weakened and members of the free soil party with whom they formed a peoples ticket as early as 1842 the coalition succeeded in electing the chief justice of the state supreme court a milwaukee mayor and aldermen3 many wisconsin barnburner democrats were also opposed to the kansasnebraska bill which not only would leave the question of slavery in the territories up to popular sovereignty but as originally amended would also deny immigrants the right to vote or hold public office4 the bill was roundly condemned in the wisconsin press as editors such as horace rublee wisconsin state journal rufus king milwaukee sentinel and sherman booth waukesha free democrat encouraged the formation of a new party by calling for an antinebraska convention at the state capitol in madison at a large meeting in milwaukee on february 13 booth led a committee that drafted many of the resolutions that would later be the basis for other antinebraska meetings in the state including the famous meeting in ripon5 birth of the republican partyedit the organizer of the meeting that gave birth to americas republican party was new york state native alvan earle bovay a lawyer and mathematics teacher at ripon college in 1852 bovay traveled to new york city during the national whig party convention and met with old friend and new york tribune editor horace greeley bovay suggested the name republican for a new antislavery party that would replace the fading whigs he favored it because it was a simple word rather than a compound name like free soil or free democrat that it could be used as either a noun or an adjective that it would remind people of thomas jeffersons affiliation and that it symbolized what he believed the new party should represent res publica synonymous with commonwealth bovay also believed that the name would attract immigrant voters that had recently fled monarchies on february 26 1854 bovay sent a letter to greeley urging him to editorialize about a new republican party without result in the meantime he organized a public meeting at the congregational church in ripon on march 1 where resolutions were passed condemning the nebraska bill and promising a new party if it became law the senate passed the bill two days later which prompted bovay to organize another meeting in ripon at schoolhouse dist no 2 on march 20 1854 at 630 pm composed of whigs democrats and free soilers 54 of ripons 100 voters filled the schoolhouse to capacity and were nearly unanimous in their support of a new party with bovays suggested name republican bovay wrote greeley on june 4 urging him to publicize the name before michigan and wisconsin held their state antinebraska conventions which greeley did in a tribune editorial on june 246 organizing the republican party of wisconsinedit on june 9 sherman booth repeated the call for a mass convention in madison and suggested july 13 the anniversary of the northwest ordinance of 1787 that had banned slavery in the northwest territory other wisconsin editors concurred and publicized the convention7 beginning in the capitols assembly chamber the state convention was moved outdoors due to the many delegates and supporters arriving with the crowd topping one thousand the proceedings were run by experienced whigs and free soilers with editors booth and king controlling the platform and nominating officers from all three major parties8 resolutions included abrogating the fugitive slave act reinstating kansas and nebraska as free states and banning all future slave states they also resolved to invite all persons whether of native or foreign birth to join the party and a committee was assigned to establish a republican german newspaper in milwaukee all resolutions were passed unanimously and nine hearty cheers went up for the states new republican party9 after winning over much of the foreignlanguage press the new party was very successful in the fall elections helped greatly by the fact that the state democrats were deeply split over the kansasnebraska act the republicans elected two of wisconsins three congressmen cadwallader c washburn and charles billinghurst as well as winning enough seats in the state legislature to elect the countrys first republican senator charles durkee10 by 1857 they not only controlled the governorship and the state legislature by large majorities but also held all three congressional seats and both us senate seats despite such electoral domination the republican party was split over many issues many former whigs pressed for temperance legislation resulting in charges of nativism from many of the germans brought into the party by carl schurz united by national events like the dred scot decision abolitionists still drove the party agenda but were criticized for showing more concern for the black slave than for the white man following sherman booths role in inciting the liberation of runaway slave joshua glover from a milwaukee jail in 1854 many republicans championed the issue of states rights declaring the fugitive slave law effectively repealed in wisconsin some in the party anticipated a confrontation with the federal government governor alexander randall ordered an irish militia disbanded because he doubted their loyalty to wisconsin many in the militia subsequently perished in the shipwreck of the lady elgin the civil war eraedit the wisconsin delegation to the 1860 republican convention backed senator william seward for president but quickly supported abraham lincoln once his nomination appeared inevitable following the outbreak of the civil war governors like randall and edward salomon vigorously endorsed the war and mustered thousands of troops to meet the federal quotas later resorting to a draft politically the civil war was a boon to the republicans returning officers like brigadier general lucius fairchild who had lost an arm at gettysburg were the perfect spokesmen for the party fairchild later became a threeterm governor republicans could forever claim they fought to preserve the union and veterans of the grand army of the republic became a powerful constituency the state republican chairman from 18591869 was wisconsin state journal editor horace rublee who with former governor randall madison postmaster elisha w keyes and others became known as the madison regency randall later became president andrew johnsons postmaster general and with keyes they steered federal patronage jobs to political allies and strengthened the partys hold on the statehouse despite such power the state republicans were divided into factions with the more ideological members opposed to johnsons vetoes of freedman legislation and president ulysses s grants corrupt administration many later joining carl schurzs liberal republican party in 1872 another faction of patronageseekers and loyal veterans supported grant as a bulwark against what they saw as a traitorous democratic party nevertheless the republicans would continue to dominate wisconsin government for the next six decades with few interruptions the 1870s and 1880sedit rublee ran a quiet campaign in the legislature for possible election as us senator but after losing to matthew h carpenter rublee was appointed by grant minister to switzerland in 1869 the party machinery was left in the hands of boss keyes yet the industrial age hailed a shift of republican power away from madison to wealthy men like philetus sawyer of oshkosh whose lumber fortune would help fund the party and advance him from mayor to state legislator to congressman to us senator milwaukees henry c payne rose from dry goods dealer to the young mens republican club where he engineered a voter registration drive among the citys immigrants to vote the republican ticket in 1876 payne was appointed milwaukees postmaster a powerful source of patronage jobs he later became wealthy as a manager of banks utilities and railroads john c spooner of hudson was the principal attorney for the west wisconsin railroad and his manipulation of land grants into sawyers hands contributed to his future as party insider and later us senator alongside sawyer upon his return from europe rublee resumed the chairmanship of the party with help from backers he purchased the milwaukee sentinel in 1882 and was its editor until his death in 1896 the republicans briefly lost control of state government following the panic of 1873 when a reform coalition of democrats grangers and liberal republicans elected democrat william taylor as governor immigrant backlash against republicansupported temperance legislation was also a major factor in 1874 republicans backed the weak railroad regulation of the potter law but replaced the law with the even weaker vance law once they returned to power the next year civil war veteran jeremiah rusk of viroqua proved a popular republican governor during his three terms 18821889 a farmer rusk supported measures that improved the states agriculture such as universityrun experimental farms he was later appointed the countrys first secretary of agriculture by president benjamin harrison in 1886 he issued the shoot to kill order to the national guard in response to widespread may day strikes in milwaukee resulting in the bay view tragedy that left seven people dead despite the loss of life rusks decision was applauded in state newspapers as well as nationally rusks administration was followed by that of another republican farmer william hoard 18891891 who published a widely read journal on dairy farming in 1890 the republicans were swept from state offices again when the party ran afoul of ethnic politics by supporting the bennett law a compulsory school attendance measure that stipulated that all classes must be taught in english immigrant groups and supporters of parochial schools condemned the law while governor hoard and the milwaukee sentinel continued to defend it democrats won in a landslide but the gop returned to power two years later the progressive eraedit during the 1890s the state republican party was split into two factions the stalwart faction in power was led by wealthy men such as sawyer payne spooner and charles f pfister who would purchase the milwaukee sentinel in 1900 the other faction the halfbreeds was composed of reformminded republicans such as dunn countys albert r hall and soldiers groves james o davidson who saw the powerful railroad and utility monopolies such as the milwaukee electric railway and light company tmerl cheating their customers and corrupting their politicians following three terms as a standpat republican congressman from madison robert m la follette emerged as the leader of an insurgent movement to wrest control of the party from the stalwart machine la follette had backed other antimachine republicans for governor before first running for the office in 1896 he campaigned on a platform of election reform and corporate accountability while accusing the stalwarts of bribery after being elected governor on his third attempt in 1900 he spent his three terms fighting for primary elections and taxation of corporations based on the value of property in 1904 the stalwarts fought bitterly against his second reelection with the use of bribed editors and a rump convention but la follette prevailed and saw his reforms passed the state legislature elected him us senator in 1905 succeeding la follette as governor was james o davidson who supported and signed into law reforms such as state regulation of industries insurance companies and other businesses governor francis e mcgovern followed with an even more progressive program that resulted in a state income tax workers compensation child labor laws and encouragement of cooperatives regardless of davidson and mcgoverns successes la follette ran his own loyal candidates against them splitting the states progressive republicans and resulting in the 1912 election of the stalwarts candidate emanuel philipp as governor despite campaigning on promises to dismantle progressive programs philipp proved to be a moderate leaving nearly all of the reforms intact world war iedit as world war i raged in europe most wisconsin republicans moved cautiously from neutrality to preparedness one exception was sen la follette an outspoken opponent of american participation in the war in february 1917 he led a group of progressive senators in blocking president woodrow wilsons bill to arm merchant ships la follettes actions made him nationally notorious after being misquoted in a speech as having no grievances against germany he was abandoned by many of his longtime associates and later threatened with expulsion from the senate gov philipp also opposed arming merchant ships and conscription but after war was declared he administered the states war effort marshaled state resources and formed councils to conduct the draft sell liberty bonds generate propaganda and stifle dissent the war shattered the traditional alignments within the states parties many progressives joined the stalwarts in supporting wisconsins war measures while many immigrant voters abandoned wilsons democratic party loyalty became a prime issue in political campaigns to the detriment of farmers and others shortchanged by the war even after the armistice superpatriots like state senator roy p wilcox of eau claire werent above accusing party figures like gov philipp and sen irvine lenroot of divided loyalties to thwart wilcoxs run for governor in 1920 the philipp and la follette forces separately supported john blaine the former mayor of boscobel and a la follette progressive the 1920sedit during the 1920s state republicans racked up a decade of tremendous legislative majorities for example in 1925 the democrats held no seats in the state senate and only one in the assembly while the republicans held 92 assembly seats11 but with the end of the war factions within the party began to reassert themselves and a second wave of progressives returned to power la follette was decisively reelected senator in 1922 and two years later he ran for president on a progressive party ticket against president calvin coolidge he received every sixth vote cast nationally but only carried wisconsin he died in 1925 but the la follette name and his brand of republicanism were carried on by his two sons robert la follette jr defeated wilcox in the special election to fill his fathers senate seat while his younger brother philip f la follette was elected dane county district attorney to fight the progressives conservative republicans organized the republican voluntary committee as a political action group to strategize and raise large donations outside the state party the rvc cited a wisconsin manufacturers associationfinanced study that concluded that businesses were leaving the state due to high taxes but the report was refuted by economists that proved manufacturing had grown in the state the study backfired and gov blaine succeeded in shifting the tax burden from property to income12 with help from the republican voluntary committee the stalwarts returned to the governorship with the 1928 election of walter j kohler a manufacturer of plumbing fixtures who practiced an industrial policy of benevolence towards his workers as a guard against unions like president herbert hoover kohler was stimied by the stock market crash of 1929 and his attempts to mitigate the effects of the depression were ineffective running for reelection in 1930 kohler was beaten decisively in the republican primary by phil la follette who led a successful slate of progressive allies to state office and congress in the general election party platformedit the current stance of the wisconsin republican party is in line with that of the national republican party
