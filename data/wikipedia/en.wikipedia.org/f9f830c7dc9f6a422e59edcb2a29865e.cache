digital physics from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in physics and cosmology digital physics also referred to as digital ontology or digital philosophy is a collection of theoretical perspectives based on the premise that the universe is describable by information according to this theory the universe can be conceived of as either the output of a deterministic or probabilistic computer program a vast digital computation device or mathematically isomorphic to such a device1 contents 1 history 11 overview 12 weizsäckers uralternatives 13 pancomputationalism or

the principles of information theory statistical thermodynamics and quantum mechanics in 1957 a link among these fields was proposed by edwin jaynes2 he elaborated an interpretation of probability theory as generalized aristotelian logic a view linking fundamental physics with digital computers because these are designed to implement the operations of classical logic and equivalently of boolean algebra3 the hypothesis that the universe is a digital computer was proposed by konrad zuse in his book rechnender raum translated into english as calculating space the term digital physics wascitation needed employed by edward fredkin who later came to prefer the term digital philosophy4 others who have modeled the universe as a giant computer include stephen wolfram5 juergen schmidhuber1 and nobel laureate gerard t hooft6not in citation given these authors hold that the probabilistic nature of quantum physics is not necessarily incompatible with the notion of computability quantum versions of digital physics have recently been proposed by seth lloyd7 and paola zizzi8 related ideas include carl friedrich von weizsäckers binary theory of uralternatives pancomputationalism computational universe theory john archibald wheelers it from bit and max tegmarks ultimate ensemble overviewedit digital physics suggests that there exists at least in principle a program for a universal computer that computes the evolution of the universe the computer could be for example a huge cellular automaton zuse 196719 or a universal turing machine as suggested by schmidhuber 19971 who pointed out that there exists a short program that can compute all possible computable universes in an asymptotically optimal way loop quantum gravity could lend support to digital physics in that it assumes spacetime is quantized1 paola zizzi has formulated a realization of this concept in what has come to be called computational loop quantum gravity or clqg1011 other theories that combine aspects of digital physics with loop quantum gravity are those of marzuoli and rasetti1213 and girelli and livine14 weizsäckers uralternativesedit physicist carl friedrich von weizsäckers theory of uralternatives theory of archetypal objects first publicized in his book the unity of nature 19711516 further developed through the 1990s171819 is a kind of digital physics as it axiomatically constructs quantum physics from the distinction between empirically observable binary alternatives weizsäcker used his theory to derive the 3dimensionality of space and to estimate the entropy of a proton in 1988 görnitz has shown that weizsäckers assumption can be connected with the bekensteinhawking entropy20 pancomputationalism or the computational universe theoryedit pancomputationalism also known as pancomputationalism naturalist computationalism is a view that the universe is a computational machine or rather a network of computational processes which following fundamental physical laws computes dynamically develops its own next state from the current one21 a computational universe is proposed by jürgen schmidhuber in a paper based on konrad zuses assumption 1967 that the history of the universe is computable he pointed out that a simple explanation of the universe would be a turing machine programmed to execute all possible programs computing all possible histories for all types of computable physical laws he also pointed out that there is an optimally efficient way of computing all computable universes based on leonid levins universal search algorithm 1973 in 2000 he expanded this work by combining ray solomonoffs theory of inductive inference with the assumption that quickly computable universes are more likely than others this work on digital physics also led to limitcomputable generalizations of algorithmic information or kolmogorov complexity and the concept of super omegas which are limitcomputable numbers that are even more random in a certain sense than gregory chaitins number of wisdom omega wheelers it from bitedit following jaynes and weizsäcker the physicist john archibald wheeler proposed an it from bit doctrine information sits at the core of physics and every it whether a particle or field derives its existence from observations222324 the toughest nut to crack in wheelers research program of a digital dissolution of physical being in a unified physics wheeler says is time in a 1986 eulogy to the mathematician hermann weyl wheeler proclaimed time among all concepts in the world of physics puts up the greatest resistance to being dethroned from ideal continuum to the world of the discrete of information of bits of all obstacles to a thoroughly penetrating account of existence none looms up more dismayingly than time explain time not without explaining existence explain existence not without explaining time to uncover the deep and hidden connection between time and existence is a task for the future252627 the idea that information could be the fundamental quantity at the core of physics was presented earlier by frederick w kantor a physicist from columbia university kantors book information mechanics wileyinterscience 1977 developed the idea in detail but without mathematical rigor kantors theory builds from just 3 axioms in less than 10 words information is conserved information is transmittable information is discretely accessible digital vs informational physicsedit not every informational approach to physics or ontology is necessarily digital according to luciano floridi28 informational structural realism is a variant of structural realism that supports an ontological commitment to a world consisting of the totality of informational objects dynamically interacting with each other such informational objects are to be understood as constraining affordances pancomputationalists like lloyd 2006 who models the universe as a quantum computer can still maintain an analogue or hybrid ontology and informational ontologists like kenneth sayre and floridi embrace neither a digital ontology nor a pancomputationalist position29 computational foundationsedit turing machinesedit main article turing machine the church–turing deutsch thesisedit the classic church–turing thesis claims that any computer as powerful as a turing machine can in principle calculate anything that a human can calculate given enough time turing moreover showed that there exist universal turing machines which can compute anything any other turing machine can compute—that they are generalizable turing machines but the limits of practical computation are set by physics not by theoretical computer science turing did not show that his machines can solve any problem that can be solved by instructions explicitly stated rules or procedures nor did he prove that the universal turing machine can compute any function that any computer with any architecture can compute he proved that his universal machine can compute any function that any turing machine can compute and he put forward and advanced philosophical arguments in support of the thesis here called turings thesis but a thesis concerning the extent of effective methods—which is to say concerning the extent of procedures of a certain sort that a human being unaided by machinery is capable of carrying out—carries no implication concerning the extent of the procedures that machines are capable of carrying out even machines acting in accordance with explicitly stated rules for among a machines repertoire of atomic operations there may be those that no human being unaided by machinery can perform30 on the other hand a modification of turings assumptions does bring practical computation within turings limits as david deutsch puts it i can now state the physical version of the church–turing principle every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means this formulation is both better defined and more physical than turings own way of expressing it31 emphasis added this compound conjecture is sometimes called the strong church–turing thesis or the church–turing–deutsch principle it is stronger because a human or turing machine computing with pencil and paper under turings conditions is a finitely realizable physical system experimental confirmationedit so far there is no experimental confirmation of either binary or quantized nature of the universe which are basic for digital physics the few attempts made in this direction would include the experiment with holometer designed by craig hogan which among others would detect a bit structure of spacetime32 the experiment started collecting data in august 2014 and is still going on criticismedit physical symmetries are continuousedit one objection is that extant models of digital physics are incompatiblecitation needed with the existence of several continuous characters of physical symmetries eg rotational symmetry translational symmetry lorentz symmetry and the lie group gauge invariance of yangmills theories all central to current physical theory proponents of digital physics claim that such continuous symmetries are only convenient and very good approximations of a discrete reality for example the reasoning leading to systems of natural units and the conclusion that the planck length is a minimum meaningful unit of distance suggests that at some level space itself is quantized33 moreover computers can manipulate and solve formulas describing real numbers using symbolic computation thus avoiding the need to approximate real numbers by using an infinite number of digits a number—in particular a real number one with an infinite number of digits—was defined by turing to be computable if a turing machine will continue to spit out digits endlessly in other words there is no last digit but this sits uncomfortably with any proposal that the universe is the output of a virtualreality exercise carried out in real time or any plausible kind of time known physical laws including quantum mechanics and its continuous spectra are very much infused with real numbers and the mathematics of the continuum so ordinary computational descriptions do not have a cardinality of states and state space trajectories that is sufficient for them to map onto ordinary mathematical descriptions of natural systems thus from the point of view of strict mathematical description the thesis that everything is a computing system in this second sense cannot be supported34 for his part david deutsch generally takes a multiverse view to the question of continuous vs discrete in short he thinks that “within each universe all observable quantities are discrete but the multiverse as a whole is a continuum when the equations of quantum theory describe a continuous but notdirectlyobservable transition between two values of a discrete quantity what they are telling us is that the transition does not take place entirely within one universe so perhaps the price of continuous motion is not an infinity of consecutive actions but an infinity of concurrent actions taking place across the multiverse” january 2001 the discrete and the continuous an abridged version of which appeared in the times higher education supplement localityedit some argue that extant models of digital physics violate various postulates of quantum physics35 for example if these models are not grounded in hilbert spaces and probabilities they belong to the class of theories with local hidden variables that have so far been ruled out experimentally using bells theorem this criticism has two possible answers first any notion of locality in the digital model does not necessarily have to correspond to locality formulated in the usual way in the emergent spacetime a concrete example of this case was given by lee smolin36specify another possibility is a wellknown loophole in bells theorem known as superdeterminism sometimes referred to as predeterminism37 in a completely deterministic model the experimenters decision to measure certain components of the spins is predetermined thus the assumption that the experimenter could have decided to measure different components of the spins than he actually did is strictly speaking not true see alsoedit a new kind of science arthur eddington bekenstein bound bitstring physics cellular automata church–turing thesis church–turing–deutsch principle clive w
