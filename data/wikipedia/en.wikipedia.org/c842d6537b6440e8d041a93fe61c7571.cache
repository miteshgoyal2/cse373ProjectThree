preceding federal power commission jurisdiction us government headquarters washington dc us agency executive kevin j mcintyre chairman parent agency us department of energy website wwwfercgov the federal energy regulatory commission ferc is the united states federal agency that regulates the transmission and wholesale sale of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce and regulates the transportation of oil by pipeline in interstate commerce ferc also reviews proposals to build interstate natural gas pipelines natural gas storage projects and liquefied natural gas lng terminals in addition to licensing nonfederal hydropower projects ferc is composed of five commissioners who are nominated by the us president and confirmed by the us senate there may be no more than three commissioners of one political party serving on the commission at any given time1 contents 1 history 11 federal power commission 12 natural gas act of 1938 13 birth of doe fpc becomes ferc 14 energy

federal power commissionedit the federal power commission fpc which preceded ferc was established by congress in 1920 to allow cabinet members to coordinate federal hydropower development in 1935 the fpc was transformed into an independent regulatory agency with five members nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate the fpc was authorized to regulate both hydropower and interstate electricity natural gas act of 1938edit in 1938 the natural gas act gave fpc jurisdiction over interstate natural gas pipelines and wholesale sales in 1942 this jurisdiction was expanded to cover the licensing of more natural gas facilities in 1954 the supreme court decision in phillips petroleum co v wisconsin extended fpc jurisdiction over all wellhead sales of natural gas in interstate commerce birth of doe fpc becomes fercedit in response to the 1973 oil crisis congress passed the department of energy organization act in 1977 to consolidate various energyrelated agencies into a department of energy congress insisted that a separate independent regulatory body be retained and the fpc was renamed the federal energy regulatory commission ferc preserving its independent status within the department2 ferc was also given added responsibility to hear appeals of doe oil price control determinations and to conduct all on the record hearings for doe3 as a result doe does not have any administrative law judges as a further protection when the department of energy proposes a rule it must refer the proposal to ferc and ferc can take over the proceeding if ferc determines that the rulemaking may significantly affect matters in its jurisdiction4 the doe act also transferred the regulation of interstate oil pipelines from the interstate commerce commission to ferc5 however the ferc lost some jurisdiction over the imports and exports of gas and electricity in 1978 ferc was given additional responsibilities for harmonizing the regulation of wellhead gas sales in both the intrastate and interstate markets ferc also administered a program to foster new cogeneration and small power production under the public utilities regulatory policy act of 1978 which was passed as part of the national energy act of 1978 the national energy act included the natural gas policy act which reduced the scope of federal price regulation to bring greater competition to both the natural gas and electric industry in 1989 congress ended federal regulation of wellhead natural gas prices with the passage of the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 19896 energy policy act of 2005edit the energy policy act of 2005 expanded fercs authority to protect the reliability and cybersecurity of the bulk power system through the establishment and enforcement of mandatory standards as well as greatly expanding ferc authority to impose civil penalties on entities that manipulate the electricity and natural gas markets the energy policy act of 2005 gave ferc additional responsibilities as outlined in fercs top priorities and updated strategic plan fercs primary dutiesedit the responsibilities of ferc include the following regulating the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce regulating the transmission of oil by pipelines in interstate commerce regulating the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce licensing and inspecting private municipal and state hydroelectric projects approving the siting of and abandonment of interstate natural gas facilities including pipelines storage and liquefied natural gas ensuring the reliability of high voltage interstate transmission system monitoring and investigating energy markets using civil penalties and other means against energy organizations and individuals who violate ferc rules in the energy markets overseeing environmental matters related to natural gas and hydroelectricity projects and major electricity policy initiatives and administering accounting and financial reporting regulations and regulating businesses of regulated companies jurisdiction and authoritiesedit ferc is an independent regulatory agency within the united states department of energy the president and congress do not generally review ferc decisions but the decisions are reviewable by the federal courts ferc is selffunding in that congress sets its budget through annual and supplemental appropriations and ferc is authorized to raise revenue to reimburse the united states treasury for its appropriations through annual charges to the natural gas oil and electric industries it regulates7 ferc is independent of the department of energy because ferc activities shall not be subject to further view by the secretary of energy or any officer or employee of the department8 the department of energy can however participate in ferc proceedings as a third party ferc is composed of up to five commissioners who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate the president appoints one of the commissioners to be the chairman of ferc the administrative head of the agency ferc is a bipartisan body no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party ferc has promoted voluntary formation of regional transmission organizations rtos and independent system operators isos to eliminate the potential for undue discrimination in access to the electric grid regional and interregional transmission planning and cost allocation through the landmark order no 1000 ferc investigated the alleged manipulation of electricity market by enron and other energy companies and their role in the california electricity crisis ferc has collected more than 63 billion from california electric market participants through settlements since passage of the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has imposed through settlements and orders more than 1 billion in civil penalties and disgorgement of unjust profits to address violations of its antimarket manipulation and other rules ferc regulates approximately 1600 hydroelectric projects in the us it is largely responsible for permitting construction of a large network of interstate natural gas pipelines ferc also works closely with the united states coast guard to review the safety security and environmental impacts of proposed lng terminals and associated shipping commissionersedit the commissioners are

30 2023 chairman criticismedit ferc has been subject to criticism and increasing acts of activism by people from communities affected by commission decisions approving pipeline and related projects9 they contend that ferc “blithely greenlights too many pipelines export terminals and other gas infrastructure”10 and that ferc’s structure in which it recovers its annual operating costs directly from the entities it regulates creates bias in favor of the issuance of pipeline certificates11 some of these critics have disrupted several regular open meetings of the commission12 and they staged two weeklong blockades of the commission’s headquarters in washington dc to make their points13 pipelines are facing unprecedented opposition commissioner lafleur remarked to the national press club in a 2015 speech we have a situation here”14 yet ferc’s decisions in these cases continue to be upheld by the courts in a july 1 2014 decision no gas pipeline v federal energy regulatory commission the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dc circuit said that pipeline applicants are not likely to pursue many certificates that are hopeless “the fact that they generally succeed in choosing to expend their resources on applications that serve their own financial interests does not mean that an agency which recognizes merit in such applications is biased” the court said15 others have directly disputed ferc’s critics by pointing out that “ferc is a creature of law it follows a careful administrative path to regulate only a portion of natural gas such as interstate pipelines and lng import and export terminals that regulation includes extensive environmental review driven by many federal laws enacted by congress signed by the president and reviewed and upheld by the us supreme court if the agency were to adopt the path suggested by these critics ferc’s decisions would routinely be overturned by the federal courts”16 the united states district court for the district of columbia also dismissed a case involving allegations of structural bias on the part of ferc the plaintiffs contended that the omnibus budget act of 1986 funding mechanism requires the commission to recover its budget through proportional charges on regulated entities therefore making ferc biased in favor of the industry from which it gets its funding but in an order issued march 22 2017 the court said the plain language of the statute indicates that ferc does not have control over its own budget “the commission’s budget cannot be increased by approving pipelines rather the statute requires the commission to make adjustments to ‘eliminate any overrecovery or underrecovery’ if plaintiffs are unhappy with congress’s chosen appropriations to the commission… plaintiffs’ recourse lies with their legislative representatives”17 however the dc circuit has ruled against commission procedures stating that in one case ferc failed to consider the cumulative environmental impact of four projects that had been separately proposed by the same pipeline the dc circuit held that the projects were not financially independent and were “a single pipeline” that was “linear and physically interdependent” so the cumulative environmental impacts should have been considered concurrently18 subsequently in a separate decision the dc circuit clarified that the “critical” factor was that all of the pipeline’s projects were either under construction or pending before ferc for environmental review at the same time19 this guidance has allowed ferc to address additional claims of improper segmentation20 fercs leaders have stressed many times since the onset of the increased activism that the proper way to oppose a proposed new infrastructure project is by participating in the related proceeding by submitting comments and participating in public comment sessions site visits and scoping meetings if someone does not like fercs decision on a matter andor believes the agency acted improperly the proper way to protest is to first seek rehearing by the commission and then if that fails to take the matter to court ferc decisions can be appealed up to the supreme court and should the individual or group still be dissatisfied they may petition congress to rectify the problem”21 see alsoedit custody transfer united states energy law highvoltage direct
