precursor to the modern liberal party of canada the globe began in toronto as a weekly party organ for browns reform party but seeing the economic gains that he could make in the newspaper business brown soon targeted a wide audience of liberal minded freeholders he selected as the motto for the editorial page a quotation from junius the subject who is truly loyal to the chief magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures the quotation is carried on the editorial page to this day by the 1850s the globe had become an independent and wellregarded daily newspaper it began
