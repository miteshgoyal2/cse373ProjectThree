default home page of internet explorer its web browser in 1998 microsoft renamed and moved this web portal to the domain name msncom where it has remained4 in addition to its original msn dialup

october 1996 with the logo used from 1995 to 1998 from 1995 to 1998 the msncom domain was used by microsoft primarily to promote msn as an online service and internet service provider at the time msncom also offered a custom start page and an internet tutorial but microsofts major web portal was known as microsoft internet start located at homemicrosoftcom internet start served as the default home page for internet explorer and offered basic information such as news weather sports stocks entertainment reports links to other websites on the internet articles by microsoft staff members and software updates for windows microsofts original news website msnbccom now nbcnewscom which launched in 1996 was also tied closely to the internet start portal msncomedit in 1999 the largely underutilized msncom domain name was combined with microsoft internet start and reinvented as both a web portal and as the brand for a family of sites produced inside microsofts interactive media group the new website put msn in direct competition with sites such as yahoo and go network because the new format opened up msns content to the world for free the internet service provider and subscription service was renamed msn internet access at that time that service eventually became known as msn dialup4 the relaunched msncom contained a whole family of sites including original content channels that were carried over from web shows that were part of microsofts msn 20 experiment with its internet service provider in 199697 and new features that were rapidly added msncom became the successor to the default internet explorer start page as all of the previous microsoft internet start website was merged with msncom4 some of the original websites that microsoft launched during that era remain active in some form today microsoft investor a business news and investments service that was once produced in conjunction with cnbc is now msn money789 carpoint an automobile comparison and shopping service is now msn autos and the internet gaming zone a website offering online casual games is now msn games other websites since divested by microsoft include the travel website expedia the online magazine slate and the local event and city search website sidewalkcom the former msn butterfly logo used from 2000 to 200910 msn dialup continues to use this logo in the late 1990s microsoft collaborated with many other service providers as well as other microsoft departments to expand the range of msns services some examples include msn adcenter msn shopping affiliated with ebay pricegrabber and shoppingcom and the encarta encyclopedia with various levels of access to information since then msncom has remained a popular destination launching many new services and content sites msns hotmail and messenger services were promoted from the msncom portal which provided a central place for all of msns content msn search now bing a dedicated search engine launched in 1999 the single signin service for microsofts online services microsoft passport now microsoft account also launched across all msn services in 1999 the msncom portal and related group of services under the msn umbrella remained largely the same in the early 2000s the sports section of the msn portal was espncom from 2001 to 2004 and foxsportscom from 2004 to 20141112 msn had an exclusive partnership with msnbccom for news content from 1996 until 2012 when microsoft sold its remaining stake in msnbccom to nbcuniversal and the website was renamed nbcnewscom since then msn has launched msn news an inhouse news operation13 the former msn butterfly logo used from 2009 to 2014 ninemsn continued to use this logo until 2016 msn released a preview of an updated home page and logo on november 3 200914 it was originally expected to be widely available to over 100 million us customers by early 20101516 msn rolled out the newer logo together with a redesign of the overall website on december 25 20091718 in 2012 msn announced on its blog that it would be unveiling a new version of the msncom home page on october 26 exclusively for windows 8 saying that the new version would be clean simple and built for touch19 microsoft said it would be more applike due to the speed of internet explorer 10 more new features included flip ahead which allowed users to swipe from one article to the next msn for windows 8 also had new deals with the ap and reuters20 rebranding of servicesedit main article windows live many of msns services were reorganized in 2005 and 2006 under a new brand name that microsoft championed at the time windows live this move was part of microsofts strategy to improve its online offerings using the windows brand name the company also overhauled its online software and services due to increasing competition from rivals such as yahoo and google the new name was introduced one service at a time the group of windows live services used web 20 technology to offer features and functionality through a web browser that were traditionally only available through dedicated software programs some of the msn services affected by the rebranding included msn hotmail which became windows live hotmail now outlookcom msn messenger which became windows live messenger now integrated into skype msn search which became live search now known as bing msn virtual earth which became live search maps now bing maps msn spaces which became windows live spaces msn alerts which became windows live alerts and msn groups which became windows live groups some other services such as msn direct remained a part of the msn family without transitioning to windows live following the launch of windows live the msn brand took on a different focus msn became primarily an online content provider of news entertainment and common interest topics through its web portal msncom while windows live provided most of microsofts online software and services in 2012 microsoft began to phase out the windows live brand referring to each service separately by its individual brand name without any windows prefix or association21 newest redesignedit microsoft launched a completely rewritten and redesigned msn website making use of the companys modern design language on september 30 20145 the new msn portal features a new version of the logo that follows a style similar to other current microsoft products the website no longer offers original content instead employing editors to repurpose existing content from partners at popular and trusted organizations much of the existing content on msn was eliminated as the website was simplified into a new home page and categories some of which have corresponding apps22 news the latest news headlines and articles from a variety of handpicked sources synced with the news app weather current weather conditions forecasts maps news and traffic synced with the weather app entertainment tv movies music and celebrity news as well as

bing maps and groove music as well as popular social media services facebook and twitter5 signing into msn with a microsoft account allows for personalized content to appear and to be synchronized across devices on the website and in the corresponding apps the redesign of the website led to the closure of msns longtime personalized home page service my msn which was made up of customized rss feeds as the new website no longer supports userspecified rss content however it added some customizability allowing each category on the home page to be reordered or hidden with the 2014 relaunch msn now supports responsive design and eliminates the need for a separate mobile website the redesign of msn proved positive and helped increase traffic with an additional 10 million daily visitors after two months24 appsedit the msn apps are a series of webbased crossplatform apps that primarily provide users information from sources that publish to msn microsoft launched these apps along with the 2014 redesign of the msn web portal rebranding many of the bing apps that originally shipped with windows and windows phone news weather sports money and travel first shipped with windows 8 while
