red rectangle sees a ghost floating next to the table the illusion is produced by a large piece of glass plexiglas or plastic film situated at an angle between viewer and scene green outline the glass reflects a room hidden from the viewer left sometimes called a blue room that is built as mirrorimage of the scene if the mirrorimage room left is darkened it does not reflect well in the glass the empty room top is brightly lit making it very visible to the viewer when the lights in the mirrorimage room are raised with the empty room being dimmed slightly to compensate the ghost appears out of nowhere peppers ghost is an illusion technique used in theatre amusement parks museums television and concerts it is named after john henry pepper 1821–1900 a scientist who popularized the effect in a demonstration in 18621 examples of the illusion are the girltogorilla trick found in old carnival sideshows and the appearance of ghosts at the haunted mansion and the blue fairy in pinocchios daring journey at the disneyland park in california teleprompters are a modern implementation of peppers ghost the technique was used for the appearance of tupac shakur onstage with dr dre and snoop dogg at

stage or room with various objects in it on command ghostly objects appear to fade in or out of existence in the room or objects in the room magically transform into different objects techniqueedit the basic trick involves a stage that is specially arranged into two rooms one that people can see into or the stage as a whole and a second that is hidden to the side the blue room a plate of glass or plexiglas or plastic film is placed somewhere in the main room at an angle that reflects the view of the blue room towards the audience generally this is arranged with the blue room to one side of the stage and the plate on the stage rotated around its vertical axis at 45 degrees2 care must be taken to make the glass as invisible as possible normally hiding the lower edge in patterning on the floor and ensuring lights do not reflect off it when the lights are bright in the main room and dark in the blue room the reflected image cannot be seen when the lighting in the blue room is increased often with the main room lights dimming to make the effect more pronounced the reflection becomes visible and the objects within the blue room seem to appear in thin air a common variation uses two blue rooms one behind the glass and one to the side which can be switched visible or invisible by alternating the lighting2 the hidden room may be an identical mirrorimage of the main room so that its reflected image matches the main rooms this approach is useful in making objects seem to appear or disappear this illusion can also be used to make one object or person reflected in the mirror appear to morph into another behind the glass or vice versa this is the principle behind the girltogorilla trick found in old carnival sideshows the hidden room may instead be painted black with only lightcolored objects in it in this case when light is cast on the room only the light objects reflect the light and appear as ghostly translucent images superimposed in the visible room this can be used to make objects appear to float in space historyedit giambattista della portaedit giambattista della porta was a 16thcentury neapolitan scientist and scholar who is credited with a number of scientific innovations including the camera obscura his 1584 work magia naturalis natural magic includes a description of an illusion titled how we may see in a chamber things that are not that is the first known description of the peppers ghost effect3 portas description from the 1658 english language translation is as follows let there be a chamber wherein no other light comes unless by the door or window where the spectator looks in let the whole window or part of it be of glass as we use to do to keep out the cold but let one part be polished that there may be a lookingglass on bothe sides whence the spectator must look in for the rest do nothing let pictures be set over against this window marble statues and suchlike for what is without will seem to be within and what is behind the spectators back he will think to be in the middle of the house as far from the glass inward as they stand from it outwardly and clearly and certainly that he will think he sees nothing but truth but lest the skill should be known let the part be made so where the ornament is that the spectator may not see it as above his head that a pavement may come between above his head and if an ingenious man do this it is impossible that he should suppose that he is deceived4 john pepper and henry dircksedit the royal polytechnic institute london was a permanent sciencerelated institution first opened in 1838 with a degree in chemistry john henry pepper joined the institution as a lecturer in 1848 the polytechnic awarded him the title of professor in 1854 he became the director and sole lessee of the royal polytechnic1 in 1862 inventor henry dircks developed the dircksian phantasmagoria his version of the longestablished phantasmagoria performances5 this technique was used to make a ghost appear onstage he tried unsuccessfully to sell his idea to theatres it required that theaters be completely rebuilt to support the effect which they found too costly to consider later in the year dircks set up a booth at the royal polytechnic where it was seen by john pepper1 pepper realized that the method could be modified to make it easy to incorporate into existing theatres pepper first showed the effect during a scene of charles dickenss the haunted man to great success peppers implementation of the effect tied his name to it permanently dircks eventually signed over to pepper all financial rights in their joint patent though pepper tried many times to give credit to dircks the title peppers ghost endured6 the relationship between dircks and pepper was summarised in an 1863 article from spectator this admirable ghost is the offspring of two fathers of a learned member of the society of civil engineers henry dircks esq and of professor pepper of the polytechnic to mr dircks belongs the honour of having invented him or as the disciples of hegel would express it evolved him from out of the depths of his own consciousness and professor pepper has the merit of having improved him considerably fitting him for the intercourse of mundane society and even educating him for the stage7 modern examplesedit amusement parksedit the worlds largest implementation of this illusion can be found at the haunted mansion and phantom manor attractions at several walt disney parks and resorts there a 90foot 27 mlong scene features multiple peppers ghost effects brought together in one scene

technique enabling guests to see various spirits that also interact with the physical environment viewable at a much closer proximity the house at haunted hill a halloween attraction in woodland hills california employs a similar variation in its front window to display characters from its storyline projecting an image on the floor and reflecting it in a pane of glass allows a live actor left to interact with a projected ghost an example that combines the peppers ghost effect with a live actor and film projection can be seen in the mystery lodge exhibit at the knotts berry farm theme park in buena park california and the ghosts of the library exhibit at the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum in springfield illinois as well as the depiction of maori legends called a millennium
