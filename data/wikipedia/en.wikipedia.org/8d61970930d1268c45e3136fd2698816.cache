twinjet narrowbody airliner developed and manufactured by boeing commercial airplanes in the united states originally developed as a shorter lowercost twinengine airliner derived from the 707 and 727 the 737 has developed into a family of ten passenger models with capacities from 85 to 215 passengers the 737 is boeings only narrowbody airliner in production with the 737 next generation 700 800 and 900er and the reengined and redesigned 737 max variants currently being built the 737 was originally envisioned in 1964 the initial 737100 made its first flight in april 1967 and entered airline service in february 1968 at lufthansa45 next the lengthened 737200 entered service in april 1968 in the 1980s boeing launched the longer −300 −400 and −500 models subsequently referred to as the boeing 737 classic series and featuring cfm56 turbofan engines along with wing improvements the 737 next generation was introduced in the 1990s with a redesigned increased span laminar flow wing upgraded glass cockpit and new interior the 737 next generation comprises the four −600 −700 −800 and −900 models with lengths ranging from 102 to 138 ft 3109 to 4206 m boeing business jet versions of the 737 next generation are also produced the 737 was revised again in the 2010s for greater efficiency with the 737 max series featuring cfm international leap1b engines and improved winglets the 737 max entered service in 2017 the 737 series is the bestselling commercial jetliner in history4 the 737 has been continuously manufactured by boeing since 1967 with 9716 aircraft delivered and 4431 orders yet to be fulfilled as of september 2017update1 assembly of the 737 is performed at the boeing renton factory in renton washington many 737s serve markets previously filled by 707 727 757 dc9 and md80md90 airliners and the aircraft currently competes primarily with the airbus a320 family6 as of 2006 there were an average of 1250 boeing 737s airborne at any given time with two departing or

had been studying shorthaul jet aircraft designs and wanted to produce another aircraft to supplement the 727 on short and thin routes8 preliminary design work began on may 11 19649 and boeings intense market research yielded plans for a 50 to 60passenger airliner for routes 50 to 1000 mi 100 to 1600 km long810 initial design featured podded engines on the aft fuselage and a ttail like the 727 and fiveabreast seating but joe sutter instead placed the engines under the wings to lighten the structure enabling fuselage widening for sixabreast seating11 the 737 design was presented in october 1964 at the air transport association maintenance and engineering conference by chief project engineer jack steiner where its elaborate highlift devices raised concerns about maintenance costs and dispatch reliability11 the launch decision for the 150 million development was made by the board on 1 february 196511 lufthansa became the launch customer on february 19 196512 with an order for 21 aircraft worth 67 million13 in 1965 after the airline received assurances from boeing that the 737 project would not be canceled14 consultation with lufthansa over the previous winter resulted in an increase in capacity to 100 seats12 the prototype 737 a 100 operated by nasa for testing on april 5 1965 boeing announced an order by united airlines for 40 737s united wanted a slightly larger airplane than the original 737 so boeing stretched the fuselage 91 cm 36 in ahead of and 102 cm 40 in behind the wing15 the longer version was designated 737200 with the original shortbody aircraft becoming the 73710016 detailed design work continued on both variants at the same time boeing was far behind its competitors when the 737 was launched rival aircraft bac111 douglas dc9 and fokker f28 were already into flight certification13 to expedite development boeing used 60 of the structure and systems of the existing 727 the most notable being the fuselage crosssection this fuselage permitted sixabreast seating compared to the rival bac111 and dc9s fiveabreast layout12 design engineers decided to mount the nacelles directly to the underside of the wings to reduce the landing gear length and kept the engines low to the ground for easy ramp inspection and servicing17 many thickness variations for the engine attachment strut were tested in the wind tunnel and the most desirable shape for high speed was found to be one which was relatively thick filling the narrow channels formed between the wing and the top of the nacelle particularly on the outboard side originally the span arrangement of the airfoil sections of the 737 wing was planned to be very similar to that of the 707 and 727 but somewhat thicker a substantial improvement in drag at high mach numbers was achieved by altering these sections near the nacelle18 the engine chosen was the pratt whitney jt8d1 lowbypass ratio turbofan engine delivering 14500 lbf 64 kn thrust19 with the wingmounted engines boeing decided to mount the horizontal stabilizer on the fuselage rather than the ttail style of the boeing 72715 production and testingedit an earlyproduction boeing 737100 of lufthansa the types launch customer at stockholm arlanda airport 1968 the initial assembly of the 737 was adjacent to boeing field now officially named king county international airport because the factory in renton was filled to capacity with the building of the 707 and 727 after 271 aircraft were built production moved to renton in late 19701420 a significant portion of fuselage assembly occurs in wichita kansas which was previously done by boeing but now by spirit aerosystems which purchased some of boeings assets in wichita2122 the fuselage is joined with the wings and landing gear then moves down the assembly line for the engines avionics and interiors after rolling out the aircraft boeing tests the systems and engines before its maiden flight to boeing field where it is painted and finetuned before delivery to the customer23 the first of six 100 prototypes rolled out in december 1966 and made its maiden flight on april 9 1967 piloted by brien wygle and lew wallick24 on december 15 1967 the federal aviation administration certified the 100 for commercial flight25 issuing type certificate a16we26 the 737 was the first aircraft to have as part of its initial certification approval for category ii approaches27 lufthansa received its first aircraft on december 28 1967 and on february 10 1968 became the first nonamerican airline to launch a new boeing aircraft25 lufthansa was the only significant customer to purchase the 737100 only 30 aircraft were produced28 the 737200 had its maiden flight on august 8 1967 it was certified by the faa on december 21 19672629 and the inaugural flight for united was on april 28 1968 from chicago to grand rapids michigan25 the lengthened 200 was widely preferred over the 100 by airlines30 sales were low in the early 1970s and after a peak of 114 deliveries in 1969 only 22 were shipped in 1972 with 19 in backlog but the us air force saved the program by ordering t43s11 african airlines orders kept the production running until the 1978 us airline deregulation act where demand was better for a sixabreast narrowbody aircraft particularly reengined with the cfm56 struggling at the time11 initial derivativesedit an earlyproduction retrofitted united airlines 737200 with deployed thrust reversers the original engine nacelles incorporated thrust reversers taken from the 727 outboard nacelles they proved to be relatively ineffective and tended to lift the aircraft up off the runway when deployed this reduced the downforce on the main wheels thereby reducing the effectiveness of the wheel brakes in 1968 an improvement to the thrust reversal system was introduced31 a 48inch tailpipe extension was added and new targetstyle thrust reversers were incorporated the thrust reverser doors were set 35 degrees away from the vertical to allow the exhaust to be deflected inboard and over the wings and outboard and under the wings32 the improvement became standard on all aircraft after march 1969 and a retrofit was provided for active aircraft boeing fixed the drag issue by introducing new longer nacellewing fairings and improved the airflow over the flaps and slats the production line also introduced an improvement to the flap system allowing increased use during takeoff and landing all these changes gave the aircraft a boost to payload and range and improved shortfield performance25 in may 1971 after aircraft 135 all improvements including more powerful engines and a greater fuel capacity were incorporated into the 737200 giving it a 15 increase in payload and range over the original 200s27 this became known as the 737200 advanced which became the production standard in june 197133 737200 planform in 1970 boeing received only 37 orders facing financial difficulties boeing considered closing the 737 productionline and selling the design to japanese aviation companies14 after the cancellation of the boeing supersonic transport and scaling back of 747 production enough funds were freed up to continue the project34 in a bid to increase sales by offering a variety of options boeing offered a 737c convertible model in both 100 and 200 lengths this model featured a 340 cm × 221 cm 134 in × 87 in freight door just behind the cockpit and a strengthened floor with rollers which allowed for palletized cargo a 737qc quick change version with palletized seating allowed for faster configuration changes between cargo and passenger flights35 with the improved shortfield capabilities of the 737 boeing offered the option on the 200 of the gravel kit which enables this aircraft to operate on remote unpaved runways3637 until retiring its 200 fleet in 2007 alaska airlines used this option for some of its rural operations in alaska38 northern canadian operators air inuit air north canadian north first air and nolinor aviation still operate the gravel kit aircraft in northern canada where gravel runways are common in 1988 the initial production run of the 200 model ended after producing 1114 aircraft the last one was delivered to xiamen airlines on august 8 19883940 improved variantsedit main article boeing 737 classic development began in 1979 for the 737s first major revision boeing wanted to increase capacity and range incorporating improvements to upgrade the aircraft to modern specifications while also retaining commonality with previous 737 variants in 1980 preliminary aircraft specifications of the variant dubbed 737300 were released at the farnborough airshow41 the 737300 was the first classic variant boeing engineer mark gregoire led a design team which cooperated with cfm international to select modify and deploy a new engine and nacelle that would make the 737300 into a viable aircraft they chose the cfm563b1 highbypass turbofan engine to power the aircraft which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise but also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the 737 and the larger diameter of the engine over the original pratt whitney engines gregoires team and cfm solved the problem by reducing the size of the fan which made the engine slightly less efficient than it had been forecast to be placing the engine ahead of the wing and by moving engine accessories to the sides of the engine pod giving the engine a distinctive noncircular hamster pouch42 air intake4344 earlier customers for the cfm56 included the us air force with its program to reengine kc135 tankers45 the passenger capacity of the aircraft was increased to 149 by extending the fuselage around the wing by 287 meters 9 ft 5 in the wing incorporated several changes for improved aerodynamics the wingtip was extended 9 in 23 cm and the wingspan by 1 ft 9 in 53 cm the leadingedge slats and trailingedge flaps were adjusted43 the tailfin was redesigned the flight deck was improved with the optional efis electronic flight instrumentation system and the passenger cabin incorporated improvements similar to those

program47 in june 1986 boeing announced the development of the 73740048 which stretched the fuselage a further 10 ft 30 m increasing the passenger load to 18849 the 400s first flight was on february 19 1988 and after a sevenmonth500hour flighttesting run entered service with piedmont airlines that october50 ryanair 737400 at takeoff the stubbier cfm56 engines are mounted ahead of the wings the −500 series was offered due to customer demand as a modern and direct replacement of the 737200 it incorporated the improvements of the 737 classic series allowing longer routes with fewer passengers to be more economical than with the 737300 the fuselage length of the −500 is 1 ft 7 in 48 cm longer than the 737200 accommodating up to 14049 passengers both glass and olderstyle mechanical cockpits arrangements were available50 using the cfm563 engine also gave a 25 increase in fuel efficiency over the older 200s pw engines50 the 737500 was launched in 1987 by southwest airlines with an order for 20 aircraft51 and flew for the first time on june 30 198950 a single prototype flew 375 hours for the certification process50 and on february 28 1990 southwest airlines received the first delivery52 after the introduction of the −600700800900 series the 300400500 series was called the 737 classic series53 the price of jet fuel reached a peak in 2008 when airlines devoted 40 of the retail price of an air ticket to pay for fuel versus 15 in 20005455 consequently in that year carriers retired classic 737 series aircraft to reduce fuel consumption replacements consisted of more efficient next generation 737s or airbus a320a319a318 series aircraft on june 4 2008 united airlines announced it would retire all 94 of its classic 737 aircraft 64 737300 and 30 737500 aircraft

internally named boeing y1 that could follow the boeing 787 dreamliner90 a decision on this replacement was postponed and delayed into 201191 in november 2014 it was reported that boeing plans to develop a new aircraft to replace the 737 in the 2030 time frame the airplane is to have a similar fuselage but probably made from composite materials similar to the boeing 787 dreamliner92 boeing also considers a parallel development along with the 757 replacement similar to when the 757767 were developed in the 1970s93 on july 20 2011 boeing announced plans for a new 737 version to be powered by the cfm international leapx engine with american airlines intending to order 100 of these aircraft94 on august 30 2011 boeing confirmed the launch of the 737 new engine variant called the 737 max95

interfaces with the antiskid brake system the dark circles of the tires are clearly visible when a 737 takes off or is at low altitude101 737s are not equipped with fuel dump systems the original aircraft were too small to require them and adding a fuel dump system to the later larger variants would have incurred a large weight penalty boeing instead demonstrated an equivalent level of safety depending upon the nature of the emergency 737s either circle to burn off fuel or land overweight if the latter is the case the aircraft is inspected by maintenance personnel for damage and then returned to service if none is found102103 enginesedit engines on the 737 classic series 300 400 500 and nextgeneration series 600 700 800 900 do not have circular inlets like most aircraft the 737 classic series featured cfm56 turbofan engines which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise over the jt8d engines used on the −100 and −200 but also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the 737 boeing and engine supplier cfmi solved the problem by placing the engine ahead of rather than below the wing and by moving engine accessories to the sides rather than the bottom of the engine pod giving the 737 a distinctive noncircular air intake43 the wing also incorporated changes for improved aerodynamics the engines accessory gearbox was moved from the 6 oclock position under the engine to the 4 oclock position from a frontforward looking aft perspective this sidemounted gearbox gives the engine a somewhat triangular rounded shape because the engine is close to the ground 737300s and later models are more prone to engine foreign object damage fod the improved cfm567 turbofan engine on the 737 next generation is 7 more fuelefficient than the previous cfm563 in the 737 classics the newest 737 variants the 737 max family are to feature cfm international leap1b engines with a 173 m fan diameter these engines are

automatically and seamlessly revert to control via servo tab in this mode the servo tabs aerodynamically control the elevators and ailerons these servo tabs are in turn controlled by cables running to the control yoke the pilots muscle forces alone control the tabs for the 737 next generation a sixscreen lcd glass cockpit with modern avionics was implemented while retaining crew commonality with previous generation 737105 most 737 cockpits are equipped with eyebrow windows positioned above the main glareshield eyebrow windows were a feature of the original 707 and 727106 they allowed for greater visibility in turns and offered better sky views if navigating by stars with modern avionics they became redundant and many pilots actually placed newspapers or other objects in them to block out sun glare they were eliminated from the 737 cockpit design in 2004 although they are still installed at customer request107 these windows are sometimes removed and plugged usually during maintenance overhauls and can be distinguished by the metal plug which differs from the smooth metal in later aircraft that were not originally fitted with the windows107 original 737200 cockpit
