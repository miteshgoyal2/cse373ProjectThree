efforts supporting evacuees of hurricane harvey jackson met with houston mayor sylvester turner and evacuees at the george r brown convention center prior to the performance246 artistryedit music and voiceedit jackson has a soprano vocal range over the course of her career she has received frequent criticism for the limits of her vocal capabilities especially in comparison to contemporary artists such as whitney houston and mariah carey247 in comparing her vocal technique to houston and aretha franklin vocal coach roger love states that when janet sings she allows a tremendous amount of air to come through shes obviously aiming for a sexy sultry effect and on one level that works nicely but actually its fairly limited he adds that while her voice is suitable for studio recording it doesnt translate well to stage because despite having great songs incredible dancing and her star like presence the live show is still magnificent but the voice is not the star248 biographer david ritz commented on janets albums—and in her videos and live performances which revealed a crisp athletic dance technique singing wasnt the point saying emphasis was placed on her slamming beats infectious hooks and impeccable production values56 eric henderson of slant magazine claimed critics opposing her small voice somehow missed the explosive gimme a beat vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over nasty  or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem lets wait awhile249 classical composer louis andriessen has praised jackson for her rubato sense of rhythm sensitivity and the childlike quality of her strangely erotic voice250 several critics also consider her voice to often be enveloped within her musics production music critic j d considine noted on albums jacksons sound isnt defined by her voice so much as by the way her voice is framed by the lush propulsive production of jimmy jam and terry lewis251 wendy robinson of popmatters said the power of janet jacksons voice does not lie in her pipes she doesnt blow she whispers  jacksons confectionary vocals are masterfully complemented by gentle harmonies and balanced out by pulsing rhythms so shes never unpleasant to listen to252 matthew perpetus of fluxblog suggested jacksons vocal techniques as a study for indie rock music considering it to possess a somewhat subliminal effect on the listener guiding and emphasizing dynamic shifts without distracting attention from its primal hooks perpetus added her voice effortlessly transitions from a rhythmic toughness to soulful emoting to a flirty softness without overselling any aspect of her performance  a continuum of emotions and attitudes that add up to the impression that were listening to the expression of a fullyformed human being with contradictions and complexities253 black cat 1989 written solely by jackson black cat was recorded using a mixture of rockman and marshall amplifier to give it a heavy metal sound the songs lyrics convey a stance against substance abuse problems playing this file see media help jacksons music has encompassed a broad range of genres her records from the 1980s have been described as being influenced by prince as her producers are exmembers of the time254 sal cinquemani wrote that in addition to defining top 40 radio she gave princes minneapolis sound a distinctly feminine—and with songs like what have you done for me lately nasty control and lets wait awhile a distinctly feminist—spin255 on control richard j ripani documented that she jam and lewis had crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco along with heavy doses of synthesizers percussion sound effects and a rap music sensibility18 author rickey vincent stated that she has often been credited for redefining the standard of popular music with the industrialstrength beats of the album256 she is considered a trendsetter in pop balladry with richard rischar stating the black pop ballad of the mid1980s had been dominated by the vocal and production style that was smooth and polished led by singers whitney houston janet jackson and james ingram257 jackson continued her musical development by blending pop and urban music with elements of hiphop in the nineties this included a softer representation articulated by lush soulful ballads and uptempo dance beats258 she is described by music critic greg kot as an artist who has reshaped the sound and image of rhythm and blues within the first decade of her career259 critic karla peterson remarked that she is a sharp dancer an appealing performer and as thats the way love goes proves—an ace popsong writer260 selected material from the following decade has been viewed less favorably as sal cinquemani comments except for maybe rem no other former superstar act has been as prolific with such diminishing commercial and creative returns255 jackson has changed her lyrical focus over the years becoming the subject of analysis in musicology african american studies and gender studies16261 david ritz compared jacksons musical style to marvin gayes stating like marvin autobiography seemed the sole source of her music her art also like marvins floated over a reservoir of secret pain262 much of her success has been attributed to a series of powerful metallic grooves her chirpy multitracked vocals and a lyrical philosophy built on pride and selfknowledge263 ritz also stated the mystery is the low flame that burns around the perimeters of janet jacksons soul the flame feeds off the most highly combustible elements survival and ambition caution and creativity supreme confidence and dark fear262 during the 1980s her lyrics embodied selfactualization feminist principles and politically driven ideology261264 gillian g gaar author of shes a rebel the history of women in rock roll 2002 described control as an autobiographical tale about her life with her parents her first marriage and breaking free19 encyclopedia of african american popular culture 2010 author jessie carney smith wrote with that album she asserted her independence individuality and personal power she challenged audiences to see her as a transformed person from an ingénue to a growup multitalented celebrity265 referring to rhythm nation 1814 as an embodiment of hope timothy e scheurer author of born in the usa the myth of america in popular music from colonial times to the present 2007 wrote it may remind some of sly stone prior to theres a riot going on and other africanamerican artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined by dr king is still possible that the american dream is a dream for all people266 on janet jackson began focusing on sexual themes shayne lee author of erotic revolutionaries black women sexuality and popular culture 2010 wrote that her music over the following decade branded her as one of the most sexually stimulating vocalists of the 1990s267 in youve come a long way baby women politics and popular culture 1996 lilly j goren observed jacksons evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dancerock divas to pursue264 the washington post declared jacksons public image over the course of her career had shifted from innocence to experience inspiring such carnal albums as 1993s janet and 1997s the velvet rope the latter of which explored the bonds—figuratively and literally—of love and lust268 the song free xone from the velvet rope which portrays samesex relationships in a positive light is described by sociologist shayne lee as a rare incident in which a popular black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of heteronormativity making it a significant song in black sexual politics267 during promotion for janet she stated i love feeling deeply sexual—and dont mind letting the world know for me sex has become a celebration a joyful part of the creative process17 upon the release of damita jo jackon stated beginning with the earlier albums exploring—and liberating—my sexuality has been an ongoing discovery and theme adding as an artist thats not only my passion its my obligation269 stephen thomas erlewine has found jacksons consistent inclusion of sex in her music lacking ingenuity especially in comparisons to other artists such as prince stating while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music it isnt an inherently fascinating topic for pop music—as with anything it all depends on the artist270 videos and stageedit see also janet jackson videography jackson drew inspiration for her music videos and performances from musicals she watched in her youth and was heavily influenced by the choreography of fred astaire and michael kidd among others271 throughout her career she has worked with and brought numerous professional choreographers to prominence such as tina landon paula abdul and michael kidd272 veronica chambers declared her impact on pop music is undeniable and farreaching adding a quick glance at the billboard chart reveals any number of artists cast in the janet jackson mold chambers observed numerous videos which features not only ms jacksons dancers but choreography and sets remarkably like those she has used273 janine coveney of billboard observed that jacksons musical declaration of independence control launched a string of hits an indelible production sound and an enduring image cemented by groundbreaking video choreography and imagery that pop vocalists still emulate157 ben hogwood of musicomh applauded the huge influence she has become on younger pretenders to her throne most notably britney spears jennifer lopez and christina aguilera274 qadree eiamin remarked that many pop artists pattern their performances after janets proven dancediva persona275 beretta e smithshomade author of shaded lives africanamerican women and television 2002 wrote that jacksons impact on the music video sphere came largely through music sales successes which afforded her more visual liberties and control this assuming of control directly impacted the look and content of her music videos giving jackson an agency not assumed by many other artists—male or female black or white276 parallel lines media representations of dance 1993 documents that her videos have often been reminiscent of live concerts or elaborate musical theater277 however in her 30minute rhythm nation 1814 film jackson utilizes street dancing techniques in contrast to traditional choreography277 the group dynamic visually embodies a gender neutral equality with jackson performing asexually and anonymously in front of but as one of the members of the group278 her music videos have also contributed to a higher degree of sexual freedom among young women as jean m twenge author of generation me why todays young americans are more confident assertive entitled—and more miserable than ever before 2007 wrote music videos by female artists have contributed to the trend of young women enganging in oral sex with jackson heavily implying maleonfemale oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a mans head until hes in exactly the right position279 however accusations of cosmetic surgery skin lightening and increasingly hypersexual imagery have led to her being viewed as conforming to a white maledominated view of sexuality rather than liberating herself or others276 jackson received the mtv video vanguard award for her contributions to the art form and became the first recipient of the mtv icon tribute celebrating her impact on the music industry as a whole in 2003 slant magazine named rhythm nation and got til its gone among the 100 greatest music videos of all time ranked at number 87 and number 10 respectively280 in 2011 rhythm nation was voted the tenth best music video of the 1980s by billboard281 the independent writer nicholas barber stated janets concerts are the pop equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie with all the explosions special effects ersatz sentimentality gratuitous cleavage and emphasis on spectacle over coherence that the term implies282 jet magazine reported janets innovative stage performances during her world tours have won her a reputation as a worldclass performer283 chris willman of los angeles times stated the enthralling choreography of jacksons rhythm nation 1814 tour represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping n locking style—a rapidfire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements284 when jackson was asked do you understand it when people talk about the velvet rope tour in terms of broadway she responded im crazy about broadway thats what i grew up on100 her number ones up close and personal tour deviated from the fullscale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship and in some cases enhanced it greg kot of the chicago tribune wrote in past tours jacksons thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of her production  in the more scaleddown setting jackson brought a warmth and a passion that wasnt always evident in stadiums  the best janet jackson performance ive covered in 20plus years285 thor christensen of the dallas morning news reported jackson often lip syncs in concert he wrote janet jackson—one of pops most notorious onstage lipsyncers—conceded  she uses some taped vocals to augment her live vocals but she refused to say what percentage of her concert voice is taped and how much is live286 michael maccambridge of the austin americanstatesman who reviewed jacksons rhythm nation world tour described lipsyncing as a moot point stating jackson was frequently singing along with her own prerecorded vocals to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles287 maccambridge also observed it seemed unlikely that anyone—even a prized member of the first family of soul music—could dance like she did for 90 minutes and still provide the sort of powerful vocals that the 90s super concerts are expected to achieve287 similarly chris willman commented even a classically trained vocalist would be hardpressed to maintain any sort of level of volume—or more appropriately control—while bounding up and down stairs and whipping limbs in unnatural directions at impeccable breakneck speed284 critics observed that in the smaller scale of her number ones up close and personal tour she forewent lipsyncing288 chris richards of the washington post stated even at its breathiest that delicate voice hasnt lost the laserlike precision289 influencesedit jackson describes lena horne as a profound inspiration for entertainers of several generations as well as herself upon hornes death she stated horne brought much joy into everyones lives—even the younger generations younger than myself she was such a great talent she opened up such doors for artists like myself290 similarly she considers dorothy dandridge to be one of her idols291 jackson has declared herself a very big joni mitchell fan explaining as a kid i was drawn to joni mitchell records jonis songs spoke to me in an intimate personal way292293 she holds reverence for tina turner stating tina has become a heroic figure for many people especially women because of her tremendous strength personally tina doesnt seem to have a beginning or an end in my life i felt her music was always there and i feel like it always will be294 she has also named other socially conscious acts such as tracy chapman sly and the family stone u2 and bob dylan as sources of inspiration19295 in her early career jackson credited her brothers

gossiped about docudramatized and hardcopied as the kennedys299 phillip mccarthy of the sydney morning herald noted that throughout her recording career one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of michael300 joshua klein wrote for the first half of her recording career janet jackson sounded like an artist with something to prove emerging in 1982 just as big brother michael was casting his longest shadow jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations from the pleasure principle to the radicalsounding rhythm nation to the telling statement of purpose control268 steve huey of allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers janet jackson has managed to emerge a superstar in her own right rivaling not only several female recording artists including madonna and whitney houston but also her brother while successfully shifting her image from a strong independent young woman to a sexy mature adult301 by forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures she has been esteemed as the queen of pop55302 klein argued that stardom was not too hard to predict but few could have foreseen that janet—miss jackson if youre nasty—would one day replace michael as true heir to the jackson family legacy268 jackson has also been recognized for playing a pivotal role in crossing racial boundaries in the recording industry where black artists were once considered to be substandard303 in right to rock the black rock coalition and the cultural politics of race 2004 author maureen mahon states in the 1980s whitney houston michael jackson janet jackson and prince were among the african american artists who crossed over  when black artists cross over into pop success they cease to be black in the industry sense of the word they get promoted from racialized black music to universal pop music in an economically driven process of racial transcendence304 routledge international encyclopedia of women global womens issues and knowledge 2000 documented that jackson along with other prominent africanamerican women had achieved financial breakthroughs in mainstream popular music receiving superstar status in the process52 she alongside her contemporaries offered viable creative intellectual and business paths for establishing and maintaining agency lyrical potency marketing and ownership305 her business savvy has been compared to that of madonna gaining a level of autonomy which enables creative latitude and access to financial resources and massmarket distribution306307 a model of reinvention author jessie carney smith wrote that janet has continued to test the limits of her transformative power receiving accolades in music film and concert tours throughout the course of her career265 musicologist richard j ripani identified jackson as a leader in the development of contemporary rb as her music created a unique blend of genre and sound effects which ushered in the use of rap vocals into mainstream rb18 he also argues her signature song nasty influenced the new jack swing genre developed by teddy riley18 leon mcdermott of the sunday herald wrote her millionselling albums in the 1980s helped invent contemporary rb through jimmy jam and terry lewiss muscular lean production the sinuous grooves threaded through 1986s control
