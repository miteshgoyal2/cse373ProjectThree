bush has led with strength and compassion and these speakers reflect that chief executive officer of the convention bill harris commented these speakers have seen president bushs strong steady leadership and each will attest to his character from a unique perspective their vast experience and various points of view are a testament to the depth and breadth of the support for the republican ticket in 2004 zell milleredit considered to be one of the most interesting choices for speakers at the convention was a keynote address by georgia senator zell miller a conservative democrat miller had consistently voted with republicans in a wall street journal editorial miller cited that the reason for his defection was that i barely recognize my party anymore he continued today its the democratic party that has mastered the art of division and diversion to run for president as a democrat these days you have to go from interest group to interest group cap in hand asking for the support of liberal kingmakers he finished by saying i still believe in hope and opportunity and when it comes right down to it mr bush is the man who represents hope and opportunity his keynote address was a visceral smite to democrats and an excoriating attack on john kerry blaming him for the divisions in america notably he mocked kerrys call for strength in the armed forces by noting several important military projects that kerry had opposed saying that kerry wanted forces armed with what spitballs including senator edward kennedy of massachusetts he claimed no pair has been more wrong more loudly more often than the two senators from massachusetts ted kennedy and john kerry in his speech miller also heaped his praise for 1940 republican presidential nominee wendell willkie for supporting president roosevelts establishment of a military draft raising concerns about the intentions of president bush in this area zell miller also delivered the keynote address on behalf of

nearly killed her in march while doctors were operating one of her lungs collapsed it turns out there was a malignant tumor pressing against her lung and heart despite the debilitating effects of cancer treatment rita insists on continuing her work as a volunteer for the bush campaign her doctor said he didnt think it was a good idea rita started crying and said but president bush needs my help she also says if someone like her can spend time working the phones for president bush we all can — ann wagner we should remember it wasnt so long ago that confidence in new york was in short supply when i took the oath of office nearly three years ago we were a city in mourning a city that had in a few dreadful hours lost almost 3000 of our own husbands wives sons and daughters from every part of the nation and every corner of the globe there were those who doubted then whether this city could hold onto the gains made during the 90s under mayor giuliani a lot of people were wondering what the future held for new york city or whether we even had a future but neither america nor president bush ever stopped believing in us nearly two years ago with the citys fate still a question mark in many minds our president decided that this convention would come to new york this was a show of faith that required courage and vision one that all new yorkers will not forget and today it fills me with enormous pride and gratitude to tell everyone that new york city is back — michael bloomberg all of us despite the differences that enliven our politics are united in the one big idea that freedom is our birthright and its defense is always our first responsibility all other responsibilities come second we must not lose sight of that as we debate who among us should bear the greatest responsibility for keeping us safe and free we must whatever our disagreements stick together in this great challenge of our time my friends in the democratic party and im fortunate to call many of them my friends assure us they share the conviction that winning the war against terrorism is our governments most important obligation i dont doubt their sincerity they emphasize that military action alone wont protect us that this war has many fronts in courts financial institutions in the shadowy world of intelligence and in diplomacy they stress that america needs the help of her friends to combat an evil that threatens us all that our alliances are as important to victory as are our armies we agree — john mccain we are americans first americans last americans always let us argue our differences but remember we are not enemies but comrades in a war against a real enemy and take courage from the knowledge that our military superiority is matched only by the superiority of our ideals and our unconquerable love for them our adversaries are weaker than us in arms and men but weaker still in causes they fight to express a hatred for all that is good in humanity we fight for love of freedom and justice a love that is invincible keep that faith keep your courage stick together stay strong do not yield do not flinch stand up stand up with our president and fight were americans were americans and well never surrender — john mccain from the first republican president abraham lincoln to president george w bush our partys great contribution is to expand freedom in our own land and all over the world and our party is at its best when it makes certain that we have a powerful national defense in a still very dangerous world i dont believe were right about everything and democrats are wrong about everything neither party has a monopoly on virtue but i do believe that there are times in our history when our ideas are more necessary and important for what we are

defended by citizensoldiers and delivered to us we inherited a great nation so must our children no nation whatever the size of its armed forces or economy can sustain greatness unless it educates all not just some of its citizens no one understands that better than president bush hes always had a compassionate vision for education students challenged by high standards teachers armed with proper resources parents empowered with information and choices young adults with meaningful diplomas in their hands not despair in their hearts — rod paige my fellow americans how do you know if you are a republican ill tell you how if you believe that government should be accountable to the people not the people to the government then you are a republican if you believe a person should be treated as an individual not as a member of an interest group then you are a republican if you believe your family knows how to spend your money better than the government does then you are a republican if you believe our educational system should be held accountable for the progress of our children then you are a republican if you believe this country not the united nations is the best hope of democracy in the world then you are a republican and ladies and gentlemen if you believe we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism then you are a republican — arnold schwarzenegger there is another way you can tell youre a republican you have faith in free enterprise faith in the resourcefulness of the american people and faith in the us economy to those critics who are so pessimistic about our economy i say dont be economic girlie men — arnold schwarzenegger this time of war has been a time of great hardship for our military families the president and i want all our men and women in uniform and their wives and husbands mothers and fathers sons and daughters to know we appreciate their sacrifice we know it will mean a more peaceful future for our children and grandchildren no american president ever wants to go to war abraham lincoln didnt want to go to war but he knew saving the union required it franklin roosevelt didnt want to go to war—but he knew defeating tyranny demanded it and my husband didnt want to go to war but he knew the safety and security of america and the world depended on it i remember some very quiet nights at the dinner table george was weighing grim scenarios and ominous intelligence about potentially even more devastating attacks i listened many nights as george talked with foreign leaders on the phone or in our living room or at our ranch in crawford i remember an intense weekend at camp david george and prime minister tony blair were discussing the threat from saddam hussein and i remember sitting in the window of the white house watching as my husband walked on the lawn below i knew he was wrestling with these agonizing decisions that would have such profound consequence for so many lives and for the future of our world and i was there when my husband had to decide once again as in our parents generation america had to make the tough choices the hard decisions and lead the world toward greater security and freedom — laura

forgetting that america is a force for good in the world fighting for freedom and human rights on this there is no question george w bush is right and the blame america first crowd is wrong americans will rise to every challenge we face —mitt romney in fact during this campaign senator kerry is now proposing more than 2 trillion in new spending over the next 10 years and we still have two months to go before the election we all know how he would pay for this explosion in new spending he would need to raise your taxes john kerry believes that government can spend our money better than we can but most americans dont share this view thats why john kerry has to preach the politics of division of envy and resentment thats why they talk so much about two americas but class warfare is not an economic policy and the politics of division will not make america stronger and it will not lead to prosperity paul ryan where is the bipartisanship in this country when we need it most now while young americans are dying in the sands of iraq and the mountains of afghanistan our nation is being torn apart and made weaker because of the democrats manic obsession to bring down our commanderinchief —zell miller never in the history of the world has any soldier sacrificed more for the freedom and liberty of total strangers than the american soldier and our soldiers dont just give freedom abroad they preserve it for us here at home for it has been said so truthfully that it is the soldier not the reporter who has given us the freedom of the press it is the soldier not the poet who has given us freedom of speech it is the soldier not the agitator who has given us the freedom to protest it is the soldier who salutes the flag serves beneath the flag whose coffin is draped by the flag who gives that protester the freedom to abuse and burn that flag no one should dare to even think about being the commander in chief of this country if he doesnt believe with all his heart that our soldiers are liberators abroad and defenders of freedom at home —zell miller and no pair has been more wrong more loudly more often than the two senators from massachusetts ted kennedy and john kerry together kennedykerry have opposed the very weapons system that won the cold war and that is now winning the war on terror listing all the weapon systems that senator kerry tried his best to shut down sounds like an auctioneer selling off our national security but americans need to know the facts the b1 bomber that senator kerry opposed dropped 40 of the bombs in the first six months of operation enduring freedom the b2 bomber that senator kerry opposed delivered air strikes against the taliban in afghanistan and husseins command post in iraq the f14a tomcats that senator kerry opposed shot down khadifis libyan migs over the gulf of sidra the modernized f14d that senator kerry opposed delivered missile strikes against tora borathe apache helicopter that senator kerry opposed took out those republican guard tanks in kuwait in the gulf war the f15 eagles that senator kerry opposed flew cover over our nations capital and this very city after 911 i could go on and on and on against the patriot missile that shot down saddam husseins scud missiles over israel against the aegis airdefense cruiser against the strategic defense initiative against the trident missile against against against this is the man who wants to be the commander in chief of our us armed forces us forces armed with what spitballs —zell miller in the weeks and months after september 11 i had so many people come up to me and say how glad they were that george bush and dick cheney were in the white house i knew exactly what they meant these men are strong they are steadfast they are exactly the leaders we need at this moment in our history —lynne cheney just as surely as the nazis during world war two and the soviet communists during the cold war the enemy we face today is bent on our destruction as in other times we are in a war we did not start and have no choice but to win firm in our resolve focused on our mission and led by a superb commander in chief we will prevail the fanatics who killed some 3000 of our fellow americans may have thought they could attack us with impunity because terrorists had done so previously but if the killers of september 11 thought we had lost the will to defend our freedom they did not know america and they did not know george w bush —dick cheney i watch him at work every day i have seen him face some of the hardest decisions that can come to the oval office and make those decisions with the wisdom and humility americans expect in their president george w bush is a man who speaks plainly and means what he says he is a person of loyalty and kindness and he brings out these qualities in those around him he is a man of great personal strength and more than that a man with a heart for the weak and the vulnerable and the afflicted we all remember that terrible morning when in the space of just 102 minutes more americans were killed than we lost at pearl harbor we remember the president who came to new york city and pledged that the terrorists would soon hear from all of us george w bush saw this country through grief and tragedy he has acted with patience and calm and a moral seriousness that calls evil by its name in the great divide of our time he has put this nation where america always belongs against the tyrants of this world and on the side of every soul on earth who yearns to live in freedom fellow

war but we have a president who chooses to win it this is no ordinary time the stakes could not be higher fate has handed our generation a grave new threat to freedom and fortune has given us a leader
