written the song after his firstgrade daughter came home crying because a boy pushed her off the slide he blurted out three reasons for the incident to comfort her one the boy liked her two people can be strange and three its human nature4 fellow toto band member david paich gave the demo tape along with two of his own songs to producer quincy jones hoping they would be used by jackson3 jones did not think paichs songs were right for jacksons current work but enjoyed the rough demo of human nature at the end of the cassette3 jones explained all of a sudden at the end there was all this silence there was why why dah dah dadum dah dah why why just a dummy lyric and a very skeletal thing—i get goosebumps talking about it i said this is where we wanna go because its got such a wonderful flavor5 however jones was dissatisfied with the original lyrics and so john bettis who had written lyrics for hits by the carpenters and the pointer sisters among others was asked to add lyrics to the song he completed the song in two days6 the producer asked if the song could be included on jacksons album to which porcaro and bettis agreed3 human nature was the last song selected for thriller ousting

rockwell of the new york times stated that human nature was a haunting brooding ballad with an irresistible chorus11 allmusic noted that the gentle and lovely human nature coexisted comfortably with the tough scared beat it12 they later added that the song was a soft rocker13 reflecting on thriller slant expressed their fondness of the song stating that it was probably the best musical composition on the album and surely one of the only ac ballads of its era worth remembering14 the magazine added that the tracks buttery harmonies were powerful14 stylus also praised the song describing it as the smoothest of ballads15 however they further added that the music does little to embody the song’s message and that it couches jacksons glazed voice in bubble synths and drum pillows15 aboutcoms bill lamb looked back on the track 25 years after its release he felt that the song set down a blueprint for what would become known as adult rb16 kelefa sanneh of blender described the softserve balladry of the song as a silksheets masterstroke17 in a 2008 ign review todd gilchrist explained that the elements of human nature worked better today than they did before he added that it may be because modern rb sucks18 tom ewing reviewer for pitchfork media described the song as meltingly tender with mtv adding that it was an airy ballad1920 rolling stone claimed that the most beautifully fragile human nature was so open and brave it made shes out of my life seem phony21 the los angeles times concluded that it was jacksons delivery that made the middling ballad take off22 vogue cites the poster for starting one of the hottest trends in costume jewelry that year “several years back he borrowed three heraldicstyle brooches with crests crowns and maltese crosses for a poster he was shooting and the minute that poster came out everybody wanted brooches” says connie parente in the vogue interview connie parente is the popular los angeles jewelry
