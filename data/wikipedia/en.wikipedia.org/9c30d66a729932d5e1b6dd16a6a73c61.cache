as hps first woman ceo that carly fiorina didnt just break the glass ceiling she obliterated it as the first woman to lead a fortune 20 company424344 writing in fortune magazine in august 2015 jeffrey

separating agilent technologies from hp and proposed pwc acquisition although the decision to spin off the companys analytical instruments division predated her arrival one of her first major responsibilities as chief executive was overseeing the separation of the unit into the standalone agilent technologies47 fiorina proposed the acquisition of the technology services arm of pricewaterhousecoopers for almost us14 billion but withdrew the bid after a lackluster reception from wall street48 following the collapse of the dotcom bubble the pwc consulting arm was acquired by ibm for less than us4 billion hp later acquired electronic data systems another technology services company which some considered a validation of fiorinas strategy4950 compaq merger in early september 2001 in the wake of the bursting of the tech bubble fiorina announced the acquisition of pc maker compaq with us25 billion in stock8 which at the time was the second largest producer of personal computers after dell8 hp stock traded down by 30 on the news of the merger8 the compaq merger created the worlds largest personal computer manufacturer in terms of units shipped515253 fiorina was frequently at odds with hps board of directors4654 and she had to fight with the board for the merger walter hewlett the son of company cofounder william hewlett was a source of particularly strong opposition5455 hewlett originally voted with the other board members to approve the compaq deal but he later changed his mind8 he launched a proxy fight against fiorinas efforts which fiorina won with a razorthin margin of 514 of the shareholders with the institutional shareholders providing the bulk of the support856 fiorina was supported in the proxy battle by other board members8 including richard hackborn philip m condit57 george a keyworth ii58 and robert knowling8 fiorina proceeded to reorganize hp and merge the parts of it that she kept with compaq59 the merger was met initially with almost universal skepticism60 the february 7 2005 issue of fortune described her merger plan as failing and the prognosis as doubtful61 business professor robert burgelman and former hp executive vice president webb mckinney who led hps postmerger integration team analyzed the merger and concluded that it was ultimately successful62 in 2008 former acting ceo of compaq ben rosen stated that although fiorina lacked the skills to run the merged company her successors made it work60 hp was able to integrate compaqs operations and emerge as the worlds largest seller of personal computers the industry soon fell into decline leading to further difficulties for the company hp eventually wrote off us12 billion from the acquisition as the personal computer market declined63 looking back a 2011 new york times article described it as one of the more questionable deals of the time64 allegations of sales to iran despite sanctions see also hewlett packard § sales to iran despite sanctions in 1997 prior to fiorinas joining the company hps dutch subsidiary formed a partnership with a company in dubai redington gulf which sold hps products in iran65 under fiorinas leadership at hp the company sold millions of dollars worth of printers and computer products to iran through the foreign subsidiary while us export sanctions were in effect6667 after the story was initially reported by the boston globe in 200868 the sec sent a letter of inquiry to hp who responded that products worth us120 million were sold in fiscal 200869 arguing that the sales did not violate export sanctions because they were made through a foreign subsidiary65 according to former officials who worked on sanctions hp was using a loophole by routing their sales through a foreign subsidiary65 hp ended its relationship with redington gulf after the sec inquiry65 providing hp servers to the nsa in a september 2015 interview with michael isikoff fiorina said that in the weeks following the september 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 she received a phone call from michael hayden then the director of the national security agency asking her assistance in providing hp computer servers to the nsa for expanded surveillance70 hayden confirmed that he had made the request for hp servers as part of stellar wind a 2001–2007 nsa warrantless surveillance program but the details were not revealed to fiorina at the time70 fiorina acknowledged she complied with haydens request redirecting trucks of hp computer servers that were on their way to retail stores from a warehouse in tennessee to the washington beltway where they were escorted by nsa security to the agencys fort meade headquarters in 2015 fiorina said i felt it was my duty to help and so we did adding they were ramping up a whole set of programs and needed a lot of data crunching capability to try and monitor a whole set of threats what i knew at the time was our nation had been attacked70 hayden also requested that fiorina provide advice to the agency on how the cia could maintain its undercover espionage mission in a culture of increasing government leaks and demands for greater public accountability and openness according to fiorina she advised the agency to be as transparent as possible about as much as possible70 changes to hp culture fiorinas predecessor at hp had pushed for an outsider to replace him because he believed that the company had become complacent and that consensusdriven decision making was inhibiting the companys growth fiorina instituted three major changes shortly after her arrival replacing profit sharing with bonuses awarded if the company met financial expectations a reduction in operating units from 83 to 12 and consolidating backoffice functions8 fiorina faced a backlash among hp employees and the tech community for her leading role in the demise of hps egalitarian the hp way work culture and guiding philosophy465471 which she felt hindered innovation4672 because of changes to hps culture and requests for voluntary pay cuts to prevent layoffs subsequently followed by the largest layoffs in hps history employee satisfaction surveys at hp—previously among the highest in america—revealed widespread unhappiness and distrust4673 and fiorina was sometimes booed at company meetings and attacked on hps electronic bulletin board46 according to the fiscal times fiorina and others have argued that she laid the groundwork for some of hp’s progress under her successors and that she shook the culture at hp so that it could compete in the internet age74 ipodhp main article ipodhp in january 2004 fiorina announced an agreement with apple founder steve jobs for the ipodhp—a cobranded ipod sold through hps retail channels75 as part of the agreement hp was forbidden from selling a competitor to the ipod until august 2006 and hp agreed to preinstall itunes on every computer sold76 two days before fiorina announced the hpipod jobs announced a new product the ipod mini catching fiorina off guard77 hp did not sell the newer versions of the ipod in a timely fashion leaving them to sell an outdated device for several months in addition apple began selling its own ipods through the same retail channels76 as a result at the peak of the program ipodhp sales represented only a small portion of total ipod sales78 in july 2005 soon after fiorina resigned as ceo her successor mark hurd ended hps agreement with apple within days of taking office79 a highly symbolic decision that was wellreceived as a return to innovation by hp8081 steven levy writing in 2015 on the agreement wrote that steve jobs blithely mugged her and hps shareholders by getting fiorina to adopt the ipod as hps music player jobs had effectively gotten his itunes software installed on millions of computers for free stifled his main competitor and gotten a company that prided itself on invention to declare that apple was a superior inventor and he lost nothing 82 layoffs in january 2001 hp laid off 1700 marketing employees83 in june 2001 fiorina asked employees to either take pay cuts or use their allotted vacation time to cut additional costs resulting in more than 80000 people signing up and saving hp us130 million84 despite these efforts from employees in july fiorina announced that 6000 jobs would be cut the biggest reduction in the companys 64year history8586 but those cuts would not actually occur until after the compaq merger was announced87 in september 2001 fiorina said she intended to cut an additional 15000 jobs in the event of a merger with compaq8588 in all fiorina laid off 30000 us employees689 according to politifact those 30000 layoffs were as a result of the merger with compaq6 by 2004 the number of hp employees was about the same as the premerger total of hp and compaq combined and that 2004 number included roughly 8000 employees of other companies acquired by hp since 200169091 altogether under fiorinas leadership hp had a net gain of employees including employees from mergers as well as hires in countries outside the united states7 in 1999 when fiorina became ceo of hp the company had 84800 employees91 after the merger with compaq the company had a total of 145000 employees worldwide92 at the time of her resignation in 2005 after hp had acquired several other companies hp had about 150000 employees6 forced resignation hps revenue doubled and the rate of patent filings increased due to mergers with compaq and other companies during fiorinas stint as ceo9394 in addition hps cash flow increased by 40 to around 68 billion9596 however the company underperformed by a number of other metrics there were no gains in hps net income despite a 70 gain in net income of the sp 500 over this period93 the companys debt rose from us425 billion to us675 billion93 and its stock price fell by 50 exceeding declines in the sp 500 information technology sector index and the nasdaq9397 by contrast stock prices for ibm and dell fell by 275 and 3 respectively during this time97 the compaq acquisition was not as transformative as fiorina and the board had envisioned in the merger proxy they had forecasted that the pc division of the merged entities would generate an operating margin of 30 in 2003 while the actual figure was 01 in that year and 09 in 20048 in 2004 hp fell dramatically short of its predicted thirdquarter earnings and fiorina fired three executives during a 5 am telephone call46 in early january 2005 the hewlettpackard board of directors discussed with fiorina a list of issues that the board had regarding the companys performance and disappointing earning reports8910 the board proposed a plan to shift her authority to hp division heads which fiorina resisted strongly10 a week after the meeting the confidential plan was leaked to the wall street journal98 according to businessweeks ben elgin directors were also concerned about the boards inability to work effectively with fiorina99 less than a month later the board brought back tom perkins and forced fiorina to resign as chair and chief executive officer of the company100 the companys stock jumped 69 percent on news of her departure adding almost three billion dollars to the value of hp in a single day101102 in her book tough choices she referred to board members behavior as amateurish and immature103 larry sonsini who investigated the leak related to fiorinas forced resignation described the board in his report to fiorina as being dysfunctional103 on may 13 2008 hp under thenchief executive mark hurd confirmed that it had reached a deal to buy electronic data systems the largest since the compaq purchase the price was a reported 126 billion104 at the time of the announcement loren steffy of the houston chronicle suggested that the eds acquisition after fiorinas tenure was evidence that her failed plan to acquire part of pricewaterhouse coopers was justified105 under the companys agreement with fiorina which was characterized as a golden parachute by time magazine106 and yahoo finance107 fiorina received a severance package valued at us21 million which consisted of 25 times her annual salary plus bonus and the balance from accelerated vesting of stock options8108 according to fortune magazine fiorina collected over us100 million in compensation during her short tenure at hp45 business leadership image

in the world today111 and named tenth on the forbes list of the worlds 100 most powerful women112 in 2005 the wall street journal described fiorina as the epitome of an alluring controversial new breed of chief executive officers who combine grand visions with charismatic but selfcentered and demanding styles113 the same year wharton school of business professor michael useem opined fiorina scored high on leadership style but she failed to execute strategy114 following her forced resignation from hp several commentators ranked fiorina as one of the worst american or tech ceos of all time115116117 in 2008 infoworld grouped her with a list of products and ideas that flopped declaring that her tenure as ceo of hp was the sixth worst tech flop of all time and characterizing her as the antisteve jobs for reversing the goodwill of geeks and alienating existing customers118119 during fiorinas tenure as ceo hp leased or purchased five planes including two gulfstream ivs to replace four aging aircraft only one of which had the range to fly overseas120121 one gulfstream iv acquired at a cost of us30 million and available for fiorinas exclusive use122 became a rallying point among hp employees who complained of fiorinas expensive selfpromotion and topdown managerial style during a time of company layoffs885121 jeffrey sonnenfeld of yale school of management said in august 2015 that problems with fiorinas leadership style were what caused hp to lose half its value during her tenure45 others have defended her business leadership decisions and viewed the compaq merger as

revenue service or the state attorney generals charitable trust division which taxexempt charities are required to do a spokeswoman commented that fiorina and her staff believed the foundation was not required to file with the irs because it accepted no outside contributions and donated only her personal wealth to worthy causes146 political career fiorina has never held public office160161162 but said that her status as an outsider is a positive given that in her opinion professional politicians have failed to deliver to the american people160 stating in an interview with fox news in 2015 that

rothenberg pointed out fiorinas downside as a vice president running mate for mccain is rather easy to sketch out because fiorina would become a talking point for democrats who would focus on fiorinas

search of public records indicated fiorina had failed to vote in most elections fiorina responded im a lifelong registered republican but i havent always voted and i will provide no excuse for it you

morning america with george stephanopoulos228 fiorina entered the race with immediate criticism of hillary clinton it was reported that the gop sees fiorina as the tip of the spear in its attack of the clinton campaign because she is uniquely positioned to isolate her criticisms of clinton from claims of gender bias229 shortly after fiorina announced her entry into the 2016 presidential race in a replay of her 2010 senatorial race the social media and editorial outlets questioned her tenure as hps ceo as a basis for her run for president focusing around us job cuts and offshoring that fiorina directed during her tenure at hp and contrasting it with the high compensation bonuses she received from the company230 campaign manager sarah isgur flores deflected the job cut criticism saying fiorina worked hard to save as many jobs as possible231232 on august 6 fiorina participated in fox newss first gop debate failing to qualify for one of the fox news primetime debate slots she

the seventeen republican contenders with 8 of the sampled republican primary voters saying they would support her in a primary or a caucus a gain in support of six points from previous polling data240 the national review pointed out her role as foil to hillary clinton saying carly fiorina is no doubt getting attention because of her unique background but more and more people are staying to listen because she has something fresh to say and that fiorina also seems to relish the role of being the most pointed critic of hillary clinton… she contrasts her background as a problem solver with clintons record as a professional politician241 the nation commented with socalled womens issues poised to play an unprecedented role in the upcoming election republicans need someone who can troll hillary clinton without seeming sexist242 while noting she was named the most powerful woman in business by fortune magazine in 1998 steve deace of the conservative review stated fiorina is a cross between carson and trump she has some of carsons inspirational biography and some of trumps business acumenresume243 meg whitman the current ceo of hewlett packard stated that in her opinion fiorina was not qualified to be president of the united states stating that a business background is important but that having worked in government is also important and that its very difficult for your first role in politics to be president of the united states244245 as part of her financial disclosures related to her candidacy fiorina reported a net worth of us59 million with us12 million in income in 2013246247 international business times estimates fiorinas net worth between us30 million and us120 million248 her performances in early debates for the republican primary nomination particularly her rebukes of frontrunner donald trump in the september 16 2015 debate earned her a significant spike in the polls from 3 to 15 postdebate249250251 but her polling numbers dropped to 4 by october252 and to 3 in december253254 on february 10 due to weak results in iowa and new hampshire fiorina announced that her campaign was suspended255 on march 9 2016 fiorina endorsed texas senator ted cruz for president saying she was horrified by donald trump and that cruz was the only candidate that could stop him256 vice presidential campaign on april 27 2016 cruz announced that if he were selected as

candidacy the shortest in modern american history259 fiorina received one electoral college vote for vice president from a faithless elector in texas260 political positions main article carly fiorina presidential campaign 2016 § political positions this article may require cleanup to meet wikipedias quality standards the specific problem is the article now gives undue weight to her political positions she has never held political office and is no longer a candidate this section should be greatly condensed as it is redundant with the article on her presidential campaign please help improve this article if you can february 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message abortion fiorina describes herself as prolife261 and has expressed support for legislation to ban abortions 20 weeks after fertilization with an exception for cases of rape incest or danger to the life of the mother262 fiorina supports overturning roe v wade the 1973 supreme court ruling that legalized abortion in the united states262 fiorina supports eliminating federal funding for planned parenthood261263 although federal funding for abortions is mostly banned263264 in august 2015 fiorina called upon republicans in congress to shut down the government in order to strip planned parenthood of federal funding265 in a september 2015 appearance on meet the press fiorina backed away from this stance saying that she was open to a government shutdown if it would make president barack obama and the democratic party defend the butchery of planned parenthood but that i believe there are a variety of ways to deal with this265 the national right to life committee the susan b anthony list and the california prolife council all endorsed fiorinas 2010 us senate campaign in california266 in a september 2015 republican presidential candidates debate on cnn fiorina was harshly critical of the planned parenthood organization for their involvement in fetal tissue donation267268269 referencing videotapes made public by the antiabortion group center for medical progress cmp she stated i dare hillary clinton barack obama to watch these tapes watch a fully formed fetus on the table its heart beating its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain267 the videos mostly contain secretly taped conversations between planned parenthood employees and individuals posing as tissue brokers interested in purchasing fetal tissue for medical research according to politifact however the video footage fiorina referred to was not obtained from a planned parenthood clinic it was stock footage of an unrelated live fetus obtained from the grantham collection an organization that hopes to stem abortion by promoting graphic images of the procedure it was then added by cmp to dramatize the description by stemexpress procurement technician holly odonnell in the edited video odonnell alleged that while she was working in a pathology lab at a planned parenthood clinic her supervisor told her that they would procure a brain from a well preserved fetus odonnell said im sitting here looking at this fetus and its heart is beating and i dont know what to think267 according to the wall street journal there was never any video that depicted as ms fiorina stated a live fetus on a table being prepared for organ harvesting270 the new york times reported that while the authenticity of the videos remains a subject of debate mrs fiorina appears to have exaggerated their contents271 and politifact said fiorina makes it sound as if the footage shows what planned parenthood is alleged to have done in fact the stock footage was added to the video to dramatize its content we rate her statement mostly false267 a grand jury later concluded that planned parenthood had not committed any wrongdoing and instead charged two of the activists who made the video with a felony tampering with a government record despite this fiorina held her stance asserting that planned parenthood was purposely harvesting body parts for profit272 in response to some elements of the media coverage of a november 2015 shooting incident at a planned parenthood abortion clinic in colorado springs colorado fiorina said that the linking by the media of the shooting to prolife proponents273 and the demonizing by some in the media of opponents of abortion for opposing what she calls the sale of body parts from aborted fetuses was typical leftwing tactics274 climate change in a february 2015 speech fiorina acknowledged the scientific consensus that climate change is real and caused by human activity262 but expressed skepticism that government can affect the issue262275 and has implied that targeting the coal industry will not solve the problem262 on april 4 2015 fiorina spoke about how california has fared in the 2012–15 north american drought stating that liberal environmentalists have brought what she described as a tragedy and that california is an example of liberals being willing to sacrifice other peoples lives and livelihoods at the altar of their ideology276 drugs fiorina said in may 2015 that drug addiction shouldnt be criminalized and cited decriminalizing drug addiction and drug use as an example of a successful reform277 fiorina opposes legalization of marijuana but says that she believes in states rights and that as president she will not enforce the federal ban on marijuana in colorado where voters have legalized marijuana as a matter of state law278 in the second republican presidential debate on september 16 2015 fiorina responded to a question about enforcing federal laws against marijuana by stating that we should invest more in substance abuse treatment and that she had buried a child to drug addiction referring to her stepdaughter lori who died at age 35 after struggling with alcohol prescription drugs addiction and bulimia277279280281 education while running for president fiorina has been a critic of the common core state standards calling them a heavyhanded and standardized example of washington bureaucracy in may 2015282283 in september 2015 fiorina said no child left behind race to the top common core — they’re all big bureaucratic programs that are failing our nation284 this was a reversal of her position on federal education policies during her 2010 campaign for us senate from california284285 in that campaign fiorina issued a position paper in which she strongly advocated for metricbased accountability in schools and praised no child left behind as setting high standards and race to the top for using internationallybenchmarked measures262 also in 2010 fiorina supported a voucher program for the areas or neighborhoods or student populations most in need286 in 2015 fiorina wrote that she supported a school choice or voucher program for all students283 fiorina said at the 2015 conservative political action conference that president obamas proposal for free community college was intended to distract us from the fact that we have too many failing high schools286 at a may 2015 event fiorina asserted that the federal government in the last several years under the obama administration has nationalized the student loan industry287 the annenberg public policy centers factcheckorg stated that fiorina gave a misleading description since private and federal student loans are available now just as they were in the past287 foreign and military policy fiorina has criticized the international nuclear agreement with iran saying that iran is at the heart of evil in the middle east288 that the agreement is a flawed deal289 and that there is a lot of reason to be suspicious of it290 fiorina said that it would be different if iran was a good actor and had negotiated in good faith all this time but they havent and said if you want a good deal youve got to walk away sometimes we never did290 fiorina also suggested that verification provisions in the agreement were insufficient and that approval of the agreement by the international community and the uss negotiating partners was suspect because russia and china have an interest in gaining access to irans economy and the european union has negotiated frankly a number of weak deals290 speaking on russiaus relations and the ukraine crisis during her 2015 campaign fiorina said that if president i wouldnt talk to him russian president vladimir putin at all291 instead she would arm ukraine conduct regular aggressive military exercises in the baltic states begin rebuilding the sixth fleet begin rebuilding the missile defense program in poland and probably send a few thousand more troops into germany to send a very clear message to vladimir putin292293 fiorina has also expressed support for an additional 50 army brigades 36 marine battalions between 300 and 350 naval ships and an upgrade of every leg of the nuclear triad294 this proposed military buildup would be an increase of more than us500 billion excluding a nuclear arsenal overhaul which would cost some additional sum of money over existing planned defense spending of us5 trillion over the next decade294 fiorina opposes the normalization of uscuba relations telling hugh hewitt that if elected she would close the us embassy in havana295 in a january 2015 discussion with an iowa political blogger fiorina said of the chinese theyre not terribly imaginative they’re not entrepreneurial they dont innovate thats why theyre stealing our intellectual property296 at a forum at the citadel in september 2015 fiorina said that if president she would cancel a scheduled state dinner during a visit by chinese president xi jinping and instead would confront the leader on chinese hacking id have a long conversation in the oval office to say understand there will be consequences we will retaliate we consider this an act of aggression297 fiorina did not give specifics on what type of retaliatory measures she would favor if elected president297 fiorina supports keeping the guantanamo bay detention camp in cuba open297 in september 2015 fiorina offered a vigorous defense of cia waterboarding a tactic used by the united states during the george w bushera war on terror70 fiorina rejected the conclusions of the senate intelligence committee study of the cias detention and interrogation program publicly released in 2014 which portrayed waterboarding as near drownings that were tantamount to torture and concluded that the agencys often brutal interrogations produced little actionable intelligence70 fiorina called the report disingenuous and a shame and said that i believe that all of the evidence is very clear — that waterboarding was used in a very small handful of cases and was supervised by medical personnel in every one of those cases and i also believe that waterboarding was used when there was no other way to get information that was necessary70 health care fiorina was critical of the affordable care act aca health care reform legislation during the debate in 2009 that led to the acts passage298 fiorina has supported repealing the aca during both her 2010 senate run in california299300 and in her 2015 presidential campaign301302 fiorina has called the law deeply flawed303 and a vast legislative overreach301 in a 2013 appearance on crossfire fiorina called the law an abomination but said that she supported the laws requirement that individuals obtain health insurance and the laws prohibition on health insurance companies denying coverage on the basis of a policyholders preexisting condition304 fiorina supports a mandate that would require individuals to carry highdeductible catastrophic care insurance plans and use federal dollars to subsidize statebased highrisk pools to provide care for those who otherwise cannot afford it304 according to a campaign spokeswoman fiorinas support for an individual mandate differs from obamacare in that the laws mandate demands that every american be covered with plans that include a higher threshold of services304 when the act went into effect it effectively banned many such highdeductible plans and required that every american buy health insurance or face a financial penalty304 her spokeswoman said fiorinas plan is set up a little like auto damage liability insurance – aimed at reducing taxpayer costs of unexpected er visits adding not what obamacare required which is actually high end insurance coverage304 fiorina has opposed obamacares provision mandating coverage of birth control without a copay305 she supports the supreme courts ruling in burwell v hobby lobby stores inc305 which permitted employers to deny their employees health insurance coverage for birth control306 and has said we are not waging a war on women simply because we believe there is no good reason for birth control to be free306 she has expressed support however for making birth control available overthecounter307 in 2010 fiorina said that she opposed the aca provision requiring insurance companies to cover children on their parents plan until the age of 26308 believing that this mandate is unnecessary and may undermine personal responsibility309 fiorina criticized the us supreme courts decision upholding the aca in king v burwell calling it outrageous303 fiorina has proposed establishing federally subsidized but staterun highrisk pools to help those who are truly needy302304 in 2010 and 2015 fiorina called for making the health insurance market more competitive although she has not provided specifics262299 referring to childhood vaccinations fiorina has said when in doubt it is always the parents choice310 she has defended the right of school districts to require that children be vaccinated against common communicable diseases but said that districts should not be permitted to require that children receive some of these more esoteric immunizations in order to attend public schools310 in 2010 fiorina said that she was all for allowing the importation of prescription drugs to the us from canada309 in 2011 fiorina joined the advisory board of foundation for health coverage education a group which assists americans with identifying health coverage options through simplified eligibility information the group which fiorina promoted in her 2013 cnn appearance assisted americans in signing up for health coverage though healthcaregov311 immigration in california fiorina supported the dream act which would allow children brought to the us by their parents when they were under the age of 16 to secure permanent us residency and a path to citizenship if they graduate from college or serve in the armed forces262275312 in a may 2015 interview with katie couric fiorina said that she does not support a path for citizenship for those who came here illegally and who have stayed here illegally312 fiorina drew a distinction between people in that category and those who came legally but overstayed their visas312 fiorina has stressed the need to improve border security before undertaking comprehensive immigration reform275312 lgbt issues in november 2009 during a wall street journal interview fiorina said that she voted in favor of proposition 8 a california ballot proposition that banned samesex marriage in that state during the 2010 united states senate election in california fiorina was endorsed by goproud a gay conservative organization313 in 2010 while answering a christian coalition questionnaire fiorina said that she supported a federal constitutional amendment banning samesex marriage314 during an interview with the conservative christian website caffeinated thoughts at a dallas county iowa republican event in may 2015 fiorina reversed her previous position saying that she now opposed such a measure i think the supreme court ruling will become the law of the land and however much i may agree or disagree with it i wouldnt support an amendment to reverse it314315 she further stated that government shouldnt discriminate on how it provides benefits and people have a right to their religious views and those views need to be protected315 in august 2010 fiorina indicated on a christian coalition questionnaire that she opposed enforcing the 1993 law banning homosexuals in the military316317 in 2010 fiorina stated that she supported the defense of marriage act but also supported civil unions318 in 2015 fiorina reaffirmed her support for civil unions and stated that those in such unions should receive the same government benefits accorded to married persons319 on september 19 2010 in a faith2action survey she opposed the employment nondiscrimination act316 on march 17 2013 on abc news fiorina said i think we have to be careful because john boehners views which are different from rob portmans views are equally sincere and i think when we get into trouble on this debate when we assume that people who support gay marriage are open and compassionate and people who dont are not its why i believe the right way to solve these very personal issues is to let people vote on them dont have judges decide it dont even have representative government decide it let people vote on it in the states i think people of both points of view accept the democratic process what they dont always accept is a bunch of selfimportant selfappointed judges saying this is culturally the new norm320 in april 2015 fiorina defended indianas religious freedom restoration act in an interview with usa today she said i honestly believe this is a set of liberal political activists who practice a game of identity politics and divisive politics to whip people into a frenzy and i think its very destructive to the fabric of this country she blasted business leaders in silicon valley and elsewhere who have criticized the indiana law as discriminatory questioning why there isnt similar outrage in the twitterverse about the subjugation of the rights of women and gays in many countries in which these companies do business where is the outrage about that where is the outrage about how gays are treated in iran for example where is the outrage about how women are treated in algeria321 during an april 2015 interview with abc news fiorina stated i think its really too bad honestly that ceos are being pressured what this law basically says is that a person can push back against either federal government mandate or state government mandate to exert their religious liberties322 in june 2015 as a response to the us supreme courts decision in obergefell v hodges which held that there is a fundamental right to samesex marriage under the fourteenth amendment fiorina said the decision was only the latest example of an activist court i do not agree that the court can or should redefine marriage i believe that responsibility should have remained with states and voters where this conversation has continued in churches town halls and living rooms around the country323 maternity leave fiorina believes employers should decide whether they should provide paid maternity leave to their employees and it should not be mandated by the government noting that some companies in the private sector such as netflix are already doing so to attract talent324325 she also pointed out that hp while she was ceo offered paid maternity leave voluntarily324 minimum wage fiorina has stated that there is no constitutional role for the federal government to be setting minimum wages326327 and that the minimum wage is a classic example of a policy that is best carried out in the states because economic conditions in new hampshire vary significantly from more expensive economic conditions in los angeles or new york328 florina also believes that raising the federal minimum wage would hurt those who are looking for entrylevel jobs275 net neutrality fiorina opposes net neutrality rules adopted by the federal communications commission fcc and has said she would roll back that policy regulation over innovation is a really bad role for government262329330 fiorina has repeatedly criticized the rules arguing that the fcc just issued—without anyone commenting on it or anyone voting on it—400 pages of new regulations over the internet its not good its not helpful331 the text contains a large number of footnotes which often address comments made by the general public and includes 87 pages of comments by the fcc commissioners331 government regulation fiorina generally believes that reducing government regulations helps to spur the economy275 she has condemned the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act saying in april 2015 that we should get rid of doddfrank and start again332 fiorina has been questioned by some in the media for stating that not a single regulation has ever been repealed333 glenn kessler of the washington post said that important parts of the economy have been deregulated in recent decades while the repeal of a specific rule is relatively rare there are certainly examples333 susan e dudley director of the regulatory studies center at george washington university however said that fiorina is generally right that regulations once issued are rarely revisited and even more rarely actually repealed333 taxes and spending fiorina favors lowering tax rates simplifying the tax code and closing loopholes that she says mostly benefit wealthy taxpayers334335 florina has said the government needs to take in less tax money not more336 fiorina has said innovation and entrepreneurship is crushed by the crushing load of a 73000page tax code according to npr fiorina was likely referring to the privately published cch standard federal tax reporter which includes proposed regulations and other materials that are not part of the tax code the tax code as published by the internal revenue service is 6500 pages337338 during her 2010 senate campaign fiorina called for eliminating the estate tax and capital gains taxes for investments in small businesses and lowering marginal tax rates275 fiorina opposes proposals to increase the federal gas tax or state gas taxes in order to fund the highway trust fund asserting in a february 2015 wall street journal oped that any gas tax hike big or small will harm american families and hurt economic growth339 fiorina opposed the federal stimulus package of 2009 intended to create shortterm job growth and invest in infrastructure education health and renewable energy calling it a waste of taxpayer money275 fiorina has said she would cut the pay of federal workers and base their compensation on performance275 she also advocates zerobased budgeting for the federal budget which would start the annual budgeting process for each department from a baseline of zero334 technology employees fiorina favors expanding the h1b visa program340341342343 writing in opposition to proposals she considered protectionist in a 2004 wall street journal oped fiorina said that while america is the most innovative country it would not remain so if the country were to run away from the reality of the global economy344 fiorina said to congress in 2004 there is no job that is americas godgiven right anymore we have to compete for jobs as a nation341 while fiorina argued that the only way to protect us hightech jobs over the long haul was to become more competitive in the united states her comments prompted strong reactions from some technology workers who argued that lower wages outside the united states encouraged the offshoring of american jobs345 personal life fiorina then cara carleton sneed married todd bartlem a stanford classmate in june 1977 they divorced in 1984346 in 1981 she was introduced to att executive frank fiorina347 who told her on their third date that she would one day be running the company348 she married him in 1985 it was the second marriage for both fiorina has said that they wanted to have children together but that wasnt gods plan349350351 frank fiorina took early retirement from att in 1998348 at age 48 to travel with and support his wife in her career352 frank fiorina had two daughters traci and lori ann from his first marriage their mother patricia was awarded custody of both children following the divorce353 fiorina helped her husband with raising his daughters lori ann struggled with alcoholism prescription drug addiction and bulimia she died in 2009 at age 35277280 in february 2009 fiorina was diagnosed with stage ii breast cancer she underwent a double mastectomy354355 at stanford hospital in march 2009 followed by chemotherapy which caused her to temporarily lose her hair and later radiation therapy356 she was given an excellent prognosis for a full recovery357358 in late 2009 during her campaign for the united states senate seat held by barbara boxer fiorina humorously told a group of supporters i have to say that after chemotherapy barbara boxer just isnt that scary anymore359 according to the financial disclosures filed by fiorinas campaign in june 2015 she and her husband have a combined net worth of 59 million360 fiorina has released the income tax returns that she and her husband jointly filed in 2013 and 2012 in those years the fiorinas reported income of almost 2 million and 13 million respectively360 fiorina and her husband live in a home in the washington dc suburb of mason neck virginia overlooking the potomac river361362 the house and grounds were valued at 66 million in 2015360
