airplanes it is the worlds largest twinjet and has a typical seating capacity of 314 to 396 passengers with a range of 5240 to 8555 nautical miles 9704 to 15844 km commonly referred to as the triple seven34 its distinguishing features include the largestdiameter turbofan engines of any aircraft six wheels on each main landing gear fully circular fuselage crosssection5 and a bladeshaped tail cone6 developed in consultation with eight major airlines the 777 was designed to replace older widebody airliners and bridge the capacity difference between boeings 767 and 747 as boeings first flybywire airliner it has computermediated controls it was also the first commercial aircraft to be designed entirely with computeraided design the 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths as of 2017update the original 777200 variant entered commercial service in 1995 followed by the extendedrange 777200er in 1997 the stretched 777300 which is 3325 ft 101 m longer followed in 1998 the initial 777200 200er and 300 versions are equipped with general electric ge90 pratt whitney pw4000 or rollsroyce trent 800 engines the extendedrange 777300er and ultra longrange 777200lr variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively while the 777f a freighter version debuted in february 2009 these variants all feature highoutput ge90 engines and extended raked wingtips the 777200lr is one of the worlds longestrange airliners able to fly more than halfway around the globe and holds the record for the longest distance flown nonstop by a commercial aircraft78 the 777 first entered commercial service with united airlines on june 7 1995 it has received more orders than any other widebody airliner as of september 2017 60 customers had placed orders for 1945 aircraft of all variants with 1518 delivered1 the most common and successful variant is the 777300er9 with 758 delivered and 829 orders1 emirates operates the largest 777 fleet with 161 passenger and freighter aircraft as of july 201710 the 777 has been involved in six hull losses as of october 2016 the asiana airlines flight 214 accident in july 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of service the 777 ranks as one of boeings bestselling models airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively fuelefficient alternative to other widebody jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on longhaul transoceanic routes direct market competitors include the airbus a330300 the airbus a350 xwb and the outofproduction a340 and mcdonnell douglas md11 the 787 dreamliner which entered service in 2011 shares design features and a common type rating for pilots with the 777 in november 2013 boeing announced the development of upgraded 7778 and 7779 variants collectively named 777x featuring composite wings and

generation of widebody passenger airliners to enter service11 in 1978 boeing unveiled three new models the twinengine boeing 757 to replace its 727 the twinengine 767 to challenge the airbus a300 and a trijet 777 concept to compete with the dc10 and l1011121314 the midsize 757 and 767 launched to market success due in part to 1980s extendedrange twinengine operational performance standards etops regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations15 these regulations allowed twinengine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours distance from emergency diversionary airports16 under etops rules airlines began operating the 767 on longdistance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners15 the trijet 777 was later dropped following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants17 boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the 767300er and the 74740018 by the late 1980s dc10 and l1011 models were approaching retirement age prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs19 mcdonnell douglas was working on the md11 a stretched and upgraded successor of the dc1019 while airbus was developing its a330 and a34019 in 1986 boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767 tentatively named 767x20 to target the replacement market for firstgeneration widebodies such as the dc1016 and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup21 the initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 76720 along with winglets22 later plans expanded the fuselage crosssection but retained the existing 767 flight deck nose and other elements20 airline customers were uninterested in the 767x proposals and instead wanted an even wider fuselage crosssection fully flexible interior configurations short to intercontinentalrange capability and a operating cost lower than any 767 stretch16 airline planners requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific adding to the heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers19 by 1988 boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean–sheet design which became the 777 twinjet23 the company opted for the twinengine configuration given past design successes projected engine developments and reducedcost benefits24 on december 8 1989 boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 77720 design effort glass cockpit of a transaero airlines 777200er the design phase for the new twinjet was different from boeings previous commercial jetliners for the first time eight major airlines – all nippon airways american airlines british airways cathay pacific delta air lines japan airlines qantas and united airlines – had a role in the development25 this was a departure from industry practice where manufacturers typically designed aircraft with minimal customer input13 the eight airlines that contributed to the design process became known within boeing as the working together group25 at the first group meeting in january 1990 a 23page questionnaire was distributed to the airlines asking what each wanted in the design16 by march 1990 boeing and the airlines had decided upon a basic design configuration a cabin crosssection close to the 747s capacity up to 325 passengers flexible interiors a glass cockpit flybywire controls and 10 percent better seatmile costs than the a330 and md1116 boeing selected its everett factory in washington home of 747 production as the 777s final assembly site26 on october 14 1990 united airlines became the 777s launch customer when it placed an order for 34 pratt whitneypowered aircraft valued at us11 billion with options on an additional 342728 the development phase coincided with uniteds replacement program for its aging dc10s29 united required that the new aircraft be capable of flying three different routes chicago to hawaii chicago to europe and nonstop from denver a hot and high airport to hawaii29 etops certification was also a priority for united30 given the overwater portion of uniteds hawaii routes27 in january 1993 a team of united developers joined other airline teams and boeing designers at the everett factory31 the 240 design teams with up to 40 members each addressed almost 1500 design issues with individual aircraft components32 the fuselage diameter was increased to suit cathay pacific the baseline model grew longer for all nippon airways and british airways input led to added builtin testing and interior flexibility16 along with higher operating weight options33 the 777 was the first commercial aircraft designed entirely by computer212734 each design drawing was created on a threedimensional cad software system known as catia sourced from dassault systemes and ibm35 this lets engineers assemble a virtual aircraft in simulation to check for interference and verify that the thousands of parts fit properly—thus reducing costly rework36 boeing developed its own highperformance visualization system flythru later called ivt integrated visualization tool to support largescale collaborative engineering design reviews production illustrations and other uses of the cad data outside of engineering37 boeing was initially not convinced of catias abilities and built a physical mockup of the nose section to verify its results the test was so successful that additional mockups were canceled38 production and testing the production process included substantial international content an unprecedented level of global subcontracting for a boeing jetliner39 later exceeded by the 78740 international contributors included mitsubishi heavy industries and kawasaki heavy industries fuselage panels41 fuji heavy industries ltd center wing section41 hawker de havilland elevators and aerospace technologies of australia rudder42 an agreement between boeing and the japan aircraft development corporation representing japanese aerospace contractors made the latter risksharing partners for 20 percent of the entire development program39 the initial 777200 model was launched with propulsion options from three manufacturers general electric pratt whitney and rollsroyce43 giving the airlines their choice of engines from competing firms44 each manufacturer agreed to develop an engine in the 77000 lbf 340 kn and higher thrust class a measure of jet engine output for the worlds largest twinjet43 pratt whitney pw4000 rollsroyce trent 800 general electric ge90 thrust reverser deployed to accommodate production of its new airliner boeing doubled the size of the everett factory at the cost of nearly us15 billion27 to provide space for two new assembly lines29 new production methodologies were developed including a turn machine that could rotate fuselage subassemblies 180 degrees giving workers access to upper body sections35 major assembly of the first aircraft began on january 4 199345 by the start of production the program had amassed 118 firm orders with options for 95 more from 10 airlines46 total investment in the program was estimated at over us4 billion from boeing with an additional us2 billion from suppliers47 on april 9 1994 the first 777 line number wa001 was rolled out in a series of 15 ceremonies held during the day to accommodate the 100000 invited guests48 the first flight took place on june 12 199449 under the command of chief test pilot john e cashman50 this marked the start of an 11month flight test program that was more extensive than testing for any previous boeing model51 nine aircraft fitted with general electric pratt whitney and rollsroyce engines49 were flight tested at locations ranging from the desert airfield at edwards air force base in california52 to frigid conditions in alaska mainly fairbanks international airport53 to satisfy etops requirements eight 180minute singleengine test flights were performed54 the first aircraft built was used by boeings nondestructive testing campaign from 1994 to 1996 and provided data for the 200er and 300 programs55 at the successful conclusion of flight testing the 777 was awarded simultaneous airworthiness certification by the us federal aviation administration faa and european joint aviation authorities jaa on april 19 199549 boeing 777 n777ua56 which served in the 777 flight test program and became the first 777200 in service with united airlines taking off from amsterdam airport schiphol in 2005 entry into service boeing delivered the first 777 to united airlines on may 15 19955758 the faa awarded 180minute etops clearance etops180 for the pratt whitney pw4084engined aircraft on may 30 1995 making it the first airliner to carry an etops180 rating at its entry into service59 the first commercial flight took place on june 7 1995 from london heathrow airport to dulles international airport near washington dc60 longer etops clearance of 207 minutes was approved in october 199661 on november 12 1995 boeing delivered the first model with general electric ge9077b engines to british airways62 which entered service five days later63 initial service was affected by gearbox bearing wear issues which caused british airways to temporarily withdraw its 777 fleet from transatlantic service in 199763 returning to full service later that year52 general electric subsequently announced engine upgrades52 the first rollsroyce trent 877powered aircraft was delivered to thai airways international on march 31 199662 completing the introduction of the three powerplants initially developed for the airliner64 each engineaircraft combination had secured etops180 certification from the point of entry into service65 by june 1997 orders for the 777 numbered 323 from 25 airlines including satisfied launch customers that had ordered additional aircraft49 operations performance data established the consistent capabilities of the twinjet over longhaul transoceanic routes leading to additional sales66 by 1998 the 777 fleet had approached 900000 flight hours67 boeing states that the 777 fleet has a dispatch reliability rate of departure from the gate with no more than 15 minutes delay due to technical issues above 99 percent68697071 initial derivatives air new zealand 777200er on final approach after the original model boeing developed an increased gross weight variant of the 777200 with greater range and payload capability72 initially named 777200igw73 the 777200er first flew on october 7 199674 received faa and jaa certification on january 17 199775 and entered service with british airways on february 9 199775 offering greater longhaul performance the variant became the most widely ordered version of the aircraft through the early 2000s72 on april 2 1997 a malaysia airlines 200er named super ranger broke the great circle distance without landing record for an airliner by flying eastward from boeing field seattle to kuala lumpur a distance of 10823 nautical miles 20044 km in 21 hours and 23 minutes67 following the introduction of the 200er boeing turned its attention to a stretched version of the airliner on october 16 1997 the 777300 made its first flight74 at 2424 ft 739 m in length the 300 became the longest airliner yet produced until the a340600 and had a 20 percent greater overall capacity than the standard length model76 the 300 was awarded type certification simultaneously from the faa and jaa on may 4 199877 and entered service with launch customer cathay pacific on may 27 19987478 longerrange models ge90 engine mounted on a 777300er with a boeing engineer to show the engines size a single ge90 engine has powered the ge test 747 during level flight79 from the programs start boeing had considered building ultralongrange variants80 early plans centered on a 777100x proposal81 a shortened variant of the 200 with reduced weight and increased range81 similar to the 747sp82 however the 100x would have carried fewer passengers than the 200 while having similar operating costs leading to a higher cost per seat8182 by the late 1990s design plans shifted to longerrange versions of existing models81 in march 1997 the boeing board approved the 777200x300x specifications 298 passengers in three classes over 8600 nmi 15900 km for the 200x and 6600 nmi 12200 km with 355 passengers in a triclass layout for the 300x with design freeze planned in may 1998 200x certification in august 2000 and introduction in september and in january 2001 for the 300x83 a more powerful engine in the 100000 lbf 440 kn and higher thrust class was required leading to talks between boeing and engine manufacturers general electric offered to develop the ge90115b engine44 while rollsroyce proposed developing the trent 8104 engine84 in 1999 boeing announced an agreement with general electric beating out rival proposals44 under the deal with general electric boeing agreed to only offer ge90 engines on new 777 versions44 on february 29 2000 boeing launched its nextgeneration twinjet program85 initially called 777x80 and began issuing offers to airlines72 development was slowed by an industry downturn during the early 2000s74 the first model to emerge from the program the 777300er was launched with an order for ten aircraft from air france86 along with additional commitments72 on february 24 2003 the 300er made its first flight and the faa and easa european aviation safety agency successor to the jaa certified the model on march 16 200487 the first delivery to air france took place on april 29 200474 the 300er which combined the 300s added capacity with the 200ers range became the topselling 777 variant in the late 2000s88 benefitting as airlines replaced comparable fourengine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs89 the second longrange model the 777200lr rolled out on february 15 2005 and completed its first flight on march 8 200574 the 200lr was certified by both the faa and easa on february 2 200690 and the first delivery to pakistan international airlines occurred on february 26 200691 on november 10 2005 the first 200lr set a record for the longest nonstop flight of a passenger airliner by flying 11664 nautical miles 21602 km eastward from hong kong to london8 lasting 22 hours and 42 minutes the flight surpassed the 200lrs standard design range and was logged in the guinness world records7 the production freighter model the 777f rolled out on may 23 200892 the maiden flight of the 777f which used the structural design and engine specifications of the 200lr93 along with fuel tanks derived from the 300er occurred on july 14 200894 faa and easa type certification for the freighter was received on february 6 200995 and the first delivery to launch customer air france took place on february 19 20099697 updates and improvements in late 2011 the faa assigned a common type rating to the 787 and 777 allowing pilots qualified on either aircraft to operate both models due to related design features98 the smaller 787 was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the boeing yellowstone project99 reportedly the 777 could eventually be replaced by a new aircraft family yellowstone 3 which would draw upon technologies from the 787100 all nippon airways 777300er taking off by the late 2000s the 777 was facing increased potential competition from airbus planned a350 xwb and internally from proposed 787 variants100 both airliners that promise fuel efficiency improvements as a consequence the 777300er received an engine and aerodynamics improvement package for reduced drag and weight101 in 2010 the variant further received a 5000 lb 2300 kg maximum zerofuel weight increase equivalent to a higher payload of 20–25 passengers its ge90115b1 engines received a 1–25 percent thrust enhancement for increased takeoff weights at higheraltitude airports101 more changes were targeted for late 2012 including possible extension of the wingspan101 along with other major changes including a composite wing new powerplant and different fuselage lengths101102103 emirates was reportedly working closely with boeing on the project possibly being the launch customer for new 777 versions104 china airlines ordered ten 777300er aircraft to replace 747400s on routes between taipei and los angeles and new york city telling aviation week and space technology that the 777300ers per seat cost is about 20 lower than the 747s costs varying due to fuel prices105 four of the 777 aircraft were already flying as of february 2015 boeing has worked with general electric to offer a 2 improvement in fuel efficiency to new aircraft beginning in 2016 ge will improve the fan module and the high pressure compressor stage1 blisk in the ge90115 turbofan as well as reduce clearances between the tips of the turbine blades and the shroud during cruise these improvements of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the 787 will ge says lower fuel burn by 05 boeings wing modification will deliver the remainder boeing stated that every 1 improvement in the 777300ers fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another 75 nautical miles on the same load of fuel or add ten passengers or 2400 lb of cargo to a load limited flight106 in march 2015 additional details of the improvement package were published in aviation week space technology the 777300er is to shed 1800 lb boeing will replace the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels similar to those used on the 787 new flight control software is to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless of the extent to which pilots command the elevators boeing is also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing the outboard raked wingtip is to have a divergent trailing edge described as apoor mans airfoil by boeing this originally developed for the mcdonnell douglas md12 project another change involves elevator trim bias these changes are to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5107 production initially second to the 747 as boeings most profitable jetliner108 the 777 became the companys most lucrative model in the 2000s109 program sales accounted for an estimated us400 million of boeings pretax earnings in 2000 us50 million more than the 747108 by 2004 the airliner comprised the bulk of widebody revenues for the boeing commercial airplanes division110 in 2007 orders for secondgeneration 777 models approached 350 aircraft100 and in november of that year boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 201289 the program backlog of 356 orders was valued at us95 billion at list prices in 2008111 an air india boeing 777200lr is rolled out at the boeing everett factory in 2010 boeing announced plans to increase production from 5 aircraft per month to 7 aircraft per month by mid2011 and 83 per month by early 2013112 complete assembly of each 777300er requires 49 days113 in november 2011 assembly began on the 1000th 777 a 300er model for emirates113 which was rolled out in march 2012114 by april 2014 with cumulative sales surpassing those of the 747 the 777 became the bestselling widebody airliner at existing production rates the aircraft was on track to become the mostdelivered widebody airliner by mid2016115 mindful of the long time required to bring the 777x to the market boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency as well as lower prices for the existing product as of february 2015 the backlog of undelivered 777s totals 278 aircraft representing just under three years of current production at 83 aircraft per month116 causing boeing to ponder the 20182020 time frame in january 2015 united airlines ordered 10 boeing 777300ers normally costing around 150 million each but paid around 130 million a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777x117 in january 2016 boeing confirmed plans to reduce the production rate of the 777 family from 83 per month to 7 per month in 2017 to help close the production gap between the 777 and 777x created by a lack of new orders118 in 2018 assembling test 7779 aircraft is expected to lower output to an effective rate of 55 per month119 boeing will drop 777 production to five per month in august 2017120 777x program main article boeing 777x launched in november 2013 the under development 777x will be reengined with new ge9x turbofanss will have a new carbon fiber wings with folding wingtips and a denser cabin the longer 7779 seating 414 over 7600 nmi 14075 km should fly in the first quarter of 2019 and be delivered from december 2019 while the shorter 7778 would seat 365 over 8700 nmi 16110 km design engines extended slats flaps and landing gear of an american airlines 777200er boeing introduced a number of advanced technologies with the 777 design including fully digital flybywire controls121 fully softwareconfigurable avionics honeywell lcd glass cockpit flight displays122 and the first use of a fiber optic avionics network on a commercial airliner123 boeing made use of work done on the cancelled boeing 7j7 regional jet124 which utilized similar versions of the chosen technologies124 in 2003 boeing began offering the option of cockpit electronic flight bag computer displays125 in 2013 boeing announced that the upgraded 777x models would incorporate airframe systems and interior technologies from the 787126 flybywire in designing the 777 as its first flybywire commercial aircraft boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many flybywire fighter aircraft and in many airbus airliners121 along with traditional yoke and rudder controls the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous boeing models127 the flybywire system also incorporates flight envelope protection a system that guides pilot inputs within a computercalculated framework of operating parameters acting to prevent stalls overspeeds and excessively stressful maneuvers121 this system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary121 the flybywire system is supplemented by mechanical backup128 airframe and systems planform view of a boeing 777200er the wings on the 777 feature a supercritical airfoil design that is swept back at 316 degrees and optimized for cruising at mach 083 revised upward after flight tests to mach 084129 the wings are designed with increased thickness and a longer span than previous airliners resulting in greater payload and range improved takeoff performance and a higher cruising altitude49 the wings also serve as fuel storage with longerrange models able to carry up to 47890 us gallons 181300 l of fuel130 this capacity allows the 777200lr to operate ultralongdistance transpolar routes such as toronto to hong kong131 in 2013 a new wing made of composite materials was introduced for the upgraded 777x with a wider span and design features based on the 787s wings126 unlike smaller airliners like the boeing 737 no current 777 wings have winglets instead the exceptionally long raked wings of the 777 serve the same dragreducing function large folding wingtips 21 feet 640 m long were offered when the 777 was first launched to appeal to airlines who might use gates made to accommodate smaller aircraft but no airline purchased this option132 folding wingtips reemerged as a design feature at the announcement of the upgraded 777x in 2013 smaller folding wingtips of 11 feet 335 m in length will allow 777x models to use the same airport gates and taxiways as earlier 777s126 these smaller folding wingtips are less complex than those proposed for earlier 777s and internally only affect the wiring needed for wingtip lights126 the sixwheel undercarriage of a boeing 777300 the airframe incorporates the use of composite materials which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight all models outside the 7778 and 7779133 elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder the main fuselage crosssection is circular134 and tapers rearward into a bladeshaped tail cone with a portfacing auxiliary power unit6 the aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner135 the sixwheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear this helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircrafts braking and hydraulic systems each tire of a 777300er sixwheel main landing gear can carry a load of 59490 lb 26980 kg which is heavier than other widebodies such as the 747400136 the aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing137 a ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing138 interior economy class cabin of etihad airways 777300er in a 333 layout the original 777 interior also known as the boeing signature interior features curved panels larger overhead bins and indirect lighting63 seating options range from four139 to six abreast in first class up to 10 across in economy140 the 777s windows were the largest of any current commercial airliner until the 787 and measure 15inch 380 mm by 10inch 250 mm in size all models outside the 7778 and 9141 the cabin also features flexibility zones which entails deliberate placement of water electrical pneumatic and other connection points throughout the interior space allowing airlines to move seats galleys and lavatories quickly and more easily when adjusting cabin arrangements140 several aircraft have also been fitted with vip interiors for nonairline use142 boeing designed a hydraulically damped toilet seat cover hinge that closes slowly143 eva

flight international reported that boeing is considering replacing the signature interior on the 777 with a new interior similar to that on the 787 as part of a move towards a common cabin experience across all boeing platforms147 with the launch of the 777x in 2013 boeing confirmed that the aircraft would be receiving a new interior featuring 787 cabin elements and larger windows126 further details released in 2014 included resculpted cabin sidewalls for greater interior room noisedampening technology and higher cabin humidity148 variants boeing uses two characteristics – fuselage length and range – to define its 777 models18 passengers and cargo capacity varies by fuselage length the 777300 stretched the base 777200 in 1998 three range categories were defined the amarket would cover domestic and regional operations the bmarket would cover routes from europe to the us west coast and the cmarket the longest transpacific routes149 the amarket would be covered by a 4200 nmi 7800 km
