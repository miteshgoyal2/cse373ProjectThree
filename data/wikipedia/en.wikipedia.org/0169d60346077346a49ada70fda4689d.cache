xscape was played for critics at exclusive album listening parties in new york city51 bernadette mcnulty from the daily telegraph praised the album as pristine noting the frontandcenter presence of jacksons voice in the mix25 michael cragg from the guardian said xscape feels like an album created to showcase a handful of jackson songs that on the whole deserve to be heard27 richard suchet from sky news thought the album sounded more like modernday remixes24 nick stevenson from mixmag asserted that the album was more like a collection of bsides from off the wall than a followup to invincible26 michael arceneaux from ebony said the upcoming project from the late singer sounds like a recipe for legacy tarnishing52 elysa gardner of usa today said that the producers on the album ensure that jacksons enduring strengths as a singer are represented layering in modern electronic textures without overwhelming the distinctly slinky shivery vocals or overall structure of the tunes53 other critics suggested the product was just a way to promote sony smartphones54 and had questions about the songwriting and production55 or with the singing5657 selfconfessed jacksonfan nekesa mumbi moody writing for yahoo said that much of the album had a dated feel with a place with no name having poor lyrics and sound she concluded that putting out music that falls below jacksons standards
