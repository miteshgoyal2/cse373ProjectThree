portal v t e capitalism is an economic system and an ideology based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit123 characteristics central to capitalism include private property capital accumulation wage labor voluntary exchange a price system and competitive markets45 in a capitalist market economy decisionmaking and investment are determined by the owners of the factors of production in financial and capital markets whereas prices and the distribution of goods are mainly determined by competition in the market67 economists political economists sociologists and historians have adopted different perspectives in their analyses of capitalism and have recognized various forms of it in practice these include laissezfaire or free market capitalism welfare capitalism and state capitalism different forms of capitalism feature varying degrees of free markets public ownership8 obstacles to free competition and statesanctioned social policies the degree of competition in markets the role of intervention and regulation and the scope of state ownership vary across different models of capitalism9 the extent to which different markets are free as well as the rules defining private property are matters of politics and policy most existing capitalist economies are mixed economies which combine elements of free markets with state intervention and in some cases economic planning10 market economies have existed under many forms of government in many different times places and cultures however the development of capitalist societies marked by a universalization of moneybased social relations a consistently large and systemwide class of workers who must work for wages and a capitalist class which dominates control of wealth and political power developed in western europe in a process that led to the industrial revolution capitalist systems with varying degrees of direct government intervention have since become dominant in the western world and continue to spread capitalism has been criticized for establishing power in the hands of a minority capitalist class that exists through the exploitation of a working class majority for prioritizing profit over social good natural resources and the environment and for being an engine of inequality and economic instabilities supporters argue that it provides better products through competition creates strong economic growth yields productivity and prosperity that greatly benefits society as well as being the most efficient system known for allocation of resources contents 1

profits system21 the term capitalist meaning an owner of capital appears earlier than the term capitalism and it dates back to the mid17th century capitalism is derived from capital which evolved from capitale a late latin word based on caput meaning head – also the origin of chattel and cattle in the sense of movable property only much later to refer only to livestock capitale emerged in the 12th to 13th centuries in the sense of referring to funds stock of merchandise sum of money or money carrying interest222324 by 1283 it was used in the sense of the capital assets of a trading firm and it was frequently interchanged with a number of other words – wealth money funds goods assets property and so on25 the hollandische mercurius uses capitalists in 1633 and 1654 to refer to owners of capital26 in french étienne clavier referred to capitalistes in 178827 six years before its first recorded english usage by arthur young in his work travels in france 17922428 in his principles of political economy and taxation 1817 david ricardo referred to the capitalist many times29 samuel taylor coleridge an english poet used capitalist in his work table talk 182330 pierrejoseph proudhon used the term capitalist in his first work what is property 1840 to refer to the owners of capital benjamin disraeli used the term capitalist in his 1845 work sybil24 the initial usage of the term capitalism in its modern sense has been attributed to louis blanc in 1850 what i call capitalism that is to say the appropriation of capital by some to the exclusion of others and pierrejoseph proudhon in 1861 economic and social regime in which capital the source of income does not generally belong to those who make it work through their labour31 karl marx and friedrich engels referred to the capitalistic system3233 and to the capitalist mode of production in the capital 186734 the use of the word capitalism in reference to an economic system appears twice in volume i of the capital p 124 german edition and in theories of surplus value tome ii p 493 german edition marx did not extensively use the form capitalism but instead those of capitalist and capitalist mode of production which appear more than 2600 times in the trilogy the capital according to the oxford english dictionary oed the term capitalism first appeared in english in 1854 in the novel the newcomes by novelist william makepeace thackeray where he meant having ownership of capital35 also according to the oed carl adolph douai a germanamerican socialist and abolitionist used the phrase private capitalism in 1863 historyedit main article history of capitalism capital has existed incipiently on a small scale for centuries36 in the form of merchant renting and lending activities and occasionally as smallscale industry with some wage labour simple commodity exchange and consequently simple commodity production which are the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade have a very long history the capitalistic era according to karl marx dates from 16th century merchants and small urban workshops37 marx knew that wage labour existed on a modest scale for centuries before capitalist industry early islam promulgated capitalist economic policies which migrated to europe through trade partners from cities such as venice38 capitalism in its modern form can be traced to the emergence of agrarian capitalism and mercantilism in the renaissance39 thus for much of history capital and commercial trade existed but it did not lead to industrialisation or dominate the production process of society that required a set of conditions including specific technologies of mass production the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production a class of workers willing to sell their labour power for a living a legal framework promoting commerce a physical infrastructure allowing the circulation of goods on a large scale and security for private accumulation many of these conditions do not currently exist in many third world countries although there is plenty of capital and labour thus the obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are less technical and more social cultural and political agrarian capitalismedit the economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16thcentury england the manorial system had broken down and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates instead of a serfbased system of labor workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding moneybased economy the system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit the weakened coercive power of the aristocracy to extract peasant surpluses encouraged them to try better methods and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods in order to flourish in a competitive labor market terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation4041 by the early 17thcentury england was a centralized state in which much of the feudal order of medieval europe had been swept away this centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and by a disproportionately large capital city london the capital acted as a central market hub for the entire country creating a very large internal market for goods contrasting with the fragmented feudal holdings that prevailed in most parts of the continent mercantilismedit main article mercantilism a painting of a french seaport from 1638 at the height of mercantilism the economic doctrine prevailing from the 16th to the 18th centuries is commonly called mercantilism3742 this period the age of discovery was associated with the geographic exploration of the foreign lands by merchant traders especially from england and the low countries mercantilism was a system of trade for profit although commodities were still largely produced by noncapitalist methods43 most scholars consider the era of merchant capitalism and mercantilism as the origin of modern capitalism4445 although karl polanyi argued that the hallmark of capitalism is the establishment of generalized markets for what he called the fictitious commodities land labor and money accordingly he argued that not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in england hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date46 robert clive after the battle of plassey which began east india company rule in india england began a largescale and integrative approach to mercantilism during the elizabethan era 1558–1603 a systematic and coherent explanation of balance of trade was made public through thomas muns argument englands treasure by forraign trade or the balance of our forraign trade is the rule of our treasure it was written in the 1620s and published in 166447 european merchants backed by state controls subsidies and monopolies made most of their profits by buying and selling goods in the words of francis bacon the purpose of mercantilism was the opening and wellbalancing of trade the cherishing of manufacturers the banishing of idleness the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws the improvement and husbanding of the soil the regulation of prices 48 the british east india company and the dutch east india company inaugurated an expansive era of commerce and trade4950 these companies were characterized by their colonial and expansionary powers given to them by nationstates49 during this era merchants who had traded under the previous stage of mercantilism invested capital in the east india companies and other colonies seeking a return on investment industrial capitalismedit a watt steam engine the steam engine fuelled primarily by coal propelled the industrial revolution in great britain51 in the mid18th century a new group of economic theorists led by david hume52 and adam smith challenged fundamental mercantilist doctrines such as the belief that the worlds wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state during the industrial revolution industrialists replaced merchants as a dominant factor in the capitalist system and affected the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of artisans guilds and journeymen also during this period the surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture industrial capitalism marked the development of the factory system of manufacturing characterized by a complex division of labor between and within work process and the routine of work tasks and finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production42 britain also abandoned its protectionist policy as embraced by mercantilism in the 19th century richard cobden and john bright who based their beliefs on the manchester school initiated a movement to lower tariffs53 in the 1840s britain adopted a less protectionist policy with the repeal of the corn laws and the navigation acts42 britain reduced tariffs and quotas in line with david ricardos advocacy for free trade modern capitalismedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it february 2017 the gold standard formed the financial basis of the international economy from 1870–1914 capitalism was carried across the world by broader processes of globalization and by the end of the 18th century became the dominant global economic system in turn intensifying processes of economic and other globalization54 later in the 20th century capitalism overcame a challenge by centrallyplanned economies and is now the encompassing system worldwide1455 with the mixed economy being its dominant form in the industrialized western world industrialization allowed cheap production of household items using economies of scale while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities globalization in this period was decisively shaped by 18thcentury imperialism56 after the first and second opium wars and the completion of british conquest of india vast populations of these regions became ready consumers of european exports also in this period areas of subsaharan africa and the pacific islands were incorporated into the world system meanwhile the conquest of new parts of the globe notably subsaharan africa by europeans yielded valuable natural resources such as rubber diamonds and coal and helped fuel trade and investment between the european imperial powers their colonies and the united states the inhabitant of london could order by telephone sipping his morning tea the various products of the whole earth and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries were little more than the amusements of his daily newspaper what an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man was that age which came to an end in august 191457 in this period the global financial system was mainly tied to the gold standard the united kingdom first formally adopted this standard in 1821 soon to follow were canada in 1853 newfoundland in 1865 the united states and germany de jure in 1873 new technologies such as the telegraph the transatlantic cable the radiotelephone the steamship and railway allowed goods and information to move around the world at an unprecedented degree58 the new york stock exchange traders floor 1963 in the period following the global depression of the 1930s the state played an increasingly prominent role in the capitalistic system throughout much of the world the postwar boom ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the situation was worsened by the rise of stagflation59 monetarism a modification of keynesianism that is more compatible with laissezfaire gained increasing prominence in the capitalist world especially under the leadership of ronald reagan in the us and margaret thatcher in the uk in the 1980s public and political interest began shifting away from the socalled collectivist concerns of keyness managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice called remarketized capitalism60 according to harvard academic shoshana zuboff a new genus of capitalism surveillance capitalism monetizes data acquired through surveillance616263 she states it was first discovered and consolidated at google emerged due to the coupling of the vast powers of the digital with the radical indifference and intrinsic narcissism of the financial capitalism and its neoliberal vision that have dominated commerce for at least three decades especially in the anglo economies62 and depends on the global architecture of computer mediation which produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power she calls big other64 relationship to democracyedit many analystswho assert that china is one of the main examples of state capitalism in the 21st century the relationship between democracy and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and in popular political movements the extension of universal adult male suffrage in 19th century britain occurred along with the development of industrial capitalism and democracy became widespread at the same time as capitalism leading capitalists to posit a causal or mutual relationship between them65 however in the 20th century according to some authors capitalism also accompanied a variety of political formations quite distinct from liberal democracies including fascist regimes absolute monarchies and singleparty states42 democratic peace theory asserts that democracies seldom fight other democracies but critics of that theory suggest that this may be because of political similarity or stability rather than because they are democratic or capitalist moderate critics argue that though economic growth under capitalism has led to democracy in the past it may not do so in the future as authoritarian regimes have been able to manage economic growth without making concessions to greater political freedom6667 one of the biggest supporters of the idea that capitalism promotes political freedom milton friedman argues that competitive capitalism allows economic and political power to be separate ensuring that they do not clash with one another this idea has been challenged given the current influence capitalist lobbying has had on policy in the united states the approval of citizens united organization has led people to question the very idea that competitive capitalism promotes political freedom the ruling on citizens united allows corporations to spend undisclosed and unregulated amounts of money on political campaigns shifting outcomes to the interests and undermining true democracy as explained in robin hahnel’s writings the centerpiece of the ideological defense of the free market system is the concept of economic freedom and that supporters equate economic democracy with economic freedom and claim that only the free market system can provide economic freedom according to hahnel there are a few objections to the premise that capitalism offers freedom through economic freedom these objections are guided by critical questions about who or what decides whose freedoms are more protected often the question of inequality is brought up when discussing how well capitalism promotes democracy an argument that could stand is that economic growth can lead to inequality given that capital can be acquired at different rates by different people in capital in the twentyfirst century thomas piketty of the paris school of economics asserts that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting concentration of wealth can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built68 marxists anarchists except for anarchocapitalists and other leftists argue that capitalism is incompatible with democracy since capitalism according to marx entails dictatorship of the bourgeoisie owners of the means of production while democracy entails rule by the people states with capitalistic economic systems have thrived under political regimes deemed to be authoritarian or oppressive singapore has a successful open market economy as a result of its competitive businessfriendly climate and robust rule of law nonetheless it often comes under fire for 1 its brand of government which though democratic and consistently one of the least corrupt69 operates largely under a oneparty rule and 2 not vigorously defending freedom of expression given its governmentregulated press as well as penchant for upholding laws protecting ethnic and religious harmony judicial dignity and personal reputation the private capitalist sector in the peoples republic of china has grown exponentially and thrived since its inception despite having an authoritarian government augusto pinochets rule in chile led to economic growth and high levels of inequality70 by using authoritarian means to create a safe environment for investment and capitalism varieties of capitalismedit peter a hall and david soskice argued that modern economies have developed two different forms of capitalism liberal market economies or lme eg us uk canada new zealand ireland and coordinated market economies cme eg germany japan sweden austria those two types can be distinguished by the primary way in which firms coordinate with each other and other actors such as trade unions in lmes firms primarily coordinate their endeavors by way of hierarchies and market mechanisms coordinated market economies more heavily rely on nonmarket forms of interaction in the coordination of their relationship with other actors for a detailed description see varieties of capitalism these two forms of capitalisms developed different industrial relations vocational training and education corporate governance interfirm relations and relations with employees the existence of these different forms of capitalism has important societal effects especially in periods of crisis and instability since the early 2000s the number of labor market outsiders has rapidly grown in europe especially among the youth potentially influencing social and political participation using varieties of capitalism theory it is possible to disentangle the different effects on social and political participation that an increase of labor market outsiders has in liberal and coordinated market economies ferragina et al 201671 the social and political disaffection especially among the youth seems to be more pronounced in liberal than coordinated market economies this signals an important problem for liberal market economies in a period of crisis if the market does not provide consistent job opportunities as it has in previous decades the shortcomings of liberal social security systems may depress social and political participation even further than in other capitalist economies characteristicsedit further information academic perspectives on capitalism capitalism is production for exchange driven by the desire for personal accumulation of money receipts in such exchanges mediated by free markets the markets themselves are driven by the needs and wants of consumers and those of society as a whole contemporary mainstream economics particularly that associated with the right holds that by an invisible hand72 through little more than the freedom of the market is able to match social production to these needs and desires73 summaryedit in general capitalism as an economic system and mode of production can be summarised by the following74 capital accumulation75 production for profit and accumulation as the implicit purpose of all or most of production constriction or elimination of production formerly carried out on a common social or private household basis73 commodity production production for exchange on a market to maximise exchangevalue instead of usevalue private ownership of the means of production9 high levels of wage labour76 the investment of money to make a profit77 the use of the price mechanism to allocate resources between competing uses9 the marketedit the price p of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price supply s and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price demand d this results in a market equilibrium with a given quantity q sold of the product whereas a rise in demand would result in an increase in price and an increase in output in freemarket and laissezfaire forms of capitalism markets are used most extensively with minimal or no regulation over the pricing mechanism in mixed economies which are almost universal today78 markets continue to play a dominant role but are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct market failures promote social welfare conserve natural resources fund defense and public safety or for other reasons in state capitalist systems markets are relied upon the least with the state relying heavily on stateowned enterprises or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital supply is the amount of a good or service produced by a firm and which is available for sale demand is the amount that people are willing to buy at a specific price prices tend to rise when demand exceeds supply and fall when supply exceeds demand in theory the market is able to coordinate itself when a new equilibrium price and quantity is reached competition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers in capitalist theory competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices without competition a monopoly or cartel may develop a monopoly occurs when a firm supplies the total output in the market the firm can therefore limit output and raise prices because it has no fear of competition a cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and prices efforts are made by government to prevent the creation of monopolies and cartels in 1890 the sherman antitrust act became the first legislation passed by the us congress to limit monopolies 79 profit motiveedit the profit motive is a theory in capitalism which posits that the ultimate goal of a business is to make money stated differently the reason for a businesss existence is to turn a profit the profit motive functions on the rational choice theory or the theory that individuals tend to pursue what is in their own best interests accordingly businesses seek to benefit themselves andor their shareholders by maximizing profits in capitalist theoretics the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently for instance austrian economist henry hazlitt explains “if there is no profit in making an article it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself80 in other words profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing theoretically in free and competitive markets maximising profits ensures that resources are not wasted private propertyedit the relationship between the state its formal mechanisms and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory with active discussion since the 19th century hernando de soto is a contemporary economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded81 according to de soto this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy a number of marxian economists have argued that the enclosure acts in england and similar legislation elsewhere were an integral part of capitalist primitive accumulation and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism8283 market competitionedit main article competition economics in capitalist economics market competition is the rivalry among sellers trying to achieve such goals as increasing profits market share and sales volume by varying the elements of the marketing mix price product distribution and promotion merriamwebster defines competition in business as the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favourable terms84 it was described by adam smith in the wealth of nations 1776 and later economists as allocating productive resources to their most highly valued uses85 and encouraging efficiency smith and other classical economists before cournot were referring to price and nonprice rivalry among producers to sell their goods on best terms by bidding of buyers not necessarily to a large number of sellers nor to a market in final equilibrium86 competition is widespread throughout the market process it is a condition where buyers tend to compete with other buyers and sellers tend to compete with other sellers87 in offering goods for exchange buyers competitively bid to purchase specific quantities of specific goods which are available or might be available if sellers were to choose to offer such goods similarly sellers bid against other sellers in offering goods on the market competing for the attention and exchange resources of buyers competition results from scarcity – there is never enough to satisfy all conceivable human wants – and occurs when people strive to meet the criteria that are being used to determine who gets what87 reserve army of labouredit main article reserve army of labour in a marxist analysis of the capitalist economy the reserve army of labour refers to the unemployed and underemployed88 it is synonymous with industrial reserve army or relative surplus population except that the unemployed can be defined as those actually looking for work and that the relative surplus population also includes people unable to work the use of the word army refers to the workers being conscripted and regimented in the workplace in a hierarchy under the commanding heights of the economy prior to the start of the capitalist era in human history ie before the 1500s structural unemployment on a mass scale rarely existed other than that caused by natural disasters and wars89 in ancient societies all people who could work necessarily had to work otherwise they would starve a slave or a serf by definition could not become unemployed there was normally very little possibility of earning a crust without working at all and the usual attitude toward beggars and idlers was harsh90 children began to work already at a very early age indeed the word employment is linguistically a product of the capitalist era a permanent level of unemployment presupposes a working population which is to a large extent dependent on a wage or salary for a living without having other means of livelihood as well as the right of enterprises to hire and fire employees in accordance with commercial or economic conditions the expression unemployed in english in the sense of temporarily out of work dates back to the 1660s reference to the unemployed as a group was first made in 1782 and reference to unemployment as a general condition is first attested in 188891 the first recorded discussion of the reserve army of labour is in a manuscript written by karl marx big industry constantly requires a reserve army of unemployed workers for times of overproduction the main purpose of the bourgeois in relation to the worker is of course to have the commodity labour as cheaply as possible which is only possible when the supply of this commodity is as large as possible in relation to the demand for it ie when the overpopulation is the greatest overpopulation is therefore in the interest of the bourgeoisie and it gives the workers good advice which it knows to be impossible to carry out since capital only increases when it employs workers the increase of capital involves an increase of the proletariat and as we have seen according to the nature of the relation of capital and labour the increase of the proletariat must proceed relatively even faster the theory which is also expressed as a law of nature that population grows faster than the means of subsistence is the more welcome to the bourgeois as it silences his conscience makes hardheartedness into a moral duty and the consequences of society into the consequences of nature and finally gives him the opportunity to watch the destruction of the proletariat by starvation as calmly as other natural event without bestirring himself and on the other hand to regard the misery of the proletariat as its own fault and to punish it to be sure the proletarian can restrain his natural instinct by reason and so by moral supervision halt the law of nature in its injurious course of development — karl marx wages december 184792 marx introduced the concept in chapter 25 of the first volume of das kapital93 which states capitalistic accumulation itself constantly produces and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy and extent a relatively redundant population of workers ie a population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the valorisation of capital and therefore a surpluspopulation it is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out of a smaller rather than a greater number of labourers if the cost is about the same the more extended the scale of production the stronger this motive its force increases with the accumulation of capital his argument is that as capitalism develops the organic composition of capital will increase which means that the mass of constant capital grows faster than the mass of variable capital fewer workers can produce all that is necessary for societys requirements in addition capital will become more concentrated and centralised in fewer hands this being the absolute historical tendency part of the working population will tend to become surplus to the requirements of capital accumulation over time paradoxically the larger the wealth of society the larger the industrial reserve army will become marx called it the antagonism of capital accumulation and he cites his the poverty of philosophy chapter 2 section 1 to explain this phenomenon in relation with relations of production94 one could add that the larger the wealth of society the more people it can support who do not work however as marx develops the argument further it also becomes clear that depending on the state of the economy the reserve army of labour will either expand or contract alternately being absorbed or expelled from the employed workforce taking them as a whole the general movements of wages are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army and these again correspond to the periodic changes of the industrial cycle they are therefore not determined by the variations of the absolute number of the working population but by the varying proportions in which the workingclass is divided into active and reserve army by the increase or diminution in the relative amount of the surpluspopulation by the extent to which it is now absorbed now set free in recent years there has been growing research on the concept of the precariat to describe a growing reliance on temporary parttime workers with precarious status who share aspects of the proletariat and the reserve army of labor95 precarious workers do work parttime or fulltime in temporary jobs but they cannot really earn enough to live on and depend partly on friends or family or on state benefits to survive typically they do not become truly unemployed but they dont have a stable job to go to either96 the rise of the precariat has been attributed to the emergence of global neoliberalism97 although nonemployed people who are unable or uninterested in performing legal paid work are not considered among the unemployed the concept of conjunctural unemployment is used in economics nowadays98 economists often distinguish between shortterm frictional or cyclical unemployment and longerterm structural unemployment sometimes there is a shortterm mismatch between the demand and supply of labour at other times there is much less total demand for labour than supply for a longtime if no possibility for getting a job at all in the foreseeable future exists many younger people decide to migrate or emigrate to a place where they can find work composition of the relative surplus populationedit marx discusses the army of labor and the reserve army in capital ch 25 section iv the army of labor consists in those workingclass people employed in average or better than average jobs not every one in the working class gets one of these jobs there are then four other categories where members of the working class might find themselves the stagnant pool the floating reserves the latent reserve and pauperdom finally people may leave the army and the reserve army by turning to criminality and marx refers to such people as lumpenproletariat99 the stagnant part consists of marginalised people with extremely irregular employment stagnant pool jobs are characterized by below average pay dangerous working conditions they may be temporary those caught in the stagnant pool have jobs so the modern definition of the employed would include both the army of labor plus the stagnant pool however they are constantly on the lookout for something better the modern unemployed would refer primarily to the floating reserve people who used to have good jobs but are now out of work they certainly hope that their unemployment is temporary conjunctural unemployment but they are well aware that they could fall into the stagnant pool or the pauper class the latent part consists of that segment of the population not yet fully integrated into capitalist production in marx day he was referring to people living off of subsistence agriculture who were looking for monetary employment in industry in modern times people coming from slums in developing countries where they survive largely by nonmonetary means to developed cities where they work for pay might form the latent housewives who move from unpaid to paid employment for a business could also form a part of the latent reserve they are not unemployed because they are not necessarily actively looking for a job but if capital needs extra workers it can pull them out of the latent reserve in this sense the latent forms a reservoir of potential workers for industries pauperdom is where one might end up the homeless is the modern term for paupers marx calls them people who cannot adapt to capitals never ending change for karl marx the sphere of pauperism including those still able to work orphans and pauper children and the demoralised and ragged or unable to work as a mode of productionedit further information mode of production in karl marx critique of political economy and subsequent marxian analyses the capitalist mode of production refers to the systems of organising production and distribution within capitalist societies private moneymaking in various forms renting banking merchant trade production for profit etc preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such the capitalist mode of production proper based on wagelabour and private ownership of the means of production and on industrial technology began to grow rapidly in western europe from the industrial revolution later extending to most of the worldcitation needed the term capitalist mode of production is defined by private ownership of the means of production extraction of surplus value by the owning class for the purpose of capital accumulation wagebased labour and at least as far as commodities are concerned being marketbased100 capitalism in the form of moneymaking activity has existed in the shape of merchants and moneylenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in simple commodity production hence the reference to merchant capitalism since the beginnings of civilisation what is specific about the “capitalist mode of production” is that most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market ie they are commodities and essentially all production is in this mode9 for example in flourishing feudalism most or all of the factors of production including labour are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade75 this has the important consequence that the whole organisation of the production process is reshaped and reorganised to conform with economic rationality as bounded by capitalism which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs wages nonlabour factor costs sales profits rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall that is the whole process is organised and reshaped in order to conform to “commercial logic” essentially capital accumulation comes to define economic rationality in capitalist production73 a society region or nation is capitalist if the predominant source of incomes and products being distributed is capitalist activity but even so this does not yet mean necessarily that the capitalist mode of production is dominant in that society wage labouredit main article wage labour an industrial worker amidst heavy steel semiproducts kinex bearings bytča slovakia c 1995–2000 wage labour refers to the sale of labour under a formal or informal employment contract to an employer101 these transactions usually occur in a labour market where wages are market determined102 individuals who possess and supply financial capital or labor to productive ventures often become owners either jointly as shareholders or individually in marxist economics these owners of the means of production and suppliers of capital are generally called capitalists the description of the role of the capitalist has shifted first referring to a useless intermediary between producers to an employer of producers and eventually came to refer to owners of the means of production103 labor includes all physical and mental human resources including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills which are needed to produce products and services production is the act of making goods or services by applying labor power104105 critics of the capitalist mode of production see wage labour as a major if not defining aspect of hierarchical industrial systems most opponents of the institution support worker selfmanagement and economic democracy as alternatives to both wage labour and to capitalism while most opponents of the wage system blame the capitalist owners of the means of production for its existence most anarchists and other libertarian socialists also hold the state as equally responsible as it exists as a tool utilised by capitalists to subsidise themselves and protect the institution of private ownership of the means of production as some opponents of wage labour take influence from marxist propositions many are opposed to private property but maintain respect for personal property typesedit the most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct or fulltime employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time from a few years to the entire career of the worker in return for a moneywage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff however wage labour takes many other forms and explicit as opposed to implicit ie conditioned by local labour and tax law contracts are not uncommon economic history shows a great variety of ways in which labour is traded and exchanged the differences show up in the form of employment status a worker could be employed fulltime parttime or on a casual basis he or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only or on a permanent basis parttime wage labour could combine with parttime selfemployment the worker could be employed also as an apprentice civil legal status the worker could for example be a free citizen an indentured labourer the subject of forced labour including some prison or army labour a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task they could be a semislave or a serf bound to the land who is hired out part of the time so the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis or on a more or less involuntary basis in which there are many gradations method of payment remuneration or compensation the work done could be paid in cash a moneywage or in kind through receiving goods andor services or in the form of piece rates where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces in some cases the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services or in the form of stock options or shares in an enterprise method of hiring the worker might engage in a labourcontract on his or her own initiative or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group but he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary such as an employment agency to a third party in this case he or she is paid by the intermediary but works for a third party which pays the intermediary in some cases labour is subcontracted several times with several intermediaries another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise together with means of production comparison to slaveryedit main article wage slavery pinkerton guards escort strikebreakers in buchtel ohio 1884 wage labour has long been compared to slavery106107108109 as a result the phrase “wage slavery” is often utilised as a pejorative for wage labour110 similarly advocates of slavery looked upon the comparative evils of slave society and of free society of slavery to human masters and slavery to capital111 and proceeded to argue that wage slavery was actually worse than chattel slavery112 slavery apologists like george fitzhugh contended that workers only accepted wage labour with the passage of time as they became familiarised and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhale111 scholars have debated the exact relationship between wage labor slavery and capitalism at length especially for the antebellum united states113 similarities between wage labour and slavery were noted as early as cicero in ancient rome114 with the advent of the industrial revolution thinkers such as proudhon and marx elaborated the comparison between wage labour and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use115116 while luddites emphasised the dehumanisation brought about by machines before the american civil war southern defenders of african american slavery invoked the concept of wage slavery to favorably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the north117118 the united states abolished slavery during the civil war but labor union activists found the metaphor useful according to lawrence glickman in the gilded age references abounded in the labor press and it is hard to find a speech by a labour leader without the phrase119 the slave together with his labourpower was sold to his owner once for all the wage labourer on the other hand sells his very self and that by fractions he belongs to the capitalist class and it is for him to find a buyer in this capitalist class120 “ ” karl marx according to noam chomsky analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the enlightenment era in his 1791 book on the limits of state action classical liberal thinker wilhelm von humboldt explained how whatever does not spring from a mans free choice or is only the result of instruction and guidance does not enter into his very nature he does not perform it with truly human energies but merely with mechanical exactness and so when the labourer works under external control we may admire what he does but we despise what he is121 both the milgram and stanford experiments have been found useful in the psychological study of wagebased workplace relations122 additionally as per anthropologist david graeber the earliest wage labour contracts we know about were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves usually the owner would receive a share of the money and the slave another with which to maintain his or her living expenses such arrangements according to graeber were quite common in new world slavery as well whether in the united states or brazil123 c l r james argued in the black jacobins that most of the techniques of human organisation employed on factory workers during the industrial revolution were first developed on slave plantations124 girl pulling a coal tub in mine from official report of the british parliamentary commission in the mid 19th century125 some anticapitalist thinkers claim that the elite maintain wage slavery and a divided working class through their influence over the media and entertainment industry126127 educational institutions unjust laws nationalist and corporate propaganda pressures and incentives to internalise values serviceable to the power structure state violence fear of unemployment128 and a historical legacy of exploitation and profit accumulationtransfer under prior systems which shaped the development of economic theory adam smith noted that employers often conspire together to keep wages low129 the interest of the dealers in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from and even opposite to that of the public… they have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public… we rarely hear it has been said of the combinations of masters though frequently of those of workmen but whoever imagines upon this account that masters rarely combine is as ignorant of the world as of the subject masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit but constant and uniform combination not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate… it is not however difficult to foresee which of the two parties must upon all ordinary occasions have the advantage in the dispute and force the other into a compliance with their terms aristotle made the statement the citizens must not live a mechanic or a mercantile life for such a life is ignoble and inimical to virtue nor yet must those who are to be citizens in the best state be tillers of the soil for leisure is needed both for the development of virtue and for active participation in politics130 often paraphrased as all paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind131 cicero wrote in 44 bc that …vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour not for artistic skill for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery132 somewhat similar criticisms have also been expressed by some proponents of liberalism like henry george133134 silvio gesell and thomas paine135 as well as the distributist school of thought within the roman catholic church to marxist and anarchist thinkers like bakunin and kropotkin wage slavery was a class condition in place due to the existence of private property and the state this class situation rested primarily on the existence of property not intended for active use the concentration of ownership in few hands the lack of direct access by workers to the means of production and consumption goods the perpetuation of a reserve army of unemployed workers for marxists labourascommodity which is how they regard wage labour136 provides a fundamental point of attack against capitalism137 it can be persuasively argued noted one concerned philosopher that the conception of the workers labour as a commodity confirms marxs stigmatization of the wage system of private capitalism as wageslavery that is as an instrument of the capitalists for reducing the workers condition to that of a slave if not below it138 that this objection is fundamental follows immediately from marxs conclusion that wage labour is the very foundation of capitalism without a class dependent on wages the moment individuals confront each other as free persons there can be no production of surplus value without the production of surplusvalue there can be no capitalist production and hence no capital and no capitalist139 systemic weaknessesedit externalitiesedit main articles externality and commons market failure occurs when an externality is present and a market will often either underproduce a product with a positive externalisation or overproduce a product that generates a negative externalisation air pollution for instance is a negative externalisation that cannot be easily incorporated into markets as the worlds air is not owned and then sold for use to polluters so too much pollution could be emitted and people not involved in the production pay the cost of the pollution instead of the firm that initially emitted the air pollution critics of market failure theory like ronald coase harold demsetz and james m buchanan argue that government programs and policies also fall short of absolute perfection while all nations currently have some kind of market regulations the desirable degree of regulation is disputedcitation needed anticompetitive practicesedit main article anticompetitive practices further information competition law the doctrine of free competition is essential to the functioning of a capitalist economy and as such anticompetitive behaviour in the market poses a crucial weakness in capitalist economics issues such as monopolistic behaviour on the part of corporations and aspects of intellectual property laws pose problems to capitalist economies capital accumulationedit main article capital accumulation further information money the accumulation of capital refers to the process of making money or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production capitalism is based around the accumulation of capital whereby financial capital is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation in marxian economic theory this dynamic is called the law of value capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of capital defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit140 in this context capital is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money whether in the form of profit rent interest royalties capital gain or some other kind of return141 in economics accounting and marxian economics capital accumulation is often equated with investment of profit income or savings especially in real capital goods the concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation in modern macroeconomics and econometrics the phrase capital formation is often used in preference to accumulation though the united nations conference on trade and development unctad refers nowadays to accumulation the phrase clarification needed is occasionally used in national accounts backgroundedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be

monetary fund the unctad the world bank group the oecd and the bank for international settlements used national investment data to estimate world trends the bureau of economic analysis eurostat and the japan statistical office provide data on the united states europe and japan respectively other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as fortune forbes the economist business week etc and various corporate watchdog organisations and nongovernmental organisation publications a reputable scientific journal is the review of income wealth in the case of the united states the analytical perspectives document an annex to the yearly budget provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country in karl marx economic theory capital accumulation refers to the operation whereby profits are reinvested increasing the total quantity of capital capital is viewed by marx as expanding value that is in other terms as a sum of capital usually expressed in money that is transformed through human labor into a larger value extracted as profits and expressed as money here capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset value in search of additional value or surplusvalue this requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned and trading rights to be established capital accumulation has a double origin namely in trade and in expropriation both of a legal or illegal kind the reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or trading up but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else without compensation david harvey calls this accumulation by dispossession the continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade and this has historically often been a violent process as markets expand more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in but capital accumulation may also confront resistance when people refuse to sell or refuse to buy for example a strike by investors or workers or consumer resistance concentration and centralisationedit according to marx capital has the tendency for concentration and centralisation in the hands of the wealthy marx explains it is concentration of capitals already formed destruction of their individual independence expropriation of capitalist by capitalist transformation of many small into few large capitals capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand because it has in another place been lost by many the battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities the cheapness of commodities demands caeteris paribus on the productiveness of labour and this again on the scale of production therefore the larger capitals beat the smaller it will further be remembered that with the development of the capitalist mode of production there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions the smaller capitals therefore crowd into spheres of production which modern industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of here competition rages it always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors partly vanish142 the rate of accumulationedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed october 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message in marxian economics the rate of accumulation is defined as 1 the value of the real net increase in the stock of capital in an accounting period 2 the proportion of realised surplusvalue or profitincome which is reinvested rather than consumed this rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay the realised turnover surplusvalue or profit and reinvestments see eg the writings of the economist michał kalecki other things being equal the greater the amount of profitincome that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be however earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment this is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about how much to spend and how much to save in a boom period of capitalism the growth of investments is cumulative ie one investment leads to another leading to a constantly expanding market an expanding labor force and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people in a stagnating decadent capitalism the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces real estate financial speculation and luxury consumption in that case income from valueadding production will decline in favour of interest rent and tax income with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment the more capital one owns the more capital one can also borrow the inverse is also true and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor ernest mandel emphasised that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on 1 the division of a societys social product between necessary product and surplus product and 2 the division of the surplus product between investment and consumption in turn this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of competition among capitalists competition between capitalists and workers and competition between workers the pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors it also involved social factors and power relationships the circuit of capital accumulation from productionedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed october 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message strictly speaking capital has accumulated only when realised profit income has been reinvested in capital assets but the process of capital accumulation in production has as suggested in the first volume of marx das kapital at least seven distinct but linked moments the initial investment of capital which could be borrowed capital in means of production and labor power the command over surpluslabour and its appropriation the valorisation increase in value of capital through production of new outputs the appropriation of the new output produced by employees containing the added value the realisation of surplusvalue through output sales the appropriation of realised surplusvalue as profit income after deduction of costs the reinvestment of profit income in production all of these moments do not refer simply to an economic or commercial process rather they assume the existence of legal social cultural and economic power conditions

to trade simple and expanded reproductionedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed october 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message in volume 2 of das kapital marx continues the story and shows that with the aid of bank credit capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another alternately taking the form of money capital liquid deposits securities etc commodity capital tradable products real estate etc or production capital means of production and labor power his discussion of the simple and expanded reproduction of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole at simple reproduction a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given living standard the stock of capital stays constant at expanded reproduction more productvalue is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard a surplus product the additional productvalue is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production the bourgeois claim there is no economic law according to which capital is necessarily reinvested in the expansion of production that such depends on anticipated profitability market expectations and perceptions of investment risk such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions as marx states in vol 2 simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by dept 1 – producers of means of production – exactly equals that of the constant capital of dept 2 producers of articles of consumption p 524 such equilibrium rests on various assumptions such as a constant labor supply no population growth accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry p 514 ernest mandel introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction ie reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale for example due to wars natural disasters or devalorisation balanced economic growth requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions but markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between supply and demand inequality is the motor of growth this partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very longtime some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and protectionism capital accumulation as social relationedit accumulation of capital sometimes also refers in marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist social relations institutions on a larger scale over time ie the expansion of the size of the proletariat and of the wealth owned by the bourgeoisie this interpretation emphasises that capital ownership predicated on command over labor is a social relation the growth of capital implies the growth of the working class a law of accumulation in the first volume of das kapital marx had illustrated this idea with reference to edward gibbon wakefields theory of colonisation wakefield discovered that in the colonies property in money means of subsistence machines and other means of production does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative – the wageworker the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own freewill he discovered that capital is not a thing but a social relation between persons established by the instrumentality of things mr peel he moans took with him from england to swan river west australia means of subsistence and of production to the amount of £50000 mr peel had the foresight to bring with him besides 3000 persons of the workingclass men women and children once arrived at his destination mr peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river unhappy mr peel who provided for everything except the export of english modes of production to swan river — das kapital vol 1 ch 33 in the third volume of das kapital marx refers to the fetishism of capital reaching its highest point with interestbearing capital because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything the relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetishlike form in interestbearing capital we have here m − m ′ displaystyle mm money creating more money selfexpanding value without the process that effectuates these two extremes in merchants capital m − c − m ′ displaystyle mcm there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation not the product of a mere thing this is obliterated in m − m ′ displaystyle mm the form of interestbearing capital the thing money commodity value is now capital even as a mere thing and capital appears as a mere thing the result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself it depends on the owner of the money ie of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital in interestbearing capital therefore this automatic fetish selfexpanding value money generating money are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birthmarks of its origin the social relation is consummated in the relation of a thing of money to itself instead of the actual transformation of money into capital we see here only form without content — das kapital vol 1 ch 24 supply and demandedit the price p of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price supply s and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price demand d the diagram shows a positive shift in demand from d1 to d2 resulting in an increase in price p and quantity sold q of the product in capitalist economic structures supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a market it concludes that in a competitive market the unit price for a particular good will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers at current price will equal the quantity supplied by producers at current price resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity the four basic laws of supply and demand are14337 if demand increases demand curve shifts to the right and supply remains unchanged then a shortage occurs leading to a higher equilibrium price if demand decreases demand curve shifts to the left and supply remains unchanged then a surplus occurs leading to a lower equilibrium price if demand remains unchanged and supply increases supply curve shifts to the right then a surplus occurs leading to a lower equilibrium price if demand remains unchanged and supply decreases supply curve shifts to the left then a shortage occurs leading to a higher equilibrium price graphical representation of supply and demandedit although it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as functions of the price of the goods the standard graphical representation usually attributed to alfred marshall has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis the opposite of the standard convention for the representation of a mathematical function since determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supplydemand diagram changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves often described as shifts in the curves by contrast responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves supply scheduleedit a supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied under the assumption of perfect competition supply is determined by marginal cost that is firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive a hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply shifting costs up while a discount would increase supply shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases by its very nature conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor ie to have no influence over the market price this is true because each point on the supply curve is the answer to the question if this firm is faced with this potential price how much output will it be able to and willing to sell if a firm has market power its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price therefore the firm is not faced with any price and the question becomes less relevant economists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and between the market supply curve the market supply curve is obtained by summing the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price thus in the graph of the supply curve individual firms supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve economists also distinguish the shortrun market supply curve from the longrun market supply curve in this context two things are assumed constant by definition of the short run the availability of one or more fixed inputs typically physical capital and the number of firms in the industry in the longrun firms can adjust their holdings of physical capital enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price furthermore in the longrun potential competitors can enter or exit the industry in response to market conditions for both of these reasons longrun market supply curves are generally flatter than their shortrun counterparts the determinants of supply are production costs how much a goods costs to be produced production costs are the cost of the inputs primarily labor capital energy and materials they depend on the technology used in production andor technological advances see productivity firms expectations about future prices number of suppliers demand scheduleedit a demand schedule depicted graphically as the demand curve represents the amount of some goods that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices assuming all determinants of demand other than the price of the good in question such as income tastes and preferences the price of substitute goods and the price of complementary goods remain the same following the law of demand the demand curve is almost always represented as downwardsloping meaning that as price decreases consumers will buy more of the good144 just like the supply curves reflect marginal cost curves demand curves are determined by marginal utility curves145 consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good at a given price if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the opportunity cost determined by the price that is the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices the demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time while the aforementioned demand curve is generally downwardsloping there may be rare examples of goods that have upwardsloping demand curves two different hypothetical types of goods with upwardsloping demand curves are giffen goods an inferior but staple good and veblen goods goods made more fashionable by a higher price by its very nature conceptualising a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor – that is that the purchaser has no influence over the market price this is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question if this buyer is faced with this potential price how much of the product will it purchase if a buyer has market power so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price then the buyer is not faced with any price and the question is meaningless like with supply curves economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve the market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price thus in the graph of the demand curve individuals demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve the determinants of demand are income tastes and preferences prices of related goods and services consumers expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked number of potential consumers equilibriumedit further information economic equilibrium in the context of supply and demand economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced and in the absence of external influences the equilibrium values of economic variables will not change for example in the standard textbook model of perfect competition equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal146 market equilibrium in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by buyers is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by sellers this price is often called the competitive price or market clearing price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes and the quantity is called competitive quantity or market clearing quantity partial equilibriumedit main article partial equilibrium partial equilibrium as the name suggests takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium jain proposes attributed to george stigler a partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data a standard example is price of a single product the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis147 the supplyanddemand model is a partial equilibrium model of economic equilibrium where the clearance on the market of some specific goods is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets in other words the prices of all substitutes and complements as well as income levels of consumers are constant this makes analysis much simpler than in a general equilibrium model which includes an entire economy here the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand it is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study equilibrium efficiency and comparative statics the stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach make the model considerably more tractable but may produce results which while seemingly precise do not effectively model real world economic phenomena partial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any hence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets léon walras first formalised the idea of a oneperiod economic equilibrium of the general economic system but it was french economist antoine augustin cournot and english political economist alfred marshall who developed tractable models to analyse an economic system empirical estimationedit demand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price quantity and other data with sufficient information in the model this can be done with simultaneousequation methods of estimation in econometrics such methods allow solving for the modelrelevant structural coefficients the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory the parameter identification problem is a common issue in structural estimation typically data on exogenous variables that is variables other than price and quantity both of which are endogenous variables are needed to perform such an estimation an alternative to structural estimation is reducedform estimation which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables macroeconomic uses of demand and supplyedit demand and supply have also been generalised to explain macroeconomic variables in a market economy including the quantity of total output and the general price level the aggregate demand – aggregate supply model may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand compared to microeconomic uses of demand and supply different and more controversial theoretical considerations apply to such macroeconomic counterparts as aggregate demand and aggregate supply demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate money supply and money demand to interest rates and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates historyedit according to hamid s hosseini the power of supply and demand was understood to some extent by several early muslim scholars such as fourteenthcentury mamluk scholar ibn taymiyyah who wrote if desire for goods increases while its availability decreases its price rises on the other hand if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases the price comes down148 adam smith john lockes 1691 work some considerations on the consequences of the lowering of interest and the raising of the value of money149 includes an early and clear description of supply and demand and their relationship in this description demand is rent the price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers” and “that which regulates the price of goods is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent the phrase supply and demand was first used by james denhamsteuart in his inquiry into the principles of political economy published in 1767 adam smith used the phrase in his 1776 book the wealth of nations and david ricardo titled one chapter of his 1817 work principles of political economy and taxation on the influence of demand and supply on price150 in the wealth of nations smith generally assumed that the supply price was fixed but that its merit value would decrease as its scarcity increased in effect what was later called the law of demand also ricardo in principles of political economy and taxation more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand antoine augustin cournot first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 researches into the mathematical principles of wealth including diagrams during the late 19th century the marginalist school of thought emerged this field mainly was started by stanley jevons carl menger and léon walras the key idea was that the price was set by the most expensive price that is the price at the margin this was a substantial change from adam smiths thoughts on determining the supply price in his 1870 essay on the graphical representation of supply and demand fleeming jenkin in the course of introducing the diagrammatic method into the english economic literature published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein151 including comparative statics from a shift of supply or demand and application to the labor market152 the model was further developed and popularized by alfred marshall in the 1890 textbook principles of economics150 capitalism and waredit war typically causes the diversion destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war war driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war often this has induced laws against perceived and real war profiteering the total hours worked in the united states rose by 34 percent during world war ii even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent153 assembling the north american b25 mitchell at kansas city 1942 the common view among economic historians is that the great depression ended with the advent of world war ii war destruction can be illustrated by looking at world war ii industrial war damage was heaviest in japan where 14 of factory buildings and 13 of plant equipment were destroyed 17 of electric powergenerating capacity was destroyed and 67 of oil refining capacity the japanese merchant fleet lost 80 of their ships in germany in 1944 when air attacks were heaviest 65 of machine tools were damaged or destroyed but around 90 were later repaired about 10 of steel production capacity was lost in europe the united states and the soviet union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes ships tanks etc were built and then lost or destroyed germanys total war damage was estimated at about 175 of the prewar total capital stock by value ie about 16 in the berlin area alone there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities in 1945 less than 10 of the railways were still operating 2395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7500 bridges 10000 locomotives and more than 100000 goods wagons were destroyed less than 40 of the remaining locomotives were operational however by the first quarter of 1946 european rail traffic which was given assistance and preferences by western appointed military governors for resources and material as an essential asset regained its prewar operational level at the end of the year 90 of germanys railway lines were operating again in retrospect the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing initially in may 1945 newly installed united states president harry s trumans directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of germany in fact the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of prewar output these plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted in 1946 over 10 of germanys physical capital stock plant equipment was also dismantled and confiscated most of it going to the ussr by 1947 industrial production in germany was at 13 of the 1938 level and industrial investment at about 12 the 1938 level the first big strikewave in the ruhr occurred in early 1947 – it was about food rations and housing but soon there were demands for nationalisation the united states appointed military governor newman however stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations the clear message was no work no eat as the military controls in western germany were nearly all relinquished and the germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with marshal plan aid things rapidly improved by 1951 german industrial production had overtaken the prewar level the marshall aid funds were important but after the currency reform which permitted german capitalists to revalue their assets and the establishment of a new political system much more important was the commitment of the united states to rebuilding german capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government rather than keeping germany in a weak position initially average real wages remained low lower even than in 1938 until the early 1950s while profitability was unusually high so the total investment fund aided by credits was also high resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools this was called the german economic miracle or wirtschaftswunder154 in italy the victorious allies did three things in 1945 they imposed their absolute military authority they quickly disarmed the italian partisans from a very large stock of weapons and they agreed to a state guarantee of wage payments as well as a veto on all sackings of workers from their jobs155 although the italian communist party grew very large immediately after the war ended – it achieved a membership of 17 million people in a population of 45 million – it was outmaneouvred through a complicated political battle by the christian democrats after three years156 in the 1950s an economic boom began in italy at first fuelled by internal demand and then also by exports157 in modern times it has often been possible to rebuild physical capital assets destroyed in wars completely within the space of about 10 years except in cases of severe pollution by chemical warfare or other kinds of irreparable devastation however damage to human capital has been much more devastating in terms of fatalities in the case of world war ii about 55 million deaths permanent physical disability enduring ethnic hostility and psychological injuries which have effects for at least several generations types of capitalismedit there are many variants of capitalism in existence that differ according to country and region they vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies the common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit predominantly marketbased allocation of resources and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital the major forms of capitalism are listed hereafter advanced capitalismedit main article advanced capitalism advanced capitalism is the situation that pertains to a society in which the capitalist model has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively for a prolonged period various writers identify antonio gramsci as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism even if he did not use the term himself in his writings gramsci sought to explain how capitalism had adapted to avoid the revolutionary overthrow that had seemed inevitable in the 19th century at the heart of his explanation was the decline of raw coercion as a tool of class power replaced by use of civil society institutions to manipulate public ideology in the capitalists favour158159160 jürgen habermas has been a major contributor to the analysis of advancedcapitalistic societies habermas observed four general features that characterise advanced capitalism concentration of industrial activity in a few large firms constant reliance on the state to stabilise the economic system a formally democratic government that legitimises the activities of the state and dissipates opposition to the system the use of nominal wage increases to pacify the most restless segments of the work force161 finance capitalismedit see also capitalist mode of production marxist theory in their critique of capitalism marxism and leninism both emphasise the role of finance capital as the determining and rulingclass interest in capitalist society particularly in the latter stages162163 rudolf hilferding is creditedby whom with first bringing the term finance capitalism into prominence through finance capital his 1910 study of the links between german trusts banks and monopolies – a study subsumed by lenin into imperialism the highest stage of capitalism 1917 his analysis of the imperialist relations of the great world powers164 lenin concluded that the banks at that time operated as the chief nerve centres of the whole capitalist system of national economy165 for the comintern founded in 1919 the phrase dictatorship of finance capitalism166 became a regular one braudel would later point to two earlier periods when finance capitalism had emerged in human history – with the genoese in the 16th century and with the dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries – although at those points it developed from commercial capitalism167need quotation to verify giovanni arrighi extended braudels analysis to suggest that a predominance of finance capitalism is a recurring longterm phenomenon whenever a previous phase of commercialindustrial capitalist expansion reaches a plateau168 mercantilismedit main articles mercantilism and protectionism the subscription room at lloyds of london in the early 19th century mercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late 16th century it is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to stateinterest and imperialism and consequently the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad an example of this is colonists living in america who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries eg britain portugal france mercantilism was driven by the belief that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations it corresponds to the phase of capitalist development sometimes called the primitive accumulation of capital freemarket economyedit see also free market and laissezfaire freemarket economy refers to a capitalist economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy it typically entails support for highly competitive markets and private ownership of productive enterprises laissezfaire is a more extensive form of freemarket economy where the role of the state is limited to protecting property rights socialmarket economyedit main articles social market and nordic model a socialmarket economy is a nominally freemarket system where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum but the state provides significant services in the area of social security unemployment benefits and recognition of labor rights through national collective bargaining arrangements this model is prominent in western and northern european countries and japan albeit in slightly different configurations the vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model rhine capitalism refers to the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental western europe today state capitalismedit main article state capitalism state capitalism is a capitalist market economy dominated by stateowned enterprises where the state enterprises are organized as commercial profitseeking businesses the designation has been used broadly throughout the 20th century to designate a number of different economic forms ranging from stateownership in market economies to the command economies of the former eastern bloc according to aldo musacchio a professor at harvard business school state capitalism is a system in which governments whether democratic or autocratic exercise a widespread influence on the economy either through direct ownership or various subsidies musacchio notes a number of differences between todays state capitalism and its predecessors in his opinion gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies the worlds largest stateowned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors contemporary state capitalism is associated with the east asian model of capitalism dirigisme and the economy of norway169 alternatively merriamwebster defines state capitalism as an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control170 friedrich engels in socialism utopian and scientific argued that stateowned enterprises would characterize the final stage of capitalism consisting of ownership and management of largescale production and communication by the bourgeois state171 in his writings vladimir lenin characterized the economy of soviet russia as state capitalist believing state capitalism to be an early step toward the development of socialism172173 some economists and leftwing academics including richard d wolff and noam chomsky argue that the economies of the former soviet union and eastern bloc represented a form of state capitalism because their internal organization within enterprises and the system of wage labor remained intact174175176 the term is not used by austrian school economists to describe state ownership of the means of production the economist ludwig von mises argued that the designation of state capitalism was simply a new label for the old labels of state socialism and planned economy and differed only in nonessentials from these earlier designations177 the debate between proponents of private versus state capitalism is centered around questions of managerial efficacy productive efficiency and fair distribution of wealth corporate capitalismedit main article corporate capitalism see also state monopoly capitalism and crony capitalism corporate capitalism is a free or mixedmarket economy characterized by the dominance of hierarchical bureaucratic corporations mixed economyedit main article mixed economy see also economic interventionism a mixed economy is a largely marketbased economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and economic interventionism through macroeconomic policies intended to correct market failures reduce unemployment and keep inflation low the degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries some mixed economies such as france under dirigisme also featured a degree of indirect economic planning over a

community capitalism neocapitalism state monopoly capitalism welfare capitalism supercapitalism technocapitalism role of governmentedit further information competition regulator consumer protection and competition law in a capitalist system the government does not prohibit private property or prevent individuals from working where they please the government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products however many countries have minimum wage laws and minimum safety standards under some versions of capitalism the government carries out a number of economic functions such as issuing money supervising public utilities and enforcing private contracts many countries have competition laws that prohibit monopolies and cartels from forming despite antimonopoly laws large corporations can form nearmonopolies in some industries such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market and then raise them again once the threat of entry is reduced in many countries public utilities eg electricity heating fuel communications are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation due to high economies of scale government agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries such as airlines and broadcasting as well as financing a wide range of programs in addition the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control factors such as inflation and unemployment179 adverse characteristics of capitalist governmentsedit democratic socialists argue that the role of the state in a capitalist society is to defend the interests of the bourgeoisie180 these governments take actions to implement such things as unified national markets national currencies and customs system180 capitalist governments have also been criticised as oligarchic in nature181 due to the inevitable inequality182183 characteristic of economic progress184185 criticismedit further information opposition to capitalism and criticism of capitalism the industrial workers of the world poster pyramid of

alienation economic inequality unemployment and economic instability186 many socialists consider capitalism to be irrational in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions187188 capitalism and individual property rights have been associated with the tragedy of the anticommons where owners are unable to agree marxian economist richard d wolff postulates that capitalist economies prioritize profits and capital accumulation over the social needs of communities and capitalist enterprises rarely include the workers in the basic decisions of the enterprise189 some labor historians and scholars have argued that unfree labor – by slaves indentured servants prisoners or other coerced persons – is compatible with capitalist relations tom brass argued that unfree labor is acceptable to capital190191 historian greg grandin argues that capitalism has its origins in slavery when historians talk about the atlantic market revolution they are talking about capitalism and when they are talking about capitalism they are talking about slavery192 historian edward e baptist claims that slavery was an integral component in the violent development of american and global capitalism193 according to immanuel wallerstein institutional racism has been one of the most significant pillars of the capitalist system and serves as the ideological justification for the hierarchization of the workforce and its highly unequal distributions of reward194 many aspects of capitalism have come under attack from the antiglobalization movement which is primarily opposed to corporate capitalism environmentalists have argued that capitalism requires continual economic growth and that it will inevitably deplete the finite natural resources of earth and cause mass extinctions of animal and plant life195196197 such critics argue that while this neoliberalism or contemporary capitalism has indeed increased global trade it has also destroyed traditional ways of life exacerbated inequality and increased global poverty – with more living today in abject poverty than before neoliberalism and that environmental indicators indicate massive environmental degradation since the late 1970s20198199 some scholars blame the financial crisis of 2007–08 on the neoliberal capitalist model206 following the banking crisis of 2007 alan greenspan told the united states congress on 23 october 2008 the whole intellectual edifice collapsed i made a mistake in presuming that the selfinterests of organizations specifically banks and others were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders i was shocked207 many religions have criticized or opposed specific elements of capitalism traditional judaism christianity and islam forbid lending money at interest208209 although alternative methods of banking have been developed some christians have criticized capitalism for its materialist aspects and its inability to account for the wellbeing of all people210 many of jesus parables deal with economic concerns farming shepherding being in debt doing hard labor being excluded from banquets and the houses of the rich and have implications for wealth and power distribution211212 catholic scholars and clergy have often criticized capitalism because of its disenfranchisement of the poor often promoting distributism as an alternative in his 84page apostolic exhortation evangelii gaudium catholic pope francis described unfettered capitalism as a new tyranny and called on world leaders to fight rising poverty and inequality213 some people continue to defend trickledown theories which assume that economic growth encouraged by a free market will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world this opinion which has never been confirmed by the facts expresses a crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system meanwhile the excluded are still waiting214 proponents of capitalism argue that it creates more prosperity than any other economic system and that its benefits are mainly to the ordinary person215 critics of capitalism variously associate it with economic instability216 an inability to provide for the wellbeing of all people217 and an unsustainable danger to the natural environment195 socialists maintain that although capitalism is superior to all previously existing economic systems such as feudalism or slavery the contradiction between class interests will only be resolved by advancing into a completely new social system of production and distribution in which all persons have an equal relationship to the means of production218 the term capitalism in its modern sense is often attributed to karl marx43219 in his magnum opus capital marx analysed the capitalist mode of production using a method of understanding today known as marxism however marx himself rarely used the term capitalism while it was used twice in the more political interpretations of his work primarily authored by his collaborator friedrich engels in the 20th century defenders of the capitalist system often replaced the term capitalism with phrases such as free enterprise and private enterprise and replaced capitalist with rentier and investor in reaction to the negative connotations associated with capitalism103 profit motiveedit the majority of criticisms against the profit motive centre on the idea that profits should not supersede the needs of people michael moores film sicko for example attacks the healthcare industry for its alleged emphasis on profits at the expense of patients220 moore explains we should have no talk of profit when it comes to helping people who are sick the profit motive should be nowhere involved in this and you know what its not fair to the insurance companies either because they have a fiduciary responsibility to make as much money as they can for their shareholders well the way they make more money is to deny claims or to kick people off the rolls or to not even let people on the rolls because they have a preexisting condition you know all of that is wrong221 another common criticism of the profit motive is that it is believed to encourage selfishness and greed critics of the profit motive contend that companies disregard morals or public safety in the pursuit of profits222 freemarket economists counter that the profit motive coupled with competition actually reduces the final price of an item for consumption rather than raising it they argue that businesses profit by selling a good at a lower price and at a greater volume than the competition economist thomas sowell uses supermarkets as an example to illustrate this point “it has been estimated that a supermarket makes a clear profit of about a penny on a dollar of sales if that sounds pretty skimpy remember that it is collecting that penny on every dollar at several cash registers simultaneously and in many cases around the clock”223 us economist milton friedman has argued that greed and selfinterest are universal human traits on a 1979 episode of the phil donahue show friedman states “the world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests” he continues by explaining that only in capitalist countries where individuals can pursue their own selfinterest people have been able to escape from “grinding poverty”224 marxian responsesedit main article

thought socialist economics critiques of capitalism economics portal marxism portal v t e marx considered capitalism to be a historically specific mode of production the way in which the productive property is owned and controlled combined with the corresponding social relations between individuals based on their connection with the process of production42 the capitalist stage of development or bourgeois society for marx represented the most advanced form of social organization to date but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide socialist or communist transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic then capitalist and finally working class rule was reached225226 following adam smith marx distinguished the use value of commodities from their exchange value in the market capital according to marx is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases for marx the use of labor power had itself become a commodity under capitalism the exchange value of labor power as reflected in the wage is less than the value it produces for the capitalist this difference in values he argues constitutes surplus value which the capitalists extract and accumulate in his book capital marx argues that the capitalist mode of production is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers – all prior class societies had extracted surplus labor but capitalism was new in doing so via the salevalue of produced commodities227 he argues that a core requirement of a capitalist society is that a large portion of the population must not possess sources of selfsustenance that would allow them to be independent and are instead forced to sell their labor for a wage228229230 in conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was marxs belief that the working class due to its relationship to the means of production and numerical superiority under capitalism would be the driving force behind the socialist revolution231 this argument is intertwined with marx version of the labor theory of value arguing that labor is the source of all value and thus of profit vladimir lenin in imperialism the highest stage of capitalism 1916 further developed marxist theory and argued that capitalism necessarily led to monopoly capitalism and the export of capital – which he also called imperialism – to find new markets and resources representing the last and highest stage of capitalism232 some 20thcentury marxian economists consider capitalism to be a social formation where capitalist class processes dominate but are not exclusive233 capitalist class processes to these thinkers are simply those in which surplus labor takes the form of surplus value usable as capital other tendencies for utilization of labor nonetheless exist simultaneously in existing societies where capitalist processes predominate however other late marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is extracted even if this surplus is not produced by capitalist activity as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in noncapitalist economic activity234 in limits to capital 1982 david harvey outlines an overdetermined spatially restless capitalism coupled with the spatiality of crisis formation and resolution235 harvey used marxs theory of crisis to aid his argument that capitalism must have its fixes but that we cannot predetermine what fixes will be implemented nor in what form they will be his work on contractions of capital accumulation and international movements of capitalist modes of production and money flows has been influential236 according to harvey capitalism creates the conditions for volatile and geographically uneven development 237 sociologists such as ulrich beck envisioned the society of risk as a new cultural value which saw risk as a commodity to be exchanged in globalized economies this theory suggested that disasters and capitalist economy were inevitably entwined disasters allow the introduction of economic programs which otherwise would be rejected as well as decentralizing the class structure in production238 however philosopher maximiliano korstanje coined the term thanacapitalism to refer to a climate of social darwinism aimed at fostering the survival of the strongest in this climate of struggle only a few win while the rest lose social darwinism is seen as a metaphor explaining our obsession with consumer news and with images related to terrorism attacks traumascapes and disasters korstanje writes that the society of risk has gradually set the pace to a new society of thanacapitalism where the main commodity is death not only do we consume death everywhere in the entertainment industry newspapers and media but in so doing we reinforce our superiority by witnessing the suffering of others korstanje sees the story of noahs ark as an allegory for what he dubbed the first genocide in this mythical event god divided the world in two parts the victims and the witnesses this logic of the supremacy of those who live over those who die is reinforced by christ´s crucifixion today new emergent segments in the tourist industry are oriented to travel to places where mass deaths or traumatic event have occurred korstanje suggests that in secularized societies death is a sign of weakness and consuming the deaths of others revitalizes the hopes of visitors to enter “the hall of chosen peoples239240 supply and demandedit at least two assumptions are necessary for the validity of the standard model first that supply and demand are independent second that supply is constrained by a fixed resource if these conditions do not hold then the marshallian model cannot be sustained sraffas critique focused on the inconsistency except in implausible circumstances of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good241 the notability of sraffas critique is also demonstrated by paul a samuelsons comments and engagements with it over many years for example what a cleanedup version of sraffa 1926 establishes is how nearly empty are all of marshalls partial equilibrium boxes to a logical purist of wittgenstein and sraffa class the marshallian partial equilibrium box of constant cost is even more empty than the box of increasing cost242 aggregate excess demand in a market is the difference between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as a function of price in the model with an upwardsloping supply curve and downwardsloping demand curve the aggregate excess demand function only intersects the axis at one point namely at the point where the supply and demand curves intersect the sonnenschein–mantel–debreu theorem shows that the standard model cannot be rigorously derived in general from general equilibrium theory243 the model of prices being determined by supply and demand assumes perfect competition but economists have no adequate model of how individuals and firms adjust prices in a competitive model if all participants are pricetakers by definition then the actor who adjusts prices to eliminate excess demand is not specified244 goodwin nelson ackerman and weisskopf write if we mistakenly confuse precision with accuracy then we might be misled into thinking that an explanation expressed in precise mathematical or graphical terms is somehow more rigorous or useful than one that takes into account particulars of history institutions or business strategy this is not the case therefore it is important not to put too much confidence in the apparent precision of supply and demand graphs supply and demand analysis is a useful precisely formulated conceptual tool that clever people have devised to help us gain an abstract understanding of a complex world it does not – nor should it be expected to – give us in addition an accurate and complete description of any particular real world market245 countercriticismsedit austrian schooledit austrian school economists have argued that capitalism can organise itself into a complex system without an external guidance or central planning mechanism friedrich hayek considered the phenomenon of selforganisation as underpinning capitalism prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfilled wants of people and the opportunity to earn profits if successful or absorb losses if resources are used poorly or left idle gives entrepreneurs incentive to use their knowledge and resources to satisfy those wants thus the activities of millions of people each seeking his own interest are coordinated246 ayn randedit the novelist and philosopher ayn rand made positive moral defenses of laissezfaire capitalism most notably in her 1957 novel atlas shrugged and in her 1966 collection of essays capitalism the unknown ideal she argued that capitalism should be supported on moral grounds not just on the basis of practical benefits247248 her ideas have had significant influence over conservative and libertarian supporters of capitalism especially within the american tea party movement249 rand defined capitalism as a social system based on the recognition of individual rights including property rights in which all property is privately owned250 according to rand the role of government in a capitalist state has three broad categories of proper functions first the police to protect men from criminals second the armed services to protect men from foreign invaders third the law courts to settle disputes among men according to objective laws251 economic growthedit worlds gdp per capita shows exponential growth since the beginning of the industrial revolution252 capitalism and the economy of the peoples republic of china many theorists and policymakers in predominantly capitalist nations have emphasized capitalisms ability to promote economic growth as measured by gross domestic product gdp capacity utilization or standard of living this argument was central for example to adam smiths advocacy of letting a free market control production and price and allocate resources many theorists have noted that this increase in global gdp over time coincides with the emergence of the modern world capitalist system253254 between 1000 and 1820 the world economy grew sixfold a faster rate than the population growth so individuals enjoyed on average a 50 increase in income between 1820 and 1998 world economy grew 50fold a much faster rate than the population growth so individuals enjoyed on average a 9fold increase in income255 in most capitalist economic regions such as europe the united states canada australia and new zealand the economy grew 19fold per person even though these countries already had a higher starting level and in japan which was poor in 1820 the increase per person was 31fold in the third world there was an increase but only 5fold per person255 economic freedomedit in his book the road to serfdom friedrich hayek asserts that the economic freedom of capitalism is a requisite of political freedom he argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion milton friedman andrew brennan and ronald reagan also promoted this view friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by political repression in his view transactions in a market economy are voluntary and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish their power to coerce some of friedmans views were shared by john maynard keynes who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive256257 freedom house an american think tank that conducts international research on and advocates for democracy political freedom and human rights has argued there is a
