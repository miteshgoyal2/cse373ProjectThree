in evolution geddes describes it as a cityregion a chain of interlinked urban or metropolitan areas one prominent north american example of a megalopolis is the northeast megalopolis sometimes called the boswash after the cities on either end it consists of boston providence ri hartford ct greater new york city philadelphia wilmington de baltimore washington dc and their vicinities31 two other prominent megalopolises in north america are as follows in california and baja california ventura county los angeles county orange county san diego county part of riverside county part of san

54 million for the 2000 census and is projected to reach about 65 million by 2025 although much of this area has remained rural due in part to the decline of the rust belt the worlds largest

location of its most important seaports in japan – such as at yokohama osaka kobe hiroshima and kure – and its most important international airports – such as at tokyo and osaka the population of this

projections assume that by 2030 up to 1 billion people will live in chinas urban areas even rather conservative projections predict an urban population of up to 800 million people in its most recent assessment the un population division estimated an urban population of 1 billion in 205032 europe contains numerous large metropolitan areas such as the madrid metropolitan area in spain pop 63

rhineruhr metropolitan region pop 115 million in germany however it is generally considered only to contain one megalopolis best known as the blue banana the concept was developed in 1989 by frenchman roger brunet its precise extent is not universally agreed but it typically stretches from london and the thames estuary down the rhine corridor including the likes of brussels paris and the rhineruhr as far as turin and milan assessments of the total population range from 92 to 110 million depending on the inclusion of the parisian area which was most explicitly excluded by brunet it has been subject to criticism particularly due to the discontinuity caused by the very lowpopulation areas of the alps and the north sea alternative models have also been suggested such as the overlapping golden banana and an emerging english megalopolis comprising most of southeastern england the midlands and parts of northern englandcitation needed indeed using the criterion of population density england as a whole already has a population density of 407 people per square kilometre33 which is higher than the united states northeast megalopolis africas first megalopolis is situated in the urban

area around and between them separated by about 300 km is by far the most urbanized and industrialized in the country and latin america megacity is a general term for metropolitan areas that usually have a total population in excess of ten million people in canada megacity can also refer informally to the results of merging a central city with its suburbs to form one large municipality a canadian megacity however is not necessarily an entirely urbanized area since many of its named cities have both rural and urban portions also 10 million inhabitants is an unreasonably high number for canada moreover canadian megacities do not constitute large metropolitan areas in a global sense for example toronto has a metropolitan population of about five million people but is part of a much larger metropolitan region called the golden horseshoe which has about eight million people the census population of a metro area is not the city population however it better demonstrates the population of the city los angeles may only have a city population of slightly less than four million but depending on the definition it has a metropolitan area population of either 13 million or 18 million people
