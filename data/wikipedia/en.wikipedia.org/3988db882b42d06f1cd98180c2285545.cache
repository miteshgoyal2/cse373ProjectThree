signing a contract or an act with a certain standard of care it can be a legal obligation but the term will more commonly apply to voluntary investigations a common example of due diligence in various industries is the process through which a potential acquirer evaluates a target company or its assets for an acquisition1 the theory behind due diligence holds that performing this type of investigation contributes significantly to informed decision making by enhancing the amount and quality of information available to decision makers and by ensuring that this information is systematically used to deliberate in a reflexive manner on the decision at hand and all its costs benefits and risks2 contents 1 etymology 2 examples 21 business transactions and corporate finance 22 foreign corrupt practices act 23 human rights 24 civil litigation 25 criminal law 3 see also 4 references etymologyedit the term “due diligence” means required carefulness or reasonable care in general usage and has been used in this sense since at least the midfifteenth century3 it became a specialized legal term and later a common business term due to the united states’ securities act of 1933 where the process is called reasonable investigation section 11b3 this act included a defense at section 11 referred to later in legal usage as the “due diligence” defense which could be used by brokerdealers when accused of inadequate disclosure to investors of material information with respect to the purchase of securities in legal and business use the term was soon used for the process itself instead of how it was to be performed so that the original expressions such as exercise due diligence in investigating and investigation carried out with due diligence were soon shortened to due diligence investigation and finally due diligence as long as brokerdealers exercised “due diligence” required carefulness in their investigation into the company whose equity they were selling and as long as they disclosed to the investor what they found they would not be held liable for nondisclosure of information that was not discovered in the process of that investigation the brokerdealer community quickly institutionalized as a standard practice the conducting of due diligence investigations of any stock offerings in which they involved themselves originally the term was limited to public offerings of equity investments but over time it has come to be associated with investigations of private mergers and acquisitions as well examplesedit business transactions and corporate financeedit due diligence takes different forms depending on its purpose the examination of a potential target for merger acquisition privatization or similar corporate finance transaction normally by a buyer this can include self due diligence or “reverse due diligence” ie an assessment of a company usually by a third party on behalf of the company prior to taking the company to market a reasonable investigation focusing on material future matters an examination being achieved by asking certain key questions including how do we buy how do we structure an acquisition and how much do we pay an investigation of current practices of process and policies an examination aiming to make an acquisition decision via the principles of valuation and shareholder value analysis4 the due diligence process framework can be divided into nine distinct areas4 compatibility audit financial audit56 macroenvironment audit56 legalenvironmental audit567 marketing audit56 production audit56 management audit56 information systems audit56 reconciliation audit it is essential that the concepts of valuations shareholder value analysis be linked into a due diligence process this is in order to reduce the number of failed mergers and acquisitions48 in this regard two new audit areas have been incorporated into the due diligence framework4 the compatibility audit which deals with the strategic components of the transaction and in particular the need to add shareholder value and the reconciliation audit which linksconsolidates other audit areas together via a formal valuation in order to test whether shareholder value will be added4 the relevant areas of concern may include the financial legal labor tax it environment and marketcommercial situation of the company other areas include intellectual property real and personal property insurance and liability coverage debt instrument review employee benefits including the affordable care act and labor matters immigration and international transactions91011 areas of focus in due diligence continue to develop with cybersecurity emerging as an area of concern for business acquirers12 due diligence findings impact a number of aspects of the transaction including the purchase price the representations and warranties negotiated in the transaction agreement and the indemnification provided by the sellers due diligence has emerged as a separate profession for accounting and auditing experts foreign corrupt practices actedit with the number and size of penalties increasing the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa is causing many us institutions to look into how they evaluate all of their relationships overseas the lack of a due diligence of a company’s agents vendors and suppliers as well as merger and acquisition partners in foreign countries could lead to doing business with an organization linked to a foreign official or state owned enterprises and their executives this link could be perceived as leading to the bribing of the foreign officials and as a result lead to noncompliance with the fcpa due diligence in regard to fcpa compliance is required in two aspects initial due diligence – this step is necessary in evaluating what risk is involved in doing business with an entity prior to establishing a relationship and assesses risk at that point in time ongoing due diligence – this is the process of periodically evaluating each relationship overseas to find links between current business relationships overseas and ties to a foreign official or illicit activities linked to corruption this process will be performed indefinitely as long as a relationship exists and usually involves comparing the companies and executives to a database of foreign officials this process should be performed on all relationships regardless of location13 and is often part of a wider integrity management initiative not in citation given in the ma context buyers can use the due diligence phase to integrate a target into their internal fcpa controls focusing initial efforts on necessary revisions to the targets business activities with a highrisk of corruption14 while financial institutions are among the most aggressive in defining fcpa best practices manufacturing retailing and energy industries are highly active in managing fcpa compliance programs human rightsedit passed on may 25 2011 the oecd member countries agreed to revise their guidelines promoting tougher standards of corporate behavior including human rights as part of this new definition they utilized a new aspect of due diligence that requires a corporation to investigate third party partners for potential abuse of human rights in the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises document it is stated that all members will “seek ways to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their business operations products or services by a business relationship even if they do not contribute to those impacts”15 the term was originally put forth by un special representative for human rights and business john ruggie who uses it as an umbrella to cover the steps and processes by which a company understands monitors and mitigates its human rights impacts human rights impact assessment is a component of this the un formalized guidelines for human rights due diligence on june 16 with the endorsement of ruggie’s guiding principles for business and human rights16 civil litigationedit due diligence in civil procedure is the idea that reasonable investigation is necessary before certain kinds of relief are requested for example duly diligent efforts to locate andor serve a party with civil process is frequently a requirement for a party seeking to use means other than personal service to obtain jurisdiction over a party similarly in areas of the law such as bankruptcy an attorney representing someone filing a bankruptcy petition must engage in due diligence to determine that the representations made in the bankruptcy petition are factually accurate due diligence is also generally prerequisite to a request for relief in states where civil litigants are permitted to conduct prelitigation discovery of facts necessary to determine whether or not a party has a factual basis for a cause of action in civil actions seeking a foreclosure or seizure of property a party requesting this relief is frequently required to engage in due diligence to determine who may claim an interest in the property by reviewing public records concerning the property and sometimes by a physical inspection of the property that would reveal a possible interest in the property of a tenant or other person due diligence is also a concept found in the civil litigation concept of a statute of limitations frequently a statute of limitations begins to run against a plaintiff when that plaintiff knew or should have known had that plaintiff investigated the matter with due diligence that the plaintiff had a claim against a defendant in this context the term “due diligence” determines the scope of a party’s constructive knowledge upon receiving notice of facts sufficient to constitute “inquiry notice” that alerts a wouldbe plaintiff that further investigation might reveal a cause of action criminal lawedit in criminal law due diligence is the only available defense to a crime that is one of strict liability ie a crime that only requires an actus reus and no mens rea once the criminal offence is proven the defendant must prove on balance that they did everything possible to prevent the act from happening it is not enough that they took the normal standard of care in their industry – they must show that they took every reasonable precaution due diligence is also used in criminal law to describe the scope of the duty of a prosecutor to take efforts to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence to accused criminal defendants in criminal law “due diligence” also identifies the standard a prosecuting entity must satisfy in pursuing an action against a defendant especially with regard to the provision of the federal and state constitutional and statutory right to a speedy trial or to have a warrant or detainer served in an action in cases where a defendant is in any type of custodial situation where their freedom is constrained it is solely the prosecuting entities duty to ensure the provision of such rights and present the citizen before the court with jurisdiction this also applies where the respective judicial system andor prosecuting entity has current address or contact information on the named party and said party has made no attempt to evade notice of the prosecution of the action17 see alsoedit data room virtual
