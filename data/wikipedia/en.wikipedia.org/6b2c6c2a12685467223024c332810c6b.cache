afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior the evenings are reserved for extended bouts of namedropping10 to his piece brooks appended the note some would say im envious of mr buckley but if truth be known i just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking so how about it billy can you spare a dime when buckley arrived to give his talk he asked whether brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job11 early careeredit upon graduation brooks became a police reporter for the city news bureau of chicago a wire service owned

previously mocked including yachting expeditions bach concerts dinners at buckleys park avenue apartment and villa in stamford connecticut and a constant stream of writers politicians and celebrities brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience national review was a catholic magazine and brooks is not catholic sam tanenhaus later reported in the new republic that buckley might have eventually named brooks his successor if it hadnt been for his being jewish if true it would be upsetting brooks says9 after his internship with buckley ended brooks spent some time at the

bobos in paradise the new upper class and how they got there to considerable acclaim the book a paean to consumerism argued that the new managerial or new upper class represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the selfinterest of the 1980s according to a 2010 article in new york magazine written by christopher beam new york times editorialpage editor gail collins called brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist william safire but one who understood how liberals think i was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldnt make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window says collins he was perfect brooks started writing in september 2003 the first six months were miserable brooks says id never been hated on a mass scale before9 in 2004 brooks book on paradise drive how we live now and always have in the future tense was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller bobos in paradise but it was not as well received as its predecessor brooks is also the volume editor of the best american essays publication date october 2 2012 and authored the social animal the hidden sources of love character and achievement12 the book was excerpted in the new yorker magazine in january 201113 and received mixed reviews upon its full publication in march of that

philosophical humility30 in 2012 brooks was elected to the university of chicago board of trustees31 he also serves on the board of advisors for the university of chicago institute of politics32 political viewsedit play media brooks on pbs newshour discussing the us presidential election in 2016 ottawa citizen conservative commentator david warren has identified brooks as a sophisticated pundit one of those republicans who want to engage with the liberal agenda33 when asked what he thinks of charges that hes not a real conservative or squishy brooks has said that if you define conservative by support for the republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems i guess i dont fit that agenda but i do think that im part of a longstanding conservative tradition that has to do with edmund burke and alexander hamilton34 in fact brooks read burkes work while he was an undergraduate at the university of chicago and completely despised it but gradually over the next five to seven years came to agree with him brooks claims that my visceral hatred was because he touched something i didnt like or know about myself35 in september 2012 brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side saying if its from a loon i dont mind it i get a kick out of it if its michelle malkin attacking i dont mind it with respect to whether he was the liberals favorite conservative brooks said he didnt care stating i dont mind liberals praising me but when its the really partisan liberals you get an avalanche of love its like uhhh i gotta rethink this34 brooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before as he put it coming to my senses he recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with nobel laureate freemarket economist milton friedman6 as brooks describes it it was essentially me making a point and he making a twosentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point that didnt immediately turn me into a conservative but36 before the 2003 invasion of iraq brooks argued forcefully for american military intervention echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that american and british forces would be welcomed as liberators3738 in 2005 brooks wrote what columnist jonathan chait described as a witheringly condescending column portraying senator harry reid as an unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the george w bush administration of falsifying its iraq intelligence3940 by 2008 five years into the war brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct but that secretary of defense donald rumsfeld had botched us war efforts41 in 2015 brooks wrote that from the current vantage point the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment made in 2003 by president bush and the majority of americans who supported the war including brooks himself42 brooks wrote many of us thought that by taking down saddam hussein we could end another evil empire and gradually open up human development in iraq and the arab world has that happened in 2004 i would have said yes in 2006 i would have said no in 2015 i say yes and no but mostly no42 citing the robbsilberman report brooks rejected as a fable the idea that intelligence about iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war42 instead brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence writing that the iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty42 his dismissal of the conviction of scooter libby as being a farce and having no significance43 was derided by political blogger andrew sullivan44 on august 10 2006 brooks wrote a column for the new york times titled party no 3 the column imagined a moderate mccainlieberman party in opposition to both major parties which he perceived as polarized and beholden to special interests45 brooks has long been a supporter of john mccain however he disliked mccains 2008 running mate sarah palin calling her a cancer on the republican party46 he has referred to her as a joke unlikely ever to win the republican nomination47 but he later admitted during a cspan interview that he had gone too far in his previous cancer comments about palin which he regretted and simply stated he was not a fan of her values48 in a march 2007 article published in the new york times titled no uturns49 brooks explained that the republican party must distance itself from the minimalgovernment conservative principles that had arisen during the barry goldwater and ronald reagan eras he claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by republicans in order to win elections alex pareene commented that brooks has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible republican party into existence that he cant still think its going to happen soon50 brooks has frequently expressed admiration for president barack obama in an august 2009 profile of brooks the new republic describes his first encounter with obama in the spring of 2005 usually when i talk to senators while they may know a policy area better than me they generally dont know political philosophy better than me i got the sense he knew both better than me i remember distinctly an image of – we were sitting on his couches and i was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant and im thinking a hes going to be president and b hell be a very good president51 brooks appreciates that obama thinks like a writer explaining hes a very writerly personality a little aloof exasperated hes calm hes not addicted to people35 two days after obamas second autobiography the audacity of hope hit bookstores brooks published a column in the new york times titled run barack run urging the chicago politician to run for president52 however in december 2011 during a cspan interview brooks expressed a more tempered opinion of obamas presidency giving obama only a b and saying that obamas chances of reelection would be less than 50–50 if elections were held at that time53 he stated i dont think hes integrated himself with people in washington as much as he should have35 however in a february 2016 new york times oped brooks admitted that he missed obama during the 2016 primary season admiring the presidents integrity and humanity among other characteristics54 in writing for the new york times in january 2010 brooks described israel as an astonishing success story55 he wrote that jews are a famously accomplished group who because they were forced to give up farming in the middle ages have been living off their wits ever since55 in brooks view israels technological success is the fruition of the zionist dream the country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry palestinians in hebron it was founded so jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world5556 in 2015 brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the united states his oped in the new york times titled “the nature of poverty” specifically followed the social uproar caused by the death of freddie gray and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are matters of social psychology57 when discussing gray in particular brooks claimed that gray as a young man was not on the path to upward mobility57 in regards to the 2016 election brooks spoke in support of hillary clinton applauding her ability to be competent and normal in comparison to her republican counterpart donald trump5859 in addition brooks noted that he believed clinton would eventually be victorious in the election as he foresaw that the general american public would become sick of trump5859 when discussing the political emergence of trump brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate most notably by authoring a new york times oped he titled no not trump not ever in this piece brooks attacked trump by arguing he is epically unprepared to be president and by pointing out trumps steady obliviousness to accuracy60 social viewsedit brooks opposes what he sees as selfdestructive behavior such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce his view is that sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life as the entertainment media have become more sexsaturated american teenagers have become more sexually abstemious by waiting longer to have sexand having fewer partners he sees the culture war as nearly over because todays young peopleseem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right as a result he is optimistic about the united states social stability which he considers to be in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair61 as early as 2003 brooks wrote favorably of samesex marriage pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value rather than opposing it he wrote we should insist on gay marriage we should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity its going to be up to conservatives to make the important moral case for marriage including gay marriage62 brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion which he thinks should be legal but with parental consent for minors during the first four or five months and illegal afterward except in extremely rare circumstances63 on the legalization of drugs he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana advocating that it encourages morally reprovable behavior brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech64 criticismsedit brooks writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on stereotypes and presenting false claims as factual6566 in 2004 sasha issenberg writing for philadelphia magazine factchecked bobos in paradise concluding that many of its comments about middle america were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth67 he reported brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like he laughedthe book was partially tongueincheeki went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable he accused me of being too pedantic of taking all of this too literally of taking a joke and distorting it thats totally unethical he said brooks later said the article made him feel that i sucki cant remember what i said but my mother told me i was extremely stupid9 in 2015 salon found that brooks had got nearly every detail wrong about a poll of highschool students68 michael kinsley argued that brooks was guilty of fearless generalizing brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke69 writing for gawker which consistently criticized brooks work opinion writer tom scocca argued that brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions noting possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief70 furthermore annie lowrey in writing for the new york magazine criticized brooks’ statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform claiming he used some very tricksy misleading math71 additionally sean illing of slate criticized the same article from brooks claiming he argued his point by framing his sources arguments out of context and routinely making bold halfright assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform72 in 2016 james taranto criticized73 brooks analysis74 of a us supreme court case75 writing that brookss treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant73 law professor ann althouse concurred that brooks distorts rather grotesquely the case in question76 brooks was previously criticized by lyle denniston with regard to another case for having scrambled the actual significance of what the supreme court has done77 legacyedit sidney awardsedit this article is about the sidney awards given each december
