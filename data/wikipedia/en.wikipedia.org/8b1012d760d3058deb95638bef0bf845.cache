pacific ocean and part of the salish sea it is a complex estuarine3 system of interconnected marine waterways and basins with one major and two minor connections to the open pacific ocean via the strait of juan de fuca — admiralty inlet being the major connection and deception pass and swinomish channel being the minor water flow through deception pass is approximately equal to 2 of the total tidal exchange between puget sound and the strait of juan de fuca1 puget sound extends approximately 100 miles 160 km from deception pass in the north to olympia washington in the south its average depth is 450 feet 140 m4 and its maximum depth off jefferson point between indianola and kingston is 930 feet 280 m the depth of the main basin between the southern tip of whidbey island and tacoma washington is approximately 600 feet 180 m1 since 2009 the term salish sea has been established by the united states board on geographic names as the collective waters of puget sound the strait of juan de fuca and the strait of georgia sometimes the terms puget sound and puget sound and adjacent waters are used for not only puget sound proper but also for waters to the north such as bellingham bay and the san juan islands region5 the term puget sound is used not just for the body of water but also the puget sound region centered on the sound major cities on the sound include seattle tacoma olympia and everett washington puget sound is also the second largest estuary in the united states behind chesapeake bay6 contents 1 names 2 definitions 3 geology 4 hydrology 5 flora and fauna 6

waters south of the tacoma narrows in honor of peter puget a huguenot lieutenant accompanying him on the vancouver expedition this name later came to be used for the waters north of tacoma narrows as well7 an alternative term for puget sound still used by some native americans and environmental groups is whulge or whulj an anglicization of the lushootseed name x̌ʷə́lč which means sea salt water ocean or sound8 definitionsedit the usgs defines puget sound as all the waters south of three entrances from the strait of juan de fuca the main entrance at admiralty inlet is defined as a line between point wilson on the olympic peninsula and point partridge on whidbey island the second entrance is at deception pass along a line from west point on whidbey island to deception island then to rosario head on fidalgo island the third entrance is at the south end of the swinomish channel which connects skagit bay and padilla bay9 under this definition puget sound includes the waters of hood canal admiralty inlet possession sound saratoga passage and others it does not include bellingham bay padilla bay the waters of the san juan islands or anything farther north another definition given by noaa subdivides puget sound into five basins or regions four of these including south puget sound correspond to areas within the usgs definition but the fifth one called northern puget sound includes a large additional region it is defined as bounded to the north by the international boundary with canada and to the west by a line running north from the mouth of the sekiu river on the olympic peninsula10 under this definition significant parts of the strait of juan de fuca and the strait of georgia are included in puget sound with the international boundary marking an abrupt and hydrologically arbitrary limit according to arthur kruckeberg the term puget sound is sometimes used for waters north of admiralty inlet and deception pass especially for areas along the north coast of washington and the san juan islands essentially equivalent to noaas northern puget sound subdivision described above kruckeberg uses the term puget sound and adjacent waters5 geologyedit snowcapped peaks are a backdrop to many puget sound scenes here mount rainier is seen from gig harbor continental ice sheets have repeatedly advanced and retreated from the puget sound region the most recent glacial period called the fraser glaciation had three phases or stades during the third or vashon glaciation a lobe of the cordilleran ice sheet called the puget lobe spread south about 15000 years ago covering the puget sound region with an ice sheet about 3000 feet 910 m thick near seattle and nearly 6000 feet 1800 m at the present canadaus border since each new advance and retreat of ice erodes away much of the evidence of previous ice ages the most recent vashon phase has left the clearest imprint on the land at its maximum extent the vashon ice sheet extended south of olympia to near tenino and covered the lowlands between the olympic and cascade mountain ranges about 14000 years ago the ice began to retreat by 11000 years ago it survived only north of the canada–us border11 the melting retreat of the vashon glaciation eroded the land creating a drumlin field of hundreds of aligned drumlin hills lake washington and lake sammamish which are ribbon lakes hood canal and the main puget sound basin were altered by glacial forces these glacial forces are not specifically carving as in cutting into the landscape via the mechanics of iceglaciers but rather eroding the landscape from melt water of the vashon glacier creating the drumlin field as the ice retreated vast amounts of glacial till were deposited throughout the puget sound region11 the soils of the region less than ten thousand years old are still characterized as immature as the vashon glacier receded a series of proglacial lakes formed filling the main trough of puget sound and inundating the southern lowlands glacial lake russell was the first such large recessional lake from the vicinity of seattle in the north the lake extended south to the black hills where it drained south into the chehalis river12 sediments from lake russell form the bluegray clay identified as the lawton clay the second major recessional lake was glacial lake bretz it also drained to the chehalis river until the chimacum valley in the northeast olympic peninsula melted allowing the lakes water to rapidly drain north into the marine waters of the strait of juan de fuca which was rising as the ice sheet retreated12 as icebergs calved off the toe of the glacier their embedded gravels and boulders were deposited in the chaotic mix of unsorted till geologists call glaciomarine drift many beaches about the sound display glacial erratics rendered more prominent than those in coastal woodland solely by their exposed position submerged glacial erratics sometimes cause hazards to navigation the sheer weight of glacialage ice depressed the landforms which experienced postglacial rebound after the ice sheets had retreated because the rate of rebound was not synchronous with the postice age rise in sea levels the bed of what is puget sound filled alternately with fresh and with sea water the upper level of the lakesediment lawton clay now lies about 120 feet 37 m above sea level the puget sound system consists of four deep basins connected by shallower sills the four basins are hood canal west of the kitsap peninsula whidbey basin east of whidbey island south sound south of the tacoma narrows and the main basin which is further subdivided into admiralty inlet and the central basin13 puget sounds sills a kind of submarine terminal moraine separate the basins from one another and puget sound from the strait of juan de fuca three sills are particularly significant—the one at admiralty inlet which checks the flow of water between the strait of juan de fuca and puget sound the one at the entrance to hood canal about 175 ft or 53 m below the surface and the one at the tacoma narrows about 145 ft or 44 m other sills that present less of a barrier include the ones at blake island agate pass rich passage and hammersley inlet5 the depth of the basins is a result of the sound being part of the cascadia subduction zone where the terranes accreted at the edge of the juan de fuca plate are being subducted under the north american plate there has not been a major subduction zone earthquake here since the magnitude nine cascadia earthquake according to japanese records it occurred 26 january 1700 lesser puget sound earthquakes with shallow epicenters caused by the fracturing of stressed oceanic rocks as they are subducted still cause great damage the seattle fault cuts across puget sound crossing the southern tip of bainbridge island and under elliott bay14 to the south the existence of a second fault the tacoma fault has buckled the intervening strata in the seattle uplift typical puget sound profiles of dense glacial till overlying permeable glacial outwash of gravels above an impermeable bed of silty clay may become unstable after periods of unusually wet weather and slump in landslides15 hydrologyedit low tide on whidbey island the united states geological survey usgs defines puget sound as a bay with numerous channels and branches more specifically it is a fjord system of flooded glacial valleys puget sound is part of a larger physiographic structure termed the puget trough which is a physiographic section of the larger pacific border province which in turn is part of the larger pacific mountain system16 puget sound is a large salt water estuary or system of many estuaries fed by highly seasonal freshwater from the olympic and cascade mountain watersheds the mean annual river discharge into puget sound is 41000 cubic feet per second 1200 m3s with a monthly average maximum of about 367000 cubic feet per second 10400 m3s and minimum of about 14000 cubic feet per second 400 m3s puget sounds shoreline is 1332 miles 2144 km long encompassing a water area of 1020 square miles 2600 km2 and a total volume of 265 cubic miles 110 km3 at mean high water the average volume of water flowing in and out of puget sound during each tide is 126 cubic miles 53 km3 the maximum tidal currents in the range of 9 to 10 knots occurs at deception pass1 evening on puget sound by edward s curtis 1913 the size of puget sounds watershed is 12138 sq mi 31440 km22 northern puget sound is frequently considered part of the puget sound watershed which enlarges its size to 13700 sq mi 35000 km217 the usgs uses the name puget sound for its hydrologic unit subregion 1711 which includes areas draining to puget sound proper as well as the strait of juan de fuca the strait of georgia and the fraser river18 significant rivers that drain to northern puget sound include the nooksack dungeness and elwha rivers the nooksack empties into bellingham bay the dungeness and elwha into the strait of juan de fuca the chilliwack river flows north to the fraser river in canada tides in puget sound are of the mixed type with two high and two low tides each tidal day these are called higher high water hhw lower low water llw lower high water lhw and higher low water hlw the configuration of basins sills and interconnections cause the tidal range to increase within puget sound the difference in height between the higher high water and the lower low water averages about 83 feet 25 m at port townsend on admiralty inlet but increases to about 144 feet 44 m at olympia the southern end of puget sound1 puget sound is generally accepted as the start of the inside passage1920 mount rainier looms over the still waters of totten inlet one

sound washington territory 1867 puget sound washington george vancouver explored puget sound in 1792 vancouver claimed it for great britain on 4 june 1792 naming it for one of his officers lieutenant peter puget36 after 1818 britain and the united states which both claimed the oregon country agreed to joint occupancy deferring resolution of the oregon boundary dispute until the 1846 oregon treaty puget sound was part of the disputed region until 1846 after which it became us territory american maritime fur traders visited puget sound in the early 19th century37 the first european settlement in the puget sound area was fort nisqually a fur trade post of the hudsons bay company hbc built in 183338 fort nisqually was part of the hbcs columbia district headquartered at fort vancouver the puget sound agricultural company a subsidiary of the hbc established farms and ranches near fort nisqually british ships such as the beaver exported foodstuffs and provisions from fort nisqually39 the first american settlement on puget sound was tumwater it was founded in 1845 by americans who had come via the oregon trail the decision to settle north of the columbia river was made in part because one of the settlers george washington bush was considered black and the provisional government of oregon banned the residency of mulattoes but did not actively enforce the restriction north of the river40 in 1853 washington territory was formed from part of oregon territory41 in 1888 the northern pacific railroad line reached puget sound linking the region to eastern states42 transportationedit a unique

puget sound in the past 30 years there has been a large recession in the populations of the species which inhabit puget sound the decrease has been seen in the populations of forage fish salmonids bottom fish marine birds harbor porpoise and orcas this decline is attributed to the various environmental issues in puget soundcitation needed because of this population decline there have been changes to the fishery practices and an increase in petitioning to add species to the endangered species act there has also been an increase in recovery and management plans for many different area species43 the causes of these environmental issues are toxic contamination eutrophication low oxygen due to excess nutrients and near shore habitat changes43 prominent islandsedit anderson island
