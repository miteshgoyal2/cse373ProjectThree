wind power density class as a general rule economic wind generators require windspeed of 45 ms 16 kmh or greater an ideal location would have a near constant flow of nonturbulent wind throughout the year with a minimum likelihood of sudden powerful bursts of wind an important factor of turbine siting is also access to local demand or transmission capacity usually sites are screened on the basis of a wind atlas and validated with wind measurements meteorological wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential23 in order to finance the project4 local winds are often monitored for a year or more and detailed wind maps constructed before wind generators are installed the wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag the increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography surface roughness and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings typically the increase of wind speeds with increasing height follows a wind profile power law which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude doubling the altitude of a turbine then increases the expected wind speeds by 10 and the expected power by 34 in general a distance of 7d 7 × rotor diameter of the wind turbine is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm5 but micrositing optimizes placement particularly in hilly areas individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage usually 345 kv power collection system and communications network at a substation this mediumvoltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage transmission system construction of a landbased wind farm requires installation of the collector system and substation and possibly access roads to each turbine site first wind farm

this is done to exploit the topographic acceleration as the wind accelerates over a ridge the additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines the exact position of each turbine matters because a difference of 30m could potentially double output this careful placement is referred to as micrositing offshore installationsedit offshore

offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance because water has less surface roughness than land especially deeper water the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water capacity factors utilisation rates are considerably higher than for onshore locations43 the province of ontario in canada is pursuing several proposed locations in the great lakes including the suspended44 trillium power wind 1 approximately 20 km from shore and over 400 mw in size45 other canadian projects include one on the

glasgow scotland which has a total capacity of 539 mw an important limiting factor of wind power is variable power generated by wind farms in most locations the wind blows only part of the time which means that there has to be backup capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing to address this issue it has been proposed to create a supergrid to connect national grids together72 across western europe ranging from denmark across the southern north sea to england and the celtic sea to ireland and further south to france and spain especially in higueruela which was considered for some time the biggest wind farm in the world73 the idea is that by the time a low pressure area has moved away from denmark to the baltic sea the next low appears off the coast of ireland therefore while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time it will always be blowing somewhere indiaedit progress in indias installed wind power

criticismedit public perception is that renewable energies such as wind solar biomass and geothermal are having a significant positive impact on global warming100 all of these sources combined only supplied 13 of global energy in 2013 as 8 billion tonnes of coal was burned annually101 one of the biggest factors inhibiting wind farm construction is human opposition a study has shown102 turbine placement close to residents may heighten their uncertainty and concern of the wind turbines and overshadow any positive inclinations towards the development wind farm development is affected by the emphasis being primarily placed on the domain of landscape assessment and environmental impact when seeking farm sites the viability and efficiency of the wind farm are barely touched upon instead falling to the developer for example sturge et al103 of the university of sheffield wrote that in many countries where wind energy is becoming popular engineering aspects specifically energy yield are not being taken into consideration either by the public or in the process of planning consent for wind farm development as energy is the main purpose of wind farms a lack of attention given to the subject could be detrimental to the general acceptance of wind farms environmental impactedit main article environmental impact of wind power livestock ignore wind turbines104 and continue to graze as they did before wind turbines were installed compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor105 wind power consumes no fuel and emits no air pollution unlike fossil fuel power sources the energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months105 while a wind farm may cover a large area of land many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use106 there are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures the scale of the ecological impact may107 or may not be significant108 depending on specific circumstances the estimated number of bird deaths caused by wind turbines in the united states is between 140000 and 328000 whereas deaths caused by domestic cats in the united states are estimated to be between 13 and 40 billion birds each year and over 100 million birds are killed in the united states each year by impact with windows108 prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities and protection of peat bogs affect the siting and operation of wind turbines109 human healthedit see also health effects from noise there have been multiple scientific peerreviewed studies into wind farm noise which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for wind turbine syndrome although some suggest further research might still be useful110 a 2007 report by the us national research council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a halfmile or so lowfrequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from windturbine noise is highly variable among humanscitation needed there are opposing views on this subject and more research needs to be done on the effects of lowfrequency noise on humans111 in a 2009 report about rural wind farms a standing committee of the parliament of new south wales australia recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses which can be waived by the affected neighbour as a precautionary approach112 a 2014 paper suggests that the wind turbine syndrome is mainly caused by the nocebo effect and other psychological mechanisms108113 effect on power gridedit see also wind power § electricity generation utilityscale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy the wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line114 the company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether to hold on to the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like ge for examplecitation needed ground radar interferenceedit wind farm interference in yellow circle on radar map wind farms can interfere with ground radar systems used for military weather and air traffic control the large rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern115 actual aircraft and weather patterns around wind farms can be accurately detected as there is no fundamental physical constraint preventing that but aging radar infrastructure is significantly challenged with the task116117 the us military is using wind turbines on some bases including barstow near the radar test facility118119 effectsedit the level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbinesaircraft with respect to the radar an aircraft flying above the wind farms turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning120 issues include masking shadowing clutter noise and signal alteration121 radar issues have stalled as much as 10000 mw of projects in usa122 some very long range radars are not affected by wind farms123 mitigationedit permanent problem solving include a noninitiation window to hide the turbines while still tracking aircraft over the wind farm and a similar method mitigates the false returns124 englands newcastle airport is using a shortterm mitigation to blank the turbines on the radar map with a software patch125 wind turbine blades using stealth technology are being developed to mitigate radar reflection problems for aviation126127128129 as well as stealth windfarms the future development of infill radar systems could filter out the turbine interference in early 2011 the us government awarded a program to build a radarwind turbine analysis tool this tool will allow developers to predict the impact of a wind farm on a radar system before construction thus allowing rearrangement of the turbines or even the entire wind farm to avoid negative impacts on the radar system120130 a mobile radar system the lockheed martin tps77 has shown in recent tests that it can distinguish between aircraft and wind turbines and more than 170 tps77 radars are in use around the world in britain the lockheed martin tps77 system was to be installed at trimingham in norfolk to remove military objections to a series of offshore wind farms in the north sea a second tps77 was to be installed in the scottish borders overcoming objections to a 48turbine wind farm at fallago131 radio reception interferenceedit there are also reports of negative effects on radio and television reception in wind farm communities potential solutions include predictive interference modeling as a component of site selection132133134 agricultureedit a 2010 study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades135 in another study an analysis carried out on corn and soybean crops in the central areas of the united states noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves even at the height of summer heat the lowering of 25–3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades can make a difference for the cultivation of corn136 see alsoedit renewable energy portal sustainable development portal renewable energy commercialisation sea breeze sustainable energy wave
