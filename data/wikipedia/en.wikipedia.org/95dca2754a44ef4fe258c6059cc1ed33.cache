to do to this industry what walmart did to theirs starbucks did to theirs costco did to theirs and lowes home depot did to their industry and i think if we’ve done our job five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank178 killingers goal was to build wamu into the walmart of banking which would cater to lower and middleclass consumers that other banks deemed too risky complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing a strategy the bank extended in big cities including chicago new york and los angeles wamu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets wamu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than 10000 for bringing in borrowers variablerate loans — option adjustable rate mortgages option arms in particular — were especially attractive because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed wamu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred as wamu was selling many of its loans to investors it worried less about defaults9178 subprime lossesedit the washington mutual tower center right in downtown seattle was washington mutuals corporate headquarters from 1988 until 2006 when the company moved into the new wamu center center left these buildings have since been renamed washington mutual tower is now known as 1201 third avenue and wamu center is now known as russell investments center in december 2007 the subsidiary washington mutual bank reorganized its homeloan division closing 160 of its 336 homeloan offices and removing 2600 positions in its homeloan staff a 22 reduction179 in march 2008 on the same weekend that jpmorgan chase chairman and ceo jamie dimon negotiated the takeover of bear stearns he secretly dispatched members of his team to seattle to meet with wamu executives urging them to consider a quick deal however wamu chairman and ceo kerry killinger rejected jpmorgan chases offer that valued wamu at 8 a share mostly in stock9178 in april 2008 the holding company responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis announced that 3000 people companywide would lose their jobs and the company stated its intent to close its approximately 176 remaining standalone homeloan offices including 23 in washington and a loanprocessing center in bellevue washington it stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as wholesale lending wamu also announced a 7 billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by tpg capital tpg agreed to pump 2 billion into the washington mutual holding company other investors including some of wamus current institutional holders agreed to buy an additional 5 billion in newly issued stock this angered many investors as tpgs investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders and as wamu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses180 in june 2008 kerry killinger stepped down as the chairman though remaining the chief executive officer181 on september 8 2008 under pressure from investors the washington mutual holding companys board of directors dismissed killinger as the ceo alan h fishman chairman of mortgage broker meridian capital group and a former chief operating officer of sovereign bank was named the new ceo for 17 days182 seizure by ots and fdicedit by midseptember 2008 wamus share price had closed as low as 200 it had been worth over 3000 in september 2007 and had briefly traded as high as 45 in the previous year183 while wamu publicly insisted it could stay independent earlier in the month it had quietly hired goldman sachs to identify potential bidders however several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid16 at the same time wamu suffered a massive run mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfercitation needed customers pulled out 167 billion in deposits in a tenday span184 this led the federal reserve and the treasury department to step up pressure for wamu to find a buyer as a takeover by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic could have been a severe drain on the fdic insurance fund which had already been hard hit by the failure of indymac that year the fdic ultimately held a secret auction of washington mutual bank finally on the morning of thursday september 25 which happened to be the 119th anniversary of wamus establishment regulators informed jpmorgan chase that they were the winners16 on thursday night shortly after the close of business on the west coast the office of thrift supervision seized washington mutual bank and placed it into the receivership of the fdic in a statement the ots said that the massive run meant that wamu was no longer sound184 the fdic as receiver sold most of washington mutual banks assets including the branch network to jpmorgan chase for 19 billion jpmorgan agreed to assume the banks secured debts and liabilities to depositors the transaction did not require any fdic insurance funds185 normally bank seizures take place after the close of business on fridays however due to the banks deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent regulators felt compelled to act a day early16 because jpmorgan chase bought washington mutuals assets for a low price wamus stockholders were nearly wiped out its stock price dropped to 016 a share far from 45 a share in 2007183 in its chapter 11 filing wamu listed assets of 33 billion and debt of 8 billion ref appendix a the filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors within days of the seizure a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist mike stathis of ava investment analytics issued a formal complaint to the securities and exchange commission demonstrating evidence of insider trading the complaint also alleged that washington mutual was not insolvent and several wall street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock he also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the associated press who told him that he was contacted by a washington mutual executive hours before the seizure telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons” in later criticisms stathis discussed that neither the fdic nor ots ever disclosed any evidence of washington mutuals insolvency186 stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning as a result of this stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the sec complaint into the public domain until a year later187188 shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of washington mutual through such websites as wamucoupcom dead link and others claiming that the ots acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of jpmorgan chase which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the ots 2 weeks earlier189 and that the holding companys board and management was kept completely in the dark about the governments negotiations with chase hampering the banks ability to sell itself on its own chief executive alan h fishman was flying from new york to seattle on the day the bank was closed and eventually received a 75 million signon bonus and cash severance of 116 million which he declined after being ceo for 17 days190 senator maria cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation191 and washington mutuals former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares189 the seizure of wamu bank resulted in the largest bank failure in american financial history far exceeding the failure of continental illinois in 198416192193 bankruptcyedit on september 26 2008 washington mutual inc and its remaining subsidiary wmi investment corp filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy194 washington mutual inc was promptly delisted from trading on the new york stock exchange and commenced trading via pink sheets the bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks after the lehman brothers filing eleven days earlier both bankruptcies far outpaced worldcoms 2002 filing which had held the record with just under 104 billion in assets washington mutuals alone which was approximately half that of lehman brothers was three times as much as worldcoms all assets but only some liabilities including deposits covered bonds and other secured debt of washington mutual bank were assumed by jpmorgan chase195 under the deal jpmorgan chase acquired all the banking operations of wamu including 307 billion in assets and 188 billion in deposits for a price of 19 billion plus debt assumptions196 unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the fdic leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery195 on friday sep 26 2008 washington mutual bank customers were informed that deposits held by washington mutual became now liabilities of jpmorgan chase197 the irs claimed 125 billion in back taxes from washington mutual inc the company filed court papers on january 22 2009 alleging losses were 20 billion and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt stating that the irs could owe washington mutual inc a tax refund198 in a settlement between wash mutual inc in receivership the fdic and jpmorgan chase that wash mutual inc recently made public a tax refund of about us57 billion will be shared between wash mutual inc jpmorgan chase and fdic199 washington mutual inc sued the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic for us13 billion after the sale of its banking operations to jpmorgan chase200 wmi attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken on january 11 2010 the united states department of justice office of the united states trustee district of delaware pursuant to section 1102a1 of the bankruptcy code appointed a committee of equity security holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock all of the motions to disband the committee of equity security holders were denied on january 28 2010 by us bankruptcy judge mary f walrath district of delaware201202 on july 20 2010 bankruptcy judge mary walrath approved a motion of the ec for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of wmi handing a victory to shareholders the judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the fdic and jpmorgan chase at the heart of wamus reorganization but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company203 on july 26 2010 us trustee roberta a deangelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and mckenna long aldridge llp partner joshua r hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between wmi jpmorgan chase and the fdic hochberg is a partner in mckenna long aldridges washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense internal investigations and compliance204 on august 10 2010 the bankruptcy judge rejected washington mutual incs effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting attorneys for the ec said that wmi was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information the judge agreed that wmi was not entitled to the information205 on november 1 2010 examiner joshua r hochberg from mckenna long aldridge llp presented his longawaited report but it did not meet the expectations of the court since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorneyclient work on december 12 the court decided to exclude the examiners report during the plan confirmation hearings saying it cant be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions206 on january 7 2011 the bankruptcy court rejected the 6th proposed plan of reorganization which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from weil gotshal manges llp judge mary walrath focused many of her criticisms on the companys releases of liability granted to directors officers and others including some hedge funds who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement she noted for example that shareholders who will likely get nothing should not have to release the companys board from the threat of being sued by them207 however many wamu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when washington mutual emerges from bankruptcy on september 14 2011 the court also rejected the modified 6th proposed plan of reorganization judge mary f walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in washington mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt the four hedge funds are appaloosa management aurelius capital management centerbridge partners and owl creek asset management208 a seventh plan of reorganization was announced in february 2012209210 and the company finally emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month as wmi holdings corporation211 by 2015 wmi holdings was able to raise 598 million and was looking for new acquisitions212 post receivership bank operationsedit during 2009 all of the washington mutual bank branches that had been purchased from the fdic after the bank had been placed into receivership were rebranded to chase or shuttered all financial documents issued by wamu were changed to carry the

illinois and greater new york were rebranded in july 2009 and the remaining branches in nevada california arizona and colorado were rebranded in october 2009213214 the last rebrandings formally

resulted in different branches on the same block chase further disposed of such branches to other banks215 advertising campaignsedit free checking accountedit this advertising campaign was introduced

register a trademark in the phrase218219 initially the bank wanted to use woo hoo without the h in the first word as the slogan but they were concerned because of the existing use of the phrase by homer simpson a character in the simpsons218 occasio branch designedit washington mutual introduced a unique branch design known as occasio which eliminated traditional teller windows and queuing stanchions in favor of an open circular floor plan with a greeter or concierge position and tellers working from behind podiums220221 the occasio design was introduced in 2000 and patented in 2004222
