establishes all doctrines5 based on its interpretations of the bible2 they prefer to use their own translation the new world translation of the holy scriptures6 although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other bible translations78 they believe that the destruction of the present world system at armageddon is imminent and that the establishment of gods kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity9 the group emerged from the bible student movement founded in the late 1870s by charles taze russell with the formation of zions watch tower tract society210 with significant organizational and doctrinal changes under the leadership of joseph franklin rutherford1112 the name jehovahs witnessesnote 1 was adopted in 1931 to distinguish themselves from other bible student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of russells traditions131415 jehovahs witnesses are best known for their doortodoor preaching distributing literature such as the watchtower and awake and refusing military service and blood transfusions they consider the use of gods name vital for proper worship they reject trinitarianism inherent immortality of the soul and hellfire which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines they do not observe christmas easter birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with christianity16 adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as the truth and consider themselves to be in the truth17 they consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of satan and most limit their social interaction with nonwitnesses18 congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping their term for formal expulsion and shunning19 baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant20 the groups position regarding conscientious objection to military service and refusal to salute national flags has brought it into conflict with some governments consequently some jehovahs witnesses have been persecuted and their activities are banned or restricted in some countries persistent legal challenges by jehovahs witnesses have influenced legislation related to civil rights in several countries21 the organization has received criticism over issues surrounding biblical translation doctrines handling of sexual abuse cases and alleged coercion of its members the claims are rejected by the groups leaders and some have

main article history of jehovahs witnesses background 1870–1916edit charles taze russell 1852–1916 in 1870 charles taze russell and others formed a group in pittsburgh pennsylvania to study the bible22 during the course of his ministry russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream christianity including immortality of the soul hellfire predestination the fleshly return of jesus christ the trinity and the burning up of the world23 in 1876 russell met nelson h barbour later that year they jointly produced the book three worlds which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy the book taught that gods dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally each ending with a harvest that christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 187423 inaugurating the harvest of the gospel age and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520year period called the gentile times24 at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of gods kingdom on earth252627 beginning in 1878 russell and barbour jointly edited a religious journal herald of the morning28 in june 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences and in july russell began publishing the magazine zions watch tower and herald of christs presence29 stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in the last days and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of christ was imminent30 from 1879 watch tower supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the bible topically thirty congregations were founded and during 1879 and 1880 russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings31 as congregations continued to form during russells ministry they each remained selfadministrative functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance3233 in 1881 zions watch tower tract society was presided over by william henry conley and in 1884 russell incorporated the society as a nonprofit business to distribute tracts and bibles343536 by about 1900 russell had organized thousands of part and fulltime colporteurs29 and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices by the 1910s russells organization maintained nearly a hundred pilgrims or traveling preachers37 russell engaged in significant global publishing efforts during his ministry3839 and by 1912 he was the most distributed christian author in the united states4041 russell moved the watch tower societys headquarters to brooklyn new york in 1909 combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named bethel he identified the religious movement as bible students and more formally as the international bible students association42 by 1910 about 50000 people worldwide were associated with the movement43 and congregations reelected him annually as their pastor44 russell died october 31 1916 at the age of 64 while returning from a ministerial speaking tour45 reorganization 1917–1942edit joseph f rutherford 1869–1942 in january 1917 the watch tower societys legal representative joseph franklin rutherford was elected as its next president his election was disputed and members of the board of directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner4647 the divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade4849 in june 1917 he released the finished mystery as a seventh volume of russells studies in the scriptures series the book published as the posthumous work of russell was a compilation of his commentaries on the bible books of ezekiel and revelation plus numerous additions by bible students clayton woodworth and george fisher50515253 it strongly criticized catholic and protestant clergy and christian involvement in the great war54 as a result watch tower society directors were jailed for sedition under the espionage act in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence the directors were released in march 1919 and charges against them were dropped in 192055 rutherford centralized organizational control of the watch tower society in 1919 he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the brooklyn headquarters56 at an international convention held at cedar point ohio in september 1922 a new emphasis was made on housetohouse preaching57 significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during rutherfords twentyfive years as president including the 1920 announcement that the hebrew patriarchs such as abraham and isaac would be resurrected in 1925 marking the beginning of christs thousandyear earthly kingdom58596061 disappointed by the changes and unfulfilled predictions tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of rutherfords tenure leading to the formation of several bible student organizations independent of the watch tower society62636465 most of which still exist66 by mid1919 as many as one in seven of russellera bible students had ceased their association with the society and as many as threequarters by the end of the 1920s6768696470 on july 26 1931 at a convention in columbus ohio rutherford introduced the new name—jehovahs witnesses—based on isaiah 4310 you are my witnesses declares jehovah yes my servant whom i have chosen so that you may know and have faith in me and understand that i am the same one before me no god was formed and after me there has been none new world translation of the holy scriptures 2013 edition —which was adopted by resolution the name was chosen to distinguish his group of bible students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the society as well as symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods131415 in 1932 rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders and in 1938 introduced what he called a theocratic literally godruled organizational system under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the brooklyn headquarters56 from 1932 it was taught that the little flock of 144000 would not be the only people to survive armageddon rutherford explained that in addition to the 144000 anointed who would be resurrected—or transferred at death—to live in heaven to rule over earth with christ a separate class of members the great multitude would live in a paradise restored on earth from 1935 new converts to the movement were considered part of that class7172 by the mid1930s the timing of the beginning of christs presence greek parousía his enthronement as king and the start of the last days were each moved to 191473 as their interpretations of the bible developed witness publications decreed that saluting national flags is a form of idolatry which led to a new outbreak of mob violence and government opposition in the united states canada germany and other countries7475 worldwide membership of jehovahs witnesses reached 113624 in 5323 congregations by the time of

version of which was released in 1961 he organized large international assemblies instituted new training programs for members and expanded missionary activity and branch offices throughout the world78 knorrs presidency was also marked by an increasing use of explicit instructions guiding witnesses in their lifestyle and conduct and a greater use of congregational judicial procedures to enforce a strict moral code7980 from 1966 witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that christs thousandyear reign might begin in late 19758182 or shortly thereafter83848586 the number of baptisms increased significantly from about 59000 in 1966 to more than 297000 in 1974 by 1975 the number of active members exceeded two million membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong87888990 watch tower society literature did not state dogmatically that 1975 would definitely mark the end83 but in 1980 the watch tower society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year9192 the offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to witness congregations in 1972 with appointments made from headquarters93 and later also by branch committees it was announced that starting in september 2014 appointments would be made by traveling overseers in a major organizational overhaul in 1976 the power of the watch tower society president was diminished with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the governing body94 since knorrs death in 1977 the position of president has been occupied by frederick franz 1977–1992 and milton henschel 1992–2000 both members of the governing body and since 2000 by don a adams not a member of the governing body in 1995 jehovahs witnesses abandoned the idea that armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2010 changed their teaching on the generation95969798 organizationedit main article organizational structure of jehovahs witnesses jehovahs witnesses are organized hierarchically in what the leadership calls a theocratic organization reflecting their belief that it is gods visible organization on earth99100101 the organization is led by the governing body—an allmale group that varies in size but since early 2014 has comprised seven membersnote 2 all of whom profess to be of the anointed class with a hope of heavenly life—based in the watch tower societys brooklyn headquarters102103 there is no election for membership new members are selected by the existing body104 until late 2012 the governing body described itself as the representative105106 and spokesman for gods faithful and discreet slave class approximately 10000 selfprofessed anointed jehovahs witnesses107108 at the 2012 annual meeting of the watch tower society the faithful and discreet slave was defined as referring to the governing body only109 the governing body directs several committees that are responsible for administrative functions including publishing assembly programs and evangelizing activities101 it appoints all branch committee members and traveling overseers after they have been recommended by local branches with traveling overseers supervising circuits of congregations within their jurisdictions traveling overseers appoint local elders and ministerial servants and while branch offices may appoint regional committees for matters such as kingdom hall construction or disaster relief110 each congregation has a body of appointed unpaid male elders and ministerial servants elders maintain general responsibility for congregational governance setting meeting times selecting speakers and conducting meetings directing the public preaching work and creating judicial committees to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases involving sexual misconduct or doctrinal breaches111 new elders are appointed by a traveling overseer after recommendation by the existing body of elders ministerial servants—appointed in a similar manner to elders—fulfill clerical and attendant duties but may also teach and conduct meetings101 witnesses do not use elder as a title to signify a formal clergylaity division112 though elders may employ ecclesiastical privilege such as confession of sins113 baptism is a requirement for being considered a member of jehovahs witnesses jehovahs witnesses do not practice infant baptism114 and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid115 individuals undergoing baptism must affirm publicly that dedication and baptism identify them as one of jehovahs witnesses in association with gods spiritdirected organization115 though witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to god and not to a man work or organization116117 their literature emphasizes the need for members to be obedient and loyal to jehovah and to his organization118119note 3 stating that individuals must remain part of it to receive gods favor and to survive armageddon120121122 publishingedit the organization produces a significant amount of literature as part of its evangelism activities123 the watch tower society has produced over 200 million copies of the new world translation in whole or in part in over 120 languages124 the watchtower and awake are the most widely distributed magazines in the world125 translation of witness publications is done by over 2000 volunteers worldwide producing literature in over 760 languages126 publications are also available online at the organizations official website fundingedit much of their funding is provided by donations primarily from members there is no tithing or collection91 in 2001 newsday listed the watch tower society as one of new yorks forty richest corporations with revenues exceeding 950 million123127 the organization reported for the same year that it spent over 709 million dollars in caring for

their denomination is a restoration of firstcentury christianity129 doctrines of jehovahs witnesses are established by the governing body which assumes responsibility for interpreting and applying scripture49130131 the governing body does not issue any single comprehensive statement of faith but prefers to express its doctrinal position in a variety of ways through publications published by the watch tower society132 their publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation in which god gradually reveals his will and purpose133134135136 and that such enlightenment or new light137 results from the application of reason and study138 the guidance of the holy spirit and direction from jesus christ and angels139 the society also teaches that members of the governing body are helped by the holy spirit to discern deep truths which are then considered by the entire governing body before it makes doctrinal decisions140 the groups leadership while disclaiming divine inspiration and infallibility141 is said to provide divine guidance142 through its teachings described as based on gods word thus not from men but from jehovah143144 the entire protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired inerrant word of god145 jehovahs witnesses consider the bible to be scientifically and historically accurate and reliable146 and interpret much of it literally but accept parts of it as symbolic147 they consider the bible to be the final authority for all their beliefs148 although sociologist andrew holdens ethnographic study of the group concluded that pronouncements of the governing body through watch tower society publications carry almost as much weight as the bible149 regular personal bible reading is frequently recommended witnesses are discouraged from formulating doctrines and private ideas reached through bible research independent of watch tower society publications and are cautioned against reading other religious literature150151152 adherents are told to have complete confidence in the leadership avoid skepticism about what is taught in the watch tower societys literature and not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to bible understanding153154155156 the organization makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings157 and all witnesses must abide by its doctrines and organizational requirements158 jehovah and jesusedit jehovahs witnesses emphasize the use of gods name and they prefer the form jehovah—a vocalization of gods name based on the tetragrammaton159160161 they believe that jehovah is the only true god the creator of all things and the universal sovereign they believe that all worship should be directed toward him and that he is not part of a trinity162 consequently the group places more emphasis on god than on christ163164 they believe that the holy spirit is gods applied power or active force rather than a person165166 the tetragrammaton jehovahs witnesses believe that jesus is gods only direct creation that everything else was created through christ by means of gods power and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies jesus as gods onlybegotten son167 jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity168 they believe jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross169 they believe that references in the bible to the archangel michael abaddon apollyon and the word all refer to jesus170 jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between god and humanity and appointed by god as the king and judge of his kingdom171 his role as a mediator referred to in 1 timothy 25 is applied to the anointed class though the other sheep are said to also benefit from the arrangement172 satanedit jehovahs witnesses believe that satan was originally a perfect angel who developed feelings of selfimportance and craved worship satan influenced adam and eve to disobey god and humanity subsequently became participants in a challenge involving the competing claims of jehovah and satan to universal sovereignty173 other angels who sided with satan became demons jehovahs witnesses teach that satan and his demons were cast down to earth from heaven after october 1 1914174 at which point the end times began they believe that satan is the ruler of the current world order173 that human society is influenced and misled by satan and his demons and that they are a cause of human suffering they also believe that human governments are controlled by satan175 but that he does not directly control each human ruler176 life after deathedit main article jehovahs witnesses and salvation jehovahs witnesses believe death is a state of nonexistence with no consciousness there is no hell of fiery torment hades and sheol are understood to refer to the condition of death termed the common grave177 jehovahs witnesses consider the soul to be a life or a living body that can die178 jehovahs witnesses believe that humanity is in a sinful state178 from which release is only possible by means of jesus shed blood as a ransom or atonement for the sins of humankind179 witnesses believe that a little flock go to heaven but that the hope for life after death for the majority of other sheep involves being resurrected by god to a cleansed earth after armageddon they interpret revelation 141–5 to mean that the number of christians going to heaven is limited to exactly 144000 who will rule with jesus as kings and priests over earth180 they believe that baptism as one of jehovahs witnesses is vital for salvation181 and that only they meet scriptural requirements for surviving armageddon but that god is the final judge182183184 during christs millennial reign most people who died prior to armageddon will be resurrected with the prospect of living forever they will be taught the proper way to worship god to prepare them for their final test at the end of the millennium185186 gods kingdomedit jehovahs witnesses believe that gods kingdom is a literal government in heaven ruled by jesus christ and 144000 spiritanointed christians drawn from the earth which they associate with jesus reference to a new covenant187188 the kingdom is viewed as the means by which god will accomplish his original purpose for the earth transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death189 it is said to have been the focal point of jesus ministry on earth190 they believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914191 and that jehovahs witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth192193 eschatologyedit main article eschatology of jehovahs witnesses a central teaching of jehovahs witnesses is that the current world era or system of things entered the last days in 1914 and faces imminent destruction through intervention by god and jesus christ leading to deliverance for those who worship god acceptably194 they consider all other presentday religions to be false identifying them with babylon the great or the harlot of revelation 17195 and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the united nations which they believe is represented in scripture by the scarletcolored wild beast of revelation chapter 17 this development will mark the beginning of the great tribulation196197 satan will subsequently attack jehovahs witnesses an action that will prompt god to begin the war of armageddon during which all forms of government and all people not counted as christs sheep or true followers will be destroyed after armageddon god will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the garden of eden198 most of those who had died before gods intervention will gradually be resurrected during judgment day lasting for one thousand years this judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds at the end of the thousand years christ will hand all authority back to god then a final test will take place when satan is released to mislead perfect mankind those who fail will be destroyed along with satan and his demons the end result will be a fully tested glorified human race199200 jehovahs witnesses believe that jesus christ began to rule in heaven as king of gods kingdom in october 1914 and that satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth resulting in woe to humanity they believe that jesus rules invisibly from heaven perceived only as a series of signs they base this belief on a rendering of the greek word parousia—usually translated as coming when referring to christ—as presence they believe jesus presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth they thus depart from the mainstream christian belief that the second coming of matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans201202 practicesedit main article jehovahs witnesses practices worshipedit worship at a kingdom hall meetings for worship and study are held at kingdom halls which are typically functional in character and do not contain religious symbols203 witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose territory they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as meetings as scheduled by congregation elders the meetings are largely devoted to study of watch tower society literature and the bible the format of the meetings is established by the groups headquarters and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide203 congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising four distinct meetings that total about threeandahalf hours typically gathering midweek two meetings and on the weekend two meetings prior to 2009 congregations met three times each week these meetings were condensed with the intention that members dedicate an evening for family worship204205 gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs hymns and brief prayers twice each year witnesses from a number of congregations that form a circuit gather for a oneday assembly larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a threeday regional convention usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the lords evening meal or memorial of christs death on the date of the jewish passover206 evangelismedit see also jehovahs witnesses publications jehovahs witnesses outside the british museum 2017 jehovahs witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs most notably by visiting people from house to house207208209 distributing literature published by the watch tower society in 700 languages210 the objective is to start a regular bible study with any person who is not already a member211 with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group212213 witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members214215 witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching216217 they are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly field service report218219 baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed irregular and may be counseled by elders220221 those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed inactive222 ethics and moralityedit all sexual relations outside of marriage are grounds for expulsion if the individual is not deemed repentant223224 homosexual activity is considered a serious sin and samesex marriages are forbidden abortion is considered murder225 suicide is considered to be selfmurder and a sin against god226 modesty in dress and grooming is frequently emphasized gambling drunkenness illegal drugs and tobacco use are forbidden227 drinking of alcoholic beverages is permitted in moderation225 the family structure is patriarchal the husband is considered to have authority on family decisions but is encouraged to solicit his wifes thoughts and feelings as well as those of his children marriages are required to be monogamous and legally registered228229 marrying a nonbeliever or endorsing such a union is strongly discouraged and carries religious sanctions230231 divorce is discouraged and remarriage is forbidden unless a divorce is obtained on the grounds of adultery which they refer to as a scriptural divorce232 if a divorce is obtained for any other reason remarriage is considered adulterous unless the prior spouse has died or is since considered to have committed sexual immorality233 extreme physical abuse willful nonsupport of ones family and what the denomination terms absolute endangerment of spirituality are considered grounds for legal separation234235 disciplinary actionedit main article jehovahs witnesses and congregational discipline formal discipline is administered by congregation elders when a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct111236 or charges of apostasy for disputing jehovahs witness doctrines237238—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt provide help and possibly administer discipline disfellowshipping a form of shunning is the strongest form of discipline administered to an offender deemed unrepentant239 contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement240 formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged241 witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help the shunned individual to come to his senses see the seriousness of his wrong and take steps to return to jehovah242 the practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior243 members who disassociate formally resign are described in watch tower society literature as wicked and are also shunned244245246 expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced20 reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized witness who is considered repentant of serious sin the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship247 marking a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of bible principles but not a serious sinnote 5 separatenessedit main article jehovahs witnesses and governments jehovahs witnesses believe that the bible condemns the mixing of religions on the basis that there can only be one truth from god and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements248249250 they believe that only jehovahs witnesses represent true christianity and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by god and will soon be destroyed251 jehovahs witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain separate from the world the witnesses literature defines the world as the mass of mankind apart from jehovahs approved servants and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by satan252253254 witnesses are taught that association with worldly people presents a danger to their faith255 and are instructed to minimize social contact with nonmembers to better maintain their own standards of morality256257258259 jehovahs witnesses believe their highest allegiance belongs to gods kingdom which is viewed as an actual government in heaven with christ as king they remain politically neutral do not seek public office and are discouraged from voting though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues260261 although they do not take part in politics they respect the authority of the governments under which they live262 they do not celebrate religious holidays such as christmas and easter nor do they observe birthdays nationalistic holidays or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than jesus they feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalistic or political spirit their position is that these traditional holidays reflect satans control over the world263264265 witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations266 they do not work in industries associated with the military do not serve in the armed services267 and refuse national military service which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment268 they do not salute or pledge allegiance to flags or sing national anthems or patriotic songs269 jehovahs witnesses see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties270 sociologist ronald lawson has suggested the groups intellectual and organizational isolation coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message271 rejection of blood transfusionsedit main article jehovahs witnesses and blood transfusions jehovahs witnesses refuse blood transfusions which they consider a violation of gods law based on their interpretation of acts 1528 29 and other scriptures272273274 since 1961 the willing acceptance of a blood transfusion by an unrepentant member has been grounds for expulsion from the group275276 members are directed to refuse blood transfusions even in a lifeordeath situation277278279 jehovahs witnesses accept nonblood alternatives and other medical procedures in lieu of blood transfusions and their literature provides information about nonblood medical procedures280 though jehovahs witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion281282283 the watch tower society provides preformatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept284285 jehovahs witnesses have established hospital liaison committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual jehovahs witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals286287 demographicsedit main article demographics of jehovahs witnesses jehovahs witnesses have an active presence in most countries but do not form a large part of the population of any country as of august 2016 jehovahs witnesses report an average of 813 million publishers—the term they use for members actively involved in preaching—in 119485 congregations3 in 2016 these reports indicated over 198 billion hours spent in preaching and bible study activity since the mid1990s the number of peak publishers has increased from 45 million to 834 million288 in the same year they conducted bible studies with over 101 million individuals including those conducted by witness parents with their children3289290 jehovahs witnesses estimate their current worldwide growth rate to be 18 per year3 the official published membership statistics such as those mentioned above include only those who submit reports for their personal ministry291 official statistics do not include inactive and disfellowshipped individuals or others who might attend their meetings as a result only about half of those who selfidentified as jehovahs witnesses in independent demographic studies are considered active by the faith itself292293 the 2008 us pew forum on religion public life survey found a low retention rate among members of the denomination about 37 of people raised in the group continued to identify themselves as jehovahs witnesses294295 sociological analysisedit see also sociological classifications of religious movements sociologist james a beckford in his 1975 study of jehovahs witnesses classified the groups organizational structure as totalizing characterized by an assertive leadership specific and narrow objectives control over competing demands on members time and energy and control over the quality of new members other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities reluctance to cooperate with other religious organizations a high rate of membership turnover a low rate of doctrinal change and strict uniformity of beliefs among members296 beckford identified the groups chief characteristics as historicism identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of gods purpose absolutism conviction that jehovahs witness leaders dispense absolute truth activism capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks rationalism conviction that witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery authoritarianism rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism and world indifference rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments297 sociologist bryan r wilson in his consideration of five religious groups including jehovahs witnesses noted that each of the denominations298 exists in a state of tension with the wider society imposes tests of merit on wouldbe members exercises stern discipline regulating the declared beliefs and the life habits of members and prescribing and operating sanctions for those who deviate including the possibility of expulsion demands sustained and total commitment from its members and the subordination and perhaps even the exclusion of all other interests a sociological comparative study by the pew research center found that jehovahs witnesses in the united states ranked highest in statistics for getting no further than high school graduation belief in god importance of religion in ones life frequency of religious attendance frequency of prayers frequency of bible reading outside of religious services belief their prayers are answered belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life opposition to abortion and opposition to homosexuality in the study jehovahs witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having earned a graduate degree and interest in politics299 oppositionedit controversy surrounding various beliefs doctrines and practices of jehovahs witnesses has led to opposition from governments communities and religious groups religious commentator ken jubber wrote that viewed globally this persecution has been so persistent and of such intensity that it would not be inaccurate to regard jehovahs witnesses as the most persecuted group of christians of the twentieth century300 persecutionedit main article persecution of jehovahs witnesses see also persecution of jehovahs witnesses in nazi germany jehovahs witness prisoners were identified by purple triangle badges in nazi concentration camps political and religious animosity against jehovahs witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries their stance regarding political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during world war ii and at other times where national service has been compulsory their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries including china vietnam and some islamic states301302 in 1933 there were approximately 20000 jehovahs witnesses in nazi germany303 of whom about 10000 were imprisoned of those 2000 were sent to nazi concentration camps where they were identified by purple triangles as many as 1200 died including 250 who were executed304305306307 in canada during world war ii jehovahs witnesses were interned in camps308 along with political dissidents and people of chinese and japanese descent309 in 1951 about 9300 jehovahs witnesses in the soviet union were deported to siberia as part of operation north in april 1951310 in april 2017 the supreme court of russia labeled jehovahs witnesses an extremist organization banned its activities in russia and issued an order to confiscate the organizations assets311 authors including william whalen shawn francis peters and former witnesses barbara grizzuti harrison alan rogerson and william schnell have claimed the arrests and mob violence in the united states in the 1930s and 1940s were the consequence of what appeared to be a deliberate course of provocation of authorities and other religious groups by jehovahs witnesses whalen harrison and schnell have suggested rutherford invited and cultivated opposition for publicity purposes in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society and to convince members that persecution from the outside world was evidence of the truth of their struggle to serve god312313314315316 watch tower society literature of the period directed that witnesses should never seek a controversy nor resist arrest but also advised members not to cooperate with police officers or courts that ordered them to stop preaching and to prefer jail rather than pay fines317 legal challengesedit main article supreme court cases involving jehovahs witnesses by country several cases involving jehovahs witnesses have been heard by supreme courts throughout the world318 the cases generally relate to their right to practice their religion displays of patriotism and military service and blood transfusions319 in the united states legal challenges by jehovahs witnesses prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties320 among the rights strengthened by witness court victories in the united states are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service the right of patients to refuse medical treatment and the right to engage in public discourse321 similar cases in their favor have been heard in canada322 criticism and controversyedit main article criticism of jehovahs witnesses jehovahs witnesses have attracted criticism over issues surrounding their bible translation doctrines their handling of sexual abuse cases and alleged coercion of members many of the claims are denied by jehovahs witnesses and some have also been disputed by religious scholars free speech and thoughtedit doctrines of jehovahs witnesses are established by the governing body323324 the denomination does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices144325326327 members who openly disagree with the groups teachings are expelled and shunned238 witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the governing body reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of gods organization327328329330 it also warns members to avoid independent thinking claiming such thinking was introduced by satan the devil331332 and would cause division333 those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as apostates who are mentally diseased243334335 former members heather and gary botting compare the cultural paradigms of the denomination to george orwells nineteen eightyfour336 and alan rogerson describes the groups leadership as totalitarian337 other critics charge that by disparaging individual decisionmaking the groups leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience150338 in which witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives339340 critics also accuse the groups leaders of exercising intellectual dominance over witnesses341 controlling information238342343 and creating mental isolation which former governing body member raymond franz argued were all elements of mind control344 jehovahs witness publications state that consensus of faith aids unity and deny that unity restricts individuality or imagination345 historian james irvin lichti has rejected the description of the denomination as totalitarian346 sociologist rodney stark states that jehovahs witness leaders are not always very democratic and that members are expected to conform to rather strict standards but adds that enforcement tends to be very informal sustained by the close bonds of friendship within the group and that jehovahs witnesses see themselves as part of the power structure rather than subject to it89 sociologist andrew holden states that most members who join millenarian movements such as jehovahs witnesses have made an informed choice347 however he also states that defectors are seldom allowed a dignified exit243 and describes the administration as autocratic323 new world translationedit main article new world translation of the holy scriptures various bible scholars including bruce m metzger former professor and bible editor and translator at princeton theological seminary have said that the new world translations renderings of certain texts are inaccurate and biased in favor of witness practices and doctrines348349350351352 old testament scholar and bible editor harold h rowley in a november 1953 review criticized the first volume as a shining example of how the bible should not be translated adding in a subsequent review that the second volume shows the same faults as the first353354 bible scholar jason beduhn355356 professor of religious studies at the northern arizona university in a new testament study wrote the nw new world translation emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared beduhn stated that although the general public and several important biblical scholars assume that the differences in the new world translation are the result of religious bias on the part of its translators most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the nw as a literal conservative translation of the original expressions of the new testament writers however he added that the insertion of the name jehovah in the new testament violates accuracy in favor of denominationally preferred expressions for god355 failed predictionsedit main article watch tower society unfulfilled predictions watch tower society publications have claimed that god has used jehovahs witnesses and formerly the international bible students to declare his will357358 and has provided advance knowledge about armageddon and the establishment of gods kingdom359360361 some publications also claimed that god has used jehovahs witnesses and the international bible students as a modernday prophetnote 6 george d chryssides stated while prediction may be part of a biblical prophets role the root meaning of prophecy is that of proclaiming gods word he went on to say that jehovahs witnesses are the recipients of prophecy who regard themselves as invested with the interpretation of biblical writings362note 7 with these interpretations jehovahs witnesses publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the bible363364 failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines365366 some failed predictions had been presented as beyond doubt or approved by god367 the watch tower society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet368 stating that its teachings are not inspired or infallible369370371 and that it has not claimed its predictions were the words of jehovah368 chryssides has suggested that with the exception of statements about 1914 1925 and 1975 the changing views and dates of the jehovahs witnesses are largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology rather than to failed predictions81 chryssides further states it is therefore simplistic and naïve to view the witnesses as a group that continues to set a single enddate that fails and then devise a new one as many countercultists do372 however sociologist andrew holden states that since the foundation of the movement around 140 years ago witnesses have maintained that we are living on the precipice of the end of time373 handling of sexual abuse casesedit main article jehovahs witnesses handling of child sex abuse jehovahs witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization374 the group has been criticized for its two witness rule for church discipline based on its application of scriptures at deuteronomy 1915 and matthew 181517 which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing375376377 in cases where corroboration is lacking the watch tower societys instruction is that the elders will leave the matter in jehovahs hands378 a former member of the headquarters staff barbara anderson says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation which is an impossibility anderson says the policies protect pedophiles rather than protect the children379 jehovahs witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents375380381 the groups failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized382 the watch tower societys policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family375383384 the australian royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the jehovahs witnesses within their organization since 1950 not one was reported by the church to secular authorities385 the royal commission also found that the watch tower society legal department routinely provided incorrect information to elders based on an incorrect understanding about what constitutes a legal obligation to report crimes in australia386387 william bowen a former jehovahs witness elder who established the silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the denomination has claimed witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its crimefree reputation374388 in court cases in the united kingdom and the united states the watch tower society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation389390391 and the society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court reportedly paying as much as 780000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing379 notesedit

discussing the april 1 1972 watchtower article that it would be tedious to comment on each passage in which watch tower literature explains the jehovahs witnesses position on prophecy some of it may lack the precision that its detractors appear to demand but the societys position is quite clear jehovahs witnesses do not claim to have any new revelation or people who are designated as prophets as cessationists they identify the ability to prophesy as a gift that died out with the first generation of christians but prophetic utterances remain in the bible which serves as the key source of

the peril of questioning the organization fear of disobedience to the governing body keeps jehovahs witnesses from carefully checking into biblical doctrine or allegations concerning false prophecy faulty scholarship and injustice witnesses are told not to read books like this one keep clear of false worship the watchtower 15 march 2006 true christians keep clear of false worship rejecting false religious teachings this means that we avoid exposure to religious programs on radio and television as well as religious literature that promotes lies about god and his word questions from readers—why do jehovahs witnesses decline to exchange their bible study aids for the religious literature of people they meet the watchtower may 1 1984 p 31 so it would be foolhardy as well as a waste of valuable time for jehovah’s witnesses to accept and expose themselves to false religious literature that is designed to deceive  question box our kingdom ministry september 2007 throughout the earth jehovah’s people are receiving ample spiritual instruction and encouragement at congregation meetings assemblies and conventions as well as through the publications of jehovah’s organization under the guidance of his holy spirit and on the basis of his word of truth jehovah provides what is needed so that all of god’s people may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought and remain stabilized in the faith surely we are grateful for jehovah’s spiritual provisions in these last days thus the faithful and discreet slave does not endorse any literature meetings or web sites that are not produced or organized under its oversight make your advancement manifest the watchtower august 1 2001 page 14 since oneness is to be observed a mature christian must be in unity and full harmony with fellow believers as far as faith and knowledge are concerned he does not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to bible understanding rather he has complete confidence in the truth as it is revealed by jehovah god through his son jesus christ and the faithful and discreet slave testimony by fred franz transcript lord strachan vs douglas walsh 1954 page 123 q did you imply that the individual member has the right of reading the books and the bible and forming his own view as to the proper interpretation of holy writ a nothe scripture is there given in support of the statement and therefore the individual when he looks up the scripture and thereby verifies the statementsearches the scripture to see whether these things were so do we need help to understand the bible the watchtower february 15 1981 page 19 jesus’ disciples wrote many letters to christian congregations to persons who were already in the way of the truth but nowhere do we read that those brothers first in a skeptical frame of mind checked the scriptures to make certain that those letters had scriptural backing that the writers really knew what they were talking about we can benefit from this consideration if we have once established what instrument god is using as his slave to dispense spiritual food to his people surely jehovah is not pleased if we receive
