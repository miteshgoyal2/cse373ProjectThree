blogger was taken out of beta by may 2007 blogger had completely moved over to googleoperated servers blogger was ranked 16 on the list of top 50 domains in terms of number of unique visitors in 200710 on february 24 2015 blogger announced that as of late march it will no longer allow its users to post sexually explicit content unless the nudity offers substantial public benefit for example in artistic educational documentary or scientific contexts11 on february 28 2015 accounting for severe backlash from longterm bloggers blogger reversed its decision on banning sexual content going back to the previous policy that allowed explicit images and videos if the blog was marked as adult12 redesign as part of the blogger redesign in 2006 all blogs associated with a users google account were migrated to google servers blogger claims that the service is now more reliable because of the quality of the servers13 along with the migration to google servers several new features were introduced including label organization a draganddrop template editing interface reading permissions to create private blogs and new web feed options furthermore blogs are updated dynamically as opposed to rewriting html files in a version of the service called blogger in draft14 new features are tested before being released to all users new features are discussed in the services official blog15 in september 2009 google introduced new features into blogger as part of its tenthanniversary celebration the features included a new interface for post editing improved image handling raw html conversion and other google docsbased implementations including adding location to posts via geotagging post timestamping at publication not at original creation vertical resizing of the post editor

chinese simplified chinese traditional croatian czech danish dutch english united kingdom english united states estonian filipino finnish french galician german greek gujarati hebrew hindi hungarian

spanish latin america spanish spain swahili swedish tamil telugu thai turkish ukrainian urdu vietnamese and zulu countryspecific blogger addresses starting in february 2013 blogger began integrating user blogs with multiple countryspecific urls for example exampleuserblognameblogspotcom would be automatically redirected to exampleuserblognameblogspotca in canada exampleuserblognameblogspotcouk in the united kingdom blogger explained that by doing this they could manage the blog content more locally so if there was any objectionable material that violated a particular countrys laws they could remove and block access to that blog for that country through the assigned cctld while retaining access through other cctld addresses and the default blogspotcom url however it should be noted that if a blog using a countryspecific url was removed it is still technically possible to access the blog through googles no country redirect override by entering the url using the regular blogspotcom address and adding ncr after the com17 these redirects have privacy implications for anonymous users those who share a link to a blogger site obtained from their web browsers address bar may inadvertently reveal which country they are currently in – unless they fool eg using a vpn service located in another country or override the country detection or manually edit the link to refer to blogspotcom before sharing it available designs blogger allows its users to choose from various templates and then customize them users may also choose to create their own templates using css the new design template known as dynamic view was introduced on 31 august 201118 with dynamic views being introduced on 27 september 201119 it is built with ajax html5 and css3 the time for loading is 40 percent shorter than traditional templates and allows user to present blog in seven different ways classic flipcard magazine mosaic sidebar snapshot and timeslide readers still have the option to choose preferable views when the blog owner has set a default view20 some of the widgets eg labels profile link list subscription links followers and blog archive etc are available for dynamic views other templates are chosen by the blogger in april 2013 blogger updated its html template editor that has some improvements to make it easy for the users to edit the blogs source code the editor was updated with syntax highlight number line and jumptowidget button for ease of editing the code for over half a year dynamic views users were suffering from a bug causing custom css and page navigation often not to load properly this happened because a javascript routine rendered the page before it was loaded a blogger user fixed the template and published the fix21 integration the google toolbar has a feature called blogthis which allows toolbar users with blogger accounts to post links directly to their blogs blogger for word is an addin for microsoft word which allows users to save a microsoft word document directly to a blogger blog as well as edit their posts both on and offline as of january 2007update google says blogger for word is not currently compatible with the new
