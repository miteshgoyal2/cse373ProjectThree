singer failed to perform it the song also failed to gain an official release despite the pop singer having stated that it would be issued as a charity single for the refugees of the kosovo war which ended in 1999 following the september 11 attacks in 2001 jackson rewrote what more can i give at the suggestion of marc schaffel schaffel who produced and became the executive producer on the project convinced jackson to also do a spanish version of the song as well and handled the details of the production jackson and other artists recorded the new version of the song shortly afterward the other artists included mariah carey britney spears reba mcentire anastacia nick carter jennifer lopez 3lw beyoncé nsync celine dion christina aguilera brian mcknight toni braxton luther vandross mary j blige and usher in addition a spanish language version of the song was recorded entitled todo para ti the lyrics were adapted into spanish by the panamanian musician rubén blades schaffel brought threetime grammy winner k c porter on to the project to give the spanish version a different sound from the english recording what more can i give was scheduled for release as a charity single in the hope that 50 million would be raised between downloads sponsors and donations to aid the survivors and the families of victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks the plan however never came to fruition and the reasons why have varied between sources and the individuals involved one newspaper stated that the release of the song was abandoned after part of a marketing ploy by sony music after jackson started a public campaign against sony and its usa music head what more can i give was played on the radio for the first time in late 2002 the debut airing was made without permission by radio station wktufm in new york the following year on october 27 2003 what more can i give was made available to the public by way of digital download for several days jackson had the song taken down on the eve of the raid on his neverland valley ranch property by santa barbara sheriffs proceeds from the short sale of the song went to childrens charities schaffel enlisted friend and famed brazilian artist romero britto to design create and paint an artwork to be used as the cover for the single britto created the ribbon piece in bright colors including yellow blue and red britto created 250 of this piece as a special collectors item and both britto and michael jackson signed and numbered each of these pieces michael jackson recorded the song in both english and spanish and shot the video for marc schaffel even after his death it is believed to be the last actual completed song and video that michael jackson had done and approved for release it was also one of only a few tracks michael jackson ever performed in spanish and is considered the last michael jackson had told many people he felt that what more can i give was a definite contender for song of the year for both the english and latin grammys and felt it would be as successful as we are the world no official release date for either project has been given since the death of jackson in june 2009 by either schaffel or

background and writingedit further information september 11 attacks michael jackson originally started writing the song originally titled heal la with brad buxer after the rodney king verdict and following riots in 1992 the song was worked on throughout the making of the history past present and future book i album and its subsequent world tour in 1996 to 1997 in late 1997 when work began on the invincible album the song was put on hold but its completion was always a passion of michaels jackson was inspired to finish heal la after a meeting with antiapartheid activist and president of south africa nelson mandela in 199912 the songwriter stated that during a conversation with the thenpresident the concept of giving was discussed by the pair the singer revealed that it was during this interaction that the words what more can i give came into his mind and he began writing with the first version of the song completed jackson intended to premiere it at his mj friends concerts staged in munich germany and the south korean capital seoul in june 1999 ultimately jackson did not perform the song at the concerts and it remained unreleased3 what more can i give was also intended to be released as a charity single to aid the kosovar refugees who had been forced out of their home during the kosovo war 1998–1999 jackson revealed his intentions for the release in an interview with the british tabloid newspaper the daily mirror the pop singer stated that television footage of the war upset him and that he wanted to go to yugoslavia to hug every one of the suffering children45 like before however the song failed to gain a release as a single and was not considered good enough for inclusion on jacksons 2001 invincible album67 in 2001 two separate concerts were held on september 7 and september 10 in celebration of michael jacksons thirtieth year as a solo entertainer his first solo single got to be there was released in 1971 held in new york city the shows

contained solo performances by jackson himself and marked the onstage reunion of the pop singer and his brothers the jacksons8 hours following the second concert the attacks on the world trade center in new york city the pentagon outside of washington dc and a crash near shanksville pennsylvania resulted in the loss of 2993 lives910 following the events of september 11 jackson rewrote what more can i give and expressed his views on the song writing and music im not one to sit back and say oh i feel bad for what happened to them i want the whole world to sing what more can i give to bring us together as a world because a song is a mantra something you repeat over and over and we need peace we need giving we need love we need unity11 recordingedit what more can i give was recorded in 2001 by a number of artists the project had received an overwhelming response from major artists all over the world with musicians such as anastacia beyoncé nick carter aaron carter nsync and carlos santana offering to lend their voices to the track the recording process was held in los angeles california and destinations reachable by michael jacksons private plane and mobile production unit

for famine relief in africa1213 the recording of what more can i give was completed in october 200114 in addition to the englishlanguage version of what more can i give a spanish version of the song

at the robert f kennedy memorial stadium in washington dc on october 21 2001 the eighthour concert featured numerous artists performing to a sellout audience of 54000 people jackson performed his song man in the mirror before he and other singers such as rod stewart al green james brown sean combs and pink closed the show with what more can i give16 joe dangelo of mtv later stated that the entire performance was held together by jackson and billy gilman who he claimed were the only two who looked like they knew the lyrics to the song he concluded that the collective rendition of the song was altogether choppy and disparate18 jon pareles also wrote negatively about the performance he stated that it became a shambles as a stageful of guests missed their cues or couldnt be heard19 jacksons appearance during the what more can i give performance was later edited out of american broadcasting companys airing of the show the company were forced to take the action after representatives of jackson informed them that cbs had demanded that the singer not perform on a network show before a jackson special being broadcast on their channel the following month cbs executives however denied their insistence on jacksons removal from the footage they stated that if the singer had appeared in the broadcast footage they most probably would have been forced to delay jacksons show so that it would not appear too soon after the airing of united we stand what more can i give20 planned release as a physical singleedit i believe in my heart that the music community will come together as one and rally to the aid of thousands of innocent victims there is a tremendous need for relief dollars right now and through this effort each one of us can play an immediate role in helping comfort so many people michael jackson 200121 what more can i give had been planned for release as a charity single to aid survivors and families of victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks1 at the time of the attacks jackson stated that he hoped to raise 50 million for those affected6 it was also proclaimed by jacksons spokesman that the recording would be released as soon as possible with further reports revealing that it could be made available in music stores within that month1222 after the song failed to gain an official release differing allegations arose as to who was to blame the los angeles times reported that the what more can i give project was abandoned after it emerged that the songs executive producer marc schaffel had directed and produced gay pornography news of schaffels background supposedly became known to an entertainment television show whose staff threatened to expose the producers past in porn jacksons legal and management team subsequently sought to end the musicians business relationship with schaffel declaring their intentions in a letter sent to the producers lawyers in november 200123 airplayedit one year after the allstar recording of what more can i give it was played for the first time on radio wktufm a radio station based in new york debuted the song without permission and played it in heavy rotation wktufms program director frankie blue stated at the time this song is a gift to the world michael and everyone donated their time for it and it deserves to be heard the song is called what more can i give and i can give the world a song they can cling onto and hopefully make them think about what they can give24 it is unknown how the station acquired a copy of the song both jackson and schaffel were uninvolved with it prior to the airing at least 200 promo copies of the song were sent to the musicians who participated in the recording process as well as to their representatives schaffel stated that he would hate to see the song not being used to raise money for charity the intended purpose wktufm received numerous telephone calls and emails from listeners following their unauthorized playing of the song thanking the station and asking where they could buy a copy of what more can i give24 release as a digital singleedit what more can i give was eventually made available as a digital download on october 27 2003 the websites whatmorecanigivecom and musicforgivingcom sold the song at a price of 2 per download with a portion of the proceeds from the fee going towards childrens charities such as oneness mr hollands opus foundation and the international child art foundation25 the charities support arts programs to eliminate racism increase education and connect children throughout the world respectively the
