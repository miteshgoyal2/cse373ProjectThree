book of virtues the book is a compilation of moral stories about courage responsibility friendship and other examples of high morality many in the media said at the time the book was an argument by dr bennett for selfdiscipline which would be at odds with gambling bennett and empower america the organization he cofounded and headed at the time opposed an extension of casino gambling in the states17

discussion on bennetts morning in america radio show a caller to the show proposed that “lost revenue from the people who have been aborted in the last 30 years could preserve social security if abortion wasnt permitted following roe v wade bennett responded that aborting all africanamerican babies if you wanted to reduce crime you could—if that were the sole purpose—you could abort every black baby in this country and the crime rate would go down that would be an impossible ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to do but your crime rate would go down20 bennett responded to the criticism saying in part a thought experiment about public policy on national radio should not have received the condemnations it has anyone paying attention to this debate should be offended by those who have selectively quoted me distorted my meaning and taken out of context the dialog i engaged in this week such distortions from leaders of organizations and parties is a disgrace not only to the organizations and institutions they serve but to the first amendment21 see alsoedit legalized abortion and crime effect list of us political appointments that crossed party lines race and crime in the
