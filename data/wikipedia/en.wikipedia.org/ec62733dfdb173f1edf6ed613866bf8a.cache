wisconsin from 1947 until his death in 1957 beginning in 1950 mccarthy became the most visible public face of a period in the united states in which cold war tensions fueled fears of widespread communist subversion1 he is known for alleging that numerous communists and soviet spies and sympathizers had infiltrated the united states federal government universities film industry and elsewhere ultimately the smear tactics he used led him to be censured by the us senate the term mccarthyism coined in 1950 in reference to mccarthys practices was soon applied to similar anticommunist activities today the term is used in reference to what are considered demagogic reckless and unsubstantiated accusations as well as public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents2 born in grand chute wisconsin mccarthy commissioned in to the marine corps in 1942 where he served as an intelligence briefing officer for a dive bomber squadron following the end of world war ii he attained the rank of major he volunteered to fly twelve combat missions as a gunnerobserver acquiring the nickname tailgunner joe some of his claims of heroism were later shown to be exaggerated or falsified leading many of his critics to use tailgunner joe as a term of mockery mccarthy successfully ran for the us senate in 1946 defeating robert m la follette jr after three largely undistinguished years in the senate mccarthy rose suddenly to national fame in february 1950 when he asserted in a speech that he had a list of members of the communist party and members of a spy ring who were employed in the state department3 in succeeding years after his 1950 speech mccarthy made additional accusations of communist infiltration into the state department the administration of president harry s truman the voice of america and the us army he also used various charges of communism communist sympathies disloyalty or sex crimes to attack a number of politicians and other individuals inside and outside of government4 this included a concurrent lavender scare against suspected homosexuals as homosexuality was prohibited by law at the time it was also perceived to increase a persons risk for blackmail with the highly publicized army–mccarthy hearings of 1954 and following the suicide of wyoming senator lester c hunt that same year5 mccarthys support and popularity faded on december 2 1954 the senate voted to censure senator mccarthy by a vote of 67–22 making him one of the few senators ever to be disciplined in this fashion mccarthy died at bethesda naval hospital in bethesda maryland on may 2 1957 at the age of 48 his death certificate listed the cause of death as hepatitis acute cause unknown6 doctors had not previously reported him

bridget tierney was from county tipperary ireland his father timothy mccarthy was born in the united states the son of an irish father and a german mother mccarthy dropped out of junior high school at age 14 to help his parents manage their farm he entered little wolf high school in manawa wisconsin when he was 20 and graduated in one year11 he attended marquette university from 1930 to 1935 mccarthy worked his way through college studying first engineering then law and receiving an llb degree in 1935 from marquette university law school in milwaukee12 mccarthy was admitted to the bar in 1935 while working at a law firm in shawano wisconsin he launched an unsuccessful campaign for district attorney as a democrat in 1936 in 1939 mccarthy had better success when he ran for the nonpartisan elected post of 10th district circuit judge1314 during his years as an attorney mccarthy made money on the side by gambling15 mccarthy became the youngest circuit judge in the states history by defeating incumbent edgar v werner who had been a judge for 24 years16 in the campaign mccarthy exaggerated werners age of 66 claiming that he was 73 and so allegedly too old and infirm to handle the duties of his office17 writing of werner in reds mccarthyism in twentiethcentury america ted morgan wrote pompous and condescending he was disliked by lawyers he had been reversed often by the wisconsin supreme court and he was so inefficient that he had piled up a huge backlog of cases18 mccarthys judicial career attracted some controversy because of the speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited wisconsin had strict divorce laws but when mccarthy heard divorce cases he expedited them whenever possible and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority19 when it came to other cases argued before him mccarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys the wisconsin supreme court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard20 but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case21 military serviceedit joseph mccarthy in his us marine corps uniform in 1942 shortly after the us entered world war ii mccarthy joined the united states marine corps despite the fact that his judicial office exempted him from military service22 his college education qualified him for a direct commission and he entered the marines as a first lieutenant23 mccarthy reportedly chose the marines with the hope that being a veteran of this branch of the military would serve him best in his future political career24 according to morgan writing in reds mccarthys friend and campaign manager attorney and judge urban p van susteren had applied for active duty in the army air force in early 1942 and advised mccarthy be a hero—join the marines2526 when mccarthy seemed hesitant van susteren asked you got shit in your blood27 he served as an intelligence briefing officer for a dive bomber squadron in the solomon islands and bougainville for 30 months august 1942 – february 1945 and held the rank of captain by the time he resigned his commission in april 1945 he volunteered to fly twelve combat missions as a gunnerobserver acquiring or perhaps giving himself the nickname tailgunner joe28 mccarthy remained in the marine corps reserve after the war attaining the rank of major29 he later falsely claimed participation in 32 aerial missions in order to qualify for a distinguished flying cross and multiple awards of the air medal which the marine corps chain of command decided to approve in 1952 because of his political influence3031 mccarthy also publicized a letter of commendation which he claimed had been signed by his commanding officer and admiral chester w nimitz then chief of naval operations3233 however his commander revealed that mccarthy had written this letter himself probably while preparing award citations and commendation letters as an additional duty and that he signed his commanders name after which nimitz signed it in the process of signing numerous other such letters3433 a war wound—a badly broken leg—that mccarthy made the subject of varying stories involving airplane crashes or antiaircraft fire had in fact happened aboard ship during a raucous celebration for sailors crossing the equator for the first time353637 because of mccarthys various lies about his military heroism his tailgunner joe nickname was sarcastically used as a term of mockery by his critics383940 mccarthy campaigned for the republican senate nomination in wisconsin while still on active duty in 1944 but was defeated by alexander wiley the incumbent after he left the marines in april 1945 five months before the end of the pacific war in september 1945 mccarthy was reelected unopposed to his circuit court position he then began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 republican senate primary nomination with support from thomas coleman the republican partys political boss in wisconsin in this race he was challenging threeterm senator robert m la follette jr founder of the wisconsin progressive party and son of the celebrated wisconsin governor and senator robert m la follette sr senate campaignedit in his campaign mccarthy attacked la follette for not enlisting during the war although la follette had been 46 when pearl harbor was bombed he also claimed la follette had made huge profits from his investments while he mccarthy had been away fighting for his country in fact mccarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war netting a profit of 42000 in 1943 over 604000 in 2017 dollars la follettes investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station which earned him a profit of 47000 over two years41 the suggestion that la follette had been guilty of war profiteering was deeply damaging and mccarthy won the primary nomination 207935 votes to 202557 it was during this campaign that mccarthy started publicizing his wartime nickname tailgunner joe using the slogan congress needs a tailgunner arnold beichman later stated that mccarthy was elected to his first term in the senate with support from the communistcontrolled united electrical radio and machine workers cio which preferred mccarthy to the anticommunist robert m la follette42 in the general election against democratic opponent howard j mcmurray mccarthy won 612 to democrat mcmurrays

a popular speaker invited by many different organizations covering a wide range of topics his aides and many in the washington social circle described him as charming and friendly and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties he was far less well liked among fellow senators however who found him quicktempered and prone to impatience and even rage outside of a small circle of colleagues he was soon an isolated figure in the senate43 he was active in labormanagement issues with a reputation as a moderate republican he fought against continuation of wartime price controls especially on sugar his advocacy in this area was associated by critics with a 20000 personal loan mccarthy received from a pepsi bottling executive earning the senator the derisive nickname the pepsicola kid44 he supported the taft–hartley act over trumans veto angering labor unions in wisconsin but solidifying his business base45 in an incident for which he would be widely criticized mccarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given to a group of waffenss soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 malmedy massacre of american prisoners of war mccarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the german soldiers confessions he charged that the us army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct but never presented any evidence to support the accusation46 shortly after this a poll of the senate press corps voted mccarthy the worst us senator currently in office47 “enemies within”edit mccarthy experienced a meteoric rise in national profile on february 9 1950 when he gave a lincoln day speech to the republican womens club of wheeling west virginia his words in the speech are a matter of some debate as no audio recording was saved however it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known communists working for the state department mccarthy is usually quoted to have said the state department is infested with communists i have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the secretary of state as being members of the communist party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the state department4849 there is some dispute about whether or not mccarthy actually gave the number of people on the list as being 205 or 57 in a later telegram to president truman and when entering the speech into the congressional record he used the number 5750 the origin of the number 205 can be traced in later debates on the senate floor mccarthy referred to a 1946 letter that then–secretary of state james byrnes sent to congressman adolph j sabath in that letter byrnes said state department security investigations had resulted in recommendation against permanent employment for 284 persons and that 79 of these had been removed from their jobs this left 205 still on the state departments payroll in fact by the time of mccarthys speech only about 65 of the employees mentioned in the byrnes letter were still with the state department and all of these had undergone further security checks51 at the time of mccarthys speech communism was a significant concern in the united states this concern was exacerbated by the actions of the soviet union in eastern europe the victory of the communists in the chinese civil war the soviets development of a nuclear weapon the year before and by the contemporary controversy surrounding alger hiss and the confession of soviet spy klaus fuchs with this background and due to the sensational nature of mccarthys charge against the state department the wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in mccarthys claim the tydings committeeedit main article tydings committee mccarthy himself was taken aback by the massive media response to the wheeling speech and he was accused of continually revising both his charges and figures in salt lake city utah a few days later he cited a figure of 57 and in the senate on february 20 he claimed 81citation needed during a fivehour speech52 mccarthy presented a casebycase analysis of his 81 loyalty risks employed at the state department it is widely accepted that most of mccarthys cases were selected from the socalled lee list a report that had been compiled three years earlier for the house appropriations committee led by a former federal bureau of investigation agent named robert e lee the house investigators had reviewed security clearance documents on state department employees and had determined that there were incidents of inefficiencies53 in the security reviews of 108 employees mccarthy hid the source of his list stating that he had penetrated the iron curtain of state department secrecy with the aid of some good loyal americans in the state department54 in reciting the information from the lee list cases mccarthy consistently exaggerated representing the hearsay of witnesses as facts and converting phrases such as inclined towards communism to a communist55 senator millard tydings in response to mccarthys charges the senate voted unanimously to investigate and the tydings committee hearings were called56 this was a subcommittee of the united states senate committee on foreign relations set up in february 1950 to conduct a full and complete study and investigation as to whether persons who are disloyal to the united states are or have been employed by the department of state57 many democrats were incensed at mccarthys attack on the state department of a democratic administration and had hoped to use the hearings to discredit him the democratic chairman of the subcommittee senator millard tydings was reported to have said let me have him mccarthy for three days in public hearings and hell never show his face in the senate again58 during the hearings mccarthy moved on from his original unnamed lee list cases and used the hearings to make charges against nine specific people dorothy kenyon esther brunauer haldore hanson gustavo durán owen lattimore harlow shapley frederick schuman john s service and philip jessup some of them no longer worked for the state department or never had all had previously been the subject of charges of varying worth and validity owen lattimore became a particular focus of mccarthys who at one point described him as a top russian spy throughout the hearings mccarthy employed colorful rhetoric but produced no substantial evidence to support his accusationscitation needed from its beginning the tydings committee was marked by partisan infighting its final report written by the democratic majority concluded that the individuals on mccarthys list were neither communists nor procommunist and said the state department had an effective security program the tydings report labeled mccarthys charges a fraud and a hoax and said that the result of mccarthys actions was to confuse and divide the american people to a degree far beyond the hopes of the communists themselves republicans responded in kind with william e jenner stating that tydings was guilty of the most brazen whitewash of treasonable conspiracy in our history59 the full senate voted three times on whether to accept the report and each time the voting was precisely divided along party lines60 fame notoriety and personal lifeedit herbert block who signed his work herblock coined the term mccarthyism in this cartoon in the march 29 1950 washington post from 1950 onward mccarthy continued to exploit the fear of communism and to press his accusations that the government was failing to deal with communism within its ranks mccarthy also began investigations into the numerous homosexuals working in the foreign policy bureaucracy who were considered prime candidates for blackmail by the soviets61 these accusations received wide publicity increased his approval rating and gained him a powerful national following in congress there was little doubt that homosexuals did not belong in sensitive government positions61 since the late 1940s the government had been dismissing about five homosexuals a month from civilian posts by 1954 the number had grown twelvefold62 mixed in with the hysterics were some logic though homosexuals faced condemnation and discrimination and most of them—wishing to conceal their orientation—were vulnerable to blackmail63 dci roscoe hillenkoetter was called to congress to testify on homosexuals being employed at the cia he said the use of homosexuals as a control mechanism over individuals recruited for espionage is a generally accepted technique which has been used at least on a limited basis for many years as soon as the dci said these words his aide signaled to take the remainder of the dcis testimony off the record political historian david barrett uncovered hillenkoetters notes which reveal the remainder of the statement while this agency will never employ homosexuals on its rolls it might conceivably be necessary and in the past has actually been valuable to use known homosexuals as agents in the field i am certain that if josef stalin or a member of the politburo or a high satellite official were known to be a homosexual no member of this committee or of the congress would balk against our use of any technique to penetrate their operations after all intelligence and espionage is at best an extremely dirty business64 the senators reluctantly agreed the cia had to be flexible65 mccarthys methods also brought on the disapproval and opposition of many barely a month after mccarthys wheeling speech the term mccarthyism was coined by washington post cartoonist herbert block block and others used the word as a synonym for demagoguery baseless defamation and mudslinging later it would be embraced by mccarthy and some of his supporters mccarthyism is americanism with its sleeves rolled mccarthy said in a 1952 speech and later that year he published a book titled mccarthyism the fight for america mccarthy discredited his critics and political opponents by accusing them of being communists or communist sympathizers in the 1950 maryland senate election mccarthy campaigned for john marshall butler in his race against fourterm incumbent millard tydings with whom mccarthy had been in conflict during the tydings committee hearings in speeches supporting butler mccarthy accused tydings of protecting communists and shielding traitors mccarthys staff was heavily involved in the campaign and collaborated in the production of a campaign tabloid that contained a composite photograph doctored to make it appear that tydings was in intimate conversation with communist leader earl russell browder666768 a senate subcommittee later investigated this election and referred to it as a despicable backstreet type of campaign as well as recommending that the use of defamatory literature in a campaign be made grounds for expulsion from the senate69 the pamphlet was clearly labeled a composite mccarthy said it was wrong to distribute it though staffer jean kerr thought it was fine after he lost the election by almost 40000 votes tydings claimed foul play tydings was the highly visible chair senator of the senate armed services committee and had some responsibility for the lack of preparedness for the korean campaign he was increasingly unpopular with africanamerican voters because of his support for jim crow laws and mccarthy and anticommunism were popular with marylands catholic voters at election time35 in addition to the tydings–butler race mccarthy campaigned for several other republicans in the 1950 elections including everett dirksen against democratic incumbent and senate majority leader scott w lucas dirksen and indeed all the candidates mccarthy supported won their elections and those he opposed lost the elections including many that mccarthy was not involved in were an overall republican sweep although his impact on the elections was unclear mccarthy was credited as a key republican campaigner he was now regarded as one of the most powerful men in the senate and was treated with newfound deference by his colleagues70 in the 1952 senate elections mccarthy was returned to his senate seat with 542 of the vote compared to democrat thomas fairchilds 456 but as explained below he finished well behind a republican ticket that dwight eisenhower then seeking to become president headed—so far behind that ticket in fact that eisenhowers presence on the ticket and wisconsins overwhelming republican support were all that kept mccarthy from losing his reelection campaign wisconsin us senate election 1952 party candidate votes republican joseph mccarthy 870444 542 democratic thomas e fairchild 731402 456 in 1950 mccarthy assaulted journalist drew pearson in the cloakroom of a washington club reportedly kneeing him in the groin mccarthy who admitted the assault claimed he merely slapped pearson71 in 1952 using rumors collected by pearson nevada publisher hank greenspun wrote that mccarthy was a homosexual the major journalistic media refused to print the story and no notable mccarthy biographer has accepted the rumor as probable72 in 1953 mccarthy married jean kerr a researcher in his office he and his wife adopted a baby girl whom they named tierney elizabeth mccarthy in january 1957 mccarthy and the truman administrationedit mccarthy and president truman clashed often during the years both held office mccarthy characterized truman and the democratic party as soft on or even in league with communists and spoke of the democrats twenty years of treason truman in turn once referred to mccarthy as the best asset the kremlin has calling mccarthys actions an attempt to sabotage the foreign policy of the united states in a cold war and comparing it to shooting american soldiers in the back in a hot war73 it was the truman administrations state department that mccarthy accused of harboring 205 or 57 or 81 known communists trumans secretary of defense george catlett marshall was the target of some of mccarthys most vitriolic rhetoric marshall had been army chief of staff during world war ii and was also trumans former secretary of state marshall was a highly respected general and statesman remembered today as the architect of victory and peace the latter based on the marshall plan for postwar reconstruction of europe for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1953 mccarthy made a lengthy speech on marshall later published in 1951 as a book titled americas retreat from victory the story of george catlett marshall marshall had been involved in american foreign policy with china and mccarthy charged that marshall was directly responsible for the loss of china to communism in the speech mccarthy also implied that marshall was guilty of treason74 declared that if marshall were merely stupid the laws of probability would dictate that part of his decisions would serve this countrys interest74 and most famously accused him of being part of a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man74 during the korean war when president truman dismissed general douglas macarthur mccarthy charged that truman and his advisors must have planned the dismissal during latenight sessions when theyve had time to get the president cheerful on bourbon and bénédictine mccarthy declared the son of a bitch should be impeached75 support from roman catholics and the kennedy familyedit one of the strongest bases of anticommunist sentiment in the united states was the catholic community which constituted over 20 of the national vote mccarthy identified himself as catholic and although the great majority of catholics were democrats as his fame as a leading anticommunist grew he became popular in catholic communities across the country with strong support from many leading catholics diocesan newspapers and catholic journals76 at the same time some catholics did oppose mccarthy notably the anticommunist author father john francis cronin and the influential journal commonweal77 mccarthy established a bond with the powerful kennedy family which had high visibility among catholics mccarthy became a close friend of joseph p kennedy sr himself a fervent anticommunist and was a frequent guest at the kennedy compound in hyannis port he dated two of kennedys daughters patricia and eunice7879 it has been stated that mccarthy was godfather to robert f kennedys first child kathleen kennedy this claim has been acknowledged by roberts wife and kathleens mother ethel80 though kathleen later claimed that she looked at her christening certificate and that her actual godfather was manhattanville college of the sacred heart professor daniel walsh80 robert kennedy was chosen by mccarthy as a counsel for his investigatory committee but resigned after six months due to disagreements with mccarthy and committee counsel roy marcus cohn joseph kennedy had a national network of contacts and became a vocal supporter building mccarthys popularity among catholics and making sizable contributions to mccarthys campaigns81 the kennedy patriarch hoped that one of his sons would be president mindful of the anticatholic prejudice al smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office joseph kennedy supported mccarthy as a national catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger kennedys presidential candidacy unlike many democrats john f kennedy who served in the senate with mccarthy from 1953 until the latters death in 1957 never attacked mccarthy mccarthy had refused to campaign for kennedys 1952 opponent republican incumbent henry cabot lodge jr due to his friendship with the kennedys82 when a speaker at a february 1952 final club dinner stated that he was glad mccarthy had not attended harvard college an angry kennedy jumped up denounced the speaker and left the event83 asked by arthur m schlesinger jr why he avoided criticism of mccarthy kennedy said hell half my voters in massachusetts look on mccarthy as a hero84 mccarthy and eisenhoweredit dwight d eisenhower 34th president of the united states during the 1952 presidential election the eisenhower campaign toured wisconsin with mccarthy in a speech delivered in green bay eisenhower declared that while he agreed with mccarthys goals he disagreed with his methods in draft versions of his speech eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor george marshall which was a direct rebuke of mccarthys frequent attacks however under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that eisenhower could lose wisconsin if he alienated mccarthy supporters he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech8586 the deletion was discovered by william h laurence a reporter for the new york times and featured on its front page the next day eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions and the incident became the low point of his campaign85 with his victory in the 1952 presidential race dwight eisenhower became the first republican president in 20 years the republican party also held a majority in the house of representatives and the senate after being elected president eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of mccarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence still he never directly confronted mccarthy or criticized him by name in any speech thus perhaps prolonging mccarthys power by giving the impression that even the president was afraid to criticize him directly oshinsky disputes this stating that eisenhower was known as a harmonizer a man who could get diverse factions to work toward a common goal  leadership he explained meant patience and conciliation not hitting people over the head87 mccarthy won reelection in 1952 with 54 of the vote defeating former wisconsin state attorney general thomas e fairchild but as stated above badly trailing a republican ticket which otherwise swept the state of wisconsin all the other republican winners including eisenhower himself received at least 60 of the wisconsin vote88 those who expected that party loyalty would cause mccarthy to tone down his accusations of communists being harbored within the government were soon disappointed eisenhower had never been an admirer of mccarthy and their relationship became more hostile once eisenhower was in office in a november 1953 speech that was carried on national television mccarthy began by praising the eisenhower administration for removing 1456 truman holdovers who were  gotten rid of because of communist connections and activities or perversion he then went on to complain that john paton davies jr was still on the payroll after eleven months of the eisenhower administration even though davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that davies had tried to put communists and espionage agents in key spots in the central intelligence agency in the same speech he criticized eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing american pilots shot down over china during the korean war89 by the end of 1953 mccarthy had altered the twenty years of treason catchphrase he had coined for the preceding democratic administrations and began referring to twentyone years of treason to include eisenhowers first year in office90 as mccarthy became increasingly combative towards the eisenhower administration eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront mccarthy directly eisenhower refused saying privately nothing would please him mccarthy more than to get the publicity that would be generated by a public repudiation by the president91 on several occasions eisenhower is reported to have said of mccarthy that he did not want to get down in the gutter with that guy92 senate permanent subcommittee on investigationsedit with the beginning of his second term as senator in 1953 mccarthy was made chairman of the senate committee on government operations according to some reports republican leaders were growing wary of mccarthys methods and gave him this relatively mundane panel rather than the internal security subcommittee—the committee normally involved with investigating communists—thus putting mccarthy where he cant do any harm in the words of senate majority leader robert a taft93 however the committee on government operations included the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations and the mandate of this subcommittee was sufficiently flexible to allow mccarthy to use it for his own investigations of communists in the government mccarthy appointed roy cohn as chief counsel and 27yearold robert f kennedy as an assistant counsel to the subcommittee cohn brought with him as his assistant gerald david schine heir to a hotelchain fortune who would bear much responsibility for triggering mccarthys eventual downfall this subcommittee would be the scene of some of mccarthys most publicized exploits when the records of the closed executive sessions of the subcommittee under mccarthys chairmanship were made public in 2003–0494 senators susan collins and carl levin wrote the following in their preface to the documents senator mccarthys zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses his browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government his freewheeling style caused both the senate and the subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations and prompted the courts to act to protect the constitutional rights of witnesses at congressional hearings  these hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur95 the subcommittee first investigated allegations of communist influence in the voice of america at that time administered by the state departments united states information agency many voa personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery with mccarthy lacing his questions with hostile innuendo and false accusations96 a few voa employees alleged communist influence on the content of broadcasts but none of the charges were substantiated morale at voa was badly damaged and one of its engineers committed suicide during mccarthys investigation ed kretzman a policy advisor for the service would later comment that it was voas darkest hour when senator mccarthy and his chief hatchet man roy cohn almost succeeded in muffling it96 the subcommittee then turned to the overseas library program of the international information agency cohn toured europe examining the card catalogs of the state department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate mccarthy then recited the list of supposedly procommunist authors before his subcommittee and the press the state department bowed to mccarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves material by any controversial persons communists fellow travelers etc some libraries went as far as burning the newly forbidden books97 shortly after this in one of his carefully oblique public criticisms of mccarthy president eisenhower urged americans dont join the book burners  dont be afraid to go in your library and read every book98 soon after receiving the chair to the subcommittee on investigations mccarthy appointed joseph brown matthews generally known as j b matthews as staff director of the subcommittee one of the nations foremost anticommunists matthews had formerly been staff director for the house unamerican activities committee the appointment became controversial when it was learned that matthews had recently written an article titled reds and our churches99100 which opened with the sentence the largest single group supporting the communist apparatus in the united states is composed of protestant clergymen a group of senators denounced this shocking and unwarranted attack against the american clergy and demanded that mccarthy dismiss matthews mccarthy initially refused to do this but as the controversy mounted and the majority of his own subcommittee joined the call for matthewss ouster mccarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation for some mccarthy opponents this was a signal defeat of the senator showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed101 investigating the armyedit in autumn 1953 mccarthys committee began its illfated inquiry into the united states army this began with mccarthy opening an investigation into the army signal corps laboratory at fort monmouth mccarthy newly married to jean kerr cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation he garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the army researchers but after weeks of hearings nothing came of his investigations102 unable to expose any signs of subversion mccarthy focused instead on the case of irving peress a new york dentist who had been drafted into the army in 1952 and promoted to major in november 1953 shortly thereafter it came to the attention of the military bureaucracy that peress who was a member of the leftwing american labor party had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyaltyreview form peress superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the army within 90 days mccarthy subpoenaed peress to appear before his subcommittee on january 30 1954 peress refused to answer mccarthys questions citing his rights under the fifth amendment mccarthy responded by sending a message to secretary of the army robert t stevens demanding that peress be courtmartialed on that same day peress asked for his pending discharge from the army to be effected immediately and the next day brigadier general ralph w zwicker his commanding officer at camp kilmer in new jersey gave him an honorable separation from the army at mccarthys encouragement who promoted peress became a rallying cry among many anticommunists and mccarthy supporters in fact and as mccarthy knew peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the doctor draft law for which mccarthy had voted103 army–mccarthy hearingsedit main article army–mccarthy hearings early in 1954 the us army accused mccarthy and his chief counsel roy cohn of improperly pressuring the army to give favorable treatment to g david schine a former aide to mccarthy and a friend of cohns who was then serving in the army as a private104 mccarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith in retaliation for his questioning of zwicker the previous year the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations usually chaired by mccarthy himself was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges republican senator karl mundt was appointed to chair the committee and the army–mccarthy hearings convened on april 22 1954citation needed mccarthy chats with roy cohn right at the armymccarthy hearings the army consulted with an attorney familiar with mccarthy to determine the best approach to attacking him based on his recommendation it decided not to pursue mccarthy on the issue of communists in government the attorney feels it is almost impossible to counter mccarthy effectively on the issue of kicking communists out of government because he generally has some basis no matter how slight for his claim of communist connection35 the hearings lasted for 36 days and were broadcast on live television by abc and dumont with an estimated 20 million viewers after hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony the committee concluded that mccarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on schines behalf but that cohn had engaged in unduly persistent or aggressive efforts the committee also concluded that army secretary robert stevens and army counsel john adams made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at fort monmouth and that adams made vigorous and diligent efforts to block subpoenas for members of the army loyalty and screening board by means of personal appeal to certain members of the mccarthy committeecitation needed of far greater importance to mccarthy than the committees inconclusive final report was the negative effect that the extensive exposure had on his popularity many in the audience saw him as bullying reckless and dishonest and the daily newspaper summaries of the hearings were also frequently unfavorable105106 late in the hearings senator stuart symington made an angry and prophetic remark to mccarthy upon being told by mccarthy that youre not fooling anyone senator the american people have had a look at you now for six weeks youre not fooling anyone either107 in gallup polls of january 1954 50 of those polled had a positive opinion of mccarthy in june that number had fallen to 34 in the same polls those with a negative opinion of mccarthy increased from 29 to 45108 an increasing number of republicans and conservatives were coming to see mccarthy as a liability to the party and to anticommunism congressman george h bender noted there is a growing impatience with the republican party mccarthyism has become a synonym for witchhunting star chamber methods and the denial of  civil liberties109 frederick woltman a reporter with a longstanding reputation as a staunch anticommunist wrote a fivepart series of articles criticizing mccarthy in the new york worldtelegram he stated that mccarthy has become a major liability to the cause of anticommunism and accused him of wild twisting of facts and near facts that repels authorities in the field110111 joseph n welch left being questioned by senator mccarthy june 9 1954 the most famous incident in the hearings was an exchange between mccarthy and the armys chief legal representative joseph nye welch on june 9 the 30th day of the hearings welch challenged roy cohn to provide us attorney general herbert brownell jr with mccarthys list of 130 communists or subversives in defense plants before the sun goes down mccarthy stepped in and said that if welch was so concerned about persons aiding the communist party he should check on a man in his boston law office named fred fisher who had once belonged to the national lawyers guild a progressive lawyers association112 in an impassioned defense of fisher welch responded until this moment senator i think i never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness  when mccarthy resumed his attack welch interrupted him let us not assassinate this lad further senator youve done enough have you no sense of decency sir at long last have you left no sense of decency when mccarthy once again persisted welch cut him off and demanded the chairman call the next witness at that point the gallery erupted in applause and a recess was called113 edward r murrow see it nowedit even before welch asked mccarthy have you no sense of decency sir at long last in the hearings one of the most prominent attacks on mccarthys methods was an episode of the television documentary series see it now hosted by journalist edward r murrow which was broadcast on march 9 1954 titled a report on senator joseph r mccarthy the episode consisted largely of clips of mccarthy speaking in these clips mccarthy accuses the democratic party of twenty years of treason describes the american civil liberties union as listed as a front for and doing the work of the communist party114 and berates and harangues various witnesses including general zwicker115 edward r murrow pioneer in broadcast journalism in his conclusion murrow said of mccarthy no one familiar with the history of this country can deny that congressional committees are useful it is necessary to investigate before legislating but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one and the junior senator from wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly his primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind as between the internal and the external threats of communism we must not confuse dissent with disloyalty we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law we will not walk in fear one of another we will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write to speak to associate and to defend causes that were for the moment unpopular this is no time for men who oppose senator mccarthys methods to keep silent or for those who approve we can deny our heritage and our history but we cannot escape responsibility for the result there is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities as a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age we proclaim ourselves as indeed we are the defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home the actions of the junior senator from wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad and given considerable comfort to our enemies and whose fault is that not really his he didnt create this situation of fear he merely exploited it—and rather successfully cassius was right the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves116 the following week see it now ran another episode critical of mccarthy this one focusing on the case of annie lee moss an africanamerican army clerk who was the target of one of mccarthys investigations the murrow shows together with the televised army–mccarthy hearings of the same year were the major causes of a nationwide popular opinion backlash against mccarthy117 in part because for the first time his statements were being publicly challenged by noteworthy figures to counter the negative publicity mccarthy appeared on see it now on april 6 1954 and made a number of charges against the popular murrow including the accusation that he colluded with voks the russian espionage and propaganda organization118 this response did not go over well with viewers and the result was a further decline in mccarthys popularitycitation needed external video booknotes interview with arthur herman on joseph mccarthy reexamining the life and legacy of americas most hated senator february 6 2000 cspan according to popular historian arthur herman murrows staff edited the film to show mccarthy behaving in an unflattering way herman quotes john cogley of commonweal a mccarthy critic as stating a totally different selection of film would turn mccarthy into a man on a shining white steed—infinitely reasonable burdened with the onus of singlehandedly cleaning out subversives in the face of violent criticism and that murrow used partial truth and innuendo119 the joe must go recall attemptedit on march 18 1954 saukprairie star editor leroy gore of sauk city wisconsin urged the recall of mccarthy in a frontpage editorial that ran alongside a sample petition that readers could fill out and mail to the newspaper a republican and former mccarthy supporter gore cited the senator with subverting president eisenhowers authority disrespecting wisconsinsown gen ralph wise zwicker and ignoring the plight of wisconsin dairy farmers faced with priceslashing surpluses despite critics claims that a recall attempt was foolhardy the joe must go movement caught fire and was backed by a diverse coalition including other republican leaders democrats businessmen farmers and students wisconsins constitution stipulates the number of signatures needed to force a recall election must exceed onequarter the number of voters in the most recent gubernatorial election requiring the antimccarthy movement to gather some 404000 signatures in sixty days with little support from organized labor or the state democratic party the roughly organized recall effort attracted national attention particularly during the concurrent armymccarthy hearings following the deadline of june 5 the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent out of state to avoid a subpoena from the sauk county district attorney an ardent mccarthy supporter who was investigating the leaders of the recall campaign on the grounds that they had violated wisconsins corrupt practices act chicago newspapermen later tallied 335000 names while another 50000 were said to be hidden in minneapolis with other lists buried on sauk county

committeeedit senator ralph flanders who introduced the resolution calling for mccarthy to be censured several members of the us senate had opposed mccarthy well before 1953 senator margaret chase smith a maine republican delivered her declaration of conscience on june 1 1950 calling for an end to the use of smear tactics without mentioning mccarthy or anyone else by name six other republican senators – wayne morse irving ives charles w tobey edward john thye george aiken and robert c hendrickson – joined her in condemning mccarthys tactics mccarthy referred to smith and her fellow senators as snow white and the six dwarfs122 on march 9 1954 vermont republican senator ralph e flanders gave a humorlaced speech on the senate floor questioning mccarthys tactics in fighting communism likening mccarthyism to housecleaning with much clatter and hullabaloo he recommended that mccarthy turn his attention to the worldwide encroachment of communism outside north america123124 in a june 1 speech flanders compared mccarthy to adolf hitler accusing him of spreading division and confusion and saying were the junior senator from wisconsin in the pay of the communists he could not have done a better job for them125 on june 11 flanders introduced a resolution to have mccarthy removed as chair of his committees although there were many in the senate who believed that some sort of disciplinary action against mccarthy was warranted there was no clear majority supporting this resolution some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the senates rules regarding committee chairs and seniority flanders next introduced a resolution to censure mccarthy the resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on mccarthys part as flanders put it it was not his breaches of etiquette or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing but rather his overall pattern of behavior ultimately a bill of particulars listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution a special committee chaired by senator arthur vivian watkins was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution this committee opened hearings on august 31126 senator arthur v watkins after two months of hearings and deliberations the watkins committee recommended that mccarthy be censured on two of the 46 counts his contempt of the subcommittee on rules and administration which had called him to testify in 1951 and 1952 and his abuse of general zwicker in 1954 the zwicker count was dropped by the full senate on the grounds that mccarthys conduct was arguably induced by zwickers own behavior in place of this count a new one was drafted regarding mccarthys statements about the watkins committee itself127 the two counts on which the senate ultimately voted were that mccarthy had failed to cooperate with the subcommittee on rules and administration and repeatedly abused the members who were trying to carry out assigned duties  that mccarthy had charged three members of the watkins select committee with deliberate deception and fraud  that the special senate session  was a lynch party and had characterized the committee as the unwitting handmaiden involuntary agent and attorneys in fact of the communist party and had acted contrary to senatorial ethics and tended to bring the senate into dishonor and disrepute to obstruct the constitutional processes of the senate and to impair its dignity128 on december 2 1954 the senate voted to condemn mccarthy on both counts by a vote of 67 to 22129 the democrats present unanimously favored condemnation and the republicans were split evenly the only senator not on record was john f kennedy who was hospitalized for back surgery kennedy never indicated how he would have voted130 immediately after the vote senator h styles bridges a mccarthy supporter argued that the resolution was not a censure resolution because the word condemn rather than censure was used in the final draft the word censure was then removed from the title of the resolution though it is generally regarded and referred to as a censure of mccarthy both by historians131 and in senate documents132 mccarthy himself said i wouldnt exactly call it a vote of confidence he added i dont feel ive been lynched133 but indiana senator william e jenner one of mccarthys friends and fellow republicans likened mccarthys conduct to that of the kid who came to the party and peed in the lemonade134 final yearsedit after his censure mccarthy continued senatorial duties for another two and a half years but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined his colleagues in the senate avoided him his speeches on the senate floor were delivered to a nearempty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention135 the press that had once recorded his every public statement now ignored him and outside speaking engagements dwindled almost to nothing president eisenhower finally freed of mccarthys political intimidation quipped to his cabinet that mccarthyism was now mccarthywasm136 still mccarthy continued to rail against communism he warned against attendance at summit conferences with the reds saying that you cannot offer friendship to tyrants and murderers  without advancing the cause of tyranny and murder137 he declared that coexistence with communists is neither possible nor honorable nor desirable our longterm objective must be the eradication of communism from the face of the earth in one of his final acts in the senate mccarthy opposed president eisenhowers nomination to the supreme court of william j brennan after reading a speech brennan had given shortly beforehand in which he characterized mccarthys anticommunist investigations as witch hunts mccarthys opposition failed to gain any traction however and he was the only senator to vote against brennans confirmation138 mccarthys biographers agree that he was a changed man after the censure declining both physically and emotionally he became a pale ghost of his former self in the words of fred j cook139 it was reported that mccarthy suffered from cirrhosis of the liver and was frequently hospitalized for alcoholism numerous eyewitnesses including senate aide george reedy and journalist tom wicker reported finding him alarmingly drunk in the senate journalist richard rovere 1959 wrote he had always been a heavy drinker and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever but he was not always drunk he went on the wagon for him this meant beer instead of whiskey for days and weeks at a time the difficulty toward the end was that he couldnt hold the stuff he went to pieces on his second or third drink and he did not snap back quickly140 deathedit tombstone of joseph mccarthy with the fox river in the background mccarthy died in bethesda naval hospital on may 2 1957 at the age of 48 his death certificate listed the cause of death as hepatitis acute cause unknown doctors had not previously reported him to be in critical condition it was hinted in the press that he died of alcoholism an estimation that is now accepted by contemporary biographers8 he was given a state funeral attended by 70 senators and a solemn pontifical requiem mass was said before more than 100 priests and 2000 others at washingtons st matthews cathedral thousands of people viewed the body in washington he was buried in st marys parish cemetery appleton wisconsin where more than 17000 filed through st marys church to pay their last respects141 three senators—george w malone william e jenner and herman welker—had flown from washington to appleton on the plane carrying mccarthys casket robert f kennedy quietly attended the funeral in wisconsin mccarthy was survived by his wife jean and their adopted daughter tierney in the summer of 1957 a special election was held to fill mccarthys seat in the primaries voters in both parties turned away from mccarthys legacy the republican primary was won by walter j kohler jr who called for a clean break from mccarthys approach he defeated former congressman glenn robert davis who charged that eisenhower was soft on communism the democratic winner was william proxmire who called the late mccarthy a disgrace to wisconsin to the senate and to america on august 27 proxmire won the election serving in the seat for 32 years until the end of his fifth full term at the start of 1989142 legacyedit william bennett former reagan administration secretary of education summed up his perspective in his 2007 book america the last best hope the cause of anticommunism which united millions of americans and which gained the support of democrats republicans and independents was undermined by sen joe mccarthy  mccarthy addressed a real problem disloyal elements within the us government but his approach to this real problem was to cause untold grief to the country he claimed to love  worst of all mccarthy besmirched the honorable cause of anticommunism he discredited legitimate efforts to counter soviet subversion of american institutions143 arguments for vindicationedit

soviet espionage data now opened to the west and newly released transcripts of closed hearings before mccarthys subcommittee—has partially vindicated mccarthy by showing that many of his identifications of communists were correct and that the scale of soviet espionage activity in the united states during the 1940s and 1950s was larger than many scholars suspected144145146 after reviewing evidence from venona and other sources historian john earl haynes concluded that of 159 people identified on lists used or referenced by mccarthy evidence was substantial that nine had aided soviet espionage efforts he suggested that a majority of those on the lists could legitimately have been considered security risks but that a substantial minority could not147 many other scholars including some generally regarded as conservative have opposed these viewswhich148 among those implicated in files later made public from the venona project and soviet sources were cedric belfrage frank coe lauchlin currie harold glasser david karr mary jane keeney and leonard mins147149150151152153154 these viewpoints are considered by historian david oshinsky to be fringe revisionist history155 challenging efforts aimed at the rehabilitation of mccarthy haynes argues that mccarthys attempts to make anticommunism a partisan weapon actually threatened the postwar anticommunist consensus thereby ultimately harming anticommunist efforts more than helping156 diplomat george f kennan drew on his state department experience to provide his view that the penetration of the american governmental services by members or agents conscious or otherwise of the american communist party in the late 1930s was not a figment of the imagination it really existed and it assumed proportions which while never overwhelming were also not trivial kennan wrote that under the roosevelt administration warnings which should have been heeded fell too often on deaf or incredulous ears157 however kennan made his assessment before the revelation of the venona decrypts the previous cautious assessments had to be revised not a few but hundreds of american communists abetted soviet espionage in the united states in the 1930s and 1940s no modern government had been more thoroughly penetrated plus only a tiny fraction of the venona intercepts have been decrypted about 3 so no one knows the entire extent of the penetration all anyone can know for sure is that the soviet penetration into the united states government was massive158159 huac and sacbedit mccarthys hearings are often incorrectly conflated with the hearings of the house committee on unamerican activities huac huac is best known for the investigation of alger hiss and for its investigation of the hollywood film industry which led to the blacklisting of hundreds of actors writers and directors huac was a house committee and as such had no formal connection with mccarthy who served in the senate although the existence of the house unamerican activities committee thrived in part as a result of mccarthys activities huac was active for 37 years 19381975160 similarly the subversive activities control board sacb was a fivemember committee established by the mccarran internal security act in 1950 which had a mandate similar to huac and inspired by mccarthy to locate and investigate socalled subversives or those sympathetic to the communists they were accused of promoting the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship in the united states president truman vetoed the act sending congress a lengthy veto message in which he criticized specific provisions as the greatest danger to freedom of speech press and assembly since the alien and sedition laws of 1798 and called it a mockery of the bill of rights and a long step toward totalitarianism his veto was overridden sacb was active for 18 years 19501968 but the supreme court did not rule all sections of the law were unconstitutional until 1993161 in popular cultureedit from the start of his notoriety mccarthy served as a favorite subject for political cartoonists he was traditionally depicted in a negative light normally pertaining to mccarthyism and his accusations herblocks cartoon that coined the term mccarthyism appeared less than two months after the senators now famous february 1950 speech in wheeling west virginia in 1953 the popular daily comic strip pogo introduced the character simple j malarkey a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to mccarthy after a worried rhode island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip creator walt kelly began depicting the malarkey character with a bag over his head concealing his features the explanation was that malarkey was hiding from a rhode island red hen a clear reference to the controversy over the malarkey character162 as his fame grew mccarthy increasingly became the target of ridicule and parody he was impersonated by nightclub and radio impressionists and was satirized in mad magazine on the red skelton show and elsewhere several comedy songs lampooning the senator were released in 1954 including point of order by stan freberg and daws butler senator mccarthy blues by hal block and unionist folk singer joe glazers joe mccarthys band sung to the tune of mcnamaras band also in 1954 the radio comedy team bob and ray parodied mccarthy with the character commissioner carstairs in their soap opera spoof mary backstayge noble wife that same year the canadian broadcasting corporation radio network broadcast a satire the investigator whose title character was a clear imitation of mccarthy a recording of the show became popular in the united states and was reportedly played by president eisenhower at cabinet meetings163 the 1953 fiction novel mr costello hero by theodore sturgeon was described by noted journalist and author paul williams as the alltime great story about senator joseph mccarthy who he was and how he did what he did164 the novel was adapted in 1958 by x minus one into a radio teleplay and broadcast on july 3 1956165 in a 1977 interview sturgeon commented that it was his concerns about the ongoing mccarthy hearings that prompted him to write the story166 a more serious fictional portrayal of mccarthy played a central role in the 1959 novel the manchurian candidate by richard condon167 the character of senator john iselin a demagogic anticommunist is closely modeled on mccarthy even to the varying numbers of communists he asserts are employed by the federal government168 he remains a major character in the 1962 film version169 mccarthy was portrayed by peter boyle in the 1977 emmywinning television movie tail gunner joe a dramatization of mccarthys life170 archival footage of mccarthy himself was used in the 2005 movie good night and good luck about edward r murrow and the see it now episode that challenged mccarthy171
