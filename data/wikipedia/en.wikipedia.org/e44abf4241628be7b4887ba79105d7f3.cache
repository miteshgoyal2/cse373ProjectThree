editionsedit although there is now only a morning edition for many years there were two distinct newspapers—the sun in the morning and the evening sun in the afternoon—each with its own reporting and editorial staff the evening sun was first published in 1910 under the leadership of charles h grasty former owner of the evening news and a firm believer in the evening circulation for most of its existence the evening sun led its morning sibling in circulation in 1959 the afternoon editions circulation was 220174 compared to 196675 for the am edition18 however by the 1980s cultural technological and economic shifts in america were eating away at afternoon newspapers market share with readers flocking to morning papers or switching to nightly television news broadcasts19 in 1992 the afternoon papers circulation was 13380020 by mid1995 the evening suns readership — 86360 — had been eclipsed by the sun — 26458321 the evening sun ceased publication on september 15 1995 dailyedit

sragow john steadman jules witcover and william f zorzi the paper has won 15 pulitzer prizes facilitiesedit the baltimore sun north calvert street sun park in port covington the first issue of the sun a fourpage tabloid was printed at 21 light street in downtown baltimore in the mid1830s a fivestory structure at the corner of baltimore and south streets was built in 1851 the iron building as it was called was destroyed in the great baltimore fire of 1904 in 1906 operations were moved to charles and baltimore streets where the sun was written published and distributed for nearly 50 years in 1950 the operation was moved to a larger modern plant at calvert and centre streets in 1979 ground was broken for a new addition to the calvert street plant to house modern pressroom facilities the new facility commenced operations in 1981 in april 1988 at a cost of 180 million the company purchased 60 acres 24 ha of land at port covington and built sun park the new building houses a satellite printing and packaging facility as well as the distribution operation26 the suns printing facility at sun park has highly sophisticated computerized presses and automated insertion equipment in the packaging area to keep pace with the speed of the presses and automated guided vehicles intelligent electronic forklifts deliver the newsprint to the presses in 1885 the sun constructed a building for its washington bureau at 1317 f street nw27 the building is on the national register controversiesedit the paper became embroiled in a controversy involving the former governor of maryland robert l ehrlich jr r ehrlich had issued an executive order on november 18 2004 banning state executive branch employees from talking to sun columnist michael olesker and reporter david nitkin claiming that their coverage had been unfair to the administration this led the sun to file a first amendment lawsuit against the ehrlich administration the case was dismissed by a us district court judge and the sun appealed to the 4th us circuit court of appeals which upheld the dismissal28 the same olesker was forced to resign on january 4 2006 after being accused of plagiarism the baltimore city paper reported that several of his columns contained sentences or paragraphs that were extremely similar although not identical to material previously published in the washington post the new york times and the sun29 several of his colleagues both in and out of the paper were highly critical of the forced resignation taking the view that the use of previously published boilerplate material was common newsroom practice and oleskers alleged plagiarism was in line with that practice30 between 2006 and 2007 thomas andrews drake a former national security agency executive allegedly leaked classified information to siobhan gorman then a national security reporter for the sun drake was charged in april 2010 with 10 felony counts in relation to the leaks31 in june 2011 all 10 original charges were dropped in what was widely viewed as an acknowledgement that the government had no valid case against the whistleblower who eventually pleaded to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer drake was the 2011 recipient of the ridenhour prize for truthtelling in popular cultureedit the baltimore sun is featured in season 5 of the wire which was created by former sun reporter david simon32 like all of the institutions featured in the wire the sun is portrayed as having many deeply dysfunctional qualities while also having very dedicated people on its staff the season focuses on the role of the media in affecting political decisions in city hall and the priorities of the baltimore police department additionally the show explores the business pressures of modern media through layoffs and buyouts occurring at the sun on the orders of the tribune company the corporate owner of the sun one storyline involves a troubled sun reporter named scott templeton with an escalating tendency of sensationalizing and falsifying stories the wire portrays the managing editors of the sun as turning a blind eye to the protests of a concerned line editor in the search for a pulitzer prize the show insinuates that the motivation for this institutional dysfunction is the business pressures of modern media and working for a flagship newspaper in a major media market like the new york times or the washington post is seen as the only way to avoid the cutbacks occurring at the sun season 5 was the wires last the last episode 30 features a montage at the end portraying the ultimate fate of the major characters it shows templeton at columbia university with the senior editors of the fictional sun accepting the pulitzer prize with no mention being made as to the aftermath of templetons career news partnershipedit since september 2008 the baltimore sun became the newspaper partner of station wjztv owned and operated by cbs involving sharing content story leads
