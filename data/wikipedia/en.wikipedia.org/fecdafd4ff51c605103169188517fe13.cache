pat tornillo jr had requested that the herald print his rebuttal to an editorial criticizing him citing floridas righttoreply law which mandated that newspapers print such responses represented by longtime counsel dan paul the herald challenged the law and the case was appealed to the supreme court11 the court unanimously overturned the florida statute under the press freedom clause of the first amendment ruling that governmental compulsion on a newspaper to publish that which reason tells it should not be published is unconstitutional12 the decision showed the limitations of a 1969 decision red lion broadcasting co v federal communications commission in which a similar fairness doctrine had been upheld for radio and television and establishing that broadcast and print media had different constitutional protections11 in 2003 the miami herald and el universal of mexico city created an international joint venture and in 2004 they together launched the herald mexico a shortlived englishlanguage newspaper for readers in mexico its final issue was published in may 2007 on july 27 2005 former miami city commissioner arthur teele walked into the main lobby of the heralds headquarters and phoned herald columnist jim defede one of several telephone conversations that the two had had during the day to say that he had a package for defede he then asked a security officer to tell his teeles wife stephanie that he loved her before pulling out a gun and committing suicide13 this happened the day the miami new times a weekly newspaper published salacious details of teeles alleged affairs including allegations that he had had sex and used cocaine with a transsexual prostitute the day before committing suicide teele had had another telephone conversation with defede who recorded this call without teeles knowledge which was illegal under florida law defede admitted to the heralds management that he had taped the call although the paper used quotes from the tape in its coverage defede was fired the next day for violating the papers code of ethics and he was likely guilty of a felony many journalists and readers of the herald disagreed with the decision to fire rather than suspend defede arguing that it had been made in haste and that the punishment was disproportionate to the offense 528 journalists including about 200 current and former herald staffers called on the herald to reinstate defede but the papers management refused to back down the state attorneys office later declined to file charges against the columnist holding that the potential violation was without a living victim or a complainant14 on september 8 2006 the miami heralds president jesús díaz jr fired three journalists because they had allegedly been paid by the united states government to work for anticuba propaganda tv and radio channels the three were pablo alfonso wilfredo cancio isla and olga connor15 less than a month later responding to pressure from the cuban community in miami díaz resigned after reinstating the fired journalists nevertheless he continues to claim that such payments especially if made from organs of the state violate the principles of journalistic independence16 at least seven other journalists who do not work at the herald namely miguel cossio carlos alberto montaner juan manuel cao ariel remos omar claro helen aguirre ferre paul crespo and ninoska perezcastellón were also paid for programs on radio martí or tv martí1517 both financed by the government of the united states through the broadcasting board of governors receiving
