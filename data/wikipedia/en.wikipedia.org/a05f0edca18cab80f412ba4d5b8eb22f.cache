he had plagiarized11 in a july 2017 letter to clarke the npss dean of students commander paul rasmussen wrote that he concurred with the honor code board that clarkes thesis was in violation of the

detention camp and hold them indefinitely under a suspension of habeas corpus3334 other political views and associationsedit clarke holding up a copy of the united states constitution clarke is registered as a democrat35 which according to journal sentinel reporter daniel bice is advantageous in heavily democratic milwaukee county however clarke is almost universally regarded as a

has the backing of the national rifle association which has raised funds for his reelection campaigns3 clarke has in turn been criticized by the local democratic party36 on his website in 2014 clarke stated that he questioned why the office of sheriff is a partisan election and wrote i have never asked a person to vote for me because i run as a democrat i ask them to vote for me based on my 35year commitment to keeping citizens safe most voters get it when it comes to public safety there is no democrat or republican way to be a sheriff the enemy is not the opposing party the enemy is the criminal3537 maurice chammah characterized clarke as an iconoclastic sheriff one of a long line of controversycourting lawmen that includes richard mack and joe arpaio in arizona38 clarke has been

controversies27 sheriff of milwaukeeedit budget and clashes with milwaukee county governmentedit clarke has often clashed with the county government over the sheriffs office budget engaging in a longrunning highprofile tiff over the issue with milwaukee county executive chris abele with clarke providing the more incendiary rhetoric abeles proposed budget for 2014 would cut 12 million from the sheriffs office budget eliminating 69 jobs and shifting park patrols emergency management 911 communications and training divisions to other entities such as the milwaukee police department suburban police departments and the county department of emergency preparedness abele described the budget as a way to refocus the sheriffs office on core mandated services clarke issued a statement calling abele a vindictive little man and saying that abele should be drugtested he has to be on heroin or hallucinating with that statement abele responded by saying that it was unfortunate the sheriff instead of engaging in thoughtful civil discourse is making personal attacks and making light of a serious problem in our community and state40 on another occasion clarke said that abele had penis envy36 in 2015 clarke clashed with abele again after clarke filed a lawsuit against the county over the sheriffs budget seeking 25 million in funds to hire 75 deputies 43 house of corrections officers and 17 supervisors clarke argued that his office is underfunded by the county while abele noted that the sheriffs office had received the largest increase of any county department and criticized clarke for having what he termed a very heavy command staff a lot of unnecessary overtime and redundancies in courthouse security41 clarke sued abele alleging that he had violated clarkes right to free speech through the budget process a federal judge dismissed clarkes suit in april 201642 a county audit released in 2012 showed that the milwaukee county sheriffs office used asset forfeiture funds to buy exercise equipment for clarkes command staff for a disney training and for a mounted patrol unit the audit reported that the spending violated county procurement rules although not federal rules on the use of seized money clarke was criticized for the amount of money spent on the mounted patrol by county supervisor patricia jursik clarke defended the offices use of the funds43

milwaukee county taxpayers paid the legal fees42 the county spent an additional 83000 defending itself against clarkes lawsuits42 in 2012 the milwaukee county sheriffs office under clarke spent 75000 on an order of 565 new glock handguns with glowinthedark sights enough to outfit each of the departments 275 deputies with two of the popular guns and still have some left over44 the order was criticized as excessive by critics including county supervisor john weishan jr who said there was absolutely no reason to justify the purchase and the milwaukee county deputy sheriffs association president who said that he would have preferred the sheriffs department to use funds to rehire laidoff deputies rather than to replace weapons44 clarke declined to comment but a department official defended the purchase44 house of correction and detainee abuse controversiesedit in january 2008 a national institute of corrections audit of the milwaukee county house of correction in franklin identified 44 areas of concern calling the house of correction dysfunctional and determining that it suffered from serious security staff morale and management flaws the house of corrections was at the time a separate milwaukee county department overseen by a superintendent who reported to then milwaukee county executive scott walker walker and the county board transferred control over the house to the sheriffs department under clarke on january 1 200943 clarke has been repeatedly accused of abusing detainees at the county jail45 following the deaths of four inmates at the jail in six months the us department of justice launched an investigation of the jail45 milwaukee county chief medical examiner brian peterson accused clarke of verbally harassing and threatening him in an october 2016

according to inmates the water was turned off for six days and the staff refused to provide water to thomas on september 15 2016 the milwaukee medical examiner ruled thomass death a homicide47 later that day clarkes office sent out a press release which stated it would be withholding employee internal investigations and will not be commenting on this matter until the completion of all sic investigative and review processes and any resultant civil litigation4849 asked about the lawsuit in march 2017 clarke said that he had no comment on the lawsuit but noted thomas criminal background50

abuse of a resident of a penal facility—and recommended that charges be brought51 death of newborn and shackling of pregnant womenedit clarkes department has come under fire for its use of restraints

federal bureau of prisons52 in 2014 a woman who was handcuffed and shackled for 21 hours while in labor sued the county5254 in 2017 a second lawsuit was filed by another woman who was shackled while giving birth and while hospitalized for prenatal care and postpartum treatment the suit contends that the jail has a blanket policy of shackling all hospitalized inmates regardless of their criminal or medical history and that at least 40 women were shackled in this manner52 in june 2017 a federal jury awarded 67 million in a lawsuit by a woman who accused a milwaukee county jail guard of raping

that she was denied medical attention before her pregnancy had medical appointments canceled received prenatal vitamins only once and was laughed at by guards after going into labor57 this death and others at the jail prompted calls for clarkes resignation from a county supervisor and several democratic state legislators57 proselytism lawsuitedit in 2006 clarke invited members of an evangelical christian organization the fellowship of christian centurions to speak at several mandatory employee meetings at which the group members proselytized several deputies complained about the centurions

national attention prompting federal investigations to examine clarkes conduct61 in a may 2017 letter the us attorneys office wrote that it had declined to prosecute clarke for federal civilrights offenses writing our decision is not meant to affirm the wisdom or propriety of what occurred it reflects only our belief that it would be difficult or impossible to prove a violation of the only

refused to cooperate with the investigation61 and has blocked auditors from interviewing milwaukee county sheriffs deputies60 clarkes refusal to cooperate in the investigation prompted the milwaukee
