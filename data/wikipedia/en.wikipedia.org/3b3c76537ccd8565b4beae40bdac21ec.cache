prominent seattlearea residents including methodist preacher daniel bagley saw this as a chance to add to the citys potential and prestige they convinced early founder of seattle and member of the territorial legislature arthur a denny on the importance of the school two universities were initially chartered but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in lewis county provided that locally donated land was available when no site emerged denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider seattle as a location in 1858 in 1861 scouting began for an appropriate 10 acres 4 ha site in seattle to serve as a new university campus arthur and mary denny donated eight acres while fellow pioneers edward lander and charlie and mary terry donated two acres

prime setting for their worlds fair they came to an agreement with washingtons board of regents that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition in exchange washington would take advantage of the campus and its development after the fairs conclusion this arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several buildings prepared in part by john charles olmsted the plan was later
