popular music history34 later that year during recording sessions for the album rubber soul mccartney began to supplant lennon as the dominant musical force in the band musicologist ian macdonald wrote from 1965  mccartney would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter but also as instrumentalist arranger producer and de facto musical director of the beatles35 critics described rubber soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the bands music and lyrics36 considered a high point in the beatles catalogue both lennon and mccartney said they had written the music for the song in my life37 mccartney said of the album wed had our cute period and now it was time to expand38 recording engineer norman smith stated that the rubber soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band the clash between john and paul was becoming obvious  and as far as paul was concerned george harrison could do no right—paul was absolutely finicky39 in 1966 the

the album marked an artistic leap for the beatles40 the first of three consecutive mccartney asides the single paperback writer preceded the lps release41 the beatles produced a short promotional film for the song and another for its bside rain the films described by harrison as the forerunner of videos aired on the ed sullivan show and top of the pops in june 196642 revolver also included

to start a new project which became sgt peppers lonely hearts club band widely regarded as rocks first concept album49 mccartney was inspired to create a new persona for the group to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that they had musically matured he invented the fictional band of the albums title track50 as mccartney explained we were fed up with being the beatles we really hated that fucking four little moptop approach we were not boys we were men  and we thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers51 starting in november 1966 the band adopted an experimental attitude during recording sessions for the album52 according to engineer geoff emerick the beatles were looking to go out on a limb both musically and sonically  we were utilising a lot of tape varispeeding and other manipulation techniques  limiters and  effects like flanging and adt53 their recording of a day in the life required a fortypiece orchestra which martin and mccartney took turns conducting54 the sessions produced the double aside single strawberry fields foreverpenny lane in february 1967 and the lp followed in june31nb 6 mccartneys shes leaving home was an orchestral pop song macdonald described the track as among the finest work on sgt pepper—imperishable popular art of its time56 based on an ink drawing by mccartney the lps cover included a collage designed by pop artists peter blake and jann haworth featuring the beatles in costume as the sgt peppers lonely hearts club band standing with a host of celebrities57nb 7 the heavy moustaches worn by the beatles reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends on the band while their clothing spoofed the vogue in britain for military fashions wrote gould59 scholar david scott kastan described sgt pepper as the most important and influential rockandroll album ever recorded60 after brian died  paul took over and supposedly led us you know  we went round in circles  we broke up then that was the disintegration i thought weve fuckin had it61 —john lennon rolling stone magazine 1970 epsteins death at age 32 in august 1967 created a void which left the beatles perplexed and concerned about their future62 mccartney stepped in to fill that void and gradually became the de facto leader and business manager of the group that lennon had once led63 in his first creative suggestion after this change of leadership mccartney proposed that the band move forward on their plans to produce a film for television which was to become magical mystery tour according to beatles historian mark lewisohn the project was an administrative nightmare throughout64 mccartney largely directed the film which brought the group their first unfavourable critical response65 however the films soundtrack was more successful it was released in the uk as a sixtrack double extended play disc ep and as an identically titled lp in the us filled out with five songs from the bands recent singles31 the only capitol compilation later included in the groups official canon of studio albums the magical mystery tour lp achieved 8 million in sales within three weeks of its release higher initial sales than any other capitol lp up to that point66 in january 1968 emi filmed the beatles for a promotional trailer intended to advertise the animated film yellow submarine loosely based on the imaginary world evoked by mccartneys 1966 composition though critics admired the film for its visual style humour and music the soundtrack album issued seven months later received a less enthusiastic response67 by late 1968 relations within the band were deteriorating the tension grew during the recording of their selftitled double album also known as the white album68nb 8 matters worsened the following year during the let it be sessions when a camera crew filmed mccartney lecturing the group weve been very negative since mr epstein passed away  we were always fighting his discipline a bit but its silly to fight that discipline if its our own70 in march 1969 mccartney married his first wife linda eastman and in august the couple had their first child mary named after his late mother71 abbey road was the bands last recorded album and martin suggested a continuously moving piece of music urging the group to think symphonically72 mccartney agreed but lennon did not they eventually compromised agreeing to mccartneys suggestion an lp featuring individual songs on side one and a long medley on side two72 in october 1969 a rumour surfaced that mccartney had died in a car crash in 1966 and been replaced by a lookalike but this was quickly refuted when a november life magazine cover featured him and his family accompanied by the caption paul is still with us73

after 56 years223224 musicianship mccartney was largely a selftaught musician and his approach was described by musicologist ian macdonald as by nature drawn to musics formal aspects yet wholly untutored  he produced technically finished work almost entirely by instinct his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears a natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony225 mccartney commented i prefer to think of my approach to music as  rather like the primitive cave artists who drew without training226 bass guitar mccartneys skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other bassists including sting dr dre bassist mike elizondo and colin moulding of xtc227 best known for primarily using a plectrum or pick mccartney occasionally plays fingerstyle228 he does not use slapping or muting techniques229 he was strongly influenced by motown artists in particular james jamerson who mccartney called a hero for his melodic style he was also influenced by brian wilson as he commented because he went to very unusual places230 another favourite bassist of his is stanley clarke231 paul is one of the most innovative bass players half the stuff thats going on now is directly ripped off from his beatles period hes an egomaniac about everything else but his bass playing hed always been a bit coy about232 —lennon playboy magazine january 1981 during mccartneys early years with the beatles he primarily used a höfner 5001 bass though in 1965 he began sporadically using a rickenbacker 4001s for recording while typically using vox amplifiers by 1967 he had also begun using a fender bassman for amplification233 during the late 1980s and early 1990s he used a wal 5string which he said made him play more thicksounding basslines in contrast to the much lighter höfner which inspired him to play more sensitively something he considers fundamental to his playing style229 he changed back to the höfner around 1990 for that reason229 he uses mesa boogie bass amplifiers while performing live234 macdonald identified shes a woman as the turning point when mccartneys bass playing began to evolve dramatically and beatles biographer chris ingham singled out rubber soul as the moment when mccartneys playing exhibited significant progress particularly on the word235 bacon and morgan agreed calling mccartneys groove on the track a high point in pop bass playing and the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument236 macdonald inferred the influence of james browns papas got a brand new bag and wilson picketts in the midnight hour american soul tracks from which mccartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he delivered his most spontaneous basspart to date237 bacon and morgan described his bassline for the beatles song rain as an astonishing piece of playing  mccartney thinking in terms of both rhythm and lead bass  choosing the area of the neck  he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove238 macdonald considered the track the beatles best bside stating that its clangorously saturated texture resonates around mccartneys bassline which macdonald described as so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track macdonald also indicated the influence of indian classical music in exotic melismas in the bass part239 mccartney identified sgt peppers lonely hearts club band as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing particularly on lucy in the sky with diamonds240 acoustic guitar if i couldnt have any other instrument i would have to have an acoustic guitar241 —mccartney guitar player july 1990 mccartney primarily flatpicks while playing acoustic guitar though he also uses elements of fingerpicking241 examples of his acoustic guitar playing on beatles tracks include yesterday im looking through you michelle blackbird i will mother natures son and rocky raccoon242 mccartney singled out blackbird as a personal favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way i got my own little sort of cheating way of fingerpicking im actually sort of pulling two strings at a time  i was trying to emulate those folk players241 he employed a similar technique for jenny wren243 he played an epiphone texan on many of his acoustic recordings but also used a martin d28244 electric guitar linda was a big fan of my guitar playing whereas ive got my doubts i think there are proper guitar players and then there are guys like me who love playing it245 —mccartney guitar player july 1990 mccartney playing a gibson les paul in concert 2009 mccartney played lead guitar on several beatles recordings including what

called im down a rockandroll classic that illustrates mccartneys vocal and stylistic versatility258 macdonald described helter skelter as an early attempt at heavy metal and hey jude as a poprock hybrid pointing out mccartneys use of gospelstyle melismas in the song and his pseudosoul shrieking in the fadeout259 benitez identified hope of deliverance and put it there as examples of mccartneys folk music efforts while musicologist walter everett considered when im sixtyfour and honey pie attempts at vaudeville260 macdonald praised the swinging beat of the beatles twentyfour bar blues song shes a woman as the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date with mccartneys voice at the edge squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment261 macdonald described ive got a feeling as a raunchy midtempo rocker with a robust and soulful vocal performance and back in the ussr as the last of the beatles uptempo rockers mccartneys belting vocals among his best since drive my car recorded three years earlier262 mccartney also teasingly tried out classical singing namely singing various renditions of besame mucho with the rest of the beatles he

strawberry fields forever an integral feature of the songs character274 mccartney played a moog synthesizer on the beatles song maxwells silver hammer and the wings track loup 1st indian on the moon275 ingham described the wings songs with a little luck and london town as full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches276 drums mccartney played drums on the beatles songs back in the ussr

ourselves384 former wings guitarist mccullough said of collaborating with linda trying to get things together with a learner in the group didnt work as far as i was concerned385 they had four

the daily mail i got a counsellor because i knew that i would need some help he was great particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt about wishing id been perfect all the time  a real bugger but

all pizza and fairytales396 in an effort to avoid talking only about business they often spoke of cats babies or baking bread397 on 24 april 1976 mccartney and lennon were watching an episode of saturday night live together at lennons home in the dakota when lorne michaels made a 3000 cash offer for the beatles to reunite while they seriously considered going to the snl studio a few blocks away they decided it was too late this was their last time together398 vh1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film two of us399 mccartneys last telephone call to lennon days before lennon and ono released double fantasy was friendly he said this about the call it is a consoling factor for me because i do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out but fortunately for me the last phone conversation i ever had with him was really great and we didnt have any kind of blowup400 reaction to lennons murder main article death of john lennon john is kinda like a constant  always there in my being  in my soul so i always think of him401 —mccartney guitar world january 2000 on 9 december 1980 mccartney followed the news that lennon had been murdered the previous night lennons death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band402 mccartney was leaving an oxford street recording studio that evening when he was surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction he responded its a drag the press quickly criticised him for what appeared to be a superficial response403 he later explained when john was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said what do you think about it i said its a draaag and meant it with every inch of melancholy i could muster when you put that in print it says mccartney in london today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said its a drag it seemed a very flippant comment to make403 he described his first exchange with ono after the murder and his last conversation with lennon i talked to yoko the day after he was killed and the first thing she said was john was really fond of you the last telephone conversation i had with him we were still the best of mates he was always a very warm guy john his bluff was all on the surface he used to take his glasses down those granny glasses and say its only me they were like a wall you know a shield those are the moments i treasure403 in 1983 mccartney said i would not have been as typically human and standoffish as i was if i knew john was going to die i would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his mask and have a better relationship with him403 he said that he went home that night watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening in 1997 he said that lennons death made the remaining exbeatles nervous that they might also be murdered404 he told mojo magazine in 2002 that lennon was his greatest hero405 in 1981 mccartney sang backup on harrisons tribute to their

harrison discussing his relationship with mccartney harrison said paul would always help along when youd done his ten songs—then when he got round to doing one of my songs he would help it was silly it was very selfish actually  there were a lot of tracks though where i played bass  because what paul would do—if hed written a song hed learn all the parts for paul and then come in the studio and say sometimes he was very difficult do this hed never give you the opportunity to come out with something408 after harrisons death in november 2001 mccartney said he was a lovely guy and a very brave
