backgroundedit starting in the late 1980s jackson and the tabloid press had a difficult relationship in 1986 tabloids claimed that jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber and had offered to buy the bones of joseph merrick the elephant man both of which jackson denied67 these stories inspired the pejorative nickname wacko jacko which jackson despised he stopped leaking untruths to the pressclarification needed and the media began creating their own stories8 in 1989 jackson released leave me alone a song about the victimization he felt by press9 the songs music video shows jackson poking fun at the press and his situation10 in 1993 the relationship between jackson and the press crumbled entirely when he was accused of child sexual abuse although he was not charged jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place complaintswho about the coverage and media included misleading and sensational headlines11 paying for stories of jacksons alleged criminal activity12 and confidential material from the police investigation13 using unflattering pictures of jackson14 and using headlines that strongly implied jacksons guilt14 in 1994 jackson said of the media coverage i am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible terrible mass media at every opportunity the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions15 michael jackson jackson began taking painkillers valium xanax and ativan to deal with the stress of the allegations16 a few months after the allegations became news jackson stopped eating17 soon after jacksons health deteriorated to the extent that he cancelled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation1819 jackson booked the whole fourth floor of a clinic and was put on valium iv to wean him from painkillers1819 the media showed jackson little sympathy in 1993 the daily mirror held a spot the jacko contest offering readers a trip to disney world if they could correctly predict where jackson would appear next18 the same year a daily express headline read drug treatment star faces life on the run while a news of the world headline accused jackson of being a fugitive these tabloids also falsely alleged that jackson had travelled to europe to have cosmetic surgery that would make him unrecognisable on his return18 in early november 1993 talk show host geraldo rivera set up a mock trial with a jury of audience members though jackson had not been charged with a crime20 production and releaseedit history is a twodisc album

poor social life and a bad childhood upbringing the song has a distinctive rock edge tabloid junkie 1995 a sample of tabloid junkie the songs lyrics are about media biases and are aimed at listeners not to believe everything they read from the media and tabloids earth song unlike other songs lyrics on history the lyrics to earth song pertain to environmental concerns problems playing these files see media help similarly to jacksons previous studio albums thriller and bad history contains lyrics that deal with paranoia the majority of the new songs were written by jackson several of the albums 15 new songs pertain to the child sexual abuse allegations made against him in 199322 and jacksons perceived mistreatment by the media mainly the tabloids23 because of this the album has been described as being jacksons most personal24 two of the albums new tracks are covers22 the genres of the albums music span rb pop hard rock and ballads222425 the lyrics pertain to isolation greed environmental concerns injustice scream is a duet with jacksons younger sister janet contemporary critics noted that it was difficult to distinguish their voices apart22 it was noted that the refrain of the songs lyrics stop pressurin me is compelling and that jackson spits out the lyrics with drama and purpose22 the songs lyrics are about injustice24 the lyrics for the rb ballad you are not alone written by r kelly pertain to isolation24 two belgian songwriters brothers eddy and danny van passel claimed to have written the melody in 1993 in september 2007 a belgian judge ruled the song was plagiarized from the van passel brothers and it was subsequently banned from airwaves in belgium2627 ds is a hard rock song whose lyrics were interpreted by music critics as an attack on the district attorney of jacksons child sexual abuse case thomas sneddon2225 multiple critics reviewed the song in connection with sneddon fox news channel and cnn noting that the cold man in the lyrics is sneddon when the name dom s sheldon from the chorus is sung it resembles thomas sneddon2829 money was interpreted as being directed at evan chandler the father of the boy who accused jackson of child sexual abuse22 the lyrics of childhood pertain to jacksons own childhood30 similar to scream the lyrics to they dont care about us pertain to injustice as well as racism in this time around jackson asserts himself as having been falsely accused22 the song features the notorious big aka biggie smalls two years before his death in 1997 jackson worked with biggie again posthumously in 2001 on jacksons following album invincible on the song unbreakable this made him the only rapper to appear on multiple jackson lps31 earth song was described as a slow bluesoperatic24 and its lyrics pertain to environmental concerns on history jackson covered charlie chaplins smile and the beatles come together24 2 bad is a track heavily influenced by hiphop featuring a sample of run–dmcs king of rock and another guest rap verse by shaquille oneal the similarity in lyrics and name have led to some seeing it as a spiritual successor to jacksons 1987 track bad32 stranger in moscow is a pop ballad that is interspersed with sounds of rain22 in which jackson references a swift and sudden fall from grace24 tabloid junkie is a hard funk song33 with lyrics instructing listeners to not believe everything they read in the media and tabloids2425 the albums title track history contained multiple samples including martin luther king jrs i have a dream speech34 history was not released as a single from history but its remix was from blood on the dance floor history in the mix in 1997 as an introduction for little susie michael used his own variation of pie jesu from maurice duruflés requiem the inspiration behind the song more likely came from an artist called gottfried helnwein michael admired the artists work and he had purchased some of his paintings one of them beautiful victim inspired the song helnwein is considered quite provocative as he paints about the human condition depicting wounded children among others helnwein later painted a portrait of michael35 there appears to be a similarity between the beautiful victim painting and the artwork included for the song in history35 controversy and influenceedit dispute regarding lyrics of they dont care about usedit one of many identical statues based on diana walczaks original history statue pictured june 3 2005 in the netherlands that sony positioned throughout europe to promote history the possibility that the lyrics to they dont care about us contained antisemitism was first raised publicly by the new york times on june 15 1995 one day before the albums release the publication highlighted the lyrics jew me sue me everybody do me kick me kike me dont you black or white me and labeled them slurs36 jackson responded directly to the publication stating “ the idea that these lyrics could be deemed objectionable is extremely hurtful to me and misleading the song in fact is about the pain of prejudice and hate and is a way to draw attention to social and political problems i am the voice of the accused and the attacked i am the voice of everyone i am the skinhead i am the jew i am the black man i am the white man i am not the one who was attacking it is about the injustices to young people and how the system can wrongfully accuse them i am angry and outraged that i could be so misinterpreted36 ” when questioned further about the lyrics jackson denied that they dont care about us was antisemitic commenting its not antisemitic because im not a racist person  i could never be a racist i love all races36 that same day jackson received support from his manager and record label who described the lyrics as brilliant that they were about opposition to prejudice and taken out of context36 the following day david a lehrer and rabbi marvin hier leaders of two jewish organizations stated that jacksons attempt to make a song critical of discrimination had backfired they expressed the opinion that the lyrics used were unsuitable for young audiences because they might not understand the songs context and that the song was ambiguous for some of the listeners they acknowledged that jackson meant well and suggested that he write an explanation in the album booklet37 on june 17 jackson issued another public apology to anyone offended by his choice of words and promised that future copies of the album would include an apology jackson concluded i just want you all to know how strongly i am committed to tolerance peace and love and i apologize to anyone who might have been hurt38 the next day in his review of history jon pareles of the new york times alleged in  they dont care about us he gives the lie to his entire catalogue of brotherhood anthems with a burst of antisemitism jew me sue me everybody do me kick me kike me dont you black or white me39 on june 23 jackson decided despite the cost incurred he would return to the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album jew me and kike me would be substituted with do me and strike me40 he reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some4041 spike lee who would direct the music videos for they dont care about us stated that he felt there was a double standard in the music industry commenting that the use of the word nigger in music does not cause controversy42 additionally rapper notorious big used the word nigga on another song on the history album this time around but it did not attract media attention42 music videosedit see also video greatest hits – history and history on film volume ii historys music videos displayed different themes and elements while some of them encouraged awareness of poverty and had a positive effect on their shooting locations the promo for they dont care about us was directed by spike lee jackson said that lee chose to direct the video because the song has an edge and spike lee had approached me its a public awareness song and thats what he is all about its a protest kind of song and i think he was perfect for it43 jackson also collaborated with 200 members of the cultural group olodum who played music in the video44 the resulting media interest exposed olodum to 140 countries bringing them worldwide fame and increasing their status in brazil45 lúcia nagib of the new brazilian cinema said of the music video “ when michael jackson decided to shoot his new music video in a favela of rio de janeiro he used the favela people as extras in a visual superspectacle all the while there is a vaguely political appeal in there the interesting aspect of michael jacksons strategy is the efficiency with which it gives visibility to poverty and social problems in countries like brazil without resorting to traditional political discourse the problematic aspect is that it does not entail a real intervention in that poverty46 ” in 2009 billboard described the area as now a model for social development and stated that jacksons influence was partially responsible for this improvement47 for the first time in jacksons career he made a second music video for a single48 this second version was filmed in a prison with cell mates the video shows jackson handcuffed and contains real footage of police attacking african americans the ku klux klan genocide execution and other human rights abuses48 jacksons music video for earth song received praise for its environmental recognition in 1995 the video received a genesis award for doris day music award given each year for animal sensitivity49 in 2008 a writer for the nigeria exchange noted earth song drew the worlds attention to the degradation and bastardization of the earth as a fall out of various human activities50 two other music videos from history have been influential jacksons stranger in moscow music video influenced the advertising campaign for international cricket council champions trophy 2004 which featured a series of smart outdoor ads and a classy tv spot51 the television commercial was inspired by stranger in moscows video where the maiden in black splash about in the rain with kids playing cricket for company51 scream was a creative influence on other music videos such as the 1999 release of the awardwinning no scrubs by tlc52 this influence was also present on the 2008 release of shawty get loose by lil mama and chris brown53 reacting to the comparisons made between the videos mama explained i feel honored because that was one of the initial goals and i feel that it was executed well she added that the emulation was intentional and that brown was the only logical choice to step into michael jacksons role53

rolling stone album guide 73 rolling stone 24 history received generally positive reviews arguablyvague jacksons most angry raw emotional album the new tracks on history revealed a musician worn and torn by years of superstardom now reportedly reacting against people who tried to bring him down this reaction is what some people say ultimately stunted his previous skill at creating cutting edge musical trends74 with jon pareles of the new york times writing that it has been a long time since michael jackson was simply a performer hes the main asset of his own corporation which is a profitable subsidiary of sony74 some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a greatest hits collection with q magazine saying from the new songs point of view its like taking your dad with you into a fight72 fred shuster of the daily news of los angeles described this time around money and ds as superb slices of organic funk that will fuel many of the summers busiest dance floors75 james hunter of rolling stone gave history fouroutoffive stars and noted that it unfolds in jacksons outraged response to everything he has encountered in the last year or so it makes for an odd charmless second chapter to a first that includes miraculous recordings like billie jean the way you make me feel black or white and beat it24 in relation to this time around hunter described it as a dynamite jam thats ripe for remixes and described scream and tabloid junkie as being adventurous while noting that earth song as a noble sentiments that sounds primarily like a showpiece24 jim farber of the new york daily news gave the album a generally mixed review and commented that he would give the albums first disc three stars if it was released on its own23 jon pareles of the new york times believed that jackson muttered lyrics such as they thought they really had control of me74 chris willman of the los angeles times said of this time around a tough rhythmguitardriven track cowritten and coproduced by hitmaker dallas austin that sports one of the albums better grooves76 stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic gave history threeoutoffive stars but commented that it was a monumental achievement of jacksons ego1 erlewine remarked that on the history begins cd it contains some of the greatest music in pop history but that it leaves some hits out citing say say say and dirty diana — commenting that yet its filled with enough prime material to be thoroughly intoxicating1 erlewine noted that history continues is easily the most personal album jackson has recorded and that its songs lyrics referencing the molestation accusations create a thick atmosphere of paranoia1 he cited you are not alone and scream as being wellcrafted pop that ranks with his best material but concludes that nevertheless history continues stands as his weakest album since the mid70s1 david browne of entertainment weekly gave history begins an a grade but the albums new material a c which winds up a b for the entire album25 browne commented that the music rarely seems to transport him and thereby us to a higher plane25 the album was nominated for five grammy awards at the 1996 and 1997 ceremonies respectively winning one award you are not alone was nominated for best pop vocal performance – male scream was nominated for best pop collaboration with vocals and scream won best music video short form and earth song was nominated for the same award the following year the album itself was nominated for album of the year at the 1995 mtv video music
