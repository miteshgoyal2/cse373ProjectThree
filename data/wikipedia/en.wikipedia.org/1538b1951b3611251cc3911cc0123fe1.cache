within the united states is almost as old as radio broadcasting itself simply defined as a radio station with its studios located at a high school and usually operated by its students with faculty supervision stations fitting this description existed in the mid1920scitation needed little is recorded about these stations but like other lowpowered stations of the era their programming would tend to be sporadic with music and readings performed live by the stations performers – the era of playing records would not be established until the 1950scitation needed the combination of the great depression of the early 1930s and new restrictions enacted by the federal communications commission forced all of the high school stations off the air by 1934citation needed it would not be until the late 1940s with the advent of the 88–108 mhz fm radio band that renewed interest was shown in hs radio because the 8892 mhz region was dedicated to noncommercial broadcasting this allowed for schools to fairly easily obtain licenses from the fcc the oldest hs station on fm is wnas in new albany indiana which started broadcasting in may 19491 the station is still broadcasting today whhs haverford senior high schools radio station also started in 1949 located in havertown pennsylvania2 as the fm band increased in listenership in the next few decades the number of hs stations increased with it by the 1970s there were over 150 hs stations across the countrycitation needed in addition to this number there have always been untold numbers of unlicensed stations using carrier current popular through the 1970s extremely low power or part 15 stations and closed circuit broadcasting many of the licensed stations are assigned to suburban school districts in a few large metro areas chicago indianapolis detroit boston philadelphia seattle and to a lesser extent san francisco and cleveland there have historically been very few hs stations in the southeastcitation needed while some hs stations became important training grounds for students who would go on to careers in broadcastingcitation needed the perception of hs stations as poorly programmed and supervised helped contribute to the downfall of many stations after a steady decline in their numbers in the 1980s and 90s the availability of lpfm licenses has renewed interest in hs radio at least in rural areas where the lpfm license is most readily availablecitation needed todays hs stations particularly in rural areas serve as de facto community radio stations when classes are not in sessioncitation needed contents 1 difficulties of high school broadcasting 2 john drury high school radio awards 3 list of radio stations in the united states 4 list of radio stations in the united kingdom 41 uk radio equipment suppliers 5 see also 6 references 7 external links difficulties of high school broadcastingedit many hs stations were first licensed in the 1970s on the fm band just as the band was beginning to fill up and become crowded in many cities as a result hs stations tended to be lowpowered under one kilowatt in most instancescitation needed the expense involved with maintaining broadcasting equipment among more powerful hs stations especially in urban markets the stations license could become very valuable this would tend to tempt school administrators to sell the license usually to a local college public or christian radio broadcaster several hs stations have met this fate kcdc near denver operated sporadically for years before being sold to a public broadcaster wycsfm near hampton roads virginia is now a christian radio station several smaller stations have been transferred to collegescitation needed many of the lowestpowered stations that held class d licenses had no legal protection against higher powered stations applying for their frequency and thus many were simply forced off the air instructors or faculty involved with initially establishing the radio station leave or retire and the school is unable to find replacements a lack of interest then begins to build amongst the studentscitation needed hs stations must air at least 12 hours daily or they are left open for a third party to apply for a timeshare on the frequency as in the case of 2004 when hoosier public radio corp of greenfield indiana applied for such against seven hs and college radio stations in indiana and kentucky in march 2005 the fcc ruled against hpr in the case of four of the affected stations granting the affected stations renewed licenses the cases in the other three stations are still pendingcitation needed a general perception that radio technology is no longer as exciting to high school students as newer technologies such as the internet many hs stations are now spending more time relaying public radio outlets than producing their own programming john drury high school radio awardsedit the john drury awards are a national competition for high school radio students3 the drury categories include best newscast best promotional announcement best sports playbyplay and best public service announcement4 the awards were formerly held each may annually but are now presented every november the awards luncheon and ceremony is hosted by north central college in naperville illinois just outside chicago5 the awards began as a small enterprise but have grown each year with entries from stations in michigan connecticut illinois tennessee iowa and more4 they are named in memory of john drury a television news anchorman from chicago il the individual record for most awards won was set in 2007 by wade fink fink won seven awards and had more points individually than any other station had total6 points are awarded for each win in one of the ten categories the
