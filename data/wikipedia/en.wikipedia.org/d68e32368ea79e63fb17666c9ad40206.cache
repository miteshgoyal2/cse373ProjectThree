market share from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search not to be confused with usage share disambiguation market share is the percentage of a market defined in terms of either units or revenue accounted for by a specific entity in a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers 67 responded that they found the revenue dollar market share metric very useful while 61 found unit market share very useful1 marketers need to be able to translate and incorporate sales targets into market share because this will demonstrate whether forecasts are to be attained by growing with the market or by capturing share from competitors the latter will almost always be more difficult to achieve market share is closely monitored for signs of change in the competitive landscape and it frequently drives strategic or tactical action2 increasing market share is one of the most important objectives of business the main advantage of using market share as a measure of business performance is that it is less dependent upon macro environmental variables such as the state of the economy or changes in tax policy however increasing market share may be dangerous for makers of fungible hazardous products particularly products sold into the united states market where they may be subject to market share liability contents 1 purpose 2 construction 3 methodologies 4 see also 5 references purposeedit market share is said to be a key indicator of market competitiveness—that is how well a firm is doing against its competitors this metric supplemented by changes in sales revenue helps managers evaluate both primary and selective demand in their market that is it enables them to judge not only total market growth or decline but also trends in customers’ selections among competitors generally sales growth resulting from primary demand total market growth is less costly and more profitable than that achieved by capturing share from competitors conversely losses in market share can signal serious longterm problems that require strategic adjustments firms with market shares below a certain level may not be viable similarly within a firm’s product line market share trends for individual products are considered early indicators of future opportunities or problems1 research has also shown that market share is a desired asset among competing firms3 experts however discourage making market share an objective and criterion upon which to base economic policies4 the aforementioned usage of market share as a basis for gauging the performance of competing firms has fostered a system in which firms make decisions with regard to their operation with careful consideration of the impact of each decision on the market share of their competitors it is generally necessary to commission market research generally desksecondary research to determine sometimes though one can use primary research to estimate the total market size and a companys market share constructionedit market share the percentage of a market accounted for by a specific entity1 unit market share the units sold by a particular company as a percentage of total market sales measured in the same units1 unit market share 100 unit sales total market unit sales this formula of course can be rearranged to derive either unit sales or total market unit sales from the other two variables as illustrated in the following1 unit sales unit market share total market unit sales 100 total market unit sales 100 unit sales unit market share revenue market share revenue market share differs from unit market share in that it reflects the prices at which goods are sold in fact a relatively simple way to calculate relative price is to divide revenue market share by unit market share1 revenue market share 100 sales revenue total market sales revenue as with the unit market share this equation for revenue market share can be rearranged to calculate either sales revenue or total market sales revenue from the other two variables1 market share can be decomposed into three components namely penetration share share of customer and usage index these three underlying metrics can then be used to help the brand identify market share growth opportunities5 methodologiesedit although market share is likely the single most important marketing metric there is no generally acknowledged best method for calculating it this is unfortunate as different methods may yield not only different computations of market share at a given moment but also widely divergent trends over time the reasons for these disparities include variations in the lenses through which share is viewed units versus dollars where in the channel the measurements are taken shipments from manufacturers versus consumer purchases market definition scope of the competitive universe and measurement error1 see alsoedit usage share disambiguation market value market power market share analysis
