17 some authors have attributed the name solely to dylans hit single at ralph gleasons suggestion wenner named his magazine after a bob dylan song8 rolling stone initially identified with and reported the hippie counterculture of the era however it distanced itself from the underground newspapers of the time such as berkeley barb embracing more traditional journalistic standards and avoiding the radical politics of the underground press in the very first edition wenner wrote that rolling stone is not just about the music but about the things and attitudes that music embraces in the 1970s rolling stone began to make a mark with its political coverage with the likes of gonzo journalist hunter s thompson writing for the magazines political section thompson first published his most famous work fear and loathing in las vegas within the pages of rolling stone where he remained a contributing editor until his death in 20059 in the 1970s the magazine also helped launch the careers of many

with a large number of regular members and contributors worldwide however the site was also plagued with numerous internet trolls and malicious codehackers who vandalized the forum substantially30 the magazine abruptly deleted the forum in may 2004 then began a new much more limited message board community on their site in late 2005 only to remove it again in 2006 in march 2008 the website started

remote site from their main new york office content will still be developed for the site but from the main new york office39 restaurantedit in december 2009 the los angeles times reported that the owners of rolling stone magazine planned to open a rolling stone restaurant in the hollywood highland center in hollywood in the spring of 201040 the expectation was that the restaurant could become the first of a national chain if it was successful41 as of november 2010 the soft opening of the restaurant was planned for december 201042 in 2011 the restaurant was open for lunch and dinner as well as a full night club downstairs on the weekends43 the restaurant closed in february 201344 criticismedit one major criticism of rolling stone involves its generational bias toward the 1960s and 1970s one critic referred to the rolling stone list of the 99 greatest songs as an example of unrepentant rockist fogeyism45 in further response to this issue rock critic jim derogatis a former rolling stone editor published a thorough critique of the magazines lists in a book called kill your idols a new generation of rock writers reconsiders the classics which featured differing opinions from many younger critics46 rolling stone magazine has been criticized for reconsidering many classic albums that it had previously dismissed and for frequent use of the 35star rating for example led zeppelin was largely written off by rolling stone magazine critics during the bands most active years in the 1970s but by 2006 a cover story on the band honored them as the heaviest band of all time47 a critic for slate magazine described a conference at which 1984s the rolling stone record guide was scrutinized as he described it the guide virtually ignored hiphop and ruthlessly panned heavy metal the two genres that within a few years would dominate the pop charts in an auditorium packed with music journalists you could detect more than a few anxious titters how many of us will want our record reviews read back to us 20 years hence45 the hiring of former fhm editor ed needham further enraged critics who alleged that rolling stone had lost its credibility48 the 2003 rolling stones 100 greatest guitarists of all time article which named only two female musicians resulted in venus zine answering with their own list entitled the greatest female guitarists of all time49 conservative columnist jonah goldberg stated that rolling stone had essentially become the house organ of the democratic national committee50 rolling stone editor jann wenner has made all of his political donations to democrats51 rolling stones film critic peter travers has been criticized for his high number of repetitively used blurbs5253 tsarnaev coveredit the august 2013 rolling stone cover featuring thenaccused later convicted boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev drew widespread criticism that the magazine was glamorizing terrorism and that the cover was a slap in the face to the great city of boston54 the online edition of the article was accompanied by a short editorial stating that the story falls within the traditions of journalism and rolling stones longstanding commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day55 the controversial cover photograph that was used by rolling stone had previously featured on the front page of the new york times on may 5 201356 in response to the outcry new englandbased cvs pharmacy and tedeschi food shops banned their stores from carrying the issue57 also refusing to sell the issue were walgreens58 riteaid59 roche bros60 kmart59 heb61 walmart61 7eleven62 hyvee63 rutters farm63 united supermarkets63 cumberland farms64 market basket64 shaws65 and stop shop60 boston mayor thomas menino sent a letter to rolling stone publisher jann wenner calling the cover ill conceived at best it reaffirms a message that destruction gains fame for killers and their causes menino also wrote to respond to you in anger is to feed into your obvious market strategy and that wenner could have written about the survivors or the people who came to help after the bombings instead in conclusion he wrote the survivors of the boston marathon deserve rolling stone cover stories though i no longer feel that rolling stone deserves them66 uva false rape storyedit main article a rape on campus in the november 19 2014 issue the story a rape on campus was run about an alleged gang rape on the campus of the university of virginia67 separate inquiries by phi kappa psi the fraternity accused by rolling stone of facilitating the alleged rape and the washington post revealed major errors omissions and discrepancies in the story6869 reporter sabrina erdelys story was subject to intense media criticism6870 the washington post and boston herald issued calls for magazine staff involved in the report to be fired71 rolling stone subsequently issued three apologies for the story some suggested that legal action against the magazine by persons accused of the rape might result72 on december 5 2014 rolling stones managing editor will dana apologized for not factchecking the story73 rolling stone commissioned an outside investigation of the story and its problems by the dean of the columbia school of journalism the report uncovered journalistic failure in the uva story and institutional problems with reporting at rolling stone74 rolling stone retracted the story on april 5 201575 on april 6 2015 following the investigation and retraction of the story phi kappa psi announced plans to pursue all available legal action against rolling stone including claims of defamation76 on may 12 2015 uva associate dean nicole eramo chief administrator for handling sexual assault issues at the school filed a 75 million defamation lawsuit in charlottesville circuit court against rolling stone and erdely claiming damage to her reputation and emotional distress said the filing rolling stone and erdelys highly defamatory and false statements about dean eramo were not the result of an innocent mistake they were the result of a wanton journalist who was more concerned with writing an article that fulfilled her preconceived narrative about the victimization of women on american college campuses and a malicious publisher who was more concerned about selling magazines to boost the economic bottom line for its faltering magazine than they were about discovering the truth or actual facts77 on november 4 2016 after 20 hours of deliberation78 a jury consisting of eight women and two men found rolling stone the magazines publisher and erdely liable for defaming eramo79 on july 29 2015 three graduates of the fraternity phi kappa psi filed a lawsuit against rolling stone its publisher wenner media and a journalist for defamation and infliction of emotional distress80 the same day and just months after the controversy began the new york times reported that managing editor will dana was departing the magazine with his last date recorded as august 7 201581 on november 9 2015 the phi kappa psi fraternity filed suit for 25 million for damages to its reputation caused by
