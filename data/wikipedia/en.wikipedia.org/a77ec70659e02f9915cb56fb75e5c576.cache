makeshift communicator used by et to phone home among its parts is a speak spell an umbrella lined with tinfoil and a coffee can filled with other electronics at school the next day elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien including exhibiting signs of intoxication because it is at his home drinking beer and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class as the alien

the girl elliott kisses pat welsh as the voice of et productionedit developmentedit after his parents divorce in 1960 spielberg filled the void with an imaginary alien companion he said that the imaginary alien was a friend who could be the brother i never had and a father that i didnt feel i had anymore5 during 1978 he announced he would shoot a film entitled growing up which he would film in 28 days the project was set aside because of delays on 1941 but the concept of making a small autobiographical film about childhood would stay with him6 he also thought about a followup to close encounters of the third kind and began to develop a darker project he had planned with john sayles called night skies in which malevolent aliens terrorize a family6 filming raiders of the lost ark in tunisia left spielberg bored and memories of his childhood creation resurfaced7 he told screenwriter melissa mathison about night skies and developed a subplot from the failed project in which buddy the only friendly alien befriends an autistic child his abandonment on earth in the scripts final scene inspired the et concept7 she wrote a first draft titled et and me in eight weeks7 which he considered perfect8 the script went through two more drafts which deleted an eddie haskell–esque friend of elliott the chase sequence was also created and he also suggested having the scene where et got drunk6 columbia pictures which had been producing night skies met him to discuss the script the studio passed on it calling it a wimpy walt disney movie so he approached the more receptive sid sheinberg president of mca9 preproductionedit italian special effects artist carlo rambaldi created ets design carlo rambaldi who designed the aliens for close encounters of the third kind was hired to design the animatronics of et rambaldis own painting women of delta led him to give the creature a unique extendable neck8 its face was inspired by those of carl sandburg albert einstein and ernest hemingway10 producer kathleen kennedy visited the jules stein eye institute to study real and glass eyes she hired institute staffers to create ets eyes which she felt were particularly important in engaging the audience11 four heads were created for filming one as the main animatronic and the others for facial expressions as well as a costume10 two dwarfs tamara de treaux and pat bilon6 as well as 12yearold matthew demeritt who was born without legs12 took turns wearing the costume depending on what scene was being filmed demeritt actually walked on his hands and played all scenes where he walked awkwardly or fell over the head was placed above that of the actors and the actors could see through slits in its chest8 caprice roth a professional mime filled prosthetics to play ets hands11 the puppet was created in three months at the cost of 15 million13 spielberg declared it was something that only a mother could love8 mars incorporated refused to allow mms to be used in the film believing et would frighten children after mars said no the hershey company was asked if reeses pieces could be used and it agreed this product placement resulted in a large increase in reeses pieces sales14 science and technology educator henry feinberg created ets communicator device1516 castingedit having worked with cary guffey on close encounters of the third kind spielberg felt confident in working with a cast composed mostly of child actors11 for the role of elliott he auditioned hundreds of boys17 before jack fisk suggested henry thomas for the role because henry had played the part of harry in the movie raggedy man which jack fisk had directed18 thomas who auditioned in an indiana jones costume did not perform well in the formal testing but got the filmmakers attention in an improvised scene11 thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears19 robert macnaughton auditioned eight times to play michael sometimes with boys auditioning for elliott spielberg felt drew barrymore had the right imagination for mischievous gertie after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band8 he enjoyed working with the children and he later said that the experience made him feel ready to be a father20 the major voice work of et for the film was performed by pat welsh she smoked two packs of cigarettes a day which gave her voice a quality that sound effects creator ben burtt liked she spent nineandahalf hours recording her part and was paid 380 by burtt for her services6 he also recorded 16 other people and various animals to create ets voice these included spielberg debra winger his sleeping wife who had a cold a burp from his usc film professor raccoons otters and horses2122 doctors working at the usc medical center were recruited to play the ones who try to save et after government agents take over elliotts house spielberg felt that actors in the roles performing lines of technical medical dialogue would come across as unnatural20 during postproduction he decided to cut a scene featuring harrison ford as the principal at elliotts school it featured his character reprimanding elliott for his behavior in biology class and warning of the dangers of underage drinking he is then taken aback as elliotts chair rises from the floor while et is levitating his phone equipment up the stairs with gertie8 filmingedit the film began shooting in september 198123 the project was filmed under the cover name a boys life as spielberg did not want anyone to discover and plagiarize the plot the actors had to read the script behind closed doors and everyone on set had to wear an id card11 the shoot began with two days at a high school in culver city and the crew spent the next 11 days moving between locations at northridge and tujunga6 the next 42 days were spent at culver citys laird international studios for the interiors of elliotts home the crew shot at a redwood forest near crescent city for the productions last six days67 the exterior halloween scene and the flying bicycle chase scenes were filmed in porter ranch24 spielberg shot the film in roughly chronological order to achieve convincingly emotional performances from his cast in the scene in which michael first encounters et his appearance caused macnaughton to jump back and knock down the shelves behind him the chronological shoot gave the young actors an emotional experience as they bonded with et making the quarantine sequences more moving20 spielberg ensured the puppeteers were kept away from the set to maintain the illusion of a real alien for the first time in his career he did not storyboard most of the film in order to facilitate spontaneity in the performances23 the film was shot so adults except for dee wallace are never seen from the waist up in its first half as a tribute to tex averys cartoons8 the shoot was completed in 61 days four days ahead of schedule7 according to spielberg the memorable scene where et disguises himself as a stuffed toy in elliotts closet was suggested by colleague robert zemeckis after he read a draft of the screenplay that spielberg had sent him25 musicedit main article et the extraterrestrial soundtrack longtime spielberg collaborator john williams who composed the films musical score described the challenge of creating one that would generate sympathy for such an oddlooking creature as with their previous collaborations spielberg liked every theme williams composed and had it included spielberg loved the music for the final chase so much that he edited the sequence to suit it26 williams took a modernist approach especially with his use of polytonality which refers to the sound of two different keys played simultaneously the lydian mode can also be used in a polytonal way williams combined polytonality and the lydian mode to express a mystic dreamlike and heroic quality his theme—emphasizing coloristic instruments such as the harp piano celesta and other keyboards as well as percussion—suggests ets childlike nature and his machine27 allegations of plagiarismedit there were allegations that the film was plagiarized from a 1967 script the alien by indian bengali director satyajit ray he stated et would not have been possible without my script of the alien being available throughout the united states in mimeographed copies spielberg denied this claim stating i was a kid in high school when his script was circulating in hollywood28 star weekend magazine disputes spielbergs claim pointing out that he had graduated from high school in 1965 and began his career as a director in hollywood in 196929 director and spielberg’s friend martin scorsese has also alleged the film was influenced by rays script30 when ray attempted to sue spielberg in 1983 spielberg was quoted as saying its the people youve never heard of who crawl out of the woodwork like cockroaches to sue you31 themesedit spielberg admitted this scene triggered speculation as to whether the film was a spiritual parable32 spielberg drew the story of the film from his parents divorce33 gary arnold of the washington post called it essentially a spiritual autobiography a portrait of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent mystical imagination34 references to his childhood occur throughout elliott fakes illness by holding a thermometer to the bulb in his lamp while covering his face with a heating pad a trick frequently employed by the young spielberg35 michael picking on elliott echoes spielbergs teasing of his younger sisters8 and michaels evolution from tormentor to protector reflects how spielberg had to take care of his sisters after their father left20 critics have focused on the parallels between ets life and elliott who is alienated by the loss of his father3637 ao scott of the new york times wrote that while et is the more obvious and desperate foundling elliott suffers in his own way from the want of a home38 et is the first and last letter of elliotts name39 at the films heart is the theme of growing up critic henry sheehan described the film as a retelling of peter pan from the perspective of a lost boy elliott et cannot survive physically on earth as pan could not survive emotionally in neverland government scientists take the place of neverlands pirates40 vincent canby of the new york times similarly observed that the film freely recycles elements from peter pan and the wizard of oz41 some critics have suggested that spielbergs portrayal of suburbia is very dark contrary to popular belief according to ao scott the suburban milieu with its unsupervised children and unhappy parents its broken toys and brandname junk food could have come out of a raymond carver story38 charles taylor of saloncom wrote spielbergs movies despite the way theyre often characterized are not hollywood idealizations of families and the suburbs the homes here bear what the cultural critic karal ann marling called the marks of hard use33 other critics found religious parallels between et and jesus4243 andrew nigels described ets story as crucifixion by military science and resurrection by love and faith44 according to spielberg biographer joseph mcbride universal pictures appealed directly to the christian market with a poster reminiscent of michelangelos the creation of adam and a logo reading peace7 spielberg answered that he did not intend the film to be a religious parable joking if i ever went to my mother and said mom ive made this movie thats a christian parable what do you think shed say she has a kosher restaurant on pico and doheny in los angeles32 as a substantial body of film criticism has built up around the film numerous writers have analyzed it in other ways as well it has been interpreted as a modern fairy tale45 and in psychoanalytic terms3745 producer kathleen kennedy noted that an important theme of et is tolerance which would be central to future spielberg films such as schindlers list8 having been a loner as a teenager spielberg described it as a minority story46 spielbergs characteristic theme of communication is partnered with the ideal of mutual understanding he has suggested that the storys central alienhuman friendship is an analogy for how realworld adversaries can learn to overcome their differences47 receptionedit release and salesedit the film was previewed in houston texas where it received high marks from viewers7 it premiered at the 1982 cannes film festivals closing gala4849 and was released in the united states on

combat piracy the tapeguards and tape hubs on the videocassettes were colored green the tape itself was affixed with a small holographic sticker of the 1963 universal logo much like the holograms on a

version of the same documentary from the laserdisc63 critical responseedit empire called elliott and ets flight to the forest the most magical moment in cinema history64 the image of them encircled by the moon is now the symbol for spielbergs company amblin entertainment this scene is a tribute to miracle in milan one of spielbergs favorite films65 the film received universal acclaim roger ebert gave the film four stars and wrote this is not simply a good movie it is one of those movies that brush away our cautions and win our hearts48 he later added it to his great movies list structuring the essay as a letter to his grandchildren about the first time they watched it66 michael sragow of rolling stone called spielberg a space age jean renoir for the first time he has put his breathtaking technical skills at the service of his deepest feelings67 derek malcolm of the guardian wrote that et is a superlative piece of popular cinema a dream of childhood brilliantly orchestrated to involve not only children but anyone able to remember being one68 leonard maltin would include it in his list of 100 mustsee films of the 20th century as one of only two movies from the 1980s69 george will was one of the few to pan the film feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science70 the film holds a 98 rating on rotten tomatoes based on 114 reviews with an

magic ilm was used to modify several shots including ones of et running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield the spaceships design was also altered to include more lights scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced these included et taking a bath and gertie telling mary that elliott went to the forest on halloween spielberg did not add the scene featuring harrison ford feeling that would reshape the film too drastically he became more sensitive about the scene where gunwielding federal agents confront elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkietalkies8 at the premiere john williams conducted a live performance of the score94 the new release grossed 68 million in total with 35 million coming from canada and the united states58 the changes to it particularly the escape scene were criticized as political correctness peter travers of rolling stone wondered remember those guns the feds carried thanks to the
