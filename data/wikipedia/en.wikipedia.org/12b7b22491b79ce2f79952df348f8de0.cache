the need to feed hungry children he said that he had seen no authoritative evidence that children in america were going hungry and that some of the allegations are purely political when asked about soup kitchens he said that some people are going to soup kitchens voluntarily i know weve had considerable information that people go to soup kitchens because the food is free and that thats easier than paying for it democratic leaders and social welfare activists called his comments disgraceful an outrage unkind meanspirited and absolutely ridiculous tip oneill the speaker of the house of

from a bad press202122 attorney generaledit reagan nominated meese to be william french smiths successor as attorney general on january 23 198423 for more than a year democrats repeatedly charged

meese shimon peres bruce rappaport robert c mcfarlane and others the report of special prosecutor james c mckay cleared meese of criminal wrongdoing but criticized him for ethical lapses especially regarding bribes to israel not to attack an iraqi oil pipeline that benefited associates of the attorney general27 wedtech scandaledit in february of 1987 james c mckay was named independent counsel in the wedtech case the investigation centered on actions meese took that benefited him and his longtime friend and former lawyer e robert wallach mckay looked into meeses involvement while attorney general in negotiations involving the company wedtech e robert wallach worked as a lobbyist for the company and sought help from meese on wedtech contract matters 28 mckay never prosecuted or sought indictment of meese but in his official report which is still confidential he was highly critical of meeses ethics and urged further investigation of meeses role in that scandal and others such as meeses efforts to help bechtel corporation meese described it as a full vindication while meese was never convicted of any wrongdoing he resigned in 1988 when the independent counsel delivered the report on wedtech29 prior to his departure several top justice department officials resigned in protest of what they and others viewed as improper acts by the attorney general30 reagan publicly voiced

as expensive autos yachts businesses and homes to make this technique even more effective we shared the proceeds with cooperating local law enforcement agencies to enhance their drugfighting activities33 supreme court viewsedit in 1985 meese delivered a speech calling for a jurisprudence of original intent and criticizing the supreme court for straying from the original intention of the

known for his opposition to the miranda warning ruling by the supreme court requiring a suspects rights to be read to him before he is questioned by authorities34 us news world report you criticize the miranda ruling which gives suspects the right to have a lawyer present before police questioning shouldnt people who may be innocent have such protection meese suspects who are innocent of a crime
