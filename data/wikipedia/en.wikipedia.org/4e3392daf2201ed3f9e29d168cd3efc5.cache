aircraft often referred to by its original nickname jumbo jet its distinctive hump upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft makes it among the worlds most recognizable aircraft5 and it was the first widebody produced manufactured by boeings commercial airplane unit in the united states the original version of the 747 was envisioned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the boeing 7076 one of the common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s first flown commercially in 1970 the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years7 the fourengine 747 uses a doubledeck configuration for part of its length it is available in passenger freighter and other versions boeing designed the 747s humplike upper deck to serve as a first class lounge or extra seating and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door boeing did so because the company expected supersonic airliners development of which was announced in the early 1960s to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would be robust well into the future8 the 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold9 but it exceeded critics expectations with production passing the 1000 mark in 199310 by september 2017 1536 aircraft had been built with 17 of the 7478 variants remaining on order4 as of january 2017update the 747 has been involved in 60 hull losses resulting in 3722 fatalities11 the 747400 the most common passenger version in service has a highsubsonic cruise speed of mach 085–0855 up to 570 mph or 920 kmh with an intercontinental range of 7260 nautical miles 8350 statute miles or 13450 km12 the 747400 passenger version can accommodate 416 passengers in a typical threeclass layout 524 passengers in a typical twoclass layout or 660 passengers in a high density oneclass configuration13 the newest version of the aircraft the 7478 is in

projects on a very large strategic transport aircraft although the c141 starlifter was being introduced they believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed especially the capability to carry outsized cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft these studies led to initial requirements for the cxheavy logistics system cxhls in march 1964 for an aircraft with a load capacity of 180000 pounds 81600 kg and a speed of mach 075 500 mph or 800 kmh and an unrefueled range of 5000 nautical miles 9300 km with a payload of 115000 pounds 52200 kg the payload bay had to be 17 feet 518 m wide by 135 feet 411 m high and 100 feet 30 m long with access through doors at the front and rear14 featuring only four engines the design also required new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy in may 1964 airframe proposals arrived from boeing douglas general dynamics lockheed and martin marietta engine proposals were submitted by general electric curtisswright and pratt whitney after a downselect boeing douglas and lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe along with general electric and pratt whitney for the engines14 all three of the airframe proposals shared a number of features as the cxhls needed to be able to be loaded from the front a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was all of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area douglas had a small pod just forward and above the wing lockheed used a long spine running the length of the aircraft with the wing spar passing through it while boeing blended the two with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing1516 in 1965 lockheeds aircraft design and general electrics engine design were selected for the new c5 galaxy transport which was the largest military aircraft in the world at the time14 the nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 74717 airliner proposal the 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s18 the era of commercial jet transportation led by the enormous popularity of the boeing 707 and douglas dc8 had revolutionized longdistance travel1819 even before it lost the cxhls contract boeing was asked by juan trippe president of pan american world airways pan am one of their most important airline customers to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 707 during this time airport congestion worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft became a problem that trippe thought could be addressed by a larger new aircraft20 in 1965 joe sutter was transferred from boeings 737 development team to manage the design studies for the new airliner already assigned the model number 74721 sutter initiated a design study with pan am and other airlines to better understand their requirements at the time it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by supersonic transport aircraft22 boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined in the freighter role the clear need was to support the containerized shipping methodologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time standard containers are 8 ft 24 m square at the front slightly higher due to attachment points and available in 20 and 40 ft 61 and 12 m lengths this meant that it would be possible to support a 2wide 2high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier cxhls project an iran air 747200 showing the earlyproduction 747 cockpit located on the upper deck in april 1966 pan am ordered 25 747100 aircraft for us525 million during the ceremonial 747 contractsigning banquet in seattle on boeings 50th anniversary juan trippe predicted that the 747 would be a great weapon for peace competing with intercontinental missiles for mankinds destiny23 as launch customer124 and because of its early involvement before placing a formal order pan am was able to influence the design and development of the 747 to an extent unmatched by a single airline before or since25 design effort ultimately the highwinged cxhls boeing design was not used for the 747 although technologies developed for their bid had an influence26 the original design included a fulllength doubledeck fuselage with eightacross seating and two aisles on the lower deck and sevenacross seating and two aisles on the upper deck2728 however concern over evacuation routes and limited cargocarrying capability caused this idea to be scrapped in early 1966 in favor of a wider single deck design1 the cockpit was therefore placed on a shortened upper deck so that a freightloading door could be included in the nose cone this design feature produced the 747s distinctive bulge29 in early models it was not clear what to do with the small space in the pod behind the cockpit and this was initially specified as a lounge area with no permanent seating30 a different configuration that had been considered in order to keep the flight deck out of the way for freight loading had the pilots below the passengers and was dubbed the anteater31 the pratt whitney jt9d highbypass turbofan engine was developed for the 747 one of the principal technologies that enabled an aircraft as large as the 747 to be drawn up was the highbypass turbofan engine32 the engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier turbojets while consuming a third less fuel general electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the c5 galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later3334 pratt whitney was also working on the same principle and by late 1966 boeing pan am and pratt whitney agreed to develop a new engine designated the jt9d to power the 74734 the project was designed with a new methodology called fault tree analysis which allowed the effects of a failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems1 to address concerns about safety and flyability the 747s design included structural redundancy redundant hydraulic systems quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces35 additionally some of the most advanced highlift devices used in the industry were included in the new design to allow it to operate from existing airports these included slats running almost the entire length of the wing as well as complex threepart slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing36 the wings complex threepart flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their nondeployed configuration37 boeing agreed to deliver the first 747 to pan am by the end of 1969 the delivery date left 28 months to design the aircraft which was twothirds of the normal time38 the schedule was so fastpaced that the people who worked on it were given the nickname the incredibles39 developing the aircraft was such a technical and financial challenge that management was said to have bet the company when it started the project1 production plant 747 final assembly at the boeing everett factory as boeing did not have a plant large enough to assemble the giant airliner they chose to build a new plant the company considered locations in about 50 cities40 and eventually decided to build the new plant some 30 miles 50 km north of seattle on a site adjoining a military base at paine field near everett washington41 it bought the 780acre 320 ha site in june 196642 developing the 747 had been a major challenge and building its assembly plant was also a huge undertaking boeing president william m allen asked malcolm t stamper then head of the companys turbine division to oversee construction of the everett factory and to start production of the 74743 to level the site more than four million cubic yards three million cubic meters of earth had to be moved44 time was so short that the 747s fullscale mockup was built before the factory roof above it was finished45 the plant is the largest building by volume ever built and has been substantially expanded several times to permit construction of other models of boeing widebody commercial jets41 development and testing the prototype 747 was first displayed to the public on september 30 1968 before the first 747 was fully assembled testing began on many components and systems one important test involved the evacuation of 560 volunteers from a cabin mockup via the aircrafts emergency chutes the first fullscale evacuation took two and a half minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the federal aviation administration faa and several volunteers were injured subsequent test evacuations achieved the 90second goal but caused more injuries most problematic was evacuation from the aircrafts upper deck instead of using a conventional slide volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel46 tests also involved taxiing such a large aircraft boeing built an unusual training device known as waddells wagon named for a 747 test pilot jack waddell that consisted of a mockup cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck while the first 747s were still being built the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upperdeck position47 on september 30 1968 the first 747 was rolled out of the everett assembly building before the worlds press and representatives of the 26 airlines that had ordered the airliner48 over the following months preparations were made for the first flight which took place on february 9 1969 with test pilots jack waddell and brien wygle at the controls4950 and jess wallick at the flight engineers station despite a minor problem with one of the flaps the flight confirmed that the 747 handled extremely well the 747 was found to be largely immune to dutch roll a phenomenon that had been a major hazard to the early sweptwing jets51 closeup of the prototype 747s 16wheel main landing gear during later stages of the flight test program flutter testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions this difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components however a particularly severe highspeed flutter problem was solved only by inserting depleted uranium counterweights as ballast in the outboard engine nacelles of the early 747s52 this measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed for example el al flight 1862 at amsterdam in 1992 with 282 kilograms 622 lb of uranium in the tailplane horizontal stabilizer5354 the flight test program was hampered by problems with the 747s jt9d engines difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine casings after a short period of service55 the problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months up to 20 aircraft at the everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation56 the program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at renton municipal airport site of the companys renton factory on december 13 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot ralph c cokely undershot the airports short runway the 747s right outer landing gear was torn off and two engine nacelles were damaged5758 however these difficulties did not prevent boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th paris air show in mid1969 where it was displayed to the public for the first time59 the 747 received its faa airworthiness certificate in december 1969 clearing it for introduction into service60 first lady pat nixon visits the cockpit of the first commercial 747 during the christening ceremony january 15 1970 the huge cost of developing the 747 and building the everett factory meant that boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate during the final months before delivery of the first aircraft the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project had this been refused boeings survival would have been threatened2461 the firms debt exceeded 2 billion with the 12 billion owed to the banks setting a record for all companies allen later said it was really too large a project for us62 ultimately the gamble succeeded and boeing held a monopoly in very large passenger aircraft production for many years63 entry into service on january 15 1970 first lady of the united states pat nixon christened pan ams first 747 at dulles international airport later washington dulles international airport in the presence of pan am chairman najeeb halaby instead of champagne red white and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft the 747 entered service on january 22 1970 on pan ams new york–london route64 the flight had been planned for the evening of january 21 but engine overheating made the original aircraft unusable finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the following day when clipper victor was used2 on the 747100 and 747200 a spiral staircase connected the main and upper decks previously boeing used a spiral staircase in its model 377 stratocruiser back in 1946 the 747 enjoyed a fairly smooth introduction into service overcoming concerns that some airports would not be able to accommodate an aircraft that large65 although technical problems occurred they were relatively minor and quickly solved66 after the aircrafts introduction with pan am other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747s into service67 boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines desiring the aircrafts long range rather than its payload capacity6869 while the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined a moderately loaded 747 one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 74770 nonetheless many flagcarriers purchased the 747 due to its iconic status even if it made no sense economically to operate during the 1970s and 1980s there was often over 30 regularly scheduled 747s at john f kennedy international airport71 the recession of 19691970 greatly affected boeing for the year and a half after september 1970 it only sold two 747s in the world and did not sell any to an american carrier for almost three years62 when economic problems in the united states and other countries after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced mcdonnell douglas dc10 and lockheed l1011 tristar trijet wide bodies72 and later the 767 and a300a310 twinjets having tried replacing coach seats on its 747s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers american airlines eventually relegated its 747s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with pan am for smaller aircraft73 delta air lines also removed its 747s from service after several years74 later delta acquired 747s again in 2008 as part of its merger with northwest airlines although it intends to retire them from service by 201875 later 747 models featured a stretched upper deck international flights that bypassed traditional hub airports and landed at smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s and this eroded the 747s original market76 however many international carriers continued to use the 747 on pacific routes77 in japan 747s on domestic routes were configured to carry close to the maximum passenger capacity78 improved 747 versions after the initial 747100 boeing developed the 100b a higher maximum takeoff weight mtow variant and the 100sr short range with higher passenger capacity79 increased maximum takeoff weight allows aircraft to carry more fuel and have longer range80 the 200 model followed in 1971 featuring more powerful engines and a higher mtow passenger freighter and combination passengerfreighter versions of the 200 were produced79 the shortened 747sp special performance with a longer range was also developed and entered service in 197681 the 747 line was further developed with the launch of the 747300 in 1980 the 300 series resulted from boeing studies to increase the seating capacity of the 747 during which modifications such as fuselage plugs and extending the upper deck over the entire length of the fuselage were rejected the first 747300 completed in 1983 included a stretched upper deck increased cruise speed and increased seating capacity the 300 variant was previously designated 747sud for stretched upper deck then 747200 sud82 followed by 747eud before the 747300 designation was used83 passenger short range and combination freighterpassenger versions of the 300 series were produced79 the 747400 entered service in 1989 with air new zealand among the original operators of the type in 1985 development of the longer range 747400 began84 the variant had a new glass cockpit which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three85 new engines lighter construction materials and a redesigned interior development cost soared and production delays occurred as new technologies were incorporated at the request of airlines insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 7474001 the 400 entered service in 198986 in 1991 a recordbreaking 1087 passengers were airlifted aboard a 747 to israel as part of operation solomon87 the 747 remained the heaviest commercial aircraft in regular service until the debut of the antonov an124 ruslan in 1982 variants of the 747400 would surpass the an124s weight in 2000 the antonov an225 mriya cargo transport which debuted in 1988 remains the worlds largest aircraft by several measures including the most accepted measures of maximum takeoff weight and length one aircraft has been completed and is in service as of 2017update the hughes h4 hercules is the largest aircraft by wingspan but it only completed a single flight88 further developments 747400 main deck economy class seating in 343 layout since the arrival of the 747400 several stretching schemes for the 747 have been proposed boeing announced the larger 747500x and 600x preliminary designs in 199689 the new variants would have cost more than us5 billion to develop89 and interest was not sufficient to launch the program90 in 2000 boeing offered the more modest 747x and 747x stretch derivatives as alternatives to the airbus a3xx however the 747x family was unable to attract enough interest to enter production a year later boeing switched from the 747x studies to pursue the sonic cruiser91 and after the sonic cruiser program was put on hold the 787 dreamliner92 some of the ideas developed for the 747x were used on the 747400er a longer range variant of the 74740093 after several variants were proposed but later abandoned some industry observers became skeptical of new aircraft proposals from boeing94 however in early 2004 boeing announced tentative plans for the 747 advanced that were eventually adopted similar in nature to the 747x the stretched 747 advanced used technology from the 787 to modernize the design and its systems the 747 remained the largest passenger airliner in service until the airbus a380 began airline service in 200795 on november 14 2005 boeing announced it was launching the 747 advanced as the boeing 747896 the last 747400s were completed in 200997 as of 2011update most orders of the 7478 have been for the freighter variant on february 8 2010 the 7478 freighter made its maiden flight98 the first delivery of the 7478 went to cargolux in 201199100 the 1500th produced boeing 747 was delivered in june 2014101 in january 2016 boeing stated it was reducing 7478 production to six a year beginning in september 2016 incurring a 569 million posttax charge against its fourthquarter 2015 profits at the end of 2015 the company had 20 orders outstanding102103 on january 29 2016 boeing announced that it had begun the preliminary work on the modifications to a commercial 7478 for the next air force one presidential aircraft expected to be operational by 2020104 on july 12 2016 boeing announced that it had finalized terms of acquisition with volgadnepr group for 20 7478 freighters valued at 758 billion at list prices four aircraft were delivered beginning in 2012 volgadnepr group is the parent of three major russian airfreight carriers – volgadnepr airlines airbridgecargo airlines and atran airlines the new 7478 freighters will replace airbridgecargos current 747400 aircraft and expand the airlines fleet and will be acquired through a mix of direct purchases and leasing over the next six years boeing said105 on july 27 2016 in its quarterly report to the securities and exchange commission boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft106 with a firm order backlog of 21 aircraft and a production rate of six per year program accounting has been reduced to 1555 aircraft and the 747 line could be closed in the third quarter of 2019107 in october 2016 ups airlines ordered 14 8fs to add capacity along with 14 options which doubles its official backlog of 15 – including some to refractory airlines – and could extend production by two more years108 design boeing 747200 cutaway for design details of a particular generation see boeing 747400 7478 and 747sp the boeing 747 is a large widebody twoaisle airliner with four wingmounted engines the wings have a high sweep angle of 375 degrees for a fast efficient cruise29 of mach 084 to 088 depending on the variant the sweep also reduces the wingspan allowing the 747 to use existing hangars1109 seating capacity is more than 366

variant and later as standard beginning on the 747300 the upper deck was stretched more on the 7478 the 747 cockpit roof section also has an escape hatch from which crew can exit in the event of an emergency if they cannot exit through the cabin the 747s maximum takeoff weight ranges from 735000 pounds 333400 kg for the 100 to 970000 lb 439985 kg for the 8 its range has increased from

with four wheels each which provide a good spread of support on the ground and safety in case of tire blowouts the main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly113 in addition the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated tripleslotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standardlength runways114 for transportation of spare engines 747s can accommodate a nonfunctioning fifthpod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage115116 variants the 747100 was the original variant launched in 1966 the 747200 soon followed with its launch in 1968 the 747300 was launched in 1980 and was followed by the 747400 in 1985 ultimately the 7478 was announced in 2005 several versions of each variant have been produced and many of the early variants were in production simultaneously the international civil aviation organization icao classifies variants using a shortened code formed by combining the model number and the variant designator eg b741 for all 100 models117 747100 pan am was the first airline to operate the 747 the 747100 pictured shows the original size of the upper deck and window layout the first 747100s were built with six upper deck windows three per side to accommodate upstairs lounge areas later as airlines began to use the upper deck for premium passenger seating instead of lounge space boeing offered a tenwindow upper deck as an option some early 100s were retrofitted with the new configuration118 the 100 was equipped with pratt whitney jt9d3a engines no freighter version of this model was developed but many 747100s were converted into freighters119 a total of 167 747100s were built4 747sr responding to requests from japanese airlines for a highcapacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities boeing developed the 747sr as a shortrange version of the 747100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability with increased economy class seating up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models79 the 747sr had an economic design life objective of 52000 flights during 20 years of operation compared to 24600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747120 the initial 747sr model the 100sr had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from a greater number of takeoffs and landings121 extra structural support was built into the wings fuselage and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity122 qatar airways 747sr81 landing at london gatwick airport in 1996 the initial order for the 100sr – four aircraft for japan air lines jal later japan airlines – was announced on october 30 1972 rollout occurred on august 3 1973 and the first flight took place on august 31 1973 the type was certified by the faa on september 26 1973 with the first delivery on the same day the 100sr entered service with jal the types sole customer on october 7 1973 and typically operated flights within japan42 seven 100srs were built between 1973 and 1975 each with a 520000pound 240000 kg mtow and pratt whitney jt9d7a engines derated to 43000 poundsforce 190000 n of thrust123 following the 100sr boeing produced the 100bsr a 747sr variant with increased takeoff weight capability debuting in 1978 the 100bsr also incorporated structural modifications for a high cycletoflying hour ratio a related standard 100b model debuted in 1979 the 100bsr first flew on november 3 1978 with first delivery to all nippon airways ana on december 21 1978 a total of twenty 100bsrs were produced for ana and jal124 the 100bsr had a 600000 lb mtow and was powered by the same jt9d7a or general electric cf645 engines used on the 100sr ana operated this variant on domestic japanese routes with 455 or 456 seats until retiring its last aircraft in march 2006125 in 1986 two 100bsr sud models featuring the stretched upper deck sud of the 300 were produced for jal126 the types maiden flight occurred on february 26 1986 with faa certification and first delivery on march 24 1986127 jal operated the 100bsr sud with 563 seats on domestic routes until their retirement in the third quarter of 2006 while only two 100bsr suds were produced in theory standard 100bs can be modified to the sud certification124 overall twentynine 747srs were built4 consisting of seven 100srs twenty 100bsrs and two 100bsr suds 747100b the sole iran air 747100b in passenger service in 2009 the 747100b model was developed from the 100sr using its stronger airframe and landing gear design the type had an increased fuel capacity of 48070 us gal 182000 l 40030 imp gal allowing for a 5000nauticalmile 9300 km 5800 mi range with a typical 452passenger payload and an increased mtow of 750000 lb 340000 kg was offered the first 100b order one aircraft for iran air was announced on june 1 1978 this aircraft first flew on june 20 1979 received faa certification on august 1 1979 and was delivered the next day128 nine 100bs were built one for iran air and eight for saudi arabian airlines129130 unlike the original 100 the 100b was offered with pratt whitney jt9d7a general electric cf650 or rollsroyce rb211524 engines however only rb211524 saudia and jt9d7a iran air engines were ordered131 the last 747100b epiam was retired by iran air in 2014 the last commercial operator of the 747100 and 100b132 747sp main article boeing 747sp bahrain royal flight 747sp climbing with landing gear not yet fully retracted the development of the 747sp stemmed from a joint request between pan american world airways and iran air who were looking for a highcapacity airliner with enough range to cover pan ams new york–middle eastern routes and iran airs planned tehran–new york route the tehran–new york route when launched was the longest nonstop commercial flight in the world the 747sp is 48 feet 4 inches 1473 m shorter than the 747100 fuselage sections were eliminated fore and aft of the wing and the center section of the fuselage was redesigned to fit mating fuselage sections the sps flaps used a simplified singleslotted configuration133134 the 747sp compared to earlier variants had a tapering of the aft upper fuselage into the empennage a doublehinged rudder and longer vertical and horizontal stabilizers135 power was provided by pratt whitney jt9d7afjfw or rollsroyce rb211524 engines136 the 747sp was granted a supplemental certificate on february 4 1976 and entered service with launch customers pan am and iran air that same year134 the aircraft was chosen by airlines wishing to serve major airports with short runways137 a total of 45 747sps were built4 with the 44th 747sp delivered on august 30 1982 in 1987 boeing reopened the 747sp production line after five years to build one last 747sp for an order by the united arab emirates government134 in addition to airline use one 747sp was modified for the nasagerman aerospace center sofia experiment138 iran air is the last civil operator of the type its final 747sp epiac was to be retired in june 2016139140 747200 alitalia 747200b arriving at rome fiumicino airport in 1990 while the 747100 powered by pratt whitney jt9d3a engines offered enough payload and range for us domestic operations it was marginal for long international route sectors the demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to the improved 200 which featured more powerful engines increased mtow and greater range than the 100 a few early 200s retained the threewindow configuration of the 100 on the upper deck but most were built with a tenwindow configuration on each side141 the 747200 was produced in passenger 200b freighter 200f convertible 200c and combi 200m versions142 the 747200b was the basic passenger version with increased fuel capacity and more powerful engines it entered service in february 197182 in its first three years of production the 200 was equipped with pratt whitney jt9d7 engines initially the only engine available range with a full passenger load started at over 5000 nmi 9300 km and increased to 6000 nmi 11000 km with later engines most 200bs had an internally stretched upper deck allowing for up to 16 passenger seats143 the freighter model the 747200f could be fitted with or without a side cargo door82 and had a capacity of 105 tons 953 tonnes and an mtow of up to 833000 lb 378000 kg it entered service in 1972 with lufthansa144 the convertible version the 747200c could be converted between a passenger and a freighter or used in mixed configurations79 and featured removable seats and a nose cargo door82 the 200c could also be fitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck145 iran air cargo 747200m combi taking off from dubai international airport 2009 the combi model the 747200m could carry freight in the rear section of the main deck via a side cargo door a removable partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front the 200m could carry up to 238 passengers in a threeclass configuration with cargo carried on the main deck the model was also known as the 747200 combi82 as on the 100 a stretched upper deck sud modification was later offered a total of 10 converted 747200s were operated by klm82 union des transports aériens uta also had two aircraft converted146147 after launching the 200 with pratt whitney jt9d7 engines on august 1 1972 boeing announced that it had reached an agreement with general electric to certify the 747 with cf650 series engines to increase the aircrafts market potential rollsroyce followed 747 engine production with a launch order from british airways for four aircraft the option of rb211524b engines was announced on june 17 1975131 the 200 was the first 747 to provide a choice of powerplant from the three major engine manufacturers148 a total of 393 of the 747200 versions had been built when production ended in 1991149 of these 225 were 200b 73 were 200f 13 were 200c 78 were 200m and 4 were military150 many 747200s remained in operation although most large carriers have retired them from their fleets and sold them to smaller operators as of early 2000s large carriers have sped up fleet retirement following the september 11 attacks and the subsequent drop in demand for air travel scrapping some or turning others into freighters151152 iran air retired the last passenger 747200 in may 2016 36 years after it was delivered153 747300 pakistan international airlines boeing 747300 on final approach to london heathrow airport england the 747300 features a 23foot4inchlonger 711 m upper deck than the 20083 the stretched upper deck has two emergency exit doors and is the most visible difference between the 300 and previous models before being made standard on the 747300 the stretched upper deck was previously offered as a retrofit and appeared on two japanese 747100sr aircraft154 the 747300 introduced a new straight stairway to the upper deck instead of a spiral staircase on earlier variants which creates room above and below for more seats79 minor aerodynamic changes allowed the 300s cruise speed to reach mach 085 compared with mach 084 on the 200 and 100 models while retaining the same takeoff weight83 the 300 could be equipped with the same pratt whitney and rollsroyce powerplants as on the 200 as well as updated general electric cf680c2b1 engines79 swissair placed the first order for the 747300 on june 11 1980155 the variant revived the 747300 designation which had been previously used on a design study that did not reach production the 747300 first flew on october 5 1982 and the types first delivery went to swissair on march 23 198342 besides the passenger model two other versions 300m 300sr were produced the 747300m features cargo capacity on the rear portion of the main deck similar to the 200m but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers136156 the 747300sr a short range highcapacity domestic model was produced for japanese markets with a maximum seating for 584157 no production freighter version of the 747300 was built but boeing began modifications of used passenger 300 models into freighters in 2000158 a total of 81 747300 series aircraft were delivered 56 for passenger use 21 300m and 4 300sr versions159 in 1985 just two years after the 300 entered service the type was superseded by the announcement of the more advanced 747400160 the last 747300 was delivered in september 1990 to sabena79161 while some 300 customers continued operating the type several large carriers replaced their 747300s with 747400s air france air india pakistan international airlines and qantas were some of the last major carriers to operate the 747300 on december 29 2008 qantas flew its last scheduled 747300 service operating from melbourne to los angeles via auckland162 in july 2015 pakistan international airlines retired their final 747300 after 30 years of service163as of july 2017 only five 747300s remain in commercial service with max air 3 mahan air 1 and transaviaexport airlines 1164 747400 main article boeing 747400 a thai airways 747400 during takeoff at munich airport the 747400 is an improved model with increased range it has wingtip extensions of 6 ft 18 m and winglets of 6 ft 18 m which improve the types fuel efficiency by four percent compared to previous 747 versions165 the 747400 introduced a new glass cockpit designed for a flight crew of two instead of three with a reduction in the number of dials gauges and knobs from 971 to 365 through the use of electronics the type also features tail fuel tanks revised engines and a new interior the longer range has been used by some airlines to bypass traditional fuel stops such as anchorage166 powerplants include the pratt whitney pw4062 general electric cf680c2 and rollsroyce rb211524167 the 400 was offered in passenger 400 freighter 400f combi 400m domestic 400d extended range passenger 400er and extended range freighter 400erf versions passenger versions retain the same upper deck as the 300 while the freighter version does not have an extended upper deck168 the 747400d was built for shortrange operations with maximum seating for 624 winglets were not included but they can be retrofitted169170 cruising speed is up to mach 0855 on different versions of the 747400167 front view of a british airways boeing 747400 arriving at london heathrow airport in 2015 the tripleslotted trailing edge flaps are well seen the passenger version first entered service in february 1989 with launch customer northwest airlines on the minneapolis to phoenix route171 the combi version entered service in september 1989 with klm while the freighter version entered service in november 1993 with cargolux the 747400erf entered service with air france in october 2002 while the 747400er entered service with qantas172 its sole customer in november 2002 in january 2004 boeing and cathay pacific launched the boeing 747400 special freighter program173 later referred to as the boeing converted freighter bcf to modify passenger 747400s for cargo use the first 747400bcf was redelivered in december 2005174 in march 2007 boeing announced that it had no plans to produce further passenger versions of the 400175 however orders for 36 400f and 400erf freighters were already in place at the time of the announcement175 the last passenger version of the 747400 was delivered in april 2005 to china airlines some of the last built 747400s were delivered with dreamliner livery along with the modern signature interior from the boeing 777 a total of 694 of the 747400 series aircraft were delivered4 at various times the largest 747400 operator has included singapore airlines176 japan airlines176 and british airways with 31 as of january 2017update177178

use in the civil reserve airlift fleet193 vc25 – this aircraft is the us air force very important person vip version of the 747200b the us air force operates two of them in vip configuration as the vc25a tail numbers 28000 and 29000 are popularly known as air force one which is technically the airtraffic call sign for any united states air force aircraft carrying the us president although based on the 747200b design they include several innovations introduced on the 747400 partially completed aircraft from everett washington were flown to wichita kansas for final outfitting e4b – formerly known as the national emergency airborne command post referred to colloquially as kneecap this aircraft is now referred to as the national airborne operations center naoc yal1 – this was the experimental airborne laser a planned component of the us national missile defense shuttle carrier aircraft sca – two 747s were modified to carry the space shuttle orbiter the first was a 747100 n905na and the other was a 747100sr n911na the first sca carried the prototype enterprise during the approach and landing tests in the late 1970s the two sca later carried all five operational space shuttle orbiters c33 – this aircraft was a proposed us military version of the 747400f intended to augment the c17 fleet the plan was canceled in favor of additional c17s 201101 japanese air force one one of two customized boeing 747400s in the japan air selfdefense force since 1993 kc33a – a proposed 747 was also adapted as an aerial refueling tanker and was bid against the dc1030 during the 1970s advanced cargo transport aircraft acta program that produced the kc10a extender before the 1979 iranian revolution iran bought four 747100 aircraft with airrefueling boom conversions to support its fleet of f4 phantoms194195 there is a report of using a kc33a in h3 airstrike during iran–iraq war196 it is unknown whether these aircraft remain usable as tankers since then other proposals have emerged for conversion of later 747400 aircraft for this role194 747 cmca – this cruise missile carrier aircraft variant was considered by the us air force during the development of the b1 lancer strategic bomber it would have been equipped with 50 to 100 agm86 alcm cruise missiles on rotary launchers this plan was abandoned in favor of more conventional strategic bombers197 747 airborne aircraft carrier concept 747 aac – a boeing study under contract from the usaf for an airborne aircraft carrier for up to 10 boeing model 985121 microfighters with the ability to launch retrieve rearm and refuel boeing believed that the scheme would be able to deliver a flexible and fast carrier platform with global reach particularly where other bases were not available modified versions of the 747200 and lockheed c5a were considered as the base aircraft the concept which included a complementary 747 awacs version with two reconnaissance microfighters was considered technically feasible in 1973198 evergreen 747 supertanker – a boeing 747200 modified as an aerial application platform for fire fighting using 20000 us gallons 76000 l of firefighting chemicals199 stratospheric observatory

order to rise above infraredabsorbing water vapor in the atmosphere a number of other governments also use the 747 as a vip transport including bahrain brunei india iran japan kuwait oman pakistan qatar saudi arabia and united arab emirates several boeing 7478s have been ordered by boeing business jet for conversion to vip transports for several unidentified customers200 undeveloped variants boeing has studied a number of 747 variants that have not gone beyond the concept stage 747 trijet during the late 1960s and early 1970s boeing studied the development of a shorter 747 with three engines to compete with the smaller l1011 tristar and dc10 the 747 trijet would have had more payload range and passenger capacity than the l1011 and dc10 the center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an sduct intake similar to the l1011s however engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened fourengine 747 resulting in the 747sp201 747 asb boeing announced the 747 asb advanced short body in 1986 as a response to the airbus a340 and the mcdonnell douglas md11 this aircraft design would have combined the advanced technology used on the 747400 with the foreshortened 747sp fuselage the aircraft was to carry 295 passengers a range of 8000 nmi 9200 mi 15000 km202 however airlines were not interested in the project and it was canceled in 1988 in favor of the 777 747500x 600x and 700x the proposed 747500x and 600x as depicted in an 1998 faa illustration boeing announced the 747500x and 600x at the 1996 farnborough airshow89 the proposed models would have combined the 747s fuselage with a new 251 ft 77 m span wing derived from the 777 other changes included adding more powerful engines and increasing the number of tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear203 the 747500x concept featured an increased fuselage length of 18 ft 55 m to 250 ft 762 m long and the aircraft was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8700 nautical miles 10000 mi 16100 km with a gross weight of over 10 mlb 450 tonnes203 the 747600x concept featured a greater stretch to 279 ft 85 m with seating for 548 passengers a range of up to 7700 nmi 8900 mi 14300 km and a gross weight of 12 mlb 540 tonnes203 a third study concept the 747700x would have combined the wing of the 747600x with a widened fuselage allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 74740089 the cost of the changes from previous 747 models in particular the new wing for the 747500x and 600x was estimated to be more than us5 billion89 boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft90 747x and 747x stretch as airbus progressed with its a3xx study boeing offered a 747 derivative as an alternative in 2000 a more modest proposal than the previous 500x and 600x that retained the 747s overall wing design and add a segment at the root increasing the span to 229 ft 698 m204 power would have been supplied by either the engine alliance gp7172 or the rollsroyce trent 600 which were also proposed for the 767400erx205 a new flight deck based on the 777s would be used the 747x aircraft was to carry 430 passengers over ranges of up to 8700 nmi 10000 mi 16100 km the 747x stretch would be extended to 263 ft 802 m long allowing it to carry 500 passengers over ranges of up to 7800 nmi 9000 mi 14500 km204 both would feature an interior based on the 777206 freighter versions of the 747x and 747x stretch were also studied207 the 747400er was derived from the 747400x study like its predecessor the 747x family was unable to garner enough interest to justify production and it was shelved along with the 767400erx in march 2001 when boeing announced the sonic cruiser concept91 though the 747x design was less costly than the 747500x and 600x it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747400 the 747x did not make it beyond the drawing board but the 747400x being developed concurrently moved into production to become the 747400er208 747400xqlr after the end of the 747x program boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747 the 747400xqlr quiet long range was meant to have an increased range of 7980 nmi 9200 mi 14800 km with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise209210 improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767400er and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction211 although the 747400xqlr did not move to production many of its features were used for the 747 advanced which has now been launched as the 7478

airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure while the japan airlines flight 123 and china airlines flight 611 crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair united airlines flight 811 which suffered an explosive decompression midflight on february 24 1989 led the national transportation safety board ntsb to issue a recommendation that 747200 cargo doors similar to those on the flight 811 aircraft be modified korean air lines flight 007 was shot down by a soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into soviet territory causing us president ronald reagan to authorize the thenstrictly military global positioning system gps for civilian use218 accidents due to design deficiencies included twa flight 800 where a 747100 exploded in midair on july 17 1996 probably due to sparking electricity wires inside the fuel tank219 this finding led the faa to propose a rule requiring installation of an inerting system in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in july 2008 after years of research into solutions at the time the new safety system was expected to cost us100000 to 450000 per aircraft and weigh approximately 200 pounds 91 kg220 el al flight 1862 crashed after the fuse pins for an engine broke off shortly after takeoff due to metal fatigue instead of dropping away from the wing the engine knocked off the adjacent
