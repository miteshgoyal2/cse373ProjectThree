flawless later that year sampling from the ted talk by feminist writer chimamanda ngozi achidie we should all be feminists beyonce has crafted her brand around embracing femininity and female sexuality although as dr cheryl thompson explains in her article “the sweet taste of lemonade beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album”2 beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work according to thompson beyonce like many other black female artists has held back with her identity as a black woman for the sake of appealing to the masses like the snl skit that pokes fun at white beyonce fans that listened to “lemonade” and realized for the first time that beyonce is indeed a black woman 3 it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face as thompson explains all of beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism“lemonade” is about black feminism the importance of having artistry like “lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women and the racial and genderbased oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles even so there is no shortage of criticism against beyonces particular brand of feminism many critics argue that beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90s something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry305 beyond this some feminist critics argue that beyonce fuels a culture of postfeminism with songs like girls who run the world beyonce creates a mindset particularly among teenage girls that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life when the reality is these critics say there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so the danger of postfeminism is that while they still exist young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism306 wealth forbes magazine began reporting on beyoncés earnings in 2008 calculating that the 80 million earned between june 2007 to june 2008 for her
