daniel schechter from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search not to be confused with daniel schechter director daniel s schechter born 1962 in miami florida is an american psychiatrist currently living in geneva switzerland he is known for his clinical work and research on intergenerational transmission or communication of violent trauma and related psychopathology involving parents and very young children123 his published work in this area following the terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york of september 11 2001 led to a coedited book entitled september 11 trauma and human bonds 2003 4 and additional original articles with clinical psychologist susan coates that were translated into multiple languages and remain among the very first accounts of 911 related loss and trauma described by mental health professionals who also experienced the attacks and their aftermath5678 schechter observed that separation anxiety among infants and young children who had either lost or feared loss of their caregivers triggered posttraumatic stress symptoms in the surviving caregivers these observations validated his prior work on the adverse impact of family violence on the early parentchild relationship formative socialemotional development and related attachment disturbances involving mutual dysregulation of emotion and arousal91011 this body of work on trauma and attachment has been cited by prominent authors in the attachment theory psychological trauma developmental psychobiology and neuroscience literatures 121314151617

2 references 3 external links careeredit following studies in music and french literature oberlin conservatory of music columbia college ba and columbia university graduate school of arts and sciences ma schechter then completed his medical training at the columbia university college of physicians surgeons his earliest research examined the nature of motherdaughter relationships in the context of maleperpetrated child sexual abuse 18 as well as traumarelated culturebound syndromes in an innercity caribbean hispanic community19 funding through the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry allowed schechter to travel to tulane university in new orleans beginning in 1998 to study with infant mental health specialist charles h zeanah they have since collaborated on multiple projects and articles related to the effects of psychological trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd on the relationship of infants young children and their parents as well as related attachment disorder2021 this collaboration along with involvement as a zero to three national center for infants toddlers and families solnit fellow 1999–2001 encouraged schechter to pursue further research training in developmental neuroscience through a nihfunded research fellowship in developmental psychobiology with myron hofer and michael myers at the new york state psychiatric institute in 2003 schechter received an nimh research career award to fund the project maternal posttraumatic stress disorder and interactive behavior with very young children which was completed in 2008 in that same year schechter was recruited to geneva switzerland to become the director of pediatric consultliaison and parentchild research in the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at the university of geneva hospitals22 and he is currently senior lecturer in psychiatry within the faculty of medicine university of geneva23 in geneva his clinical research efforts together with colleagues françois ansermet sandra rusconiserpa and others continue to focus on the effects of parental violencerelated traumatic stress on the parentchild relationship and child developmental outcomes in the domains of emotion and arousal regulation together with related biomarkers that might contribute to intergenerational cycles of violence and victimization 2425 schechters work has received a number of awards including a pierre janet scientific paper prize from the international society for the study of trauma and dissociation 2007 the hayman prize for best published work relevant to traumatized children or adults 2015 and four significant contribution to research awards from the international psychoanalytical association 2005 2009 2013 2015 as well as three norbert and charlotte rieger paper prizes from the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry 2010 2015 2017 his publication with psychologist dominik moser on neural activity among traumatized mothers with dissociative symptoms was awarded a best scientific paper prize by the french psychiatric association 2014 26 helping traumatized parents change their minds about their young childrenedit during his work as director of infant mental health services at the columbia university medical center 1998–2008 schechter found that the large majority of innercity mothers who were requesting consultation for their infants and young children for reasons of behavioral difficulties had histories of childhood maltreatment andor family violence victimization and exposure often with related psychiatric sequelae ie ptsd major depression dissociation and personality disorder he further observed that many of these traumatized mothers despite their best intentions not only had great difficulty in reading and tolerating their infants distress but that they also had a tendency to misattribute their childrens intentions and personality characteristics2728 as a result the child in an effort to maintain an attachment with the traumatized parent would conform to these misattributions andor attempt to join the parents hypervigilant mental state leading to a traumatically skewed intersubjectivity29 children of these traumatized mothers also show increased ptsd symptoms externalizing symptoms and attachment disturbances that are mediated by maternal ptsd severity3031 schechter and colleagues developed an experimental paradigm informed by attachment theory called the clinician assisted videofeedback exposure sessions caves to test whether mothers could change their mind about their young children if helped to watch videoexcerpts of play separation and similarly stressful moments in the presence of a clinician who asks the mother to think about what she and her child might be thinking and feeling at the time of the excerpt and at the moment of videofeedback thus this technique applies principles of mentalization as an aide to emotional regulation with traumatized parents3233 this technique also involves elements of prolonged exposure treatment—in other words confronting avoidance of traumarelated negative emotions34 the videobased treatment interaction guidance3536 and psychodynamically oriented childparent psychotherapy 37 schechter and colleagues showed a significant change in the way mothers perceived their own child and their relationship together38 schechter rusconi serpa and colleagues have manualized a 16session psychotherapy for violenceexposed mothers their infants and young children that builds upon the caves technique this treatment is called clinician assisted videofeedback exposureapproach therapy caveat and currently is in a pilot phase intergenerational communication of violent traumaedit schechter has studied how the distressed toddler can trigger a parents posttraumatic stress marked by a emotional unavailability or frank avoidance and b how parents communicate— often unintentionally memories of their own violent traumatic experiences in relation to emotional unavailability schechter and colleagues found that mothers with interpersonalviolence related ptsd while not showing differences in their capacity to jointly attend to play with their toddlers before a stressor when compared to controlsubjects show significant limitation in their responsiveness to their toddlers upon reunion following separation stress this is despite that children of ptsd mothers show no greater distress during separation than those of controls39 and in relation to communication of traumatic experience following from the work of scheeringa and zeanah schechter explored the implicit and explicit nonverbal and verbal ways parents communicate their traumatic experiences to their children who may or may not have been present during these violent events40 in particular schechter has shown how a parent can vicariously and unintentionally transmit her prior experiences of interpersonal violence to her child through her behavior and narrative associations by doing or saying something— or drawing connections between actions andor language that the child cannot place in any familiar context but that is by its nature frightening or even traumatizing his work has demonstrated this both in routine daily interactions laboratory observations and in violentmedia viewing practices by mothers and their toddlers in the home41424344 he has hypothesized that this inadvertent intergenerational transmission is often an effect of traumatized mothers efforts to control their own psychophysiologic dysregulation that is linked to their posttraumatic psychopathology this was for example demonstrated with regards to the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpaaxis in the first publication on maternal physiologic response to child separation and in a parallel study subsequently in relation to the autonomic nervous system response4546 schechter and colleagues have in addition to maternal behavioral and physiological dysregulation also found at the level of maternal brain activity corticolimbic dysregulation on functional neuroimaging as associated with maternal ptsd and dissociative symptoms in response to child separation and adult malefemale violencerelated videostimuli in both new york and geneva samples 474849 the same pattern of corticolimbic dysregulation has also been associated with increased parenting stress hpa axis dysregulation as marked by decreased methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene and observed child behavioral difficulty during motherchild play50 an important motivation for traumatized parents schechter and colleagues have found is the conscious aim of the traumatized parent to interrupt intergenerational cycles of violence and trauma so that her child does not have to suffer the emotional and often physical pain that she had experienced as a child as schechter and willheim describe this can be a long and difficult process for families—and one that requires that the therapist be prepared to intervene thoughtfully ie modelling and stimulating parental mentalization as much inthemoment in response to reallife events reported by the parents and professionals ie pediatricians daycare and preschool staff child protective agencies the courts as during parentchild sessions51 the work with parents and their relationship with their child often needs to continue when possible and feasible52 as infants and young children and their needs are so rapidly developing and as their parents find themselves in a parallel phase of adult development during which they are more open to change the therapist can be surprised by quick positive shifts in relational patterns within the context of both brief consultations and longterm treatments such as for caregivers with complex ptsd and their young children53 5455 infant and early childhood mental health advocacyedit schechter served as a key member of the new york city early childhood mental health strategic work group an advisory group to the new york city department of health and mental hygiene under the direction of evelyn blanck from 2004 to 2008 in 2005 the workgroup published a white paper“promoting the mental health and healthy development of new york’s infants toddlers and preschoolers a call to action” that has been used to effectively advocate for mental health services for children from birth to age 5 across all childserving systems in new york city and new york state56 this paper was instrumental in the inclusion of infants and toddlers in the child and families clinic plus initiative implemented by the new york state office of mental health thus officially recognized for the first time as under the responsibility for care by state licensed child and adolescent mental health clinical programs57 an updated version of the white paper was reviewed favorably in 2011 by the new york state mental health commissioners office referencesedit mayer km
