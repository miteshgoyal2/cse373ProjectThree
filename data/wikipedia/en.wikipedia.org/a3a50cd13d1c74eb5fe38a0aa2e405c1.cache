johnson who had six siblings121314 was influenced by his parents strong work ethic johnsons mother spent many hours after work each night cleaning their home and preparing the next days meals while his father did janitorial work at a used car lot and collected garbage all while never missing a day at general motors earvin jr would often help his father on the garbage route and he was teased by neighborhood children who called him garbage man15 johnson grew up in lansing and came to love basketball as a youngster his favorite basketball player was bill russell whom he admired more for his many championships than his athletic ability16 he also idolized players such as earl monroe and marques haynes17 and practiced all day3 magic johnson came from an athletic family his father played high school basketball in his home state of mississippi18 and johnson learned the finer points about the game from him johnsons mother originally from north carolina18 had also played basketball as a child and she grew up watching her brothers play the game16 by the time he had reached the eighth grade johnson had begun to think about a future in basketball he had become a dominant junior high player once scoring 48 points in a game13 johnson looked forward to playing at sexton high school a school with a very successful basketball team and a great tradition that also happened to be only five blocks from his home his plans underwent a dramatic change when he learned that he would be bused to predominately white everett high school1619 instead of going to sexton which was predominately black1320 johnsons sister pearl and his brother larry had bused to everett the previous year and did not have a pleasant experience there were incidents of racism with rocks being thrown at buses carrying black students and white parents refusing to send their children to school larry was kicked off the basketball team after a confrontation during practice prompting him to beg earvin not to play johnson did join the basketball team but became angry after several days when his new teammates ignored him during practice not even passing the ball he nearly got into a fight with another player before head coach george fox intervened eventually johnson accepted his situation and the small group of black students looked to him as their leader13 when recalling the events in his autobiography my life he talked about how his time at everett had changed him as i look back on it today i see the whole picture very differently its true that i hated missing out on sexton and the first few months i was miserable at everett but being bused to everett turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me it got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people how to communicate and deal with them13 johnson was first dubbed magic as a 15yearold sophomore playing for everett high school when he recorded a tripledouble of 36 points 18 rebounds and 16 assists3 after the game fred stabley jr a sports writer for the lansing state journal gave him the moniker21 despite the belief of johnsons mother a christian that the name was sacrilegious3 in his final high school season johnson led lansing everett to a 27–1 win–loss record while averaging 288 points and 168 rebounds per game3 and took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game22 johnson dedicated the championship victory to his best friend reggie chastine who was killed in a car accident the previous summer23 he gave chastine much of the credit for his development as a basketball player and as a person24 saying years later i doubted myself back then25 johnson and chastine were almost always together playing basketball or riding around in chastines car15 upon learning of chastines death magic ran from his home crying uncontrollably25 johnson who finished his high school career with two allstate selections was considered at the time to be the best high school player ever to come out of michigan23 and was also named to the 1977 mcdonalds allamerican team26 college career although johnson was recruited by several topranked colleges such as indiana and ucla he decided to play close to home27 his college decision came down to michigan and michigan state in east lansing he ultimately decided to attend michigan state when coach jud heathcote told him he could play the point guard position the talent already on michigan states roster also drew him to the program28 johnson did not initially aspire to play professionally focusing

season was composed of 80 normal games and two lakers–celtics games similarly bird admitted that johnsons daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning97 several journalists
