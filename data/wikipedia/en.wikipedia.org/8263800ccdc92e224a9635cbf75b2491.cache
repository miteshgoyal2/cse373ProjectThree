expressed concern for too much government regulation in the us stating that we could be facing the greatest loss of liberty and prosperity since the 1930s27 in addition he has warned that drastic

to the state30 in an april 2011 wall street journal oped koch wrote government spending on business only aggravates the problem too many businesses have successfully lobbied for special favors and treatment by seeking mandates for their products subsidies in the form of cash payments from the government and regulations and tariffs to keep more efficient competitors at bay crony capitalism is much easier than competing in an open market but it erodes our overall standard of living and stifles entrepreneurs by rewarding the politically favored rather than those who provide what consumers want31 his opposition to corporate welfare includes lobbying for the end to ethanol subsidies despite the fact that koch industries is a major ethanol producer he is quoted as saying “the first thing we’ve got to get rid of is business welfare and entitlements”32 regarding government regulation koch has written that he expects his employees to cooperate fully with the law regardless of personal views we needed to be uncompromising with our workforce to expect 100 percent of our employees to comply 100 percent of the time with complex and everchanging government mandates striving to comply with every law does not mean agreeing with every law but even when faced with laws we think are counterproductive we must first comply only then from a credible position can we enter into a dialogue with regulatory agencies to demonstrate alternatives that are more beneficial if these efforts fail we can then join with others in using education andor political efforts to change the law33 in an april 2014 wall street journal oped koch wrote the fundamental concepts of dignity respect equality before the law and personal freedom are under attack by the nations own government he criticized the obama administration saying that its central belief and fatal conceit is that people are not capable of running their own lives this is the essence of big government and collectivism he wrote he cited the current health care debacle as an example of disastrous government control he complained that he had been the victim of character assassination3435 in an november 2015 joint interview with his brother david on msnbcs morning joe koch who supports a noninterventionist foreign policy36 criticized americas current foreign policy calling it a form of insanity37 marketbased managementedit kochs

industries 2004 acquisition of invista so he could give new employees a comprehensive picture of mbm according to the website of the marketbased management institute which koch founded in 2005 mbm is based on rules of just conduct economic thinking and sound mental models harnessing the dispersed knowledge of employees just as markets harness knowledge in society it is organized in and interpreted through five dimensions vision virtue and talents decision rights incentives and knowledge processes38 in the book koch attempts to apply f a hayeks spontaneous order theory and austrian
