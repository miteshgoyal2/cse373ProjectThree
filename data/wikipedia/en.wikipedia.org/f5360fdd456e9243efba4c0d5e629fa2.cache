privacy policy agreements that cover all of its services meaning that the language in the agreements grants the company broad rights to reproduce use and create derivative works from content stored on google drive while the policies also confirm that users retain intellectual property rights privacy advocates raised concerns that the licenses grant google the rights to use the information and data to customize advertising and other services google provides in contrast other members of the media noted that the agreements were no worse than those of competing cloud storage services but that the competition uses more artful language in the agreements and also stated that google needs the rights in order to move files around on its servers cache your data or make image thumbnails as of march

249month 100gb costing 499month and 1tb costing 4999month5 originally gmail google docs and picasa had separate allowances for free storage and a shared allowance for purchased storagecitation needed between april 2012 and may 2013 google drive and google photos had a shared allowance for both free and purchased storage whereas gmail had a separate 10 gb storage limit which increased to 25 gb on the purchase of any storage plancitation needed in september 2012 google announced that a paid plan would now cover total storage rather than the paid allocation being added to the free eg a 100 gb plan allowed a total of 100 gb rather than 115 gb as previously35 in may 2013 google announced the overall merge of storage across gmail google drive and google photos allowing users 15 gb of unified free storage between the services27 in march 2014 the storage plans were revised again and prices were reduced by 80 to 199month for 100 gb 999month for 1tb and 9999month for 10 tb36 this was much

creator of a file or folder is by default its owner the owner can regulate the public visibility of the file or folder ownership is transferable files or folders can be shared privately with particular users having a google account using their gmailcom email addresses sharing files with users not having a google account requires making them accessible to anybody with the link this generates a secret url for the file which may be shared via email or private messages files and folders can also be made public on the web which means that they can be indexed by search engines and thus can be found and accessed by anyone the owner may also set an access level for regulating permissions the three access levels offered are can edit can comment and can view users with editing access can invite others to edit thirdparty appsedit a number of external web applications that work with google drive are available from the chrome web store to add an app users are required to sign

usage or access to additional features saving data from a thirdparty app to google drive requires authorization the first time40 the google drive software development kit sdk works together with the google drive user interface and the chrome web store to create an ecosystem of apps that can be installed into google drive in february 2013 the create menu in google drive was revamped to include thirdparty apps thus effectively granting them the same status as googles own apps4142 in march 2013 google released an api for google drive that enables thirdparty developers to build collaborative

had direct access to servers owned by multiple technology companies including google65 the company began testing encrypting data in july66 and enabled encryption for data in transit between its data centers in november67 however as of 2015 google drive does not provide clientside encryption68 professional editionsedit see also g suite google drive for workedit google drive for work is a business

standard which confirmed that google would not use data in drive for work accounts for advertising enabled additional tools for handling and exporting data more transparency about data storage and protection from thirdparty data requests71 in march 2017 google introduced drive file stream making it possible for g suite customers on windows and macos computers to search their drive folders and download specific files ondemand rather than downloading all files during installation potentially preventing large amounts of data from gobbling up your hard drive additionally the feature will guess

in november google opened an early adopter program allowing g suite business and g suite for education customers to sign up although google noted that some functionality isnt yet supported by team drives76 docs sheets and slidesedit main article google docs sheets and slides an example of a document in google docs google docs google sheets and google slides constitute a free webbased office suite offered by google and integrated with google drive it allows users to create and edit documents spreadsheets and presentations online while collaborating in realtime with other users the three

google forms google drawings and google tables beta while forms and tables are only available as web applications drawings is also available as a chrome app the suite is tightly integrated with google drive and all files created with the apps are by default saved to google drive receptionedit featuresedit in a review of google drive after its launch in april 2012 dan grabham of techradar wrote that the integration of google docs into google drive was a bit confusing mainly due to the differences in the user interfaces ui between the two where drive offers a my drive section with a specific shared with me view for shared documents he stated that we think the user interface needs a lot more work its like a retread of google docs at the moment and google surely needs to do work here he considered uploading files fairly easy but noted that folder upload was only supported through the google chrome web browser the lack of native editing of microsoft office documents was annoying regarding google drives computer apps he stated that the option in settings to synchronize only specific folders was powerful he wrote that drive was a great addition to google armoury of apps and everything does work seamlessly while again criticizing the interface for being confusing and that the file view was not quite intuitive enough without file icons grabham also reviewed the mobile android app writing that its a pretty simple app that enables you to access your files on the move and save some for offline access should you wish and praised google docs creation and photo uploading for being easy he also praised that everything is easily searchable77 a review by michael muchmore of pc magazine in february 2016 praised the service as truly impressive in creating and editing files describing its features as leading in officesuite collaboration he added that compatibility is rarely an issue with importing and exporting options and that the free storage of 15 gigabytes was generous however he also criticized the user interface for being confusing to navigate and wrote that offline editing isnt simple78 ownership and licensingedit immediately after its announcement in april 2012 google faced criticism over google drive privacy in particular privacy advocates have noted that google has one unified set of terms of service and privacy policy agreements for all its products and services in a cnet report zack whittaker noted that the terms and service have come under heavy fire by the wider community for how it handles users copyright and intellectual property rights in a comparison of terms of service agreements between google drive and competing cloud storage services dropbox and onedrive he cited a paragraph stating that google has broad rights to reproduce use and create derivative works from content stored on google drive via a license from its users although the user retains intellectual property rights the user licenses google to extract and parse uploaded content to customize advertising and other services that google provides to the user and to promote the service summarized he wrote that according to its terms google does not own useruploaded files to google drive but the company can do whatever it likes with them79 in a highly critical editorial of the service ed bott of zdnet wrote that language in the agreements contained exact same words as dropbox used in a july 2011 privacy policy update that sparked criticism and forced dropbox to update its policy once again with clarifying language adding that its a perfect example of googles inability to pay even the slightest bit of attention to anything that happens outside the googleplex80 matt peckham of time criticized the lack of unique service agreements for drive writing that if any google service warrants privacy firewalling it’s google drive this isn’t youtube or calendar or even gmail——the potential for someone’s most sensitive data to be snooped whether to glean info for marketing or otherwise is too high google ought to create a privacy exception that “narrows the scope” of its service terms for google drive one that minimally states the company will never circulate the information generated from searching within sic your gdrive data in any way81 in contrast a report by nilay patel of the verge stated that all web services should be subject to harsh scrutiny of their privacy policies—but a close and careful reading reveals that googles terms are pretty much the same as anyone elses and slightly better in some cases pointing to the fact that google couldnt move files around on its servers cache your data or make image thumbnails without proper rights in comparing the policies with competing services patel wrote that its clear that they need the exact same permissions—they just use slightly more artful language to communicate them82 growthedit on november 12 2013 google announced that google drive had 120 million active users a figure that the company was releasing for the first time83 on june 25 2014 at the google io developer conference sundar pichai announced that google drive now had 190 million monthly active users and that it was being used by 58 of the fortune 500 companies as well as by 72 of the top universities84 on october 1 2014 at its atmosphere live event it was announced that google drive

million organizational paying users86 in march 2017 google announced that google drive had 800 million active users8788 in may 2017 a google executive stated at a company event that there were over two trillion files stored on google drive8990 downtime issuesedit although google has a 999 uptime guarantee for google drive for g suite customers91 google drive has suffered downtimes for both consumers and business users during significant downtimes googles app status dashboard gets updated with the current status of each service google offers along with details on restoration progress
