lot of turmoil in virginia with the rise of the republican party when the civil war reached western virginia there was a rise in violence against those who opposed slavery in may 1861 people traveled to richmond virginia to vote on secession of the state many republicans had to leave the city because of the threats those who fled and others who lived in western virginia went to wheeling to create their own government and began creating a new state in which they were successful the civil war helped the republican party gain recognition in the state the civil war in west virginia often split families apart the boggs family lived in pendleton county and one son was the head of the confederate county court while another son was the head of the union home guards in the north today the northern party of pendleton county is still strongly republican republicans in hampshire and hardy counties left after the war to form mineral and grant counties which are still primarily republican republicans held the control in the state until the 1870s and the confederates began voting and holding offices in the 1870s the party was so weak that it endorsed a democratic governor major nathan goff jr restructured the party he was able to get the party to raise money and voters and recruit leaders he led the party until the 1880s he ran for governor in 1888 and won the republicans were the dominant party until the great depression since the depression democrats have controlled the state arch moore jr was elected the republican governor in the 1960s in 1985 moore helped raise money and
