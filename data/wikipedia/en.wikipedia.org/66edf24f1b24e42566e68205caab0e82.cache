showing real gdp growth rates for 2009 countries in brown were in recession the great recession 2008–2012 was a period of general economic decline observed in world markets during the late 2000s and early 2010s the scale and timing of the recession varied from country to country12 in terms of overall impact the international monetary fund concluded that it was the worst global recession since the 1930s the great depression34 the causes of the recession largely originated in the united states particularly related to the realestate market though choices made by other nations contributed as well according to the us national bureau of economic research the official arbiter of us recessions the recession as experienced in that country began in december 2007 and ended in june 2009 thus extending over 19 months5 the great recession was related to the financial crisis of 2007–08 and us subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–09 the great recession resulted in the scarcity of valuable assets in the market economy and the collapse of the financial sector banks in the world economy the banks were then bailed out by the us government 67 the recession was not felt evenly around the world whereas most of the worlds developed economies particularly in north america and europe including russia fell into a definitive recession many of the newer developed economies suffered far less impact

reading 13 external links terminologyedit two senses of the word recession exist a less precise sense referring broadly to a period of reduced economic activity8 and the academic sense used most often in economics which is defined operationally referring specifically to the contraction phase of a business cycle with two or more consecutive quarters of gdp contraction under the academic definition the recession ended in the united states in june or july 2009910 in the broader lay sense of the word however many people use the term to refer to ongoing hardship in the same way that the term great depression is also popularly used111213141516 overviewedit the great recession met the imf criteria for being a global recession only in the single calendar year 200934 that imf definition requires a decline in annual real world gdp per‑capita despite the fact that quarterly data are being used as recession definition criteria by all g20 members representing 85 of the world gdp17 the international monetary fund imf has decided—in the absence of a complete data set—not to declaremeasure global recessions according to quarterly gdp data the seasonally adjusted ppp‑weighted real gdp for the g20‑zone however is a good indicator for the world gdp and it was measured to have suffered a direct quarter on quarter decline during the three quarters from q3‑2008 until q1‑2009 which more accurately mark when the recession took place at the global level18 according to the us national bureau of economic research the official arbiter of us recessions the recession began in december 2007 and ended in june 2009 and thus extended over eighteen months519 the years leading up to the crisis were characterized by an exorbitant rise in asset prices and associated boom in economic demand20 further the us shadow banking system ie nondepository financial institutions such as investment banks had grown to rival the depository system yet was not subject to the same regulatory oversight making it vulnerable to a bank run21 us mortgagebacked securities which had risks that were hard to assess were marketed around the world as they offered higher yields than us government bonds many of these securities were backed by subprime mortgages which collapsed in value when the us housing bubble burst during 2006 and homeowners began to default on their mortgage payments in large numbers starting in 200722 the emergence of subprime loan losses in 2007 began the crisis and exposed other risky loans and overinflated asset prices with loan losses mounting and the fall of lehman brothers on 15 september 2008 a major panic broke out on the interbank loan market there was the equivalent of a bank run on the shadow banking system resulting in many large and well established investment and commercial banks in the united states and europe suffering huge losses and even facing bankruptcy resulting in massive public financial assistance government bailouts23 the global recession that followed resulted in a sharp drop in international trade rising unemployment and slumping commodity prices24 several economists predicted that recovery might not appear until 2011 and that the recession would be the worst since the great depression of the 1930s2526 economist paul krugman once commented on this as seemingly the beginning of a second great depression27 governments and central banks responded with fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate national economies and reduce financial system risks the recession has renewed interest in keynesian economic ideas on how to combat recessionary conditions economists advise that the stimulus should be withdrawn as soon as the economies recover enough to chart a path to sustainable growth282930 the distribution of household incomes in the united states has become more unequal during the post2008 economic recovery31 income inequality in the united states has grown from 2005 to 2012 in more than 2 out of 3 metropolitan areas32 median household wealth fell 35 in the us from 106591 to 68839 between 2005 and 201133 causesedit main article causes of the great recession the great asset bubble34 1 central banks gold

2009 19 trillion further information financial crisis of 2007–2008 panel reportsedit the majority report provided by us financial crisis inquiry commission composed of six democratic and four republican appointees reported its findings in january 2011 it concluded that the crisis was avoidable and was caused by widespread failures in financial regulation including the federal reserve’s failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk an explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and wall street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels35 there were two republican dissenting fcic reports one of them signed by three republican appointees concluded that there were multiple causes in his separate dissent to the majority and minority opinions of the fcic commissioner peter j wallison of the american enterprise institute aei primarily blamed us housing policy including the actions of fannie freddie for the crisis he wrote when the bubble began to deflate in mid2007 the low quality and high risk loans engendered by government policies failed in unprecedented numbers36 in its declaration of the summit on financial markets and the world economy dated 15 november 2008 leaders of the group of 20 cited the following causes during a period of strong global growth growing capital flows and prolonged stability earlier this decade market participants sought higher yields without an adequate appreciation of the risks and failed to exercise proper due diligence at the same time weak underwriting standards unsound risk management practices increasingly complex and opaque financial products and consequent excessive leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system policymakers regulators and supervisors in some advanced countries did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial markets keep pace with financial innovation or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic regulatory actions37 narrativesedit us residential and nonresidential investment fell relative to gdp during the crisis there are several narratives attempting to place the causes of the recession into context with overlapping elements five such narratives include there was the equivalent of a bank run on the shadow banking system which includes investment banks and other nondepository financial entities this system had grown to rival the depository system in scale yet was not subject to the same regulatory safeguards its failure disrupted the flow of credit to consumers and corporations2338 the us economy was being driven by a housing bubble when it burst private residential investment ie housing construction fell by nearly 4 gdp and consumption enabled by bubblegenerated housing wealth also slowed this created a gap in annual demand gdp of nearly 1 trillion the us government was unwilling to make up for this private sector shortfall3940 record levels of household debt accumulated in the decades preceding the crisis resulted in a balance sheet recession similar to debt deflation once housing prices began falling in 2006 consumers began paying off debt which reduces their consumption slowing down the economy for an extended period while debt levels are reduced2341 us government policies encouraged home ownership even for those who could not afford it contributing to lax lending standards unsustainable housing price increases and indebtedness42 wealthy and middleclass house flippers with midtogood credit scores created a speculative bubble in house prices and then wrecked local housing markets and financial institutions after they defaulted on their debt en masse43 underlying narratives 13 is a hypothesis that growing income inequality and wage stagnation encouraged families to increase their household debt to maintain their desired living standard fueling the bubble further this greater share of income flowing to the top increased the political power of business interests who used that power to deregulate or limit regulation of the shadow banking system444546 narrative 5 challenges the popular claim that subprime borrowers with shoddy credit caused the crisis by buying homes they couldnt afford this narrative is supported by new research showing that the biggest growth of mortgage debt during the us housing boom came from those with good credit scores in the middle and top of the credit score distribution—and that these borrowers accounted for a disproportionate share of defaults47 trade imbalances and debt bubblesedit us households and financial businesses significantly increased borrowing leverage in the years leading up to the crisis the economist wrote in july 2012 that the inflow of investment dollars required to fund the us trade deficit was a major cause of the housing bubble and financial crisis the trade deficit less than 1 of gdp in the early 1990s hit 6 in 2006 that deficit was financed by inflows of foreign savings in particular from east asia and the middle east much of that money went into dodgy mortgages to buy overvalued houses and the financial crisis was the result48 in may 2008 npr explained in their peabody award winning program the giant pool of money that a vast inflow of savings from developing nations flowed into the mortgage market driving the us housing bubble this pool of fixed income savings increased from around 35 trillion in 2000 to about 70 trillion by 2008 npr explained this money came from various sources but the main headline is that all sorts of poor countries became kind of rich making things like tvs and selling us oil china india abu dhabi saudi arabia made a lot of money and banked it49 describing the crisis in europe paul krugman wrote in february 2012 that what we’re basically looking at then is a balance of payments problem in which capital flooded south after the creation of the euro leading to overvaluation in southern europe50 monetary policyedit another narrative about the origin has been focused on the respective parts played by the public monetary policy in the us notably and by the practices of private financial institutions in the us mortgage funding was unusually decentralised opaque and competitive and it is believed that competition between lenders for revenue and market share contributed to declining underwriting standards and risky lending51 while alan greenspans role as chairman of the federal reserve has been widely discussed the main point of controversy remains the lowering of the federal funds rate to 1 for more than a year which according to austrian theorists injected huge amounts of easy creditbased money into the financial system and created an unsustainable economic boom52 there is also the argument that greenspans actions in the years 2002–2004 were actually motivated by the need to take the us economy out of the early 2000s recession caused by the bursting of the dotcom bubble—although by doing so he did not help avert the crisis but only postpone it5354 high private debt levelsedit us household debt relative to disposable income and gdp another narrative focuses on high levels of private debt in the us economy usa household debt as a percentage of annual disposable personal income was 127 at the end of 2007 versus 77 in 19905556 faced with increasing mortgage payments as their adjustable rate mortgage payments increased households began to default in record numbers rendering mortgagebacked securities worthless high private debt levels also impact growth by making recessions deeper and the following recovery weaker5758 robert reich claims the amount of debt in the us economy can be traced to economic inequality assuming that middleclass wages remained stagnant while wealth concentrated at the top and households pull equity from their homes and overload on debt to maintain living standards59 the imf reported in april 2012 household debt soared in the years leading up to the downturn in advanced economies during the five years preceding 2007 the ratio of household debt to income rose by an average of 39 percentage points to 138 percent in denmark iceland ireland the netherlands and norway debt peaked at more than 200 percent of household income a surge in household debt to historic highs also occurred in emerging economies such as estonia hungary latvia and lithuania the concurrent boom in both house prices and the stock market meant that household debt relative to assets held broadly stable which masked households’ growing exposure to a sharp fall in asset prices when house prices declined ushering in the global financial crisis many households saw their wealth shrink relative to their debt and with less income and more unemployment found it harder to meet mortgage payments by the end of 2011 real house prices had fallen from their peak by about 41 in ireland 29 in iceland 23 in spain and the united states and 21 in denmark household defaults underwater mortgages where the loan balance exceeds the house value foreclosures and fire sales are now endemic to a number of economies household deleveraging by paying off debts or defaulting on them has begun in some countries it has been most pronounced in the united states where about twothirds of the debt reduction reflects defaults6061 prerecession warningsedit the onset of the economic crisis took most people by surprise a 2009 paper identifies twelve economists and commentators who between 2000 and 2006 predicted a recession based on the collapse of the thenbooming housing market in the united states62 dean baker wynne godley fred harrison michael hudson eric

ukraine and china67 us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said in mid2005 that at a minimum theres a little froth in the us housing marketits hard not to see that there are a lot of local bubbles68 the economist newspaper writing at the same time went further saying the worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history69 real estate bubbles are by definition of the word bubble followed by a price decrease also known as a housing price crash that can result in many owners holding negative equity a mortgage debt higher than the current value of the property increases in uncertaintyedit increases in uncertainty can depress investment or consumption the 2007–14 recession represents the most striking episode of heightened uncertainty since 19607071 ineffective or inappropriate regulationedit regulations encouraging lax lending standardsedit several analysts such as peter wallison and edward pinto of the american enterprise institute have asserted that private lenders were encouraged to relax lending standards by government affordable housing policies7273 they cite the housing and community development act of 1992 which initially required that 30 percent or more of fannie’s and freddie’s loan purchases be related to affordable housing the legislation gave hud the power to set future requirements and eventually under the bush administration a 56 percent minimum was established74 to fulfil the requirements fannie mae and freddie mac established programs to purchase 5 trillion in affordable housing loans75 and encouraged lenders to relax underwriting standards to produce those loans74 these critics also cite as inappropriate regulation “the national homeownership strategy partners in the american dream “strategy” which was compiled in 1995 by henry cisneros president clinton’s hud secretary in 2001 the independent research company graham fisher company stated “while the underlying initiatives of the strategy were broad in content the main theme was the relaxation of credit standards”76 the community reinvestment act cra is also identified as one of the causes of the recession by some critics they contend that lenders relaxed lending standards in an effort to meet cra commitments and they note that publicly announced cra loan commitments were massive totaling 45 trillion in the years between 1994 and 200777 however the financial crisis inquiry commission fcic concluded that fannie freddie were not a primary cause of the crisis and that cra was not a factor in the crisis35 further since housing bubbles appeared in multiple countries in europe as well the fcic republican minority dissenting report also concluded that us housing policies were not a robust explanation for a wider global housing bubble35 the view that us government housing policy was a primary cause of the crisis has been widely disputed78 with paul krugman referring to it as imaginary history79 derivativesedit author michael lewis wrote that a type of derivative called a credit default swap cds enabled speculators to stack bets on the same mortgage securities this is analogous to allowing many persons to buy insurance on the same house speculators that bought cds protection were betting that significant mortgage security defaults would occur while the sellers such as aig bet they would not an unlimited amount could be wagered on the same housingrelated securities provided buyers and sellers of the cds could be found80 when massive defaults occurred on underlying mortgage securities companies like aig that were selling cds were unable to perform their side of the obligation and defaulted us taxpayers paid over 100 billion to global financial institutions to honor aig obligations generating considerable outrage81 derivatives such as cds were unregulated or barely regulated several sources have noted the failure of the us government to supervise or even require transparency of the financial instruments known as derivatives828384 a 2008 investigative article in the washington post found that leading government officials at the time federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan treasury secretary robert rubin and sec chairman arthur levitt vehemently opposed any regulation of derivatives in 1998 brooksley e born head of the commodity futures trading commission put forth a policy paper asking for feedback from regulators lobbyists legislators on the question of whether derivatives should be reported sold through a central facility or whether capital requirements should be required of their buyers greenspan rubin and levitt pressured her to withdraw the paper and greenspan persuaded congress to pass a resolution preventing cftc from regulating derivatives for another six months — when borns term of office would expire83 ultimately it was the collapse of a specific kind of derivative the mortgagebacked security that triggered the economic crisis of 200884 shadow banking systemedit securitization markets were impaired during the crisis paul krugman wrote in 2009 that the run on the shadow banking system was the core of what happened to cause the crisis as the shadow banking system expanded to rival or even surpass conventional banking in importance politicians and government officials should have realised that they were recreating the kind of financial vulnerability that made the great depression possible – and they should have responded by extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new institutions influential figures should have proclaimed a simple rule anything that does what a bank does anything that has to be rescued in crises the way banks are should be regulated like a bank he referred to this lack of controls as malign neglect8586 during 2008 three of the largest us investment banks either went bankrupt lehman brothers or were sold at fire sale prices to other banks bear stearns and merrill lynch the investment banks were not subject to the more stringent regulations applied to depository banks these failures exacerbated the instability in the global financial system the remaining two investment banks morgan stanley and goldman sachs potentially facing failure opted to become commercial banks thereby subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation but receiving access to credit via the federal reserve8788 further american international group aig had insured mortgagebacked and other securities but was not required to maintain sufficient reserves to pay its obligations when debtors defaulted on these securities aig was contractually required to post additional collateral with many creditors and counterparties touching off controversy when over 100 billion of us taxpayer money was paid out to major global financial institutions on behalf of aig while this money was legally owed to the banks by aig under agreements made via credit default swaps purchased from aig by the institutions a number of congressmen and media members expressed outrage that taxpayer money was used to bail out banks81 economist gary gorton wrote in may 2009 unlike the historical banking panics of the 19th and early 20th centuries the current banking panic is a wholesale panic not a retail panic in the earlier episodes depositors ran to their banks and demanded cash in exchange for their checking accounts unable to meet those demands the banking system became insolvent the current panic involved financial firms “running” on other financial firms by not renewing sale and repurchase agreements repo or increasing the repo margin “haircut” forcing massive deleveraging and resulting in the banking system being insolvent89 the financial crisis inquiry commission reported in january 2011 in the early part of the 20th century we erected a series of protections – the federal reserve as a lender of last resort federal deposit insurance ample regulations – to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued america’s banking system in the 20th century yet over the past 30plus years we permitted the growth of a shadow banking system – opaque and laden with short term debt – that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system key components of the market – for example the multitrilliondollar repo lending market offbalancesheet entities and the use of overthecounter derivatives – were hidden from view without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns we had a 21stcentury financial system with 19thcentury safeguards35 systemic crisisedit the financial crisis and the recession have been described as a symptom of another deeper crisis by a number of economists for example ravi batra argues that growing inequality of financial capitalism produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major political changes9091 feminist economists ailsa mckay and margunn bjørnholt argue that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession and call for a reshaping of both the economy economic theory and the economics profession they argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics and ecological economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet92 effectsedit main article effects of the great recession effects on the united statesedit further

bankruptcies an increasing federal debt inflation and rising petroleum and food prices a 2011 poll found that more than half of all americans thought that the us was still in recession or even depression although economic data showed a historically modest recovery93 this could have been because both private and public levels of debt were at historic highs in the us and in many other countries94959697 real gross domestic product gdp began contracting in the third quarter of 2008 and did not return to growth until q1 201098 cbo estimated in february 2013 that real us gdp remained only a little over 45 percent above its previous peak or about 850 billion cbo projected that gdp would not return to its potential level until 201799 in 2009 the us gdp was at 144 trillion by the final quarter of 2014 the us gdp had grown by 186 equal to 177 trillion canada the united states largest trading partner by then had a gdp of 137 trillion in 2009 but by 2014 reached 2 trillion growing by over 31 both countries now have the fastest growing economies within the g8 and g20 and both countries has increased daily trade with each other from 15 billion in 2011 to 4 billion in 2014 equating to over 13 trillion in annual trade the unemployment rate rose from 5 in 2008 precrisis to 10 by late 2009 then steadily declined to 73 by march 2013100 the number of unemployed rose from approximately 7 million in 2008 precrisis to 15 million by 2009 then declined to 12 million by early 2013101 residential private investment mainly housing fell from its 2006 precrisis peak of 800 billion to 400 billion by mid2009 and has remained depressed at that level nonresidential investment mainly business purchases of capital equipment peaked at 1700 billion in 2008 precrisis and fell to 1300 billion in 2010 but by early 2013 had nearly recovered to this peak102 housing prices fell approximately 30 on average from their mid2006 peak to mid2009 and remained at approximately that level as of march 2013103 stock market prices as measured by the sp 500 index fell 57 from their october 2007 peak of 1565 to a trough of 676 in march 2009 stock prices began a steady climb thereafter and returned to record levels by april 2013104 the net worth of us households and nonprofit organisations fell from a peak of approximately 67 trillion in 2007 to a trough of 52 trillion in 2009 a decline of 15 trillion or 22 it began to recover thereafter and was 66 trillion by q3 2012105 us total national debt rose from 66 gdp in 2008 precrisis to over 103 by the end of 2012106 for the majority income levels have dropped substantially with the median male worker making 32137 in 2010 and an inflationadjusted income of 32844 in 1968107 the recession of 2007–2009 is considered to be the worst economic downturn since the great depression108 and the subsequent economic recovery one of the weakest the weak economic performance since 2000 has seen the percentage of working age adults actually employed drop from 64 to 58 a number last seen in 1984 with most of that drop occurring since 2007109 approximately 54 million people have been added to federal disability rolls as discouraged workers give up looking for work and take advantage of the federal program110 the united states has seen an increasing concentration of wealth to the detriment of the middle class and the poor with the younger generations being especially affected111 the middle class dropped from 61 of the population in 1971 to 51 in 2011 as the upper class increased its take of the national income from 29 in 1970 to 46 in 2010 the share for the middle class dropped to 45 down from 62 while total income for the poor dropped to 9 from 10 since the number of poor increased during this period the smaller piece of the pie down to 9 from 10 is spread over a greater portion of the population112 the portion of national wealth owned by the middle class and poor has also dropped as their portion of the national income has dropped making it more difficult to accumulate wealth the younger generation which would be just starting their wealth accumulation has been the most hard hit those under 35 are 68 less wealthy than they were in 1984 while those over 55 are 10 wealthier113 much of this concentration has happened since the start of the great recession in 2009 the wealthiest 20 of households controlled 872 of all wealth up from 850 in 2007 the top 1 controlled 356 of all wealth up from 346 in 2007114 the share of the bottom 80 fell from 15 to 128 dropping 15 inflationadjusted median household income in the united states peaked in 1999 at 53252 at the peak of the internet stock bubble dropped to 51174 in 2004 went up to 52823 in 2007 at the peak of the housing bubble and has since trended downward to 49445 in 2010 the last time median household income was at this level was in 1996 at 49112 indicating that the recession of the early 2000s and the 2008–2012 global recession wiped out all middle class income gains for the last 15 years115 this income drop has caused a dramaticcitation needed rise in people living under the poverty level and has hit suburbia particularly hard between 2000 and 2010 the number of suburban households below the poverty line increased by 53 percent compared to a 23 percent increase in poor households in urban areas116 a 2011 poll found that more than half of all americans think the us is still in recession or even depression despite official data that shows a historically modest recovery117 in 2013 the census bureau defined poverty rate decreased to roughly 145 of the population118 as late as 2014 and early 2015 a majority of americans still believed that the nation remained in a recession119 such perceptions have been cited as a partial factor in the rise of donald trump as presidential candidate in 2016 and later the 45th president of the united states120121122123124 effects on europeedit further information european debt crisis and

2008–2012125 the crisis in europe generally progressed from banking system crises to sovereign debt crises as many countries elected to bailout their banking systems using taxpayer moneycitation needed greece was different in that it faced large public debts rather than problems within its banking system several countries received bailout packages from the troika european commission european central bank international monetary fund which also implemented a series of emergency measures many european countries embarked on austerity programs reducing their budget deficits relative to gdp from 2010 to 2011 for example according to the cia world factbook greece improved its budget deficit from 104 gdp in 2010 to 96 in 2011 iceland italy ireland portugal france and spain also improved their budget deficits from 2010 to 2011 relative to gdp126127 however with the exception of germany each of these countries had publicdebttogdp ratios that increased ie worsened from 2010 to 2011 as indicated in the chart at right greeces publicdebttogdp ratio increased from 143 in 2010 to 165 in 2011126 to 185 in 2014 this indicates that despite improving budget deficits gdp growth was not sufficient to support a decline improvement in the debttogdp ratio for these countries during this period eurostat reported that the debt to gdp ratio for the 17 euro area countries together was 701 in 2008 799 in 2009 853 in 2010 and 872 in 2011127128 according to the cia world factbook from 2010 to 2011 the unemployment rates in spain greece italy ireland portugal and the uk increased france had no significant changes while in germany and iceland the unemployment rate declined126 eurostat reported that eurozone unemployment reached record levels in september 2012 at 116 up from 103 the prior year unemployment varied significantly by country129 economist martin wolf analysed the relationship between cumulative gdp growth from 20082012 and total reduction in budget deficits due to austerity policies see chart at right in several european countries during april 2012 he concluded that in all there is no evidence here that large fiscal contractions budget deficit reductions bring benefits to confidence and growth that offset the direct effects of the contractions they bring exactly what one would expect small contractions bring recessions and big contractions bring depressions changes in budget balances deficits or surpluses explained approximately 53 of the change in gdp according to the equation derived from the imf data used in his analysis125 economist paul krugman analysed the relationship between gdp and reduction in budget deficits for several european countries in april 2012 and concluded that austerity was slowing growth similar to martin wolf he also wrote
