motowns cultural impact into the 60s i was still not of a frame of mind that we were not only making music we were making history but i did recognize the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time i recognized the bridges that we crossed the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music i recognized that because i lived it i would come to the south in the

records all as separate entities14 motown would then begin serving as a subsidiary of capitol records15 motown soundedit it has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled motown sound discuss march 2016 motown specialized in a type of soul music it referred to with the trademark the motown sound crafted with an ear towards pop appeal the motown sound typically used tambourines to accent the back beat prominent and often melodic electric bassguitar lines distinctive melodic and chord structures and a callandresponse singing style that originated in gospel music in 1971 jon landau wrote in rolling stone that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies along with a fourbeat drum pattern regular use of horns and strings and a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing boosting the high range frequencies to give the overall product a distinctive sound particularly effective for broadcast over am radio16 pop production techniques such as the use of orchestral string sections charted horn sections and carefully arranged background vocals were also used complex arrangements and elaborate melismatic vocal riffs were avoided17 motown producers believed steadfastly in the kiss principle keep it simple stupid18 despite the growth of popular music being written and performed by black artists the songs would not become popular or recognized unless the music was being performed by white performers however the motown sound became distinctly unique making it impossible for white performers to replicate its sound the real motown sound became more favorable than the altered renditions19 the motown production process has been described as factorylike the hitsville studios remained open and active 22 hours a day and artists would often go on tour for weeks come back to detroit to record as many songs as possible and then promptly go on tour again berry gordy held quality control meetings every friday morning and used veto power to ensure that only the very best material and performances would be released the test was that every new release needed to fit into a sequence of the top five selling pop singles of the week several tracks that later became critical and commercial favorites were initially rejected by gordy the two most notable being the marvin gaye songs i heard it through the grapevine and whats going on in several cases producers would rework tracks in hopes of eventually getting them approved at a later friday morning meeting as producer norman whitfield did with i heard it through the grapevine and the temptations aint too proud to beg many of motowns bestknown songs including all the early hits for the supremes were written by the songwriting trio of holland–dozier–holland lamont dozier and brothers brian and eddie holland other important motown producers and songwriters included norman whitfield william mickey stevenson smokey robinson barrett strong nickolas ashford valerie simpson frank wilson pamela sawyer gloria jones james dean william weatherspoon johnny bristol harvey fuqua gil askey20 stevie wonder and gordy himself the style created by the motown musicians was a major influence on several nonmotown artists of the mid1960s such as dusty springfield and the foundations in the united kingdom the motown sound became the basis of the northern soul movement smokey robinson said the motown sound had little to do with detroit people would listen to it and theyd say aha they use more bass or they use more drums bullshit when we were first successful with it people were coming from germany france italy mobile alabama from new york chicago california from everywhere just to record in detroit they figured it was in the air that if they came to detroit and recorded on the freeway theyd get the motown sound listen the motown sound to me is not an audible sound its spiritual and it comes from the people that make it happen what other people didnt realize is that we just had one studio there but we recorded in chicago nashville new york la—almost every big city and we still got the sound21 the funk brothersedit main article the funk brothers in addition to the songwriting process of the writers and producers one of the major factors in the widespread appeal of motowns music was gordys practice of using a highly select and tightknit group of studio musicians collectively known as the funk brothers to record the instrumental or band tracks of a majority of motown recordings among the studio musicians responsible for the motown sound were keyboardists earl van dyke johnny griffith and joe hunter guitarists joe messina robert white and eddie willis percussionists eddie bongo brown and jack ashford drummers benny benjamin uriel jones and richard pistol allen and bassists james jamerson and bob babbitt the bands career and work is chronicled in the 2002 documentary film standing in the shadows of motown which publicised the fact that these musicians played on more numberone records than the beatles elvis the rolling stones and the beach boys combined22 much of the motown sound came from the use of overdubbed and duplicated instrumentation motown songs regularly featured two drummers instead of one either overdubbed or in unison as well as three or four guitar lines22 bassist james jamerson often played his instrument with only the index finger of his right hand and created many of the basslines apparent on motown songs such as up the ladder to the roof by the supremes22 artist developmentedit artist development was a major part of motowns operations instituted by berry gordy the acts on the motown label were fastidiously groomed dressed and choreographed for live performances motown artists were advised that their breakthrough into the white popular music market made them ambassadors for other africanamerican artists seeking broad market acceptance and that they should think act walk and talk like royalty so as to alter the lessthandignified image commonly held of black musicians by white americans in that era23 given that many of the talented young artists had been raised in housing projects and lacked the necessary social and dress experience this motown department was not only necessary it created an elegant style of presentation long associated with the label24 the artist development department specialized primarily in working with younger less experienced acts experienced performers such as jr walker and marvin gaye were exempt from artist development classes many of the young artists participated in an annual package tour called the motortown revue which was popular first on the chitlin circuit and later around the world the tours gave the younger artists a chance to hone their performance and social skills and learn from the more experienced artists motown subsidiary labelsedit in order to avoid accusations of payola should djs play too many records from the original tamla label gordy formed motown records as a second label in 1959 the two labels featured the same writers producers and artists many more subsidiary labels were established later under the umbrella of the motown parent company including gordy records soul records and vip records in reality the motown record corporation controlled all of these labels most of the distinctions between motown labels were largely arbitrary with the same writers producers and musicians working on all the major subsidiaries and artists were often shuffled between labels for internal marketing reasons all of these records are usually considered to be motown records regardless of whether they actually appeared on the motown records label itself major divisionsedit tamla records established 1959 tamla was a primary subsidiary for mainstream rbsoul music tamla is actually the companys original label gordy founded tamla records several months before
