october 2017 learn how and when to remove this template message the internet archive launched the wayback machine in october 200145 it was set up by brewster kahle and bruce gilliat and is maintained with content from alexa internetcitation needed the service enables users to see archived versions of web pages across time which the archive calls a three dimensional indexcitation needed since 1996 the wayback machine has been archiving cached pages of websites onto its large cluster of linux nodescitation needed it revisits sites on occasion see technical details below and archives a new version6 sites can also be captured on the fly by visitors who enter the sites url into a search boxcitation needed the intent is to capture and archive content that otherwise would be lost whenever a site is changed or closed downcitation needed the overall vision of the machines creators is to archive the entire internetcitation needed information had been kept on digital tape for five years with kahle occasionally allowing researchers and scientists to tap into the clunky database7 when the archive reached its fifth anniversary in 2001 it was unveiled and opened to the public in a ceremony at the university of california berkeley8 the name wayback machine was chosen as a reference to the wabac machine pronounced wayback a timetraveling device used by the characters mr peabody and sherman in the rocky and bullwinkle show an animated cartoon910 in one of the animated cartoons component segments peabodys improbable history the characters routinely used the machine to witness participate in and more often than not alter famous events in historycitation needed technical detailsedit software has been developed to crawl the web and download all publicly accessible world wide web pages the gopher hierarchy the netnews usenet bulletin board system and downloadable software11 the information collected by these crawlers does not include all the information available on the internet since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible to overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites archiveitorg was developed in 2005 by the internet archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives12 crawl are contributed from various sources some imported from third parties and others generated internally by the archive6 for example crawls are contributed by the sloan foundation and alexa crawls run by ia on behalf of nara and the internet memory foundation mirrors of common crawl6 the worldwide web crawls have been running since 2010 and capture the global web136 the frequency of snapshot captures varies per website6 websites in the worldwide web crawls are included in a crawl list with the site archived once per crawl6 a crawl can take months or even years to complete depending on size6 for example wide crawl number 13 started on january 9 2015 and completed on july 11 201614 however there may be multiple crawls ongoing at any one time and a site might be included in more than one crawl list so how often a site is crawled varies widely6 storage capabilitiesedit as of 2009update the wayback machine contained approximately three petabytes of data and was growing at a rate of 100 terabytes each month15 the growth rate reported in 2003 was 12 terabytesmonth the data is stored on petabox rack systems manufactured by capricorn technologies16 in 2009 the internet archive migrated its customized storage architecture to sun open storage and hosts a new data center in a sun modular datacenter on sun microsystems california campus17 in 2011 a new improved version of the wayback machine with an updated interface and fresher index of archived content was made available for public testing18 in march 2011 it was said on the wayback machine forum that the beta of the new wayback machine has a more complete and uptodate index of all crawled materials into 2010 and will continue to be updated regularly the index driving the classic wayback machine only has a little bit of material past 2008 and no further index updates are planned as it will be phased out this year19 in january 2013 the company announced a groundbreaking milestone of 240 billion urls20 in october 2013 the company announced the save a page feature21 which allows any internet user to archive the contents of a url this became a threat of abuse by the service for hosting malicious binaries2223 as of december 2014update the wayback machine contained almost nine petabytes of data and was growing at a rate of about 20 terabytes each week24 as of july 2016update the wayback machine reportedly contained around 15 petabytes of data25 growthedit between october 2013 and march 2015 the websites global alexa rank changed from 16226 to 20827 wayback machine growth2829303132333435363738 year pages archived billion 2005 40 2008 85 2012 150 2013 373 2014 400 2015 452 website exclusion policyedit historically wayback machine respected the robots exclusion standard robotstxt in determining if a website would be crawled or not or if already crawled if its archives would be publicly viewable website owners had the option to optout of wayback machine through the use of robotstxt it applied robotstxt rules retroactively if a site blocked the internet archive any previously archived pages from the domain were immediately rendered unavailable as well in addition the internet archive stated sometimes a website owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site we comply with these requests39 in addition the website says the internet archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection40 oakland archive policyedit waybacks retroactive exclusion policy is based in part upon recommendations for managing removal requests and preserving archival integrity published by the school of information management and systems at university of california berkeley in 2002 which gives a website owner the right block access to the sites archives 41 wayback has complied with this policy to help avoid expensive litigation42 the wayback retroactive exclusion policy began to relax in 2017 when it stopped honoring robotstxt on us government and military web sites for both crawling and displaying web pages as of april 2017 wayback is exploring ignoring robotstxt more broadly not just for us government websites43444546 usesedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it may 2017 the site is frequently used by journalists and citizens to review dead websites dated news reports or changes to website contents its content has been used to hold politicians accountable and expose battlefield lies47 in 2014 an archived social media page of separatist rebel leader in ukraine igor girkin showed him boasting about his troops having shot down a suspected ukrainian military airplane before it became known that the plane actually was a civilian malaysian airlines jet after which he deleted the post and blamed ukraines military4748 in 2017 the march for science originated from a discussion on reddit that indicated someone had visited archiveorg and discovered that all references to climate change had been deleted from the white house website in response a user commented there needs to be a scientists march on washington495051 furthermore the site is used heavily for verification providing access to references and content creation by wikipedia editorscitation needed in legal evidenceedit civil litigationedit netbula llc v chordiant software incedit in a 2009 case netbula llc v chordiant software inc defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the robotstxt file on its website that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from netbulas site pages that chordiant believed would support its case52 netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter netbulas website and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly53 an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting chordiants motion however stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means without considerable burden expense and disruption to its operations52 magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california san jose division rejected netbulas arguments and ordered them to disable the robotstxt blockage temporarily in order to allow chordiant to retrieve the archived pages that they sought52 telewizja polskaedit in an october 2004 case telewizja polska usa inc v echostar satellite no 02 c 3293 65 fed r evid serv 673 nd ill oct 15 2004 a litigant attempted to use the wayback machine archives as a source of admissible evidence perhaps for the first time telewizja polska is the provider of tvp polonia and echostar operates the dish network prior to the trial proceedings echostar indicated that it intended to offer wayback machine snapshots as proof of the past content of telewizja polskas website telewizja polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source but magistrate judge arlander keys rejected telewizja polskas assertion of hearsay and denied tvps motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial5455 at the trial however district court judge ronald guzman the trial judge overruled magistrate keys findingscitation needed and held that neither the affidavit of the internet archive employee nor the underlying pages ie the telewizja polska website were admissible as evidence judge guzman reasoned that the employees affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements and the purported web page printouts were not selfauthenticatingcitation needed patent lawedit main article internet as a source of prior art provided some additional requirements are met eg providing an authoritative statement of the archivist the united states patent office and the european patent office will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application56 limitations of utilityedit there are technical limitations to archiving a website and as a consequence it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by website archives this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints answers or expert witness reports when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore can contain errors for example archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore do not include the contents of nonrestful ecommerce databases in their archives57 legal statusedit in europe the wayback machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated so the archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator58 the exclusion policies for the wayback machine may be found in the faq section of the site59 archived content legal issuesedit a number of cases have been brought against the internet archive specifically for its wayback machine archiving efforts scientologyedit see also scientology and the internet in late 2002 the internet archive removed various sites that were critical of scientology from the wayback machine60 an error message stated that this was in response to a request by the site owner61 later it was clarified that lawyers from the church of scientology had demanded the removal and that the site owners did not want their material removed62 healthcare advocates incedit in 2003 harding earley follmer frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the archives wayback machine the attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid based on the content of their website from several years prior the plaintiff healthcare advocates then amended their complaint to include the internet archive accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the dmca and the computer fraud and abuse act healthcare advocates claimed that since they had installed a robotstxt file on their website even if after the initial lawsuit was filed the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the wayback machine however some material continued to be publicly visible on wayback63 the lawsuit was settled out of court after wayback fixed the problem64 suzanne shelledit in december 2005 activist suzanne shell filed suit demanding internet archive pay her us 100000 for archiving her website profanejusticeorg between 1999 and 20046566 internet archive filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of california on january 20 2006 seeking a judicial determination that internet archive did not violate shells copyright shell responded and brought a countersuit against internet archive for archiving her site which she alleges is in violation of her terms of service67 on february 13 2007 a judge for the united states district court for the district of colorado dismissed all counterclaims except breach of contract66 the internet archive did not move to dismiss copyright infringement claims shell asserted arising out of its copying activities which would also go forward68 on april 25 2007 internet archive and suzanne shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit65 the internet archive said it has no interest in including materials in the wayback machine of persons who do not wish to have their web content archived we recognize that ms shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her web site and we regret that the inclusion of her web site in the wayback machine resulted in this litigation shell said i respect the historical value of internet archives goal i never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm69 daniel davydiukedit in 2013–16 a pornographic actor tried to remove archived images of himself from the wayback machines archive first by sending multiple dmca requests to the archive and then by appealing to the federal court of canada707172 censorship and other threatsedit archiveorg is currently blocked in china7374 after the site enabled the encrypted https protocol the internet archive was blocked in its entirety in russia in 2015757647needs update alison macrina director of the library freedom project notes that while librarians deeply value individual privacy we also strongly oppose censorship47 there are known rare cases where online access to content which for nothing has put people in danger was disabled47 other threats include natural disasters77 destruction remote or physicalcitation needed manipulation of the archives contents see also cyberattack backup problematic copyright laws78 and surveillance of the sites users79 kevin vaughan suspects that in the longterm of multiple generations next to nothing will survive in a useful way besides if we have continuity in our technological civilization by which a lot of the bare data will remain findable and searchable80 some find the internet archive which describes itself to be built for the longterm81 to be working furiously to
