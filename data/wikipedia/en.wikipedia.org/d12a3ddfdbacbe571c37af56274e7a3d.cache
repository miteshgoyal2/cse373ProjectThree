sometimes shortened to paleocon is a conservative political philosophy stressing tradition limited government and civil society along with religious regional national and western identity12 according to international relations scholar michael foley paleoconservatives press for restrictions on immigration a rollback of multicultural programmes the decentralization of the federal policy the restoration of controls upon free trade a greater emphasis upon economic nationalism and noninterventionism in the conduct of american foreign policy and a generally revanchist outlook upon a social order in need of recovering old lines of distinction and in particular the assignment of roles in accordance with traditional categories of gender ethnicity and race3 practitioners of this philosophy identify themselves as the legitimate heirs to the american conservative tradition14 pat buchanan was strongly influenced by the rockford institutes chronicles a magazine of american culture5 and helped create another paleocon publication the american conservative67 paleoconservativisms concerns overlap those of the old right that opposed the new deal in the 1930s and 1940s8 as well as american social conservatism of the late 20th century expressed for example in the book single issues by joseph sobran elizabethtown college professor paul gottfried is credited with coining the term in the 1980s9 he says the term originally referred to various americans such as conservative and traditionalist catholics and agrarian southerners who turned to anticommunism during the cold war5

the greek root palaeo meaning ancient or old it is somewhat tongueincheek and refers to the paleocons claim to represent a more historic authentic conservative tradition than that found in neoconservatism adherents of paleoconservatism often describe themselves simply as paleo rich lowry of national review claims the prefix is designed to obscure the fact that it is a recent ideological creation of postcold war politics10 the paleoconservatives use the term conservative somewhat differently from some us opponents of leftism paleocons may reject attempts by rush limbaugh and others to graft shortterm policy goals—such as school choice enterprise zones and faithbased initiatives—into the core of conservatism this is mainly due to the paleoconservatives desire to see these incorporated as longterm institutional goals rather than shortterm victories for the movement itself in this way paleocons are generally regarded as taking the long view toward us conservatism willing to suffer temporary setbacks while never taking their aim off the goal of establishing the primacy of conservative thought into us politics11 moreover samuel t francis thomas fleming and some other paleocons deemphasized the conservative part of the paleoconservative label saying that they do not want the status quo preserved1213 fleming and paul gottfried called such thinking stupid tenacity and described it as a series of trenches dug in defense of last years revolution14 francis defined authentic conservatism as the survival and enhancement of a particular people and its institutionalized cultural expressions15 he said of the paleoconservative movement what paleoconservatism tries to tell americans is that the dominant forces in their society are no longer committed to conserving the traditions institutions and values that created and formed it and therefore that those who are really conservative in any serious sense and wish to live under those traditions institutions and values need to oppose the dominant forces and form new ones16 the earliest mention of the word paleoconservative listed in nexis17 is an article by j patrick lewis in the october 20 1984 issue of the nation referring to academic economists who allegedly work to redefine poverty18 the american heritage dictionary fourth edition lists a generic informal use of the term meaning extremely or stubbornly conservative in political matters outside of the united states the word is sometimes spelled palaeoconservative19 conservative heritageedit many paleoconservatives identify themselves as classical conservatives and trace their philosophy to the old right republicans of the interwar period20 which influenced the us not to join the league of nations reduce immigration with the passage of the immigration act of 1924 and oppose franklin roosevelt they often look back even further to edmund burke as well as the antifederalist movement that stretched from the days of thomas jefferson to john c calhoun21 just as paleoconservatives noninterventionism stems from their skepticism as to what extent—if at all—european culture can be transplanted or forced upon nonwestern cultures paleoconservatives opposition to immigration is rooted in their skepticism of the ability of nonwestern peoples to adopt european culture22 as a result paleocons are most distinctive in their emphatic opposition to open immigration by noneuropeans and their general disapproval of us intervention overseas sam francis wrote we believe that the united states derives from and is an integral part of european civilization and the european people and that the american people and government should remain european in their composition and character we therefore oppose the massive immigration of noneuropean and nonwestern peoples into the united states that threatens to transform our nation into a noneuropean majority in our lifetime we believe that illegal immigration must be stopped if necessary by military force and placing troops on our national borders that illegal aliens must be returned to their own countries and that legal immigration must be severely restricted or halted through appropriate changes in our laws and policies23 they are also strongly critical of neoconservatives and their sympathizers in print media talk radio and cable tv news24 paleocons often say they are not conservatives in the sense that they necessarily wish to preserve existing institutions or seek merely to slow the growth of modern biggovernment conservatism25 they do not wish to be closely identified with the us republican party24 rather they seek the renewal of small r republican society in the context of the western heritage customs and civilization26 author joseph scotchie wrote republics mind their own business their governments have very limited powers and their people are too busy practicing selfgovernment to worry about problems in other countries empires not only bully smaller defenseless nations they also cant leave their own hapless subjects alone empires and small government arent compatible either27 by contrast paleocons see neoconservatives as empirebuilders and themselves as defenders of the republic pointing to rome as an example of how an ongoing campaign of military expansionism can destroy a republic28 on some issues many paleocons are hard to distinguish from others on the conservative spectrum for example they tend to oppose abortion on demand29 and gay marriage3031 while supporting capital punishment32 handgun ownership33 and an original intent reading of the us constitution34 on the other hand paleocons are often more sympathetic to environmental protection35 animal welfare36 and anticonsumerism37 than others on the us right human nature tradition and reasonedit paleoconservatives argue that since human nature is limited and finite any attempt to create a manmade utopia is headed for disaster and potential carnage instead they lean toward tradition family customs religious institutions and classical learning to provide wisdom and guidance38 thomas fleming stated this opposition to abstract ideals in a way that critic david brooks called a startling crescendo among the most dangerous of our theoretical illusions are the political fantasies that can be summed up in words like democracy equality and natural rights the principle of one man one vote and the american tradition of selfgovernment no one who lives in the world with his eyes open can actually believe in any of this39 historian w wesley mcdonald explains the opposition to ideology this way in a humane social order a community of spirit is fostered in which generations are bound together according to russell kirk this link is achieved through moral and social norms that transcend the particularities of time and place and because they form the basis of genuine civilized existence can only be neglected at great peril these norms reflected in religious dogmas traditions humane letters social habit and custom and prescriptive institutions create the sources of the true community that is the final end of politics40 along these lines joseph sobran in his pensees argues that western civilization relies on civility at the center of the society civility is the relationship among citizens in a republic it corresponds to the condition we call freedom which is not just an absence of restraint or coercion but the security of living under commonly recognized rules of conduct not all these rules are enforced by the state legal institutions of civility depend on the ethical substratum and collapse when it is absent and in fact the colloquial sense of civility as good manners is relevant to its political meaning citizens typically deal with each other by consent and they have to say please and thank you to each other41 certain paleoconservatives say that tradition is a better guide than reason for example mel bradford wrote that certain questions are settled before any serious deliberation concerning a preferred course of conduct may begin this ethic is based in a culture of families linked by friendship common enemies and common projects so a good conservative keeps a clear sense of what southern grandmothers have always meant in admonishing children we dont do that42 thomas fleming calls tradition a body of wisdom and truth and a set of attitudes and behavior handed down from one generation to another it is our parents respect for their grandfathers that we reflect when we refuse to think ourselves wiser than our ancestors and do not presume to condemn their shortcomings by following tradition joseph sobran said that society can maintain continuity with the past through words rituals records commemorations and laws there is no question of resisting change the only question is what can and should be salvaged from devouring time conservation is a labor not indolence and it takes discrimination to identify and save a few strands of tradition in the incessant flow of mutability in fact conservation is so hard that it could never be achieved by sheer conscious effort most of it has to be done by habit as when we speak in such a way as to make ourselves understood by others without their having to consult a dictionary and thereby give a little permanence to the kind of tradition that is a language41 furthermore james kalb argues that tradition succeeds where ideology fails because it includes habits and attitudes about things that are hard to articulate rationally many aspects of social life resist clear definition so technocratic approaches to social policy deserve suspicion our knowledge is partial and attained with difficulty the effects of political proposals are difficult to predict and as the proposals become more ambitious their effects become incalculable we cant evaluate political ideas without accepting far more beliefs presumptions and attitudes than we could possibly judge critically43 concrete rootsedit many paleocons also say that westerners have lost touch with their classical and european heritage to the point that they are in danger of losing their civilization44 robert s griffin notes that paleocons fear the united states becoming a secularized homogenized deeuropeanized pacified deluded manipulated lowestcommondenominatorleveled popularculturedopified country45 the decadence of a civilization by loss of faith and vigour can be observed more than once in history what is extraordinary about the american situation is the stupidity the romans such is my impression did not become stupid and incompetent with their decadence americans have not lost faith in their cultural inheritance—they have been entirely separated from it how this happened is one of the few topics still worth exploring in this twilight46 paleocons tend to dislike abstract principles presented without connection to concrete roots like religion heritage or traditional institutions this distaste for universalism includes the doctrinal conclusions by socialists neothomists and straussians for example mel bradford wrote in a better guide than reason citing michael oakeshott that the only freedom which can last is a freedom embodied somewhere rooted in a history located in space sanctioned by genealogy and blessed by a religious establishment the only equality which abstract rights insisted upon outside the context of politics are likely to provide is the equality of universal slavery it is a lesson which western man is only now beginning to learn47 some paleocons also profess a conservative valuecentered historicism which gottfried defines as the belief that historical circumstances set values this is distinguished from nihilism postmodernism and moral relativism samuel francis argued that this position is a burkean appeal to tradition48 for example edmund burke wrote in his reflections on the revolution in france i cannot stand forward and give praise or blame to anything which relates to human actions and human concerns on a simple view of the object as it stands stripped of every relation in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction circumstances which with some gentlemen pass for nothing give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing color and discriminating effect the circumstances are what render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind49 claes ryn says that life has an enduring purpose but one that manifests itself differently as individuals and circumstances are different50 he writes for the conservative the universal imperative that binds human beings does not announce its purpose in simple declaratory statements how then does one discern its demands sometimes only with difficulty only through effort can the good or true or beautiful be discovered and they must be realized differently in different historical circumstances the same universal values have diverse manifestations some of the concrete instantiations of universality take us by surprise because there is no simple roadmap to good human beings need freedom and imagination to find it universality has nothing to do with uniformity51 antifederalismedit antifederalism is another key aspect of paleoconservatism which adherents see as an antitype to the managerial state the paleocon flavor urges honoring the principle of subsidiarity that is decentralized government local rule private property and minimal bureaucracy52 in an international context this view would be known as federalism and paleocons often look to john c calhoun for inspiration53 as to the role of statecraft in society thomas fleming says it should not be confused with soulcraft he gives his summary of the paleocon position our basic position on the state has always been twofold 1 a recognition that man is a social and political animal who cannot be treated as an individual without doing damage to human nature in this sense libertarian theory is as wrong and as potentially harmful as communism the commonwealth is therefore a natural and necessary expression of human nature that provides for the fulfillment of human needs and 2 the modern state is a cancerous form of polity that has metastasized and poisoned the natural institutions from which the state derives all legitimacy—family church corporation in the broadest sense and neighborhood thus it is almost always a mistake to try to use the modern state to accomplish moral or social ends54 russell kirk for example argued that most government tasks should be performed at the local or state level this is intended to ward off centralization and protect community sentiment by putting the decisionmaking power closer to the populace he rooted this in the christian notion of original sin since humanity is flawed society should not put too much power in a few hands gerald j russello concluded that this involved a different way of thinking about government one based on an understanding of political society as beginning in place and sentiment which in turn supports written laws55 this antifederalism extends to culture too in general this means that different regional groups should be able to maintain their own distinct identity for example thomas fleming and michael hill argue that the american south and every other region have the right to preserve their authentic cultural traditions and demand the same respect from others in their southern context they call on citizens to take control of their own governments their own institutions their own culture their own communities and their own lives and wean themselves from dependence on federal largesse they say that a concern for states rights local selfgovernment and regional identity used to be taken for granted everywhere in america but the united states is no longer as it once was a federal union of diverse states and regions national uniformity is being imposed by the political class that runs washington the economic class that owns wall street and the cultural class in charge of hollywood and the ivy league56 in a similar fashion pat buchanan argued during the 1996 campaign that the social welfare should be left to the control of individual states he also called for abolishing the us department of education and handing decisionmaking over to parents teachers and districts controversies such as evolution busing and curriculum standards would be settled on a local basis57 in addition he opposed a 1998 puerto rican statehood plan on the grounds that the island would be ripped from its cultural and linguistic roots let puerto rico remain puerto rico and let the united states remain the united states and not try to absorb assimilate and americanize a people whose hearts will forever belong to that island58 familyedit paleocons often argue that modern managerial society is a threat to stable families allan c carlson former president of the rockford institute argues that the family is the natural and fundamental social unit inscribed in our nature as human beings rooted in marriage rooted in the commitment to bring new life into the world and rooted in a deep respect for both ancestors and posterity59 he calls this a universal rule of human nature true for westerners and nonwesterners alike he also argues that happiness comes through natural family bonds and that the future of any nation shall be by way of the family60 he defines family as a man and a woman living in a socially sanctioned bond called marriage for the purposes of propagating and rearing children sharing intimacy and resources and conserving lineage property and tradition61 to be human is to be familial any significant departure from the family rooted in stable marriage the welcoming of children and respect for ancestors and posterity—any deviation from this social structure makes us in a way less human that is i think it fair to say the true message of modern science59 joseph sobran picks up this same theme saying that heterosexual marriage is hardcoded into human nature even the pope can’t change the nature of marriage it existed by necessity of human nature long before jesus or even abraham this has nothing to do with mere disapproval of sodomy even societies that were indifferent to sodomy saw no reason to treat samesex domestic partnerships as marriages why not because such unions don’t produce children to put it as unromantically as possible people who have children should be stuck with each other sharing the responsibility62 paleocons also question the validity of gender feminism in similar ways some questioning feminism in both its radical and moderate forms they say that the push for total gender equality dehumanizes both men and women damaging the nuclear family and sacralizing abortion certain attitudes toward feminism also create room for the managerial state to try engineering sexual equality gottfried described this position which was influenced by scholar allan carlson thus the change of womens role from being primarily mothers to selfdefined professionals has been a social disaster that continues to take its toll on the family rather than being the culminating point of western christian gentility the movement of women into commerce and politics may be seen as exactly the opposite the descent by increasingly disconnected individuals into social chaos63 postfamily orderedit allan c carlson says that we live in a postfamily order in which elites no longer accept the centrality of family life6465 in response he calls for a proactive social conservatism that seeks real alternatives to the centralized ‘corporate state’ that are compatible with liberty and family life he argues that there is a permanent tension between the family and individualist industrialized society66 he says the modern abstract state too often sees the family as its principal rival and tries to suppress it it can also hurt family living by the unintended consequences of public policy with good intentions66 he also chides us republicans for consistently favoring wall street over main street67 as an alternative to the abstract state carlson argues the state must recognize that men and women are different in reproductive economic and social functions even though they share political and property rights61 he says that churches and other religious bodies must step in and help rebuild familycentered communities66 as for common people he says men and women are both called home to rebuild families with an inner sanctity to relearn the authentic meanings of the ancient words husbandry and housewifery and to exercise the natural family functions of education the care of the weak charity and a common economic life66 carlson argues that the familys greatest challenge in the early 21st century comes from what he calls soft totalitarianisms which are packaged around a militant secular individualism but still seeking to build a marriagefree postfamily order68 this includes samesex marriage the lefts association of family values with abortion69 and equity feminism61 samuel t francis uses similar ideas to argue that society should regulate sexual behavior specifically laws against sodomy and gays in the military70 polemicsedit other contemporary luminaries include donald livingston a professor of philosophy at emory and corresponding editor for chronicles71 paul craig roberts an attorney and former reagan administration treasury official commentator joseph sobran died 2010 a columnist and contributing editor for chronicles71 novelist and essayist chilton williamson senior editor for books at chronicles71 classicist thomas fleming editor of chronicles72 and historian clyde n wilson longtime contributing editor for chronicles71 another prominent paleoconservative theodore pappas73 is the current executive editor of encyclopædia britannica74 the movement combines disparate people and ideas that might seem incompatible in another context75 such diversity of thought echoes the paleo opposition to ideology and political rationalism reflecting the influence of thinkers like russell kirk76 and michael oakeshott77 pat buchanan argues that a good politician must defend the moral order rooted in the old and new testament and natural law—and that the deepest problems in our society are not economic or political but moral78 on the other hand samuel francis complained that the religious right focuses on certain social issues and neglects other civilizational crises79 kirkian legacyedit russell kirk 1914–94 is a key figure in paleoconservatism in that several of his books present an outline of a pervasive angloamerican conservative tradition that exists despite many other distinctions his own career stretched long enough to for him to defend robert a taft in the 1950s write for national review during the cold war criticize neoconservatism in the 1980s and give speeches supporting buchanan in 1992 one neoconservative writer dan himmelfarb even refers to kirks the conservative mind as the seminal work of paleoconservatism even though it was first published in 195380 kirk developed six canons of conservatism gerald j russello described them thus a belief in a transcendent order which kirk described variously as based in tradition divine revelation or natural law an affection for the variety and mystery of human existence a conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions a belief that property and freedom are closely linked a faith in custom convention and prescription and a recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs which is a respect for the political value of prudence81 in addition kirk said christianity and western civilization are unimaginable apart from one another45 he said that all culture arises out of religion when religious faith decays culture must decline though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief82 kirk called libertarians chirping sectaries quoting t s eliot and said that they and conservatives have nothing in common he called the movement an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder but rarely conjugating he said a line of division exists between believers in some sort of transcendent moral order and utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct he put libertarians in the latter category83 kirk also popularized the angloirish statesman edmund burke as the prototypical conservative—and many paleocons consider him a hallowed ancestor84 for them he represents a vital link between the american right and the greater tradition of british customs and common law85 as such his ideas are a touchstone for a conservatism that respects tradition while rejecting authoritarianism precursorsedit in the united states the southern agrarians86 john t flynn87 albert jay nock88 garet garrett89 robert r mccormick90 felix morley91 and richard m weaver among others articulated positions that have proved influential among contemporary paleoconservatives some paleocons enthusiastically embrace the decentralizing tenets of the antifederalists92 such as john dickinson93 and george mason94 neoconservative critic david brooks lists william jennings bryan t s eliot allen tate john crowe ransom cleanth brooks and walker percy as major paleo influences39 the germanborn and calvinist political philosopher johannes althusius and his tract politica with its core emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity has proven influential as well paul gottfried once noted an occasional paleo association with overthetop catholicism95 in fact counterrevolutionary roman catholic european precursors to the paleoconservatives include joseph de maistre charles maurras juan donoso cortés klemens wenzel von metternich and pope pius ix though they tend to carry influence limited to the roman catholic traditionalist subset of paleoconservatism g k chesterton9697 and hilaire belloc98 are also popular catholic forebears of paleo thoughtcitation needed as for chesterton and belloc joseph sobran explained their relevance this new paganized western society under the comprehensive state would have come as much less of a surprise to us if we’d paid more attention to the two great english catholic writers of the prebolshevik period in 1912 belloc predicted the rise of a new form of tyranny which he called the servile state neither capitalist nor socialist in which one part of the population would be forced to support the other he was not always accurate in detail but he was right in principle he saw that the cellular structure of christian society was under assault chesterton agreed together both men resisted modernity in religion morality politics economics and art they celebrated the middle ages small private property and above all catholicism in a famous epigram typically defiant in its simplicity belloc proclaimed europe is the faith and the faith is europe99 some noncatholic paleocons such as sam francis complained that this tradition is overrepresented among conservative intellectuals thus putting the movement out of step with middle america he reluctantly acknowledged the southern presbyterian influence upon his own thinking100 in addition precursors of a protestant paleoconservatism can be seen in 19th century figures such as robert lewis dabney charles hodge friedrich julius stahl abraham kuyper and guillaume groen van prinsterer many paleocons also look to more modernist or historicist sources such as machiavelli hobbes and even gramsci for intellectual ammunition contrarian leftists such as eugene genovese christopher lasch and paul piccone also influenced the movement101 samuel francis even explored the nihilistic fiction of h p lovecraft102 to them such thinkers help explain modernity power relationships and show how managerial society subverted western traditions103 some modern european continental conservatives such as frenchmen jacques barzun alain de benoist and rené girard have a mode of thought and cultural criticism esteemed by many paleoconservatives southern traditionedit the southern conservative thread of paleoconservatism embodies the statesmanship of nineteenthcentury figures such as john randolph of roanoke john taylor of caroline and john c calhoun it found modern expositors in richard m weaver and mel bradford historian paul v murphy argues that paleoconservatism is rooted in a group of intellectuals fascinated by antebellum culture and the southern agrarians including thomas fleming clyde wilson and bradford in the 1970s fleming wilson and samuel francis attended the university of north carolina together becoming what novelist walker percy called the chapel hill conspiracy45 murphy wrote that they developed a particularistic politics of states rights and localism which they combine with a cultural and social criticism defined by christian and patriarchal organicism104 he also says the southern traditionalist worldview evolved into what appeared in chronicles from the mid1980s onward a focus on national identity mixed with regional particularity plus skepticism of abstract theory and centralized power they also said the mainstream view of the old south was distorted for example bradford said the way to look at the institution of slavery is not backward from 1991 but forward from the hundred years before 1860 slavery was like the rising and setting of the sun a fixture of life in precolonial times everyone was racist except a few quakers jefferson thought that negroes were not capable of taking care of themselves that they were somewhere between helpless children and orangutans105 in the 1995 new dixie manifesto fleming and michael hill argued that southerners are pelted with ethnic slurs denied selfgovernment and stripped of their symbols including the confederate flag106 like any other people they have the right to their history and cultural identity after so many decades of strife they wrote black and white southerners of good will should be left alone to work out their destinies avoiding before it is too late the urban hell that has been created by the lawyers social engineers and imperial bureaucrats who have grown rich on programs that have done nothing to help anyone but themselves thomas dilorenzo revisited the southern paleo critique of abraham lincoln in his book the real lincoln he gives it a paleolibertarian twist saying the president followed mercantilism protectionism and the example of alexander hamilton107 he also said that the civil war was about destroying the right of secession not freeing slaves furthermore he claims that the praise lincoln commonly receives from conservatives is misguided the gettysburg address was brilliant oratory but it was also political subterfuge as hl mencken pointed out it was the southerners who were fighting for the consent of the governed and it was lincolns government that opposed them they no longer consented to being governed by washington dc lincolns admonition that government of the people by the people for the people would perish from the earth if the right of secession were sustained was equally absurd the united states remained a democracy and the confederate states of america would have been a democratic country as well lincolns notion that secession would destroy the government of the united states is also bizarre in light of the fact that after secession took place the us government fielded the largest and bestequipped army and navy in the history of the world up to that point for four long years108 as for the 1861–1865 conflict clyde wilson suggest it be referred to as the war to preserve southern independence fleming argues that secession was legal those who hold the opinion false and easy to refute that the united states in 1860 were an amalgamated central state believe that the secession of south carolina and the other southern states was illegal an act of wickedness that can be explained only by the desire of evil southerners to defend slavery thus in the upsidedown and factfree world of leftists like harry jaffa the war was a civil war between the citizens of the same state or better yet a rebellion abolitionists clearly did not believe this because after the war they insisted that southern states had left the union and needed to be reconstructed everybody knew that it is a basic principle of international law going back to grotius at least that in a confederated state the members have a right to leave109 francis while endorsing authentic federalism110 stopped short at supporting a contemporary return to southern secessionism saying it is impractical and that the main political line of division in the united states is not between the regions of north and south insofar as such regions can still be said to exist but between elite and nonelite he said that middle americans in both regions face the same threats111 david brooks a neoconservative critic says that paleocons do not dream of seeing slavery reborn instead he concludes that they link rural communities to a transcendent order and ancient institutions they do not shy away from expressing their true beliefs and if they supported slavery they would probably say so they merely believe in the social hierarchies in those southern communities they say social roles were crucial to happiness and ordered sociability aristotle recognized that a wellordered society protected an ascending order of good through the institutionalization of rank fleming and coauthor paul gottfried wrote in their book the conservative movement they are talking about the social pecking order in oldtime towns—the folks who live on the hill the merchants on main street the village idiot on the green on a larger scale the paleocons contrast the virtues of the republic with the corruptions of empire the empire throws its weight around in the world the republic minds its own business39 fusionismedit william f buckley jr was an unwitting influence on paleoconservatism112 during the cold war his national review magazine113 vowed to stand athwart history yelling stop114 it promoted both burke and kirk along with frank meyers theory of fusionism115 it suggested that conservatives and libertarians reduce arguments with one another and present a united front against communism116 many firstgeneration paleocons were national review supporters117 but slowly grew weary as the journal reflected more and more neoconservative influence118 starting in the 1970s119 chronicles founder leopold tyrmand complained that the movement gave political solutions to cultural problems120 open hostility broke out in the mid1980s and was never resolved118 some paleocons argued that fusionism failed121 and suggested a new alliance on the right to stand outside the neoconservative consensus122 pat buchanans statement that we are old church and old right antiimperialist and antiinterventionist disbelievers in pax americana reflects this new coalition39123 william rusher former publisher of buckleys magazine claims that paleocons are not representative conservatives the break between the national review and the paleoconservatives is no tempest in a teapot he says it may well determine the direction of american foreign policy for decades to come124 one problem according to paul gottfried and samuel francis was that this was an archaic conservatism this means it saw too much continuity between ancient traditions and the contemporary west which was in mortal combat with communists and other enemies gottfried says the problem with this mindset which he finds even in russell kirk is that it missed that the us was then clearly on its way to becoming a selfidentified multicultural society overseen by a postchristian managerial elite so these conservatives became too optimistic about modernday civic virtue125 looking back thomas fleming remarked that in theory the cold warriors were protecting the people of britain france and the united states against the expansion of an evil empire but nations can only be successfully defended by people who believe in nationhood which is anathema to the liberal assumptions that are the foundation of most western states one notable group the intercollegiate studies institute isi still follows the old fusionism126 it showcases both neoconservative and old right ideas such as antiinterventionism limited government and cultural regionalism in its publications and conferences while it favors freemarket solutions it tends to recognize the limitations of the market or as economist wilhelm roepke says the market is not everything isi scholarship includes analysis of agrarian and distributist works along with the idea of an humane economy127 burnham revolutionedit one fusionist james burnham left an important influence on paleocons especially on samuel francis paul gottfried said that the two men believed that social forces create ideologies—and that moral visions are the mere accompaniments of the process by which classes make themselves economically dominant and try to control other groups128 burnham wrote in 1967 in real life men are joined on a much less than universal scale into a variety of groupings—family community church business club party etc—which on the political scale reach the maximum significant limit in the nation since there is at present time no humanity or mankind socially and historically speaking there cannot be a world government—though conceivably there could be a world empire129 burnham presented a theory of managerial bureaucracy presenting a class of elites that gain power in government business and the media based on technical skill heres how francis who said this theory inspired george orwells 1984 explained it those who hold such skills are able to dominate the state the economy and the culture because the structures of these sectors of modern society require technical functions that only specially skilled personnel can provide the older elites simply lack those skills and eventually lose actual control over the key institutions of modern mass society as the new managerial elites take over society is reconfigured to reflect and support their interests as a ruling class—interests radically different from those of the older elites generally the interests of the new managerial elites consist in maintaining and extending the institutions they control and in ensuring that the needs for and rewards of the technical skills they possess are steadily increased that society become as dependent on them and their functions as possible130 francis unlike some other paleocons argued that the existence of managers alone is harmless rather the multiculturalist ideology they adopted drives it toward tyranny he said that white christian maleoriented bourgeois values and institutions are the principal restraints of managerial power which this class seeks to undermine he explained if we could somehow take out the ideology change the minds of those who control the state and convert them into paleoconservatives the state apparatus itself would be neutral what really animates its drive toward a totalitarian conquest and reconfiguration of society and the human mind itself comes from the ideology that the masters of the managerial state have adopted a force that is entirely extraneous and largely accidental to the structure by which they exercise power130 francis also said however that ideology helps the managerial elite increase its grip on society it is in the longterm interest of the overclass not of anyone else to managerialize society so that all aspects of life are organized packaged routinized and subjugated to manipulation by the technical skill the overclass possesses and that interest requires the undermining of institutions and norms that are independent of and impediments to overclass control131 international parallelsedit as paleoconservatism germinated as a reaction to neoconservatism most of its development as a distinct political tendency under that name has been in the united states although there are parallels in the traditional old right of other western nations french conservatives such as jean raspail132 and british conservatives such as enoch powell133 peter hitchens134 antony flew whom the rockford institute awarded the ingersoll prize135 john betjeman136 and roger scruton137 as well as scrutons salisbury review and derek turners quarterly review138 as well as australias sydney traditionalist forum139 all emphasize skepticism stability and the burkean inheritance and may be considered broadly sympathetic to paleo values for example hitchens wrote in opposition to the iraq war there is nothing conservative about war for at least the last century war has been the herald and handmaid of socialism and state control it is the excuse for censorship organized lying regulation and taxation it is paradise for the busybody and the nark it damages family life and wounds the church it is in short the ally of everything summed up by the ugly word ‘progress’140 note the one nation movement in 1990s australia141 germanys junge freiheit142 and italys lega nord143 and compare the russian dissidents andrei navrozov144 and aleksandr solzhenitsyn145 heredity and human natureedit biology genes and behavioredit while in the past many paleocons have criticized darwinism as such theories become widely accepted in society many paleoconservative intellectuals have become interested in the findings of anthropology genetics and sociobiology for insight into human behavior146 murphy says that thomas fleming was influenced by the works of writers like e e evanspritchard and edward o wilson147 while criticizing evolutionary biologists like stephen jay gould148 they see evidence for traditional values in these fields the rockford institute even awarded sociobiologist edward o wilson a 1989 ingersoll prize thomas fleming takes a view of human nature that mixes classical philosophy with sociobiology he said the laws and decrees enacted by human government are mutable and sometimes tyrannical yet the laws of human nature worked tight within the spirals of the genetic code are unchanging and just149 critic tony glaister describes the attitude thus for fleming human nature is rooted in the biological family consequently the extension of state power he sees as thoroughly deleterious family adhesion is the glue of our biologically determined natural social environment from john locke and jeanjacques rousseau to existentialism and by implication nihilism and social fragmentation the way is shorter than we think the principle that society consists of a social bond created contractually between each member and every other is in accordance with the existentialist belief that existence precedes essence for the existentialist man creates his nature and his history by existing and the actions which constitute that existence and not by virtue of a biological inheritance or the unfolding of an inherent human nature if there is no god which precedes man there is no essence to which his reactions refer this implies a rejection of essential or immutable human nature in this way fleming sees both the sexual revolution and abortion as a revolution against human nature and against the most basic elements of human society do not look for parallels in ancient greek bisexuality a much misinterpreted phenomenon or roman decadence ordinary people in the ancient world lived as most ordinary people have always lived dividing their time between worrying about crops and chasing after the children who are supposed to be tending the livestock or working in the fields the tiny elite classes might become as decadent as they liked without influencing the rest of us whose lives are shaped by natural necessities yes in 18th century europe an antiethic of irresponsible hedonism reached its peak in figures like voltaire and sade but the sexual antics of the palais royal were not being imitated by peasants in the vendée only in the 20th century have we universalized the rebellion against nature and god and communicated it to the common man150 differing views exist on the specific question of evolution vs intelligent design fleming says intelligent design is a boneheaded piece of pseudoscience almost as simplistic as the naive materialism that darwinists teach151 pat buchanan says that science itself points to intelligent design such that the existence of natural laws such as in gravity physics or chemistry implies the existence of a lawmaker152 steve sailer has argued that leftists downplay the politically incorrect implications of evolution sailer writes for instance that richard dawkins dances around the real implications of kin selection theory pierre l van den berghes concept of ethnic nepotism lead him to to sociobiology and its bedrock finding the late william d hamiltons theory of kin selection and inclusive fitness—the more genes we share with another individual the more altruistic we feel toward him there are no clear boundaries between extended family tribe ethnic group or race so van den berghe coined the term ethnic nepotism to describe the human tendency to favor our people ethnocentrism clannishness xenophobia nationalism and racism are the almost inevitable flip sides of ethnic nepotism the genetic basis for ethnic nepotism with each racial group is roughly as strong on average as the etymologically classic case of nepotism among close kin—the unclenephew bond ethnic nepotism isnt a metaphor its a reality and wed better accept it—whether richard dawkins thinks it would be good for his career or not153 eschewing platonic definitions of race sailer argues that a race is better thought of in terms of common ancestry he argues a race is simply an extremely extended family as you extend the boundaries of the extended family farther and farther out you typically find that they start turning in upon themselves most families down through history have married almost exclusively within some sort of population thats more restricted than the entire human species thus while traits unique to a family fade with time forward or backward and outward to more distant relatives a racial groups biological traits can remain quite stable over fairly long periods154 neoconservatismedit pat buchanan calls neoconservatism a globalist interventionist open borders ideology155 the paleoconservatives argue that the neocons are illegitimate interlopers in the conservative movement in 1986156 historian stephen tonsor who rejects the label paleoconservative157 said it has always struck me as odd even perverse that former marxists have been permitted yes invited to play such a leading role in the conservative movement of the twentieth century it is splendid when the town whore gets religion and joins the church now and then she makes a good choir director but when she begins to tell the minister what he ought to say in his sunday sermons matters have been carried too far158 further information neoconservatism and paleoconservatism prominent peopleedit
