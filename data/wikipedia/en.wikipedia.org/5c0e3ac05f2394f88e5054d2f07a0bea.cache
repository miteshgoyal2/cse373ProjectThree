division of orbital sciences corporation in the wake of the 1992 land remote sensing policy act which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business the division was spun off in 1997 it changed its name to geoeye in 2006 after acquiring denver coloradobased space imaging for 58 million5 space imaging was founded and controlled by raytheon and lockheed martin its principal asset was the ikonos satellite although orbimages first chairman was orbital chairman david w thompson and orbital at the time owned more than 60 percent of the stock it no longer has a substantial interest in the company or its successor6 geoeye provided 253000000 square kilometres 98000000 sq mi of satellite map images to microsoft and yahoo search engines in 2008 google secured exclusive online mapping use of the geoeye1 satellite7 geoeye maintained major contracts with the national geospatialintelligence agency for the provision of reconnaissance and imagery data in the early twentyfirst century geoeye was headquartered in herndon virginia satellite operations were conducted from herndon virginia and thornton colorado the location in saint louis missouri provided additional image processing multiple ground stations were located worldwide in 2011 geoeye was inducted into the space foundations space technology hall of fame8 for its role in advancing commercial

770 sq mi per minute ikonos orbits the earth every 98 minutes at an altitude of approximately 681 km 423 mi it travels a sunsynchronous orbit passing a given longitude at 1030 am local time ikonos is operated out of thornton colorado it derived its name from the greek term eikōn pronounced eikona for image10 ikonos was retired on march 31 2015 having performed for more than twice its life expectancy orbview2edit the satellite also called seastar was launched in 1997 by orbimage orbview2 collects color imagery of the earths entire land and ocean surfaces on a daily basis commercial fishing vessels use orbview2 data for detecting oceanographic conditions used to create fishing maps the satellite also provides broadarea coverage in 2800 kilometerwide swaths which are routinely used in naval operations environmental monitoring and global crop assessment applications orbview2 carries nasas seawifs sensor orbview2 was operated out of dulles virginia but operations ceased shortly before geoeyes hq relocation to herndon virginia in 201111 it stopped collecting data on 11 december 201012 orbview3edit launched in 2003 by orbimage orbview3 acquired 1 m 33 ft panchromatic and 4 m 13 ft multispectral imagery in an 8kilometerwide swath the satellite collected up to 210000 km2 81000 sq mi of imagery each day it revisited each location on earth in less than three days with the ability to collect data up to 50 degrees off nadir similar to ikonos this satellite passes a given longitude at 1030 am local time on april 23 2007 geoeye inc filed a form 8k to announce that its orbview3 satellite is permanently out of service though geoeye remained in control of the satellite it no longer produced usable imagery1314 the spacecraft decayed on march 13 2011 via a controlled

swaths the spacecraft is intended for a sunsynchronous orbit at an altitude of 681 km 423 mi and an inclination of 98 degrees with a 1030 am equator crossing time geoeye1 can image up to 60 degrees off nadir it is operated out of herndon virginia and was built in arizona by general dynamics advanced information systems geoeye2edit main article geoeye2 the geoeye2 satellite is designed to provide panchromatic images at a highest resolution of 031 meters per pixel 122 inpx and multispectral images at 124 meters per pixel 488 inpx16 the spacecraft was designed and built by lockheed martin17 while the camera payload was provided by itt corporation18 following the merger of geoeye and digitalglobe digitalglobe announced that geoeye2 would be completed as a ground spare to be launched if or

into aerial imagery in march 2007 with the purchase of mj harden from general electric company23 mj harden based in mission ks is now a wholly owned subsidiary that operates two aircraft that carry a digital mapping camera dmc and a sophisticated lidar imaging system mj harden was founded by milton j harden in 1956 to provide photogrammetry services24 ge power systems bought the company in 200325
