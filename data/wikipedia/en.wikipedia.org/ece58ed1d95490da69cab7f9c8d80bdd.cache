professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit a fellow of the ieee and a founding director of both creative commons2 and the free software foundation he directed the first implementation of logo for the apple ii which made the language widely available on personal computers beginning in 1981 and published a widely selling book on logo in 1982 together with gerald jay sussman abelson developed mits introductory computer science subject the structure and interpretation of computer programs aka 6001 a subject organized around the notion that a computer language is primarily a formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology rather than just a way to get a computer to perform operations abelson and sussman also cooperate in codirecting the mit project on mathematics and computation the mit opencourseware ocw project was spearheaded by hal abelson and other mit faculty abelson led an internal investigation of the schools choices and role in the

abelson holds an ab degree from princeton university and obtained a phd degree in mathematics from mit under the tutelage of mathematician dennis sullivan3 workedit computer science educationedit abelson has a longstanding interest in using computation as a conceptual framework in teaching he directed the first implementation of logo for the apple ii which made the language widely available on personal computers beginning in 1981 and published a widely selling book on logo in 1982 his book turtle geometry written with andrea disessa in 1981 presented a computational approach to geometry which has been cited as the first step in a revolutionary change in the entire teachinglearning process in march 2015 a copy of abelsons 1969 implementation of turtle graphics was sold at the algorithm auction the world’s first auction of computer algorithms4 together with gerald jay sussman abelson developed mits introductory computer science subject structure and interpretation of computer programs a subject organized around the notion that a computer language is primarily a formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology rather than just a way to get a computer to perform operations this work through the textbook of the same name videotapes of their lectures and the availability on personal computers of the scheme dialect of lisp used in teaching the course has had a worldwide impact on university computerscience education56 he is a visiting faculty member at google where he is part of the app inventor for android team an educational program aiming to make it easy for people without programming background to write mobile phone applications and explore whether this could change the nature of introductory computing7 he is the coauthor of the book app inventor with david wolber ellen spertus and liz looney published by oreilly media in 2011 computational toolsedit abelson and sussman also cooperate in codirecting the mit project on mathematics and computation a project of the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory previously a joint project of the ai lab and lcs csails components the goal of the project is to create better computational tools for scientists and engineers but even with powerful numerical computers exploring complex physical systems still requires substantial human effort and human judgement to prepare simulations and to interpret numerical results together with their students abelson and sussman are combining techniques from numerical computation symbolic algebra and heuristic programming to develop programs that not only perform massive numerical computations but that also interpret these computations and discuss the results in qualitative terms programs such as these could form the basis for intelligent scientific instruments that monitor physical systems based upon highlevel behavioral descriptions more generally they could lead to a new generation of computational tools that can autonomously explore complex physical systems and which will play an important part in the future practice of science and engineering at the same time these programs incorporate computational formulations of scientific knowledge that can form the foundations of better ways to teach science and engineering free software movementedit abelson and sussman have also been a part of the free software movement including serving on the board of directors of the free software foundation8 abelson is known to have been involved in the publishing of andrew huangs hacking the xbox and keith winsteins sevenline perl decss script known as qrpff as well as lamp mits campuswide music distribution system the mit opencourseware ocw project was spearheaded by hal abelson and other mit faculty69 aaron swartz investigationedit main article aaron swartz in january 2013 open access activist aaron swartz committed suicide he had previously been arrested near mit and was facing up to 35 years imprisonment for the alleged crime of downloading jstor articles through mits open access campus network10 in response mit appointed professor hal abelson to lead an internal investigation of the schools choices and role in the prosecution of aaron swartz by the fbi111213 the report was delivered on july 26 2013 it concluded that mit did nothing legally wrong but recommended that mit consider changing some of its internal policies14 other affiliationsedit abelson is also a founding director of creative commons and public knowledge and a director of the center for democracy and technology3
