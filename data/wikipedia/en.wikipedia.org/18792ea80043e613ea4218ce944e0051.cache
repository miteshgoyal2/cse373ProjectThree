justice earl warren announced his retirement after 15 years on the court effective on the confirmation of his successor president lyndon johnson nominated sitting associate justice abe fortas to the position but a senate filibuster blocked his confirmation with johnsons term as president about to expire before another nominee could be considered warren remained in office in 1969 president richard nixon nominated burger to the chief justice position burger had first caught nixons eye through a letter of support the former sent to nixon during the 1952 fund crisis5 and then again 15 years later when the magazine us news and world report had reprinted a 1967 speech that burger had given at ripon college in it burger compared the united states judicial system to those of norway sweden and denmark i assume that no one will take issue with me when i say that these north european countries are as enlightened as the united states in the value they place on the individual and on human dignity those countries do not consider it necessary to use a device like our fifth amendment under which an accused person may not be required to testify they go swiftly efficiently and directly to the question of whether the accused is guilty no nation on earth goes to such lengths or takes such pains to provide safeguards as we do once an accused person is called before the bar of justice and until his case is completed through speeches like this burger became known as a critic of chief justice warren and an advocate of a literal strictconstructionist reading of the us constitution nixons agreement with these views being expressed by a readily confirmable sitting federal appellate judge led to the appointment the senate confirmed burger to succeed warren who in turn swore in the new chief on june 23 19696 in his presidential campaign nixon had pledged to appoint a strict constructionist as chief justice according to president nixons memoirs he had asked justice burger in the spring of 1970 to be prepared to run for president in 1972 if the political repercussions of the cambodia invasion were too negative for him to endure a few years later in 1971 and 1973 burger was on nixons short list of vicepresidential replacements for vice president spiro agnew along with john connally ronald reagan and nelson rockefeller before gerald ford was appointed following agnews resignation in october 1973 chief justiceedit jurisprudenceedit when burger was nominated for the chief justiceship conservatives in the nixon administration expected that the burger court would rule markedly differently from the warren court and might in fact overturn controversial warren court era precedents by the early 1970s however it became apparent that the burger court was not going to reverse the rulings of the warren court and in fact might extend some warren court doctrinescitation needed the court issued a unanimous ruling swann v charlottemecklenburg board of education 1971 supporting busing to reduce de facto racial segregation in schools in united states v us district court 1972 the burger court issued another unanimous ruling against the nixon administrations desire to invalidate the need for a search warrant and the requirements of the fourth amendment in cases of domestic surveillance then only two weeks later in furman v georgia 1972 the court in a 5–4 decision invalidated all death penalty laws then in force although burger dissented from the decision in the most controversial ruling of his term roe v wade 1973 burger voted with the majority to recognize a broad right to privacy that prohibited states from banning abortions however burger abandoned roe v wade by the time of thornburgh v american college of obstetricians and gynecologists on july 24 1974 burger led the court in a unanimous decision in united states v nixon this was president nixons attempt to keep several memos and tapes relating to the watergate affair private as documented in woodward and armstrongs the brethren and elsewhere burgers original feelings on the case were that watergate was merely a political battle he didnt see what they did wrong7 the actual final opinion was largely justice brennans work though each justice wrote at least a rough draft of a particular section8 burger was originally to vote in favor of nixon but tactically changed his vote in order to assign the opinion to himself and to restrain the opinions rhetoric9 burgers first draft of the opinion wrote that executive privilege could be invoked when it dealt with a core function of the presidency that in some cases the executive could be supreme10 however the other justices in the supreme court were able to convince burger to excise that language from the opinionnbsp—the judicial branch alone would have the power to determine whether something qualifies to be shielded under executive privilege11 burger was opposed to gay rights as he wrote a famous concurring opinion in the courts 1986 decision upholding a georgia law criminalizing sodomy bowers v hardwick in which burger relied on historical evidence that laws criminalizing homosexuality were of ancient vintage chief justice burger pointed out that the famous legal author william blackstone wrote that sodomy was a crime against nature of deeper malignity than rape a heinous act the very mention of which is a disgrace to human nature and a crime not fit to be named12 with betty ford between them chief justice burger swears in president gerald ford following the resignation of president richard nixon burger also emphasized the maintenance of checks and balances between the branches of government in the 1983 case of immigration and naturalization service v chadha he held for the majority that congress could not reserve a legislative veto over executive branch actions on issues involving criminal law and procedure burger remained reliably conservative he joined the court majority in voting to reinstate the death penalty in gregg v georgia 1976 and in 1983 he vigorously dissented from the courts holding in the case of solem v helm that a sentence of life imprisonment for issuing a fraudulent check in the amount of 100 constituted cruel and unusual punishment leadershipedit rather than dominating the court burger sought to improve administration both within the court and within the nations legal system criticizing some advocates as unprepared burger created training venues for state and local government advocates13 he also helped found the national center for state courts which is now located in williamsburg virginia as well as the institute for court management and national institute of corrections to provide professional training for judges clerks and prison guards14 burger also began a tradition of annually delivering a state of the judiciary speech to the american bar association many members of which had been alienated by the warren court however some detractors thought his emphasis on the mechanics of the judicial system trivialized the office of chief justicecitation needed burger drew internal controversy within the supreme court throughout his tenure as was revealed in the controversial though bestselling book woodward and armstrongs the brethren although senator everett dirksen noted burger looked sounded and acted like a chief justice the reporters depicted burger as a weak chief justice who was not seriously respected by his colleagues due to alleged personal eccentricity and lack of legal acumencitation needed woodward and armstrongs sources indicated that some of the other justices were annoyed by burgers practice of switching his vote in conference or simply not announcing his vote in order that he be able to control opinion assignments burger repeatedly irked his colleagues by changing his vote to remain in the majority and by rewarding his friends with choice assignments and punishing his foes with dreary ones15 burger would also try to influence the course of events in a case by circulating a preemptive opinion16 consequently the burger court was described as his in name only17 time magazine called him plodding and standoffish17 as well as pompous aloof and unpopular15 burger was a constant irritant on the courts group dynamic according to the new york times linda greenhouse18 jeffrey toobin wrote in his book the nine that by the time of his departure in 1986 burger had alienated all of his colleagues to one degree or another19 in particular potter stewart who had been considered a candidate to follow warren as chief justice was so discontented with burger that he became the primary source for woodward and armstrong when writing the brethren greenhouse points to the case of immigration and naturalization service v chadha as evidence of burgers foundering leadership burger would cause the case to be delayed for over twenty months despite there having been five votes to affirm the appeals courts finding of unconstitutionality after the case was first argued brennan marshall blackmun powell and stevens burger did not allow an opinion to be assigned first by asking for a special conference on the case and then by delaying the case for reargument when that conference fell through even though he never held a formal vote on holding the case over for reargument20 later life death and legacyedit burger retired on september 26 1986 in part to lead the campaign to mark the 1987 bicentennial of the united states constitution at which time he commissioned the construction of the constitution bicentennial monument the national monument to the us constitution he had served longer than any other chief justice appointed in the 20th century21 despite his reputation for being imperious he was beloved by the law clerks and judicial fellows who worked with him22 in 1987 princeton universitys american whigcliosophic society awarded burger the james madison award for distinguished public service23 in 1988 he was awarded the prestigious united states military academys sylvanus thayer award as well as the presidential medal of freedom in 1991 appearance on the macneillehrer newshour burger stated that the second amendment has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud i repeat the word fraud on the american public by special interest groups24 burger died in his sleep on june 25 1995 from congestive heart failure at the age of 87 at sibley memorial hospital in washington dc he drafted his own onepage will all of his papers were donated to the college of william and mary where he formerly served as chancellor however they will not be open to the public until 2026 burger’s casket was displayed in the great hall of the us supreme court building his remains are interred at arlington national cemetery25 as chief justice burger was instrumental in founding the supreme court historical society and was its first president burger is often cited as one of the foundational proponents of alternative dispute resolution adr particularly in its ability to ameliorate an overloaded justice system in a speech given in front of the american bar association justice burger lamented the state of the justice system in 1984 our system is too costly too painful too destructive too inefficient for a truly civilized people to rely on the adversary process as the principal means of resolving conflicting claims is a mistake that must be corrected26 the warren e burger federal courthouse27 in st paul minnesota and the warren e
