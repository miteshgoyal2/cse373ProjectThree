this is london calling – 2lo calling here is the first general news bulletin copyright by reuters press association exchange telegraph and central news ” — bbc news programme opening during the 1920s6 the british broadcasting company broadcast its first radio bulletin from radio station 2lo on 14 november 19227 wishing to avoid competition newspaper publishers persuaded the government to ban the bbc from broadcasting news before 7 pm and to force it to use wire service copy instead of reporting on its own6 on easter weekend in 1930 18 april this reliance on newspaper wire services left the radio news service with no information to report after saying there is no news today piano music was played instead8 the bbc gradually gained the right to edit the copy and in 1934 created its own news operation however it could not broadcast news before 6 pm until world war ii6 gaumont british and movietone cinema newsreels had been broadcast on the tv service since 1936 with the bbc producing its own equivalent television newsreel programme from january 1948 a weekly childrens newsreel was inaugurated on 23 april 1950 to around 350000 receivers9 the network began simulcasting its radio news on television in 1946 with a still picture of big ben6 televised bulletins began on 5 july 1954 broadcast from leased studios within alexandra palace in london10not in citation given the publics interest in television and live events was stimulated by elizabeth iis coronation in 1953 it is estimated that up to 27 million people11 viewed the programme in the uk overtaking radios audience of 12 million for the first time12 those live pictures were fed from 21 cameras in central london to alexandra palace for transmission and then on to other uk transmitters opened in time for the event13 that year there were around two million tv licences held in the uk rising to over three million the following year and four and a half million by 1955 1950sedit television news although physically separate from its radio counterpart was still firmly under radio news control – correspondents provided reports for both outlets–and that first bulletin shown on 5 july 1954 on the then bbc television service and presented by richard baker involved his providing narration offscreen while stills were shown14 this was then followed by the customary television newsreel with a recorded commentary by john snagge and on other occasions by andrew timothy it was revealed that this had been due to producers fearing a newsreader with visible facial movements would distract the viewer from the story onscreen newsreaders were finally introduced a year later in 1955 – kenneth kendall the first to appear in vision robert dougall and richard baker–three weeks before itns launch on 21 september 1955 mainstream television production had started to move out of alexandra palace in 195015 to larger premises – mainly at lime grove studios in shepherds bush west london – taking current affairs then known as talks department with it it was from here that the first panorama a new documentary programme was transmitted on 11 november 1953 with richard dimbleby becoming anchor in 195516 on 18 february 1957 the topical earlyevening programme tonight hosted by cliff michelmore and designed to fill the airtime provided by the abolition of the toddlers truce was broadcast from marconis viking studio in st mary abbotts place kensington – with the programme moving into a lime grove studio in 1960 where it already maintained its production office on 28 october 1957 the today programme a morning radio programme was launched in central london on the home service17 in 1958 hugh carleton greene became head of news and current affairs he set up a bbc study group whose findings published in 1959 were critical of what the television news operation had become under his predecessor tahu hole the report proposed that the head of television news should take control away from radio and that the television service should have a proper newsroom of its own with an editoroftheday18 1960sedit on 1 january 1960 greene became directorgeneral and brought about big changes at bbc television and bbc television news bbc television news had been created in 1955 in response to the founding of itn the changes made by greene were aimed at making bbc reporting more similar to itn which had been highly rated by study groups held by greene a newsroom was created at alexandra palace television reporters were recruited and given the opportunity to write and voice their own scripts–without the impossible burden of having to cover stories for radio too19 in 1987 almost thirty years later john birt resurrected the practice of correspondents working for both tv and radio with the introduction of bimedia journalism20 and 2008 saw trimedia introduced across tv radio and online on 20 june 1960 nan winton the first female bbc network newsreader appeared in vision21 19 september saw the start of the radio news and current affairs programme the ten oclock news22 bbc2 started transmission on 20 april 1964 and with it came a new news programme for that channel newsroom the world at one a lunchtime news programme began on 4 october 1965 on the then home service and the year before news review had started on television news review was a summary of the weeks news first broadcast on sunday 26 april 196423 on bbc 2 and harking back to the weekly newsreel review of the week produced from 1951 to open programming on sunday evenings–the difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hardofhearing as this was the decade before electronic caption generation each superimposition super had to be produced on paper or card synchronised manually to studio and news footage committed to tape during the afternoon and broadcast early evening thus sundays were no longer a quiet day for news at alexandra palace the programme ran until the 1980s24 – by then using electronic captions known as anchor – to be superseded by ceefax subtitling a similar teletext format and the signing of such programmes as see hear from 1981 on sunday 17 september 1967 the world this weekend a weekly news and current affairs programme launched on what was then home service but soontobe radio 4 preparations for colour began in the autumn of 1967 and on thursday 7 march 1968 newsroom on bbc2 moved to an early evening slot becoming the first uk news programme to be transmitted in colour25 – from studio a at alexandra palace news review and westminster the latter a weekly review of parliamentary happenings were colourised shortly after however much of the insert material was still in black and white as initially only a part of the film coverage shot in and around london was on colour reversal film stock and all regional and many international contributions were still in black and white colour facilities at alexandra palace were technically very limited for the next eighteen months as it had only one rca colour quadruplex videotape machine and eventually two pye plumbicon colour telecines–although the news colour service started with just one black and white national bulletins on bbc 1 continued to originate from studio b on weekdays along with town and around the london regional opt out programme broadcast throughout the 1960s and the bbcs first regional news programme for the south east until it started to be replaced by nationwide on tuesday to thursday from lime grove studios early in september 1969 town and around was never to make the move to television centre – instead it became london this week which aired on mondays and fridays only from the new tvc studios26 television news moves to television centreedit television news moved to bbc television centre in september 1969 the final news programme to come from alexandra palace was a late night news on bbc2 on friday 19 september 1969 in colour it was said that over this september weekend it took 65 removal vans to transfer the contents of alexandra palace across london27 bbc television news resumed operations the next day with a lunchtime bulletin on bbc1 – in black and white – from television centre where it remained until march 2013 this move to better technical facilities but much smaller studios allowed newsroom and news review to replace back projection with colourseparation overlay it also allowed all news output to be produced in pal colour ahead of the transition of bbc1 to colour from 15 november 1969 – and like alexandra palace studio a these studios too were capable of operating in ntsc for the us canada and japan as the bbc occasionally provided facilities for overseas broadcasters during the 1960s satellite communication had become possible28 however colour fieldstore standards converters were still in their infancy in 196829 and it was some years before digital linestore conversion was able to undertake the process seamlessly30 1970sedit angela rippon pictured in 1983 became the first female news presenter in 1975 on 14 september 1970 the first nine oclock news was broadcast on television robert dougall presented the first week from studio n131 – described by the guardian32 as a sort of polystyrene padded cell33—the bulletin having been moved from the earlier time of 2050 as a response to the ratings achieved by itns news at ten introduced three years earlier on the rival itv richard baker and kenneth kendall presented subsequent weeks thus echoing those first television bulletins of the mid1950s angela rippon became the first female news presenter of the nine oclock news in 1975 her work outside the news was controversial at the time appearing on the morecambe and wise christmas show in 1976 singing and dancing31 the first edition of john cravens newsround initially intended only as a short series and later renamed just newsround came from studio n3 on 4 april 1972 afternoon television news bulletins during the mid to late 1970s were broadcast from the bbc newsroom itself rather than one of the three news studios the newsreader would present to camera while sitting on the edge of a desk behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks this period corresponded with when the nine oclock news got its next makeover and would use a cso background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening also in the mid1970s the late night news on bbc2 was briefly renamed newsnight34 but this was not to last or be the same programme as we know today – that would be launched in 1980 – and it soon reverted to being just a news summary with the early evening bbc2 news expanded to become newsday news on radio was to change in the 1970s and on radio 4 in particular brought about by the arrival of new editor peter woon from television news and the implementation of the broadcasting in the seventies report these included the introduction of correspondents into news bulletins where previously only a newsreader would present as well as the inclusion of content gathered in the preparation process new programmes were also added to the daily schedule pm and the world tonight as part of the plan for the station to become a wholly speech network32 newsbeat launched as the news service on radio 1 on 10 september 197335 on 23 september 1974 a teletext system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched engineers originally began developing such a system to bring news to deaf viewers but the system was expanded the ceefax service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 october 2012 it not only had subtitling for all channels it also gave information such as weather flight times and film reviews by the end of the decade the practice of shooting on film for inserts in news broadcasts was declining with the introduction of eng technology into the uk the equipment would gradually become less cumbersome – the bbcs first attempts had been using a philips colour camera with backpack base station and separate portable sony umatic recorder in the latter half of the decade 1980sedit by 1982 eng technology had become sufficiently reliable for bernard hesketh to use an ikegami camera to cover the falklands war coverage for which he won the royal television society cameraman of the year award36 and a bafta nomination37 – the first time that bbc news had relied upon an electronic camera rather than film in a conflict zone bbc news won the bafta for its actuality coverage38 however the event has become remembered in television terms for brian hanrahans reporting where he coined the phrase im not allowed to say how many planes joined the raid but i counted them all out and i counted them all back39 to circumvent restrictions and which has become cited as an example of good reporting under pressure40 two years earlier the iranian embassy siege had been shot electronically by the bbc television news outside broadcasting team and the work of reporter kate adie broadcasting live from princes gate was nominated for bafta actuality coverage but this time beaten by itn for the 1980 award41 newsnight the news and current affairs programme was due to go on air on 23 january 1980 although trade union disagreements meant that its launch from lime grove was postponed by a week20 on 27 august 1981 moira stuart became the first african caribbean female newsreader to appear on british television the first bbc breakfast television programme breakfast time also launched during the 1980s on 17 january 1983 from lime grove studio e and two weeks before its itv rival tvam frank bough selina scott and nick ross helped to wake viewers with a relaxed style of presenting42 the six oclock news first aired on 3 september 1984 eventually becoming the most watched news programme in the uk however since 2006 it has been overtaken by the bbc news at ten starting in 1981 the bbc gave a common theme to its main news bulletins with new electronic titles–a set of computer animated stripes forming a circle43 on a red background with a bbc news typescript appearing below the circle graphics and a theme tune consisting of brass and keyboards the nine used a similar striped number 9 the red background was replaced by a blue from 1985 until 1987 by 1987 the bbc had decided to rebrand its bulletins and established individual styles again for each one with differing titles and music the weekend and holiday bulletins branded in a similar style to the nine although the stripes introduction continued to be used until 1989 on occasions where a news bulletin was screened out of the running order of the schedule44 1990sedit the combined newsroom for domestic television and radio was opened at television centre in west london in 1998 during the 1990s a wider range of services began to be offered by bbc news with the split of bbc world service television to become bbc world news and current affairs and bbc prime light entertainment content for a 24hour news channel was thus required followed in 1997 with the launch of domestic equivalent bbc news 24 rather than set bulletins ongoing reports and coverage was needed to keep both channels functioning and meant a greater emphasis in budgeting for both was necessary in 1998 after 66 years at broadcasting house the bbc radio news operation moved to bbc television centre45 new technology provided by silicon graphics came into use in 1993 for a relaunch of the main bbc 1 bulletins creating a virtual set which appeared to be much larger than it was physically the relaunch also brought all bulletins into the same style of set with only small changes in colouring titles and music to differentiate each a computer generated glass sculpture of the bbc coat of arms was the centrepiece of the programme titles until the large scale corporate rebranding of news services in 1999 in 1999 the biggest relaunch occurred with bbc one bulletins bbc world bbc news 24 and bbc news online all adopting a common style one of the most significant changes was the gradual adoption of the corporate image by the bbc regional news programmes giving a common style across local national and international bbc television news this also included newyddion the main news programme of welsh language channel s4c produced by bbc news wales 2000sedit following the relaunch of bbc news the previous year regional headlines were included at the start of the bbc one news bulletins in 2000 the english regions did however lose five minutes at the end of their bulletins due to a new headline roundup at 1855 2000 also saw the nine oclock news moved to the later time of 2200 this was in response to itn who had just moved their popular news at ten programme to 2300 itn briefly returned news at ten but following poor ratings when head to head against the bbcs ten oclock news the itn bulletin was moved to 2230 where it remained until 14 january 2008 the retirement of peter sissons and departure of michael buerk from the ten oclock news led to changes in the bbc one bulletin presenting team on 20 january 2003 the six oclock news became double headed with george alagiah and sophie raworth after huw edwards and fiona bruce moved to present the ten at the time of the changes a new set design featuring a projected background image of a fictional newsroom was introduced new programme titles were introduced on 16 february 2004 to match those of bbc news 24 bbc news 24 and bbc world introduced a new style of presentation in december 2003 that was slightly altered on 5 july 2004 to mark 50 years of bbc television news46 the individual positions of editor of the one and six oclock news were replaced by a new daytime position in november 2005 kevin bakhurst became the first controller of bbc news 24 replacing the position of editor amanda farnsworth became daytime editor while craig oliver was later named editor of the ten oclock news the bulletins also began to be simulcast with news 24 as a way of pooling resources bulletins received new titles and a new set design in may 2006 to allow for breakfast to move into the main studio for the first time since 1997 the new set featured barco videowall screens with a background of the london skyline used for main bulletins and originally an image of cirrus clouds against a blue sky for breakfast this was later replaced following viewer criticism47 the studio bore similarities with the itnproduced itv news in 2004 though itn uses a cso virtual studio rather than the actual screens at bbc news also may saw the launch of world news today the first domestic bulletin focused principally on international news bbc news became part of a new bbc journalism group in november 2006 as part of a restructuring of the bbc the thendirector of bbc news helen boaden reported to the thendeputy directorgeneral and head of the journalism group mark byford until he was made redundant in 201048 on 18 october 2007 mark thompson announced a sixyear plan delivering creative future merging the television current affairs department into a new news programmes division4950 thompsons announcement in response to a £2 billion shortfall in funding would he said deliver a smaller but fitter bbc in the digital age by cutting its payroll and in 2013 selling the television centre51 the various separate newsrooms for television radio and online operations were merged into a single multimedia newsroom programme making within the newsrooms was brought together to form a multimedia programme making department bbc world service director peter horrocks said that the changes would achieve efficiency at a time of costcutting at the bbc in his blog he wrote that by using the same resources across the various broadcast media meant fewer stories could be covered or by following more stories there would be fewer ways to broadcast them52 a new graphics and video playout system was introduced for production of television bulletins in january 2007 this coincided with a new structure to bbc world news bulletins editors favouring a section devoted to analysing the news stories reported on the first new bbc news bulletin since the six oclock news was announced in july 2007 following a successful trial in the midlands53 the summary lasting 90 seconds has been broadcast at 2000 on weekdays since december 2007 and bears similarities with 60 seconds on bbc three but also includes headlines from the various bbc regions and a weather summary as part of a longterm cost cutting programme bulletins were renamed the bbc news at one six and ten respectively in april 2008 while bbc news 24 was renamed bbc news and moved into the same studio as the bulletins at bbc television centre5455 bbc world was renamed bbc world news and regional news programmes were also updated with the new presentation style designed by lambienairn56 the studio moves also meant that studio n9 previously used for bbc world was closed and operations moved to the previous studio of bbc news 24 studio n9 was later refitted to match the new branding and was used for the bbcs uk local elections and european elections coverage in early june 2009 2010sedit the new newsroom in broadcasting house a strategy review of the bbc in march 2010 confirmed that having the best journalism in the world would form one of five key editorial policies as part of changes subject to public consultation and bbc trust approval57 after a period of suspension in late 2012 helen boaden ceased to be the director of bbc news58 on 16 april 2013 incoming bbc directorgeneral tony hall named james harding a former editor of the times of london newspaper as director of

also available to view on the bbc iplayer service the bbc news channel is also available to view 24 hours a day while video and radio clips are also available within online news articles70 opinionsedit main articles bbc controversies and criticism of the bbc political and commercial independenceedit the bbc is required by its charter to be free from both political and commercial influence and answers only to its viewers and listeners this political objectivity is sometimes questioned for instance the daily telegraph 3 august 2005 carried a letter from the kgb defector oleg gordievsky referring to it as the red service books have been written on the subject including antibbc works like truth betrayed by w j west and the truth twisters by richard deacon the bbcs editorial guidelines on politics and public policy state that whilst the voices and opinions of opposition parties must be routinely aired and challenged the government of the day will often be the primary source of news71 the bbc is regularly accused by the government of the day of bias in favour of the opposition and by the opposition of bias in favour of the government similarly during times of war the bbc is often accused by the uk government or by strong supporters of british military campaigns of being overly sympathetic to the view of the enemy an edition of newsnight at the start of the falklands war in 1982 was described as almost treasonable by john page mp who objected to peter snow saying if we believe the british72 during the first gulf war critics of the bbc took to using the satirical name baghdad broadcasting corporation73 during the kosovo war the bbc were labelled the belgrade broadcasting corporation suggesting favouritism towards the fr yugoslavia government over ethnic albanian rebels by british ministers73 although slobodan milosević then fry president claimed that the bbcs coverage had been biased against his nation74 conversely some of those who style themselves antiestablishment in the united kingdom or who oppose foreign wars have accused the bbc of proestablishment bias or of refusing to give an outlet to antiwar voices following the 2003 invasion of iraq a study by the cardiff university school of journalism of the reporting of the war found that nine out of 10 references to weapons of mass destruction during the war assumed that iraq possessed them and only one in 10 questioned this assumption it also found that out of the main british broadcasters covering the war the bbc was the most likely to use the british government and military as its source it was also the least likely to use independent sources like the red cross who were more critical of the war when it came to reporting iraqi casualties the study found fewer reports on the bbc than on the other three main channels the reports author justin lewis wrote far from revealing an antiwar bbc our findings tend to give credence to those who criticised the bbc for being too sympathetic to the government in its war coverage either way it is clear that the accusation of bbc antiwar bias fails to stand up to any serious or sustained analysis75 prominent bbc appointments are constantly assessed by the british media and political establishment for signs of political bias the appointment of greg dyke as directorgeneral was highlighted by press sources because dyke was a labour party member and former activist as well as a friend of tony blair the bbcs current political editor nick robinson was some years ago a chairman of the young conservatives and did as a result attract informal criticism from the former labour government but his predecessor andrew marr faced similar claims from the right because he was editor of the independent a liberalleaning newspaper before his appointment in 2000 mark thompson former directorgeneral of the bbc admitted the organisation has been biased towards the left in the past he said in the bbc i joined 30 years ago there was in much of current affairs in terms of peoples personal politics which were quite vocal a massive bias to the left76 he then added the organization did struggle then with impartiality now it is a completely different generation there is much less overt tribalism among the young journalists who work for the bbc indiaedit in 2008 the bbc was criticised by some for referring to the terrorists who carried out the november 2008 mumbai attacks as gunmen7778 the response to this added to prior criticism from some indian commentators suggesting that the bbc may have an indophobic bias79 in march 2015 the bbc was criticised for airing a documentary interviewing one of the rapists in india in spite of a ban ordered by the indian high court the bbc still aired the documentary80 but the bbc was supported by many others from the world for standing for justice instead of coming under pressure of some indian fundamentalist organizations81 hutton inquiryedit main article hutton inquiry bbc news was at the centre of a political controversy following the 2003 invasion of iraq three bbc news reports andrew gilligans on today gavin hewitts on the ten oclock news and another on newsnight quoted an anonymous source that stated the british government particularly the prime ministers office had embellished the september dossier with misleading exaggerations of iraqs weapons of mass destruction capabilities the government denounced the reports and accused the corporation of poor journalism in subsequent weeks the corporation stood by the report saying that it had a reliable source following intense media speculation david kelly was named in the press as the source for gilligans story on 9 july 2003 kelly was found dead by suicide in a field close to his home early on 18 july an inquiry led by lord hutton was announced by the british government the following day to investigate the circumstances leading to kellys death concluding that dr kelly took his own life82 in his report on 28 january 2004 lord hutton concluded that gilligans original accusation was unfounded and the bbcs editorial and management processes were defective in particular it specifically criticised the chain of management that caused the bbc to defend its story the bbc director of news richard sambrook the report said had accepted gilligans word that his story was accurate in spite of his notes being incomplete davies had then told the bbc board of governors that he was happy with the story and told the prime minister that a satisfactory internal inquiry had taken place the board of governors under the chairmans gavyn davies guidance accepted that further investigation of the governments complaints were unnecessary because of the criticism in the hutton report davies resigned on the day of publication bbc news faced an important test reporting on itself with the publication of the report but by common consent of the board of governors managed this independently impartially and honestly83 davies resignation was followed by the resignation of director general greg dyke the following day and the resignation of gilligan on 30 january while undoubtedly a traumatic experience for the corporation an icm poll in april 2003 indicated that it had sustained its position as the best and most trusted provider of news84 israelipalestinian conflictedit see also criticism of the bbc § middle east and israel and balen report the bbc has faced accusations of holding both antiisrael and antipalestine bias douglas davis the london correspondent of the jerusalem post has described the bbcs coverage of the arab–israeli conflict as a relentless onedimensional portrayal of israel as a demonic criminal state and israelis as brutal oppressors which bears all the hallmarks of a concerted campaign of vilification that wittingly or not has the effect of delegitimising the jewish state and pumping oxygen into a dark old european hatred that dared not speak its name for the past halfcentury85 however two large independent studies one conducted by loughborough university and the other by glasgow universitys media group concluded that israeli perspectives are given greater coverage8687 critics of the bbc argue that the balen report proves systematic bias against israel in headline news programming daily mail and the daily telegraph criticised the bbc for spending hundreds of thousands of british tax payers pounds from preventing the report being released to the public888990 jeremy bowen the middle east editor for bbc world news was singled out specifically for bias by the bbc trust which concluded that he violated bbc guidelines on accuracy and impartiality91 an independent panel appointed by the bbc trust was set up in 2006 to review the impartiality of the bbcs coverage of the israeli–palestinian conflict92 the panels assessment was that apart from individual lapses there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias while noting a commitment to be fair accurate and impartial and praising much of the bbcs coverage the independent panel concluded that bbc output does not consistently give a full and fair account of the conflict in some ways the picture is incomplete and in that sense misleading it notes that the failure to convey adequately the disparity in the israeli and palestinian experience reflects the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation writing in the financial times philip stephens one of the panellists later accused the bbcs directorgeneral mark thompson of misrepresenting the panels conclusions he further opined my sense is that bbc news reporting has also lost a once ironclad commitment to objectivity and a necessary respect for the democratic process if i am right the bbc too is lost93 mark thompson published a rebuttal in the ft the next day94 the description by one bbc correspondent reporting on the funeral of yassir arafat that she had been left with tears in her eyes led to other questions of impartiality particularly from martin walker95 in a guest opinion piece in the times who picked out the apparent case of fayad abu shamala the bbc arabic service correspondent who told a hamas rally on 6 may 2001 that journalists in gaza were waging the campaign shoulder to shoulder together with the palestinian people95 walker argues that the independent inquiry was flawed for two reasons firstly because the time period over which it was conducted august 2005 to january 2006 surrounded the israeli withdrawal from gaza and ariel sharons stroke which produced more positive coverage than usual furthermore he wrote the inquiry only looked at the bbcs domestic coverage and excluded output on the bbc world service and bbc world95 tom gross accused the bbc of glorifying hamas suicide bombers and condemned its policy of inviting guests such as jenny tonge and tom paulin who have compared israeli soldiers to nazis writing for the bbc paulin said israeli soldiers should be shot dead like hitlers ss and said he could understand how suicide bombers feelcitation needed according to gross paulin and tonge continue to be invited as regular guests and they are among the most frequent contributors to their most widely screened arts programme96 the bbc also faced criticism for not airing a disasters emergency committee aid appeal for palestinians who suffered in gaza during 22day war there in late 2008early 2009 most other major uk broadcasters did air this appeal but rival sky news did notcitation needed british journalist julie burchill has accused bbc of creating a climate of fear for british jews over its excessive coverage of israel compared to other nations97 partnersedit bbc and abc share video segments and reporters as needed in producing their newscasts with the bbc showing abc world news tonight with david muir in the uk however in july 2017 bbc announced a new partnership with cbs news allows both organisations to share video editorial content and additional newsgathering resources in new york london washington and around the world98 bbc news subscribes to wire services from leading international agencies including press association reuters and agence francepress in april 2017 the bbc dropped associated press in favour of an enhanced service from afp99
