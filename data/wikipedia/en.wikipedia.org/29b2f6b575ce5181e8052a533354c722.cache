backgroundedit leave me alone was a response to negative rumours about jackson that frequently appeared in the media and tabloids post1986 after the success of thriller1 beginning in 1986 the tabloids began to publish rumours about jackson one of the first being a story claiming that jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process a picture leaked out to the media of him lying down in a hyberbaric chamber at a hospital he visited an unknown person took the picture of jackson while he was testing out the chamber out of curiosity when jackson bought a pet chimpanzee named bubbles the media viewed it as evidence of jacksons increasing detachment from reality2 it was also reported that jackson had offered to buy the bones of joseph merrick the elephant man jackson stated that the story was a complete lie23 these stories inspired the nickname wacko jacko which jackson acquired the following year and would come to despise another frequent response from the media was about jacksons plastic surgery jacksons manager said of the medias criticism towards the topic so many terrible things have been written okay so he had his nose fixed and the cleft — big deal i got news for you my nose has broke five times its been fixed twice who gives a shit who cares elvis had his nose done marilyn monroe had her nose done had her breasts done everybodys had it done4 the song has been viewed as having a paranoia theme a theme that jackson had frequently used on previous studio albums5 the atlantic felt that jackson showed obvious expressions of distrust in the song and that the song was one of multiple songs where jacksons persistent loneliness in his music was prominent6 in 2009 j edward keyes of rolling stone described leave me alone as sounding like vintage michael and the song works because of its music a batch of thick chords for jackson to vamp over7 keyes noted that the song was a kind of darker inversion of the way you make me feel and that leave me alone was workedup and angry and jacksons aggressive scraping of the high notes makes plain his frustration7 compositionedit leave me alone is a funk song8 played with a synthesizer and a guitar9 according to musicnotescom the song is set in the key of eb minor with jacksons voice range being sung from bb3 to ab510 the songs tempo is moderate and its metronome is 112 beats per minute10 critical and commercial receptionedit leave me alone has the angry edge that is lacking in much of the song bad richard harrington a writer for the washington post11 leave me alone was generally well received by contemporary music critics stephen thomas erlewine a writer for allmusic stated he felt that leave me alone was the best track on bad commenting why are all of his best songs paranoid anthems5 steve morse a writer for the boston globe described leave me alone as a sendup of jacksons feuds with the paparazzifilled tabloids12 jon pareles of the new york times commented that leave me alone had an unmistakable message13 after jacksons death in june 2009 rolling stone listed leave me alone as being one of jacksons most monumental work and the songs composition was generally praised7 leave me alone performed well on various charts it was released as a single outside of the united states and canada the song similar to bads previous singles proved to be a commercial success internationally leave me alones most successful territory was ireland where the song peaked at no 114 the song saw similar chart success on the united kingdom the netherlands norwegian and switzerland charts peaking within the top 10 at nos 2 5 6 and 10 respectively1516 leave me alone also peaked within the top 20 in austria france and sweden peaking at nos 15 17 and 19 respectively15 the single was least successful in australia where the song peaked at number 3717 music videoedit a newspaper with the headline reading michael sleeps in hyperbaric chamber the headline is a reference to a frequent rumor which jackson said was false that he slept in a hyperbaric chamber with an identical photo shown to the one that was attached to the stories which showed jackson lying in a glass box a male indian peafowl is shown looking at the camera the music video for leave me alone was directed by jim blashfield produced by jim blashfield and paul diener and released on january 2 1989 the video was also appeared in the 1988 film moonwalker18 in essence the video is an amusement park consisting of stylistically crude images based around jacksons successful career since 1982s thriller there is an emphasis on the tabloid view of jacksons personal life and public image referring to the nickname wacko jacko given to him by the press and the various headlines associated with him in the 1980s19 lampooning rumours that he tried to purchase joseph merricks bones jackson dances with stop motion elephant man bones in the video19 this particular segment without the image of the bones was used for the singles cover art and the moonwalker trailer in the video there are images of shrines to actress elizabeth taylor a real life close friend of jackson throughout the video newspaper headlines published by national intruder with bizarre titles are shown such as michaels spaceage diet and michael proposes to liz another notable scene in the music video was a nose being chased by a surgical scalpel which was reference to jacksons plastic surgery being criticized by the media at the end of the video it is revealed that a gigantic jackson himself is the amusement park he breaks free tearing the park to pieces that scene is a somewhat reminiscent of gullivers travels where gulliver eventually breaks free from the lilliputians bonds20 the video is included on michael jacksons vision and the target version dvd of bad 25 leave me alone was the recipient of multiple nominations for its music video the video won a grammy award in 1990 for best short form music video at the 32nd grammy awards21 also leave me alone video won the cannes gold lion award for best special effects httpwwwblashfieldstudiocommusicvideoshtml the video also received six nominations at the 1989 mtv
