the native lushootseed name of the duwamish river and of the cedar river was dxwdəw the lushootseed name of the duwamish tribe was dxwdəwabš or dkhwduwabsh meaning people of the inside1 both of these have been anglicized as duwamish historyedit this 1909 topographical map of greater seattle shows the old route of the duwamish lower center maps showing the changes of course and nomenclature of rivers in the duwamish valley 18991959 until 1906 the white and green rivers combined at auburn and joined the black river at tukwila to form the duwamish in 1906 however the white river changed course following a major flood and emptied into the puyallup river as it does today the lower portion of the historic white river—from the historic confluence of the white and green rivers to the conjunction with the black river—is now considered part of the green river later in 1911 the cedar river was diverted to empty into lake washington instead of into the black river at that time the lake itself still emptied into the black river then with the opening of the lake washington ship canal in 1916 the lakes level dropped nearly nine feet and the black river dried up from that time forward the point of the name change from green to duwamish is no longer the confluence of the green and black rivers though it has not changed location2 the duwamish waterway empties into elliott bay in seattle after the completion of the manmade harbor island in 1909 the mouth of the river was divided into two channels the east and west waterways when the first europeanamericans arrived in the area in 1851 they found the dkhw’duw’absh people living in more than 90 longhouses in at least 17 villages in modernday seattle and environs radiocarbondating of artifacts indicates that indigenous tribes have lived along the duwamish since at least the sixth century ad the dkhw’duw’absh traditionally used the river to hunt ducks and geese fish for salmon cod and halibut harvest clams and gather berries camas and other plants for food and medicinal purposes1 native villages on the duwamish were eventually supplanted by white settlement and commercial use and there was evidence of deliberate burning of indian longhouses in 18933 duwamish people continued to work and fish in the area using manmade ballast island on the seattle waterfront as a canoe haulout and informal market4 but by the early 20th century most remnants of traditional life along the river had disappeared the last yearround native residents on the river an old man named seetoowathl and his wife died of starvation in their floathouse on kellogg island in the winter of 192056 in 1895 eugene semple who had earlier served as governor of washington territory outlined a plan for a series of major public works projects in the seattle area including the straightening and dredging of the duwamish river both to open up the area to commercial use and to alleviate flooding in 1909 the city of seattle formed the duwamish waterway commission in order to sell bonds and oversee the rechannelling of the river work began in october 1913 and the oxbows gradually disappeared with a few recesses in the channel left to accommodate high water flows and turning ships parts of the georgetown and south park neighborhoods once on quiet riverbank found themselves inland the georgetown steam plant was now almost a mile from the river and special water pumping facilities had to be installed by 1920 4½ miles of the duwamish waterway had been dredged to a depth of 50 feet with 20 million cubic feet of mud and sand going into the expansion of harbor island7 the shallow meandering ninemilelong river became a fivemile engineered waterway capable of handling oceangoing vessels8 the duwamish basin soon became seattles industrial and commercial core area activities included cargo handling and storage marine construction ship and boat manufacturing concrete manufacturing paper and metals fabrication food processing and countless other industrial operations boeing plant 1 was established on the lower duwamish in 1916 and boeing plant 2 further upriver in 19368 the lower waterway is spanned by four major public bridges the first avenue south bridge the south park bridge the spokane street bridge and directly above the latter the west seattle bridge with the spread of ecological concerns in the 1970s various environmental tribal and community organizations became interested in the severely polluted duwamish kellogg island the last remnant of the original river was declared a wildlife preserve and nearby terminal t107 was converted into a park creating a substantial natural area near the mouth of the river9 cleanup and restoration efforts are ongoing10 in 2009 the duwamish longhouse and cultural center was opened on the west bank of the river as part of the tribes reassertion of its historic rights in the area and its continuing struggle for federal recognition of tribal status3 pollutionedit the green river at tukwila slightly upstream of where it becomes the duwamish the duwamish at south park seattle due to 20th century industrial contamination the lower 5 miles 80 km of the duwamish was declared a superfund site by the united states environmental protection agency the contaminants include pcbs pahs mercury and phthalates11 the cleanup of the river has been controversial one plan for an early action or hotspot cleanup proposed to dredge contaminated sediment and dump the resulting sludge in tacomas commencement bay 26 miles 42 km to the southwest opposition to this plan in both seattle and tacoma forced the sludge to be shipped to klickitat county in south central washington instead of disposal in puget sound12 the riverwide cleanup plan was released for public review on february 28 2013 epas community advisory group for the site the duwamish river cleanup coalitiontechnical advisory group conducted a review of the plan and published a community fact sheet with a summary of its assessment and recommendations for improvement the duwamish river faces many types of pollution in addition to the contaminants named above one major form of pollution is fecal coliform caused by sewage overflow even if these overflows were to be cleaned up the overall quality of the water would not improve much the duwamish rivers most common pollutant is petroleum13 other contamination would still occur from farms surface runoff or failing septic tanks14 wildlifeedit despite the industrialization of the duwamish river it remains an important habitat for the thousands of salmon and trout that visit the marshes and estuaries each year to spawn the duwamish supports chinook coho chum and steelhead not to mention the more rare sockeye searun cutthroat trout and bull trout pink salmon run in the millions every oddnumbered years in recent history15 many of the animal species found in or around the river contain an unhealthy amount of contaminants for example other than salmon any type of fish or shellfish found in the river is unfit for human consumption it was found that pcb levels in fish and crab that live in the waterway most of their lives are 35 to 110 times higher than in puget sound salmon the ecological risk assessment also found that river otters from the lower duwamish river might be exposed to such high levels of pcbs that the growth or survival of their offspring may be reduced16 see alsoedit list of rivers of washington referencesedit a b duwamish tribeculture and history httpwwwduwamishtribeorgculturehtml
