always sang as a child i was one of those kids who just liked to sing some kids sing in choirs others like to show off in front of the mirror i was in the church choir and i also loved listening to singers on the radio–the bbc or radio luxembourg–or watching them on tv and in the movies10 in september 1950 keith richards and jagger were classmates at wentworth primary school dartford in 1954 jagger passed the elevenplus and went to dartford grammar school which now has the mick jagger centre named after its most famous alumnus installed within the schools site jagger and richards lost contact with each other when they went to different schools but after a chance encounter on platform two at dartford railway station in july 1960 resumed their friendship and discovered their shared love of rhythm and blues which for jagger had begun with little richard1112 jagger left school in 1961 after passing seven olevels and three alevels with richards he moved into a flat in edith grove chelsea london with guitarist brian jones while richards and jones planned to start their own rhythm and blues group blues incorporated jagger continued to study business on a government grant as an undergraduate student at the london school of economics13 and had seriously considered becoming either a journalist or a politician comparing the latter to a pop star1415 brian jones using the name elmo jones began working at the ealing club — where he later ran into a loosely knit version of blues incorporated jagger and richards began to jam with the group where jagger eventually became a featured singer this resulted in him richards and jones beginning to practice on their own16 this practice eventually laid the foundation of the rolling stones16 in 1963 jagger dropped out of the london school of economics to pursue a career in the music industry with the rolling stones in what was originally considered just another beatboom band12 1962–present the rolling stonesedit main article the rolling stones 1960sedit jagger in 1965 in their earliest days the rolling stones played for no money in the interval of alexis korners gigs at a basement club opposite ealing broadway tube station subsequently called ferrys club at the time the group had very little equipment and needed to borrow korners gear to play the groups first appearance under the name the rollin stones after one of their favourite muddy waters tunes was at the marquee club a jazz club in london on 12 july 1962 they would later change their name to the rolling stones as it seemed more formal victor bockris states that the band members included jagger keith richards brian jones ian stewart on piano dick taylor on bass and tony chapman on drums however richards states in his memoir life that the drummer that night was mick avorynot tony chapman as history has mysteriously handed it down17 by autumn 1963 jagger had left the london school of economics in favour of his promising musical career with the rolling stones the group continued to play songs by american rhythm and blues artists such as chuck berry and bo diddley but with the strong encouragement of manager andrew loog oldham jagger and richards soon began to write their own songs this core songwriting partnership took some time to develop one of their early compositions as tears go by was a song written for marianne faithfull a young singer loog oldham was promoting at the time18 for the rolling stones the duo would write the last time the groups third no 1 single in the uk their first two uk no 1 hits had been remakes of songs that had previously been recorded by other artists its all over now by bobby womack19 and little red rooster by willie dixon20 based on this may be the last time a traditional negro spiritual song recorded by the staple singers in 195521 jagger and richards also wrote their first international hit i cant get no satisfaction it also established the rolling stones image as defiant troublemakers in contrast to the beatles lovable moptop image22 jagger told stephen schiff in a 1992 vanity fair profile23 i wasnt trying to be rebellious in those days i was just being me i wasnt trying to push the edge of anything im being me and ordinary the guy from suburbia who sings in this band but someone older might have thought it was just the most awful racket the most terrible thing and where are we going if this is music but all those songs we sang were pretty tame really people didnt think they were but i thought they were tame242526 the group released several successful albums including decembers children and everybodys aftermath and between the buttons but in their personal lives their behaviour was brought into question in 1967 jagger and richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences jagger was sentenced to three months imprisonment for possession of four overthecounter pep pills he had purchased in italy the traditionally conservative editor of the times william reesmogg wrote an article critical of the sentences and on appeal richards sentence was overturned and jaggers was amended to a conditional discharge although he ended up spending one night inside londons brixton prison27 the rolling stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade2816 by the release of the stones album beggars banquet brian jones was only sporadically contributing to the band jagger stated that jones was not psychologically suited to this way of life29 his drug use had become a hindrance and he was unable to obtain a us visa richards reported that in a june meeting with jagger richards and watts at jones house jones admitted that he was unable to go on the road again and left the band saying ive left and if i want to i can come back30 on 3 july 1969 less than a month later jones drowned under mysterious circumstances in the swimming pool at his home cotchford farm in hartfield east sussex31 on 5 july 1969 two days

naked buttocks a photo that sold at sothebys auction house in 1986 for 4000162 jagger was reported to be a contender for the anonymous subject of carly simons 1973 hit song youre so vain on which he sings backing vocals163 although don mclean does not use jaggers name in his song american pie he alludes to jagger onstage at altamont calling him satan164 in 2010 a retrospective exhibition of portraits of jagger was presented at the festival rencontres darles in france the catalogue of the exhibition is the first photo album of jagger and shows his evolution over 50 years165 he was listed as one of the fifty bestdressed over 50 by the guardian in march 2013166 maroon 5s song moves like jagger is about jagger jagger himself acknowledged the song in an interview calling the concept very flattering167 jagger is also referenced in keshas song tik tok the black eyed peas hit the time dirty bit and his vocal delivery is referenced by rapper ghostface killah in his song the champ from his 2006 album fishscale which was later referenced by kanye west in the 2008 ti and jayz single swagga like us in 1998 the mtv animated show celebrity deathmatch had a clayanimated fight to the death between jagger and aerosmith lead singer steven tyler jagger wins the fight by using his tongue to stab tyler through the chest the 2000 film almost famous set in 1973 refers to jagger because if you think mick jaggerll still be out there trying to be a rock star at age 50 youre sadly sadly mistaken168 in 2012 jagger was among the british cultural icons selected by artist sir peter blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the beatles sgt peppers lonely hearts club band album cover – to celebrate the british cultural figures of his life that he most admires169 jaggers net worth has been estimated at 360 million170 legacyedit jagger singing during the rolling stones 50 counting tour in boston massachusetts 12 june 2013 in the words of british dramatist and novelist philip norman the only point concerning mick jaggers influence over young people that doctors and psychologists agreed on was that it wasnt under any circumstances fundamentally harmless171 according to norman even elvis presley at his most scandalous had not exerted a power so wholly and disturbingly physical presley he wrote in 1984 while he made girls scream did not have jaggers ability to make men feel uncomfortable171 norman also likens jagger in his early performances with the rolling stones in the 1960s to a male ballet dancer with his conflicting and colliding sexuality the swans neck and smeared harlot eyes allied to an overstuffed and straining codpiece171 his performance style has been studied by academics who analysed gender image and sexuality172 for example one author noted that jaggers performance style opened up definitions of gendered masculinity and so laid the foundations for selfinvention and sexual plasticity which are now an integral part of contemporary youth culture173 his stage personas also contributed significantly to the british tradition of popular music that always featured the character song and where the art of singing becomes a matter of acting—which creates a question about the singers relationship to his own words174 his voice has been described as a powerful expressive tool for communicating feelings to his audience and expressing an alternative vision of society175 to express virility and unrestrained passion he developed techniques previously used by african american preachers and gospel singers such as the roar the guttural belt style of singing and the buzz a more nasal and raspy sound175 steven van zandt wrote the acceptance of jaggers voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock roll he broke open the door for everyone else suddenly eric burdon and van morrison werent so weird – even bob dylan176 jagger has been described as one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock roll by allmusic and msn3177 with billboard sharing a similar sentiment calling him the rock and roll frontman178179 musician david bowie joined many rock bands with blues folk and soul orientations in his first attempts as a musician in the mid1960s and he was to recall i used to dream of being their mick jagger180 bowie would also offer that i think mick jagger would be astounded and amazed if he realized that to many people he is not a sex symbol but a mother image181 jagger appeared on rolling stones list of 100 greatest singers at number 16 in the article lenny kravitz wrote i sometimes talk to people who sing perfectly in a technical sense who dont understand mick jagger his sense of pitch and melody is really sophisticated his vocals are stunning flawless in their own kind of perfection182 this edition also cites mick jagger as a key influence on jack white steven tyler and iggy pop182 more recently his cultural legacy is also associated with his ageing and continued energetic vitality bon jovi frontman jon bon jovi also a veteran has said we continue to make number one records and fill stadiums but will we still be doing 150 shows per tour i just cant see it i dont know how the hell mick jagger does it at 67 that would be the first question id ask him he runs around the stage as much as i do yet hes got almost 20 years on me183 since his early career jagger has embodied what some authors describe as a dionysian archetype of eternal youth personified by many rock stars and the rock culture184 jagger has repeatedly said that he will not write an autobiography however according to journalist john blake coauthor of the book up and down with the rolling stones in the early 1980s after a slew of unauthorised books about him jagger was persuaded by lord weidenfeld to prepare his own for a £1 million advance the resulting 75000word manuscript is now held by blake who he says was briefly on track to publish it until jagger withdrew support185
