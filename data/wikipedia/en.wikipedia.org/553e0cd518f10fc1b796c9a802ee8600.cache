consequence of sound 13 entertainment weekly b14 ign 8915 the independent 3 rolling stone 16 newsday favorable17 the times 18 upon its release this is it received mixed to positive reviews from music critics simon vozicklevinson of entertainment weekly praised the album and gave it an overall rating of a b vozicklevinson described the albums track this is it as being an uplifting ballad and felt that if youre feeling generous you can count the minimally distinguishable orchestra version of this is it having thought of it as being a decent if slight addition to jacksons songbook vozicklevinson stated that while the albums second disc only contains four tracks that were unreleased that included a fairly unremarkable spokenword poem after hearing jackson work out the vocal harmonies for beat it he in particular felt that this is it was well worth the price of admission or at least a healthy chunk of it14 brian linder of ign described this is it as a freshly designed release of a greatest hits album and that the albums tracks of an allvocal arrangement of beat it was particularly awesome and the acoustic version of shes out of my life allows jacksons vocals to shine without the distraction of dated 70s musical underpinnings linder did note that he felt that the album was both a fitting tribute to jackson and a crass commercial doubledip15 will hines of consequence of sound gave this is it a rating of four and a half out of five stars hines commented that on one level of the album its an attempt to focus and draw attention to what michael jackson lived for and not what he did on a more superficial level this is sony milking his legacy any true mj fan will already own 90 of the songs that make up this twodisc set it is however that 10 which justifies this album’s existence13 negative reviews from critics were mainly centered around them feeling that the album was released only for profit stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic gave this is it two and a half out of five stars erlewine commented that an important thing to remember when considering the soundtrack to this is it this entire film and cd project was never supposed to happen he noted that jacksons death had created considerable demand for his final rehearsal footage and that this is it was an accompaniment to the film12 andy gill of the independent strongly criticized this is it describing it as being a shoddy apology for an album and felt that it was made just for a profit commenting as a cashin attempt to scrape as much money from fans memories with as little outlay as possible however it rivals rcas ruthless and still ongoing reconfigurations of elvis presleys back catalogue but then what should one expect from jacksons executors his own fathers immediate reaction to michaels death seemed to involve the promotion of his own label while his brothers quickly grabbed the opportunity to scour through a box of tapes and find a tepid old track not previously deemed worthy of release and add their own vocals to it before taking the trouble to find out it was cowritten by paul anka who understandably sought remuneration for his work who exactly stands to gain from this not the fans thats for sure in the four months since his death sony and motownuniversal between them have issued no fewer than five posthumous album packages the collection hello world the stripped mixes the remix suite and now this is it thats a busy promotion schedule for a dead man at some point presumably he will be left to rest in peace3 commercial performanceedit this is it debuted at number one on the
