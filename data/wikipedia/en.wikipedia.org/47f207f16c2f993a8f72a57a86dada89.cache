national security agency nsa collects internet communications from at least nine major us internet companies123 the program is also known by the sigad us984xn45 prism collects stored internet communications based on demands made to internet companies such as google inc under section 702 of the fisa amendments act of 2008 to turn over any data that match courtapproved search terms6 the nsa can use these prism requests to target communications that were encrypted when they traveled across the internet backbone to focus on stored data that telecommunication filtering systems discarded earlier78 and to get data that is easier to handle among other things9 prism began in 2007 in the wake of the passage of the protect america act under the bush administration1011 the program is operated under the supervision of the us foreign intelligence surveillance court fisa court or fisc pursuant to the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa12 its existence was leaked six years later by nsa contractor edward snowden who warned that the extent of mass data collection was far greater than the public knew and included what he characterized as dangerous and criminal activities13 the disclosures were published by the guardian and the washington post on june 6 2013 subsequent documents have demonstrated a financial arrangement between nsas special source operations division sso and prism partners in the millions of dollars14 documents indicate that prism is the number one source of raw intelligence used for nsa analytic reports and it accounts for 91 of the nsas internet traffic acquired under fisa section 702 authority1516 the leaked information came to light one day after the revelation that the fisa court had been ordering a subsidiary of telecommunications company verizon communications to turn over to the nsa logs tracking all of its customers telephone calls1718 us government officials have disputed some aspects of the guardian and washington post stories and have defended the program by asserting it cannot be used on domestic targets without a warrant that it has helped to prevent acts of terrorism and that it receives independent oversight from the federal governments executive judicial and legislative branches1920 on june 19 2013 us president barack obama during a visit to germany stated that the nsas data gathering practices constitute a

at the time an nsa contractor – during a visit to hong kong12 the leaked documents included 41 powerpoint slides four of which were published in news articles12 the documents identified several technology companies as participants in the prism program including microsoft in 2007 yahoo in 2008 google in 2009 facebook in 2009 paltalk in 2009 youtube in 2010 aol in 2011 skype in 2011 and apple in 201222 the speakers notes in the briefing document reviewed by the washington post indicated that 98 percent of prism production is based on yahoo google and microsoft1 the slide presentation stated that much of the worlds electronic communications pass through the us because electronic communications data tend to follow the least expensive route rather than the most physically direct route and the bulk of the worlds internet infrastructure is based in the united states15 the presentation noted that these facts provide united states intelligence analysts with opportunities for intercepting the communications of foreign targets as their electronic data pass into or through the united states215 snowdens subsequent disclosures included statements that government agencies such as the united kingdoms gchq also undertook mass interception and tracking of internet and communications data23 – described by germany as nightmarish if true24 – allegations that the nsa engaged in dangerous and criminal activity by hacking civilian infrastructure networks in other countries such as universities hospitals and private businesses13 and alleged that compliance offered only very limited restrictive effect on mass data collection practices including of americans since restrictions are policybased not technically based and can change at any time adding that additionally audits are cursory incomplete and easily fooled by fake justifications13 with numerous selfgranted exceptions and that nsa policies encourage staff to assume the benefit of the doubt in cases of uncertainty252627 the slidesedit below are a number of slides released by edward snowden showing the operation and processes behind the prism program it should be noted that the faa referred to is

along with other associated documents the programedit prism logo prism is a program from the special source operations sso division of the nsa which in the tradition of nsas intelligence alliances cooperates with as many as 100 trusted us companies since the 1970s1 a prior program the terrorist surveillance program3031 was implemented in the wake of the september 11 attacks under the george w bush administration but was widely criticized and challenged as illegal because it did not include warrants obtained from the foreign intelligence surveillance court3132333435 prism was authorized by the foreign intelligence surveillance court15 prism was enabled under president bush by the protect america act of 2007 and by the fisa amendments act of 2008 which immunizes private companies from legal action when they cooperate with us government agencies in intelligence collection in 2012 the act was renewed by congress under president obama for an additional five years through december 201723637 according to the register the fisa amendments act of 2008 specifically authorizes intelligence agencies to monitor the phone email and other communications of us citizens for up to a week without obtaining a warrant when one of the parties is outside the us36 the most detailed description of the prism program can be found in a report about nsas collection efforts under section 702 faa that was released by the privacy and civil liberties oversight board pclob on july 2 201438 according to this report prism is only used to collect internet communications not telephone conversations these internet communications are not collected in bulk but in a targeted way only communications that are to or from specific selectors like email addresses can be gathered under prism theres no collection based upon keywords or names38 the actual collection process is done by the data intercept technology unit ditu of the fbi which on behalf of the nsa sends the selectors to the us internet service providers which were previously served with a section 702 directive under this directive the provider is legally obliged to hand over to ditu all communications to or from the selectors provided by the government38 ditu then sends these communications to nsa where they are stored in various databases depending on their type data both content and metadata that already have been collected under the prism program may be searched for both us and nonus person identifiers these kinds of queries became known as backdoor searches and are conducted by nsa fbi and cia39 each of these agencies has slightly different protocols and safeguards to protect searches with a us person identifier38 extent of the programedit internal nsa presentation slides included in the various media disclosures show that the nsa could unilaterally access data and perform extensive indepth surveillance on live communications and stored information with examples including email video and voice chat videos photos voiceoverip chats such as skype file transfers and social networking details2 snowden summarized that in general the reality is this if an nsa fbi cia dia etc analyst has access to query raw sigint signals intelligence databases they can enter and get results for anything they want13 according to the washington post the intelligence analysts search prism data using terms intended to identify suspicious communications of targets whom the analysts suspect with at least 51 percent confidence to not be us citizens but in the process communication data of some us citizens are also collected unintentionally1 training materials for analysts tell them that while they should periodically report such accidental collection of nonforeign us data its nothing to worry about140 according to the guardian nsa had access to chats and emails on hotmailcom skype because microsoft had developed a surveillance capability to deal with the interception of chats and for prism collection against microsoft email services will be unaffected because prism collects this data prior to encryption414243 also according to the guardians glenn greenwald even lowlevel nsa analysts are allowed to search and listen to the communications of americans and other people without court approval and supervision greenwald said low level analysts can via systems like prism listen to whatever emails they want whatever telephone calls browsing histories microsoft word documents30 and its all done with no need to go to a court with no need to even get supervisor approval on the part of the analyst44 he added that the nsa databank with its years of collected communications allows analysts to search that database and listen to the calls or read the emails of everything that the nsa has stored or look at the browsing histories or google search terms that youve entered and it also alerts them to any further activity that people connected to that email address or that ip address do in the future44 greenwald

governmentedit executive branchedit shortly after publication of the reports by the guardian and the washington post the united states director of national intelligence james clapper on june 7 2013 released a statement confirming that for nearly six years the government of the united states had been using large internet services companies such as facebook to collect information on foreigners outside the united states as a defense against national security threats17 the statement read in part the guardian and the washington post articles refer to collection of communications pursuant to section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act they contain numerous inaccuracies47 he went on to say section 702 is a provision of fisa that is designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning nonus persons located outside the united states it cannot be used to intentionally target any us citizen any other us person or anyone located within the united states47 clapper concluded his statement by stating the unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of americans47 on march 12 2013 clapper had told the united states senate select committee on intelligence that the nsa does not wittingly collect any type of data on millions or hundreds of millions of americans48 clapper later admitted the statement he made on march 12 2013 was a lie49 or in his words i responded in what i thought was the most truthful or least untruthful manner by saying no50 on june 7 2013 us president barack obama referring to the prism programcitation needed and the nsas telephone calls logging program said what youve got is two programs that were originally authorized by congress have been repeatedly authorized by congress bipartisan majorities have approved them congress is continually briefed on how these are conducted there are a whole range of safeguards involved and federal judges are overseeing the entire program throughout51 he also said you cant have 100 percent security and then also have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience you know were going to have to make some choices as a society51 in separate statements senior obama administration officials not mentioned by name in source said that congress had been briefed 13 times on the programs since 200952 on june 8 2013 director of national intelligence clapper made an additional public statement about prism and released a fact sheet providing further information about the program which he described as an internal government computer system used to facilitate the governments statutorily authorized collection of foreign intelligence information from electronic communication service providers under court supervision as authorized by section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa 50 usc § 1881a5354 the fact sheet stated that the surveillance activities published in the guardian and the washington post are lawful and conducted under authorities widely known and discussed and fully debated and authorized by congress53 the fact sheet also stated that the united states government does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of us electronic communication service providers all such information is obtained with fisa court approval and with the knowledge of the provider based upon a written directive from the attorney general and the director of national intelligence it said that the attorney general provides fisa court rulings and semiannual reports about prism activities to congress providing an unprecedented degree of accountability and transparency53 democratic senators udall and wyden who serve on the us senate select committee on intelligence subsequently criticized the fact sheet as being inaccurateclarification needed nsa director general keith alexander acknowledged the errors stating that the fact sheet could have more precisely described the requirements governing the collection of email and other internet content from us companies the fact sheet was withdrawn from the nsas website around june 2655 in a closeddoors senate hearing around june 11 fbi director robert mueller said that snowdens leaks had caused significant harm to our nation and to our safety56 in the same senate nsa director alexander defended the programfurther explanation needed alexanders defense was immediately criticized by senators udall and wyden who said they saw no evidence that the nsa programs had produced uniquely valuable intelligence in a joint statement they wrote gen alexanders testimony yesterday suggested that the nsas bulk phone records collection program helped thwart dozens of terrorist attacks but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods5657 on june 18 nsa director alexander said in an open hearing before the house intelligence committee of congress that communications surveillance had helped prevent more than 50 potential terrorist attacks worldwide at least 10 of them involving terrorism suspects or targets in the united states between 2001 and 2013 and that the prism web traffic surveillance program contributed in over 90 percent of those cases585960 according to court records one example alexander gave regarding a thwarted attack by al qaeda on the new york stock exchange was not in fact foiled by surveillance61 several senators wrote director of national intelligence clapper asking him to provide other examples62 us intelligence officials speaking on condition of anonymity told various news outlets that by june 24 they were already seeing what they said was evidence that suspected terrorists had begun changing their communication practices in order to evade detection by the surveillance tools disclosed by snowden6364 legislative branchedit in contrast to their swift and forceful reactions the previous day to allegations that the government had been conducting surveillance of united states citizens telephone records congressional leaders initially had little to say about the prism program the day after leaked information about the program was published several lawmakers declined to discuss prism citing its topsecret classification65 and others said that they had not been aware of the program66 after statements had been released by the president and the director of national intelligence some lawmakers began to comment senator john mccain raz june 9 2013 we passed the patriot act we passed specific provisions of the act that allowed for this program to take place to be enacted in operation67 senator dianne feinstein dca chair of the senate intelligence committee june 9 these programs are within the law part of our obligation is keeping americans safe human intelligence isnt going to do it68 june 9 heres the rub the instances where this has produced good—has disrupted plots prevented terrorist attacks is all classified thats whats so hard about this69 june 11 it went fine we asked him keith alexander to declassify things because it would be helpful for people and lawmakers to better understand the intelligence programs ive just got to see if the information gets declassified im sure people will find it very interesting70 senator rand paul rky june 9 im going to be seeing if i can challenge this at the supreme court level im going to be asking the internet providers and all of the phone companies ask your customers to join me in a classaction lawsuit67 senator susan collins rme member of senate intelligence committee and past member of homeland security committee june 11 i had along with joe lieberman a monthly threat briefing but i did not have access to this highly compartmentalized information and how can you ask when you dont know the program exists71 representative jim sensenbrenner rwi principal sponsor of the patriot act june 9 this is well beyond what the patriot act allows72 president obamas claim that this is the most transparent administration in history has once again proven false in fact it appears that no administration has ever peered more closely or intimately into the lives of innocent americans72 representative mike rogers rmi a chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence june 9 one of the things that were charged with is keeping america safe and keeping our civil liberties and privacy intact i think we have done both in this particular case68 june 9 within the last few years this program was used to stop a program excuse me to stop a terrorist attack in the united states we know that its its its important it fills in a little seam that we have and its used to make sure that there is not an international nexus to any terrorism event that they may believe is ongoing in the united states so in that regard it is a very valuable thing73 senator mark udall dco june 9 i dont think the american public knows the extent or knew the extent to which they were being surveilled and their data was being collected i think we ought to reopen the patriot act and put some limits on the amount of data that the national security agency is collecting it ought to remain sacred and theres got to be a balance here that is what im aiming for lets have the debate lets be transparent lets open this up68 representative todd rokita rin june 10 we have no idea when they foreign intelligence surveillance court meet we have no idea what their judgments are74 representative luis gutierrez dil june 9 we will be receiving secret briefings and we will be asking i know im going to be asking to get more information i want to make sure that what theyre doing is harvesting information that is necessary to keep us safe and not simply going into everybodys private telephone conversations and facebook and communications i mean one of the you know the terrorists win when you debilitate freedom of expression and privacy73 senator ron wyden dor july 11 i have a feeling that the administration is getting concerned about the bulk phone records collection and that they are thinking about whether to move administratively to stop it i think we are making a comeback75 following these statements some lawmakers from both parties warned national security officials during a hearing before the house judiciary committee that they must change their use of sweeping national security agency surveillance programs or face losing the provisions of the foreign intelligence surveillance act that have allowed for the agencys mass collection of telephone metadata76 section 215 expires at the end of 2015 and unless you realize youve got a problem that is not going to be renewed rep jim sensenbrenner rwis author of the usa patriot act threatened during the hearing76 its got to be changed and youve got to change how you operate section 215 otherwise in two and a half years youre not going to have it anymore76 judicial branchedit leaks of classified documents pointed to the role of a special court in enabling the governments secret surveillance programs but members of the court maintained they were not collaborating with the executive branch77 the new york times however reported in july 2013 that in more than a dozen classified rulings the nations surveillance court has created a secret body of law giving the national security agency the power to amass vast collections of data on americans while pursuing not only terrorism suspects but also people possibly involved in nuclear proliferation espionage and cyberattacks78 after members of the us congress pressed the foreign intelligence surveillance court to release declassified versions of its secret ruling the court dismissed those requests arguing that the decisions cant be declassified because they contain classified information79 reggie walton the current fisa presiding judge said in a statement the perception that the court is a rubber stamp is absolutely false there is a rigorous review process of applications submitted by the executive branch spearheaded initially by five judicial branch lawyers who are national security experts and then by the judges to ensure that the courts authorizations comport with what the applicable statutes authorize80 the accusation of being a rubber stamp was further rejected by walton who wrote in a letter to senator patrick j leahy the annual statistics provided to congress by the attorney general —frequently cited to in press reports as a suggestion that the courts approval rate of application is over 99—reflect only the number of final applications submitted to and acted on by the court these statistics do not reflect the fact that many applications are altered to prior or final submission or even withheld from final submission entirely often after an indication that a judge would not approve them81 the us militaryedit the us military has acknowledged blocking access to parts of the guardian website for thousands of defense personnel across the country82 and blocking the entire guardian website for personnel stationed throughout afghanistan the middle east and south asia83 a spokesman said the military was filtering out reports and content relating to government surveillance programs to preserve network hygiene and prevent any classified material from appearing on unclassified parts of its computer systems82 access to the washington post which also published information on classified nsa surveillance programs disclosed by edward snowden had not been blocked at the time the blocking of access to the guardian was reported83 responses and involvement of other countriesedit austriaedit the former head of the austrian federal office for the protection of the constitution and counterterrorism gertrené polli stated he knew the prism program under a different name and stated that surveillance activities had occurred in austria as well polli had publicly stated in 2009 that he had received requests from us intelligence agencies to do things that would be in violation of austrian law which polli refused to allow8485 australiaedit the australian government has said it will investigate the impact of the prism program and the use of the pine gap surveillance facility on the privacy of australian citizens86 australias former foreign minister bob carr said that australians shouldnt be concerned about prism but that cybersecurity is high on the governments list of concerns87 the australian foreign minister julie bishop stated that the acts of edward snowden were treachery and offered a staunch defence of her nations intelligence cooperation with the united states88 braziledit brazils president dilma rousseff responded to snowdens reports that the nsa spied on her phone calls and emails by cancelling a planned october 2013 state visit to the united states demanding an official apology which by october 20 2013 hadnt come89 also rousseff classified the spying as unacceptable between more harsh words in a speech before the un general assembly on september 24 201390 as a result boeing lost out on a us45 billion contract for fighter jets to swedens saab group91 canadaedit cse headquarters in ottawa canadas national cryptologic agency the communications security establishment cse said that commenting on prism would undermine cses ability to carry out its mandate privacy commissioner jennifer stoddart lamented canadas standards when it comes to protecting personal online privacy stating we have fallen too far behind in her report while other nations data protection authorities have the legal power to make binding orders levy hefty fines and take meaningful action in the event of serious data breaches we are restricted to a soft approach persuasion encouragement and at the most the potential to publish the names of transgressors in the public interest and when push comes to shove stoddart wrote short of a costly and timeconsuming court battle we have no power to enforce our recommendations9293 european unionedit on 20 october 2013 a committee at the european parliament backed a measure that if it is enacted would require american companies to seek clearance from european officials before complying with united states warrants seeking private data the legislation has been under consideration for two years the vote is part of efforts in europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of revelations about a farreaching spying program by the us national security agency94 germany and france have also had ongoing mutual talks about how they can keep european email traffic from going across american servers95 franceedit on october 21 2013 the french foreign minister laurent fabius summoned the us ambassador charles rivkin to the quai dorsay in paris to protest largescale spying on french citizens by the us national security agency nsa paris prosecutors had opened preliminary inquiries into the nsa program in july but fabius said … obviously we need to go further and we must quickly assure that these practices arent repeated96 germanyedit germany did not receive any raw prism data according to a reuters report97 german chancellor angela merkel said that the internet is new to all of us to explain the nature of the program matthew schofield of mcclatchy washington bureau said she was roundly mocked for that statement98 gertrené polli a former austrian counterterrorism official said in 2013 that it is absurd and unnatural for the german authorities to pretend not to have known anything8485 the german army was using prism to support its operations in afghanistan as early as 201199 in october 2013 it was reported that the nsa monitored merkels cell phone100 the united states denied the report but following the allegations merkel called president obama and told him that spying on friends was never acceptable no matter in what situation101 israeledit israeli newspaper calcalist discussed102 the business insider article103 about the possible involvement of technologies from two secretive israeli companies in the prism program—verint systems and narus mexicoedit after finding out about the prism program the mexican government has started constructing its own spying program to spy on its own citizens according to jenaro villamil a writer from procesco cisen mexicos intelligence agency has started to work with ibm and hewlett packard to develop its own data gathering software facebook twitter emails and other social network sites are going to be priority104 new zealandedit in new zealand university of otago information science associate professor hank wolfe said that under what was unofficially known as the five eyes alliance new zealand and other governments including the united states australia canada and britain dealt with internal spying by saying they didnt do it but they have all the partners doing it for them and then they share all the information105 edward snowden in a live streamed google hangout to kim dotcom and julian assange alleged that he had received intelligence from new zealand and the nsa has listening posts in new zealand106 spainedit at a meeting of european union leaders held the week of 21 october 2013 mariano rajoy spains prime minister said that spying activities arent proper among partner countries and allies on 28 october 2013 the spanish government summoned the american ambassador james costos to address allegations that the us had collected data on 60 million telephone calls in spain separately íñigo méndez de vigo a spanish secretary of state referred to the need to maintain a necessary balance between security and privacy concerns but said that the recent allegations of spying if proven to be true are improper and unacceptable between partners and friendly countries107 united kingdomedit further information mass surveillance in the united kingdom in the united kingdom the government communications headquarters gchq which also has its own surveillance program tempora had access to the prism program on or before june 2010 and wrote 197 reports with it in 2012 alone but after 2014 the tempora lost its access to the prism programmecitation needed the intelligence and security committee of the uk parliament reviewed the reports gchq produced on the basis of intelligence sought from the us they found in each case a warrant for interception was in place in accordance with the legal safeguards contained in uk law108 in august 2013 the guardian newspapers offices were visited by agents from gchq who ordered and supervised the destruction of the hard drives containing information acquired from snowden109 companiesedit the original washington post and guardian articles reporting on prism noted that one of the leaked briefing documents said prism involves collection of data directly from the servers of several major internet services providers12 initial public statementsedit corporate executives of several companies identified in the leaked documents told the guardian that they had no knowledge of the prism program in particular and also denied making information available to the government on the scale alleged by news reports2110 statements of several of the companies named in the leaked documents were reported by techcrunch and the washington post as follows111112 microsoft we provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so and never on a voluntary basis in addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers if the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we dont participate in it111113 yahoo yahoo takes users privacy very seriously we do not provide the government with direct access to our servers systems or network111 of the hundreds of millions of users we serve an infinitesimal percentage will ever be the subject of a government data collection directive112 facebook we do not provide any government organization with direct access to facebook servers when facebook is asked for data or information about specific individuals we carefully scrutinize any such request for compliance with all applicable laws and provide information only to the extent required by law111 google google cares deeply about the security of our users data we disclose user data to government in accordance with the law and we review all such requests carefully from time to time people allege that we have created a government back door into our systems but google does not have a backdoor for the government to access private user data111 any suggestion that google is disclosing information about our users internet activity on such a scale is completely false112 apple we have never heard of prism we do not provide any government agency with direct access to our servers and any government agency requesting customer data must get a court order114 dropbox weve seen reports that dropbox might be asked to participate in a government program called prism we are not part of any such program and remain committed to protecting our users privacy111 in response to the technology companies denials of the nsa being able to directly access the companies servers the new york times reported that sources had stated the nsa was gathering the surveillance data from the companies using other technical means in response to court orders for specific sets of data17 the washington post suggested it is possible that the conflict between the prism slides and the company spokesmen is the result of imprecision on the part of the nsa author in another classified report obtained by the post the arrangement is described as allowing collection managers to send content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at companycontrolled locations rather than directly to company servers1 in context direct is more likely to mean that the nsa is receiving data sent to them deliberately by the tech companies as opposed to intercepting communications as theyre transmitted to some other destination112 if these companies received an order under the fisa amendments act they are forbidden by law from disclosing having received the order and disclosing any information about the order at all mark rumold staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation told abc news115 on may 28 2013 google was ordered by united states district court judge susan illston to comply with a national security letter issued by the fbi to provide user data without a warrant116 kurt opsahl a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in an interview with venturebeat said i certainly appreciate that google put out a transparency report but it appears that the transparency didnt include this i wouldnt be surprised if they were subject to a gag order117 the new york times reported on june 7 2013 that twitter declined to make it easier for the government but other companies were more compliant according to people briefed on the negotiations118 the other companies held discussions with national security personnel on how to make data available more efficiently and securely118 in some cases these companies made modifications to their systems in support of the intelligence collection effort118 the dialogues have continued in recent months as general martin dempsey the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has met with executives including those at facebook microsoft google and intel118 these details on the discussions provide insight into the disparity between initial descriptions of the government program including a training slide which states collection directly from the servers119 and the companies denials118 while providing data in response to a legitimate fisa request approved by the fisa court is a legal requirement modifying systems to make it easier for the government to collect the data is not this is why twitter could legally decline to provide an enhanced mechanism for data transmission118 other than twitter the companies were effectively asked to construct a locked mailbox and provide the key to the government people briefed on the negotiations said118 facebook for instance built such a system for requesting and sharing the information118 google does not provide a lockbox system but instead transmits required data by hand delivery or ssh120 postprism transparency reportsedit in response to the publicity surrounding media reports of datasharing several companies requested permission to reveal more public information about the nature and scope of information provided in response to national security requests on june 14 2013 facebook reported that the us government had authorized the communication of about these numbers in aggregate and as a range in a press release posted to its web site the company reported for the six months ending december 31 2012 the total number of userdata requests facebook received from any and all government entities in the us including local state and federal and including criminal and national securityrelated requests – was between 9000 and 10000 the company further reported that the requests impacted between 18000 and 19000 user accounts a tiny fraction of one percent of more than 11 billion active user accounts121 that same day microsoft reported that for the same period it received between 6000 and 7000 criminal and national security warrants subpoenas and orders affecting between 31000 and 32000 consumer accounts from us governmental entities including local state and federal which impacted a tiny fraction of microsofts global customer base122 google issued a statement criticizing the requirement that data be reported in aggregated form stating that lumping national security requests with criminal request data would be a step backwards from its previous more detailed practices on its websites transparency report the company said that it would continue to seek government permission to publish the number and extent of fisa requests123 cisco systems saw a huge drop in export sales because of fears that the national security agency could be using backdoors in its products124 on september 12 2014 yahoo reported the us government threatened the imposition of 250000 in fines per day if yahoo didnt hand over user data as part of the nsas prism program125 it is not known if other companies were threatened or fined for not providing data in response to a legitimate fisa requests public and media responseedit domesticedit an elaborate graffito in columbus ohio united states satirizing comprehensive surveillance of telecommunications the new york times editorial board charged that the obama administration has now lost all credibility on this issue126 and lamented that for years members of congress ignored evidence that domestic intelligencegathering had grown beyond their control and even now few seem disturbed to learn that every detail about the publics calling and texting habits now reside in a nsa database127 it wrote with respect to the fisacourt in context of prism that it is a perversion of the american justice system when judicial secrecy is coupled with a onesided presentation of the issues128 according to the new york times the result is a court whose reach is expanding far beyond its original mandate and without any substantive check128 james robertson a former federal district judge based in washington who served on the secret foreign intelligence surveillance act court for three years between 2002 and 2005 and who ruled against the bush administration in the landmark hamdan v rumsfeld case said fisa court is independent but flawed because only the governments side is represented effectively in its deliberations anyone who has been a judge will tell you a judge needs to hear both sides of a case said james robertson129 without this judges do not benefit from adversarial debate he suggested creating an advocate with security clearance who would argue against government filings130 robertson questioned whether the secret fisa court should provide overall legal approval for the surveillance programs saying the court has turned into something like an administrative agency under the changes brought by the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 amendments act of 2008 which expanded the us governments authority by forcing the court to approve entire surveillance systems and not just surveillance warrants as it previously handled the court is now approving programmatic surveillance i dont think that is a judicial function129 robertson also said he was frankly stunned by the new york times report78 that fisa court rulings had created a new body of law broadening the ability of the nsa to use its surveillance programs to target not only terrorists but suspects in cases involving espionage cyberattacks and weapons of mass destruction129 former cia analyst valerie plame wilson and former us diplomat joseph wilson writing in an oped article published in the guardian said that prism and other nsa datamining programs might indeed be very effective in hunting and capturing actual terrorists but we dont have enough information as a society to make that decision131 the electronic frontier foundation eff an international nonprofit digitalrights group based in the us is hosting a tool by which an american resident can write to their government representatives regarding their opposition to mass spying132 the obama administrations argument that nsa surveillance programs such as prism and boundless informant had been necessary to prevent acts of terrorism was challenged by several parties ed pilkington and nicholas watt of the guardian said of the case of najibullah zazi who had planned to bomb the new york city subway that interviews with involved parties and us and british court documents indicated that the investigation into the case had actually been initiated in response to conventional surveillance methods such as oldfashioned tipoffs of the british intelligence services rather than to leads produced by nsa surveillance133 michael daly of the daily beast stated that even though tamerlan tsarnaev who conducted the boston marathon bombing with his brother dzhokhar tsarnaev had visited the al qaedaaffiliated inspire magazine website and even though russian intelligence officials had raised concerns with us intelligence officials about tamerlan tsarnaev prism did not prevent him from carrying out the boston attacks daly observed that the problem is not just what the national security agency is gathering at the risk of our privacy but what it is apparently unable to monitor at the risk of our safety134 ron paul a former republican member of congress and prominent libertarian thanked snowden and greenwald and denounced the mass surveillance as unhelpful and damaging urging instead more transparency in us government actions135 he called congress derelict in giving that much power to the government and said that had he been elected president he would have ordered searches only when there was probable cause of a crime having been committed which he said was not how the prism program was being operated136 new york times columnist thomas l friedman defended limited government surveillance programs intended to protect the american people from terrorist acts yes i worry about potential government abuse of privacy from a program designed to prevent another 911—abuse that so far does not appear to have happened but i worry even more about another 911 if there were another 911 i fear that 99 percent of americans would tell their members of congress do whatever you need to do to privacy be damned just make sure this does not happen again that is what i fear most that is why ill reluctantly very reluctantly trade off the government using data mining to look for suspicious patterns in phone numbers called and email addresses—and then have to go to a judge to get a warrant to actually look at the content under guidelines set by congress—to prevent a day where out of fear we give government a license to look at anyone any email any phone call anywhere anytime137 political commentator david brooks similarly cautioned that government data surveillance programs are a necessary evil if you dont have mass data sweeps well then these agencies are going to want to go back to the oldfashioned eavesdropping which is a lot more intrusive138 conservative commentator charles krauthammer worried less about the legality of prism and other nsa surveillance tools than about the potential for their abuse without more stringent oversight the problem here is not constitutionality we need a toughening of both congressional oversight and judicial review perhaps even some independent outside scrutiny plus periodic legislative revision—say reauthorization every couple of years—in light of the efficacy of the safeguards and the nature of the external threat the object is not to abolish these vital programs its to fix them139 in a blog post david simon the creator of the wire compared the nsas programs including prism to a 1980s effort by the city of baltimore to add dialed number recorders to all pay phones to know which individuals were being called by the callers140 the city believed that drug traffickers were using pay phones and pagers and a municipal judge allowed the city to place the recorders the placement of the dialers formed the basis of the shows first season simon argued that the media attention regarding the nsa programs is a faux scandal140141 simon had stated that many classes of people in american society had already faced constant government surveillance political theorist and frequent critic of us government policies noam chomsky argued governments should not have this capacity but governments will use whatever technology is available to them to combat their primary enemy – which is their own population142 a cnnopinion research corporation poll conducted june 11 through 13 found that 66 of americans generally supported the program143144notes 1 however a quinnipiac university poll conducted june 28 through july 8 found that 45 of registered voters think the surveillance programs have gone too far with 40 saying they do not go far enough compared to 25 saying they had gone too far and 63 saying not far enough in 2010145 other polls have shown similar shifts in public opinion as revelations about the programs were leaked146147 in terms of economic impact a study released in august by the information technology and innovation foundation148 found that the disclosure of prism could cost the us economy between 215 and 35 billion in lost cloud computing business over three years149150151152 internationaledit sentiment around the world was that of general displeasure upon learning the extent of world communication data mining some national leaders spoke against the nsa and some spoke against their own national surveillance one national minister had scathing comments on the national security agencys datamining program citing benjamin franklin the more a society monitors controls and observes its citizens the less free it is153 some question if the costs of hunting terrorists now overshadows the loss of citizen privacy154155 nick xenophon an australian independent senator asked bob carr the australian minister of foreign affairs if email addresses of australian parliamentarians were exempt from prism mainway marina andor nucleon after carr replied that there was a legal framework to protect australians but that the government would not comment on intelligence matters xenophon argued that this was not a specific answer to his question156 taliban spokesperson zabiullah mujahid said we knew about their past efforts to trace our system we have used our technical resources to foil their efforts and have been able to stop them from succeeding so far157158 however cnn has reported that terrorist groups have changed their communications behaviors in response to the leaks63 in 2013 the cloud security alliance surveyed cloud computing stakeholders about their reactions to the us prism spying scandal about 10 of nonus residents indicated that they had cancelled a project with a usbased cloud computing provider in the wake of prism 56 said that they would be less likely to use a usbased cloud computing service the alliance predicted that us cloud computing providers might lose as much as €26 billion and 20 of its share of cloud services in foreign markets because of the prism spying scandal159 china and hong kongedit hong kong rally to support snowden june 15 2013 reactions of internet users in china were mixed between viewing a loss of freedom worldwide and seeing state surveillance coming out of secrecy the story broke just before us president barack obama and chinese president xi jinping met in california160161 when asked about nsa hacking china the spokeswoman of ministry of foreign affairs of the peoples republic of china said china strongly advocates cybersecurity162 the partyowned newspaper liberation daily described this surveillance like nineteen eightyfourstyle163 hong kong legislators gary fan and claudia mo wrote a letter to obama stating the revelations of blanket surveillance of global communications by the worlds leading democracy have damaged the image of the us among freedomloving peoples around the world164 ai weiwei a chinese dissident said even though we know governments do all kinds of things i was shocked by the information about the us surveillance operation prism to me its abusively using government powers to interfere in individuals privacy this is an important moment for international society to reconsider and protect individual rights165 europeedit sophie in t veld a dutch member of the european parliament called prism a violation of eu laws166 digital rights group digitale gesellschaft protest at checkpoint charlie in berlin germany june 18 2013 protesters against prism in berlin germany wearing chelsea manning and edward snowden masks june 19 2013 the german federal commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar condemned the program as monstrous167 he further added that white house claims do not reassure me at all and that given the large number of german users of google facebook apple or microsoft services i expect the german government is committed to clarification and limitation of surveillance steffen seibert press secretary of the chancellors office announced that angela merkel will put these issues on the agenda of the talks with barack obama during his pending visit in berlin168 wolfgang schmidt a former lieutenant colonel with the stasi said that the stasi would have seen such a program as a dream come true since the stasi lacked the technology that made prism possible169 schmidt expressed opposition saying it is the height of naivete to think that once collected this information wont be used this is the nature of secret government organizations the only way to protect the peoples privacy is not to allow the government to collect their information in the first place98 many germans organized protests including one at checkpoint charlie when obama went to berlin to speak matthew schofield of the mcclatchy washington bureau said germans are dismayed at obamas role in allowing the collection of so much information98 the italian president of the guarantor for the protection of personal data antonello soro said that the surveillance dragnet would not be legal in italy and would be contrary to the principles of our legislation and would represent a very serious violation170 cnil french data protection watchdog intimates google to change its privacy policies within three months or itll risk fines up to 150000 euros spanish agency of data protection aepd is planning to fine google between 40k and 300k euros if it fails to clear about the past usage of the massive data of the spanish users171 william hague the foreign secretary of the united kingdom dismissed accusations that british security agencies had been circumventing british law by using information gathered on british citizens by prism172 saying any data obtained by us from the united states involving uk nationals is subject to proper uk statutory controls and safeguards172 david cameron said britains spy agencies that received data collected from prism acted within the law im satisfied that we have intelligence agencies that do a fantastically important job for this country to keep us safe and they operate within the law172173 malcolm rifkind the chairman of parliaments intelligence and security committee said that if the british intelligence agencies were seeking to know the content of emails about people living in the uk then they actually have to get lawful authority173 the uks information commissioners office was more cautious saying it would investigate prism alongside other european data agencies there are real issues about the extent to which us law agencies can access personal data of uk and other european citizens aspects of us law under which companies can be compelled to provide information to us agencies potentially conflict with european data protection law including the uks own data protection act the ico has raised this with its european counterparts and the issue is being considered by the european commission who are in discussions with the us government166 tim bernerslee the inventor of the world wide web accused western governments of practicing hypocrisy174 as they conducted spying on the internet while they criticized other countries for spying on the internet175 bernerslee said that internet spying can make people feel reluctant to access intimate details or use the internet in a certain way and as paraphrased by steve robson of the daily mail he said that the internet should be protected from being controlled by governments or large corporations174 indiaedit minister of external affairs salman khurshid defended the prism program saying this is not scrutiny and access to actual messages it is only computer analysis of patterns of calls and emails that are being sent it is not actually snooping specifically on content of anybodys message or conversation some of the information they got out of their scrutiny they were able to use it to prevent serious terrorist attacks in several countries176 his comments contradicted his foreign ministrys characterization of violations of privacy as unacceptable177178 when minister of communications and information technology kapil sibal was asked about khurshids comments he refused to comment on them directly but said we do not know the nature of data or information sought as part of prism even the external ministry does not have any idea179 the media felt that khurshids defence of prism was because the india government was rolling out the central monitoring system cms which is similar to the prism program180181182 khurshids comments were criticized by the indian media183184 as well as opposition party cpim who stated the upa government should have strongly protested against such surveillance and bugging instead it is shocking that khurshid has sought to justify it this shameful remark has come at a time when even the close allies of the us like germany and france have protested against the snooping on their countries185 rajya sabha mp p rajeev told the times of india that the act of the usa is a clear violation of vienna convention on diplomatic relations but khurshid is trying to justify it and the speed of the government of india to reject the asylum application of edward snowden is shameful186 legal aspectsedit applicable law and practiceedit on june 8 2013 the director of national intelligence issued a fact sheet stating that prism is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program but rather an internal government computer system used to facilitate the collection of foreign intelligence information under court supervision as authorized by section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa 50 usc § 1881a53 section 702 provides that the attorney general and the director of national intelligence may authorize jointly for a period of up to 1 year from the effective date of the authorization the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states to acquire foreign intelligence information187 in order to authorize the targeting the attorney general and director of national intelligence need to obtain an order from the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisa court pursuant to section 702 or certify that intelligence important to the national security of the united states may be lost or not timely acquired and time does not permit the issuance of an order187 when requesting an order the attorney general and director of national intelligence must certify to the fisa court that a significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information187 they do not need to specify which facilities or property will be targeted187 after receiving a fisa court order or determining that there are emergency circumstances the attorney general and director of national intelligence can direct an electronic communication service provider to give them access to information or facilities to carry out the targeting and keep the targeting secret187 the provider then has the option to 1 comply with the directive 2 reject it or 3 challenge it with the fisa court if the provider complies with the directive it is released from liability to its users for providing the information and is reimbursed for the cost of providing it187 while if the provider rejects the directive the attorney general may request an order from the fisa court to enforce it187 a provider that fails to comply with the fisa courts order can be punished with contempt of court187 finally a provider can petition the fisa court to reject the directive187 in case the fisa court denies the petition and orders the provider to comply with the directive the provider risks contempt of court if it refuses to comply with the fisa courts order187 the provider can appeal the fisa courts denial to the foreign intelligence surveillance court of review and then appeal the court of reviews decision to the supreme court by a writ of certiorari for review under seal187 the senate select committee on intelligence and the fisa courts had been put in place to oversee intelligence operations in the period after the death of j edgar hoover beverly gage of slate said when they were created these new mechanisms were supposed to stop the kinds of abuses that men like hoover had engineered instead it now looks as if they have come to function as rubber stamps for the expansive ambitions of the intelligence community j edgar hoover no longer rules washington but it turns out we didnt need him anyway188 litigationedit june 11 2013 american civil liberties union lawsuit filed against the nsa citing that the mass call tracking program as the case terms prism violates americans constitutional rights of free speech association and privacy

security and the law has called prism and other nsa mass surveillance programs unconstitutional192 woodrow hartzog an affiliate at stanford law schools center for internet and society commented that the aclu will likely have to demonstrate legitimate first amendment harms such as chilling effects or fourth amendment harms perhaps a violation of a reasonable expectation of privacy is it a harm to merely know with certainty that you are being monitored by the government theres certainly an argument that it is people under surveillance act differently experience a loss of autonomy are less likely to engage in self exploration and reflection and are less willing to engage in core expressive political activities such as dissenting speech and government criticism such interests are what first and fourth amendment seek to protect193 legality of the fisa amendments actedit the fisa amendments act faa section 702 is referenced in prism documents detailing the electronic interception

by targeting us persons insofar as collections occur in us as published documents indicate194195196197 the aclu has asserted the following regarding the faa regardless of abuses the problem with the faa is more fundamental the statute itself is unconstitutional198 senator rand paul is introducing new legislation called the fourth amendment restoration act of 2013 to stop the nsa or other agencies
