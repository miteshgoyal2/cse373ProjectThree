science fiction writer greg egan who wrote that a sensationalist bent and a lack of basic knowledge by its writers was making the magazines coverage sufficiently unreliable to constitute a real threat to the public understanding of science in particular egan found himself gobsmacked by the level of scientific illiteracy in the magazines coverage of roger shawyers electromagnetic drive where new scientist allowed the publication of meaningless doubletalk designed to bypass a fatal objection to shawyers proposed space drive namely that it violates the law of conservation of momentum egan urged others to write to new scientist and pressure the magazine to raise its standards instead of squandering the opportunity that the magazines circulation and prestige provides21 the editor of new scientist then jeremy webb replied defending the article saying that it is an ideas magazine—that means writing about hypotheses as well as theories22 darwin was wrong coveredit in january 2009 new scientist ran a cover with the title darwin was wrong23 the actual story stated that specific details of darwins evolution theory had been shown incorrectly mainly the shape of phylogenetic trees of interrelated species which should be represented as a web instead of a tree some evolutionary biologists who actively oppose the intelligent design movement thought the cover was both sensationalist and damaging to the scientific community2324 jerry coyne author of the book why evolution is true called for a boycott of the magazine which was supported by evolutionary biologists richard dawkins
