rehabilitated in a good way —crisanto nierre inmate who played michael jackson1 cebu provincial detention and rehabilitation center is a maximum security prison in cebu in the cebu province of the philippines the center is run by byron f garcia and its inmates are either facing trial or are serving sentences for crimes ranging from shoplifting to murder and rape2 in 2007 more than 300 of the inmates were facing murder charges1 garcia initiated the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit while the goal is to keep the body fit in order to keep the mind fit such may not happen if it is done in a manner deemed unpleasurable garcia said2 considering music to be the language of the soul garcia added it to the prisoners workout regime2 garcia also wanted the music workouts to be a way in which to break down gang factions amongst prison inmates3 melita thomeczeck the philippines deputy consulate general in new york suspected that the warden added the music in order to take detainees minds off of other matters2 one of the first songs the prisoners worked with was pink floyds another brick in the wall garcia had them march to the music as a bid to increase participation in exercise4 other early musical choices included in the navy and ymca by the village people the village people songs were chosen so that macho inmates wouldnt be offended by being asked to dance4 for filipinos music and dancing is said to be a way of life natives of the philippines are reported to have a tendency to sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations2 thomeczeck stated the filipinos love music and they love to sing and dance whatever they are in a natural way they can continue that habit in prison2 despite other colleagues enthusiasm about the dancing chief administrator patrick rubio of the directorate of operations within the bureau of jail management and penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing as cpdrc was undermanned despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the centers operations manual rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen as a jail officer i got worried when i saw it rubio commented2 the inmates were not fond of the idea either pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison3 prisoners eventually agreed to dance but admitted that the routines took awhile to master it was difficult at first but eventually we inmates got used to it inmate mario benito revealed3 the program began as an experiment and after six months prison chiefs concluded that it was a successful one3 video and responseedit in 2007 garcia posted several videos of his inmates performances on youtube in hopes of inspiring other prisons to learn from the experience3 the clips became some of the most talked about in cyberspace3 the most popular of the videos was uploaded in april 2007 it showed over 1500 male inmates imitating the zombie dance featured in the music video of michael jacksons thriller25 the prisoners wore their orange jailissue jumpsuits during the performance in the jails exercise yard6 the los angeles times later commented that the dance moves were not lifted directly from the video but they are performed with such precision it somehow seems that they must have been7 inmate crisanto nierre played the role of michael jackson nierre who at the time was awaiting trial on drug charges has been a fan of jackson since he was in a dance troupe at high school usa today noted that his favorite jackson tracks were bad and smooth criminal1 former pizza chef wenjiel resane who is gay played the part of jacksons girlfriend at the time resane had already been at the prison for three years also awaiting trial on drug charges1 fortyeight hours after being uploaded onto youtube the video had been viewed 266000 times after a week the number of hits had risen to over one million8 within two weeks of the thriller video being uploaded it had been viewed by some three million youtube users3 the following week the number had almost doubled coming close to six million hits9 on average the clip received 300000 views per day at its peak1 the video generated mixed reviews with some critics claiming that garcia forced the inmates to perform an accusation the prisoners refuted several of the inmates showed devotion towards their prison chief with as many as 20 prisoners bearing tattoos with garcias name1 garcias concept of having prisoners dance as part of a rehabilitation program has been copied by several prisons including jails in quezon province and muntinlupa garcia commented that the movie showed that dancing is not a cruel or unusual punishment he claimed that his prison showed that negative inmates could be turned into positive individuals through the concept of a revolutionized penology10 following garcias presentation of an inmate performance at the provinces founding day celebrations a donation of 35000 was given to the prison each inmate received 22 of the gift deposited into a prison passbook account the remaining money went to the cebu province and its employees to defray the costs of incarceration111 the prison inmates thriller performance made it to the pages of time—on the international magazine’s list of the most watchable internet videos for 2007 the inmates interpretation of the thriller music video was ranked the fifth of 10 most popular viral videos of the year or the web clips we couldn’t stop watching8 the list also included appearances by hillary clinton will ferrell and chris crocker for his leave britney alone clip8 time described the convicts as orangejumpsuited accused murderers rapists and drug dealers and noted that their performance was made in homage to jacksons thriller8 the magazine stated that the viral video had been downloaded more than nine million times8 as of january 18 2008 the reported views of the video have reached almost 15 million12 edward latessa professor and head of division of criminal justice at the university of cincinnati declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated latessa stated that the prisoners may think that they are getting something out of the performances when in reality they are not he described it as having a potentially harmful effect the professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs like substance abuse or family reunification programs should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor2 the detention workers disagreed with the assessment deeming the activities to be an integral part of rehabilitation it combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance thomeczeck argued in more ways than one it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration its a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually thats good isnt it2 entertainment weekly put it on its endofthedecade bestof list saying now thats a breakout hit the clip of inmates at a highsecurity prison in the philippines performing an intricately choreographed dance to michael jacksons thriller has nabbed more than 42 million views since 200713 aftermathedit in late 2007 pinoy big brother celebrity edition 2 scheduled a visit from some of its celebrities to the provincial jail the celebrities danced with 1600 cpdrc inmates to the tune of rico mambo as part of their weekly task set by big brother the request had been made by maria rowena benitez pinoy big brother production manager14 the housemates were not informed of their task but were brought to the prison in blindfolds they were then subsequently given back their sight with the inmates surrounding them14 beforehand it was also announced that the big brother celebrity housemates would perform a concert with the proceeds being donated to cpdrc the concert held inside the pinoy big brother house in manila was attended by 100 people who each paid p100014 the cpdrc inmates have performed numerous other songs including queens radio ga ga and several songs from sister act with prisoners dressing as nuns in habits23 44 female inmates held in a separate wing from the males joined the men in a dance to i will follow him1 hail holy queen from sister act 2 and the algorithm march were also performed by the convicts and then upload onto youtube8 the inmates dance in order to help pass the time while serving their prison sentences or awaiting a trial more than 900 of the inmates take part in the routines with a small group of dancers at the core of each performance every prisoner at cpdrc apart from the old and the infirm has a part in the routine garcia directs and choreographs each of the dances26 the inmates participation is said to be completely voluntary with no prisoner being forced to dance it would be different if they are being forced to dance declared rubio ive never known any prisoners being forced to dance its normal to dance2 the inmates have express pride at their performing success and routinely query the viewing figures for their routines6 by august 2007 ten of the prisoners performances had been viewed over 100000 times each15 in 2007 the prisoners stated that they were to perform to vanilla ices ice ice baby46 at the time they were also practicing philip oakey and giorgio moroders together in electric dreams a homage to the inmates fans1 in january 2008 garcia requested that the prisoners perform their thriller routine at the annual sinulog festival a popular streetmusic festival organised by the catholic augustinian in celebration of baby jesus the nineday fiesta and party is preceded by a solemn religious procession1617 the mayor of cebu tomas osmena refused to permit the request stating that the inmates could dance all they wanted in jail i will not allow it even if michael jackson joins them he commented1617 garcia had hoped that by allowing the inmates to be a part of the sinulog celebrations cebu would showcase the success of his rehabilitation programme by showing these highly disciplined inmates perhaps we might just be giving hope that cebu is not just about the mardi gras but rather cebu is about leadership and good governance1617 the cpdrc inmates were expected to be tough competition for the lumad basakonon a group which has won the free interpretation category of the sinulog festival for two consecutive years1617 as a result of the prisoners internet fame many visitors come to cpdrc to view the monthly performances held by the convicts their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard at the jail visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates they can also buy souvenir prison shirts12 a research student from the netherlands anne yzerman attended one of the twohour shows and praised the convicts they are so good at dancing all the time i was really impressed12 the cpdrc inmates dance numbers include a rendition of bonnie tylers holding out for a hero the performance involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the dalai lama pope john paul ii and mahatma gandhi12 after michael jacksons death on june 25 2009 cebu prison officials announced that the prison inmates would be recreating the thriller routine on the following
