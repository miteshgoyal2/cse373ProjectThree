nhtsagov the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa pronounced nitsuh5 is an agency of the executive branch of the us government part of the department of transportation it describes its mission as save lives prevent injuries reduce vehiclerelated crashes6 as part of its activities nhtsa is charged with writing and enforcing federal motor vehicle safety standards as well as regulations for motor vehicle theft resistance and fuel economy the latter under the rubric of the corporate average fuel economy cafe system nhtsa also licenses vehicle manufacturers and importers allows or blocks the import of vehicles and safetyregulated vehicle parts administers the vehicle identification number vin system develops the anthropomorphic dummies used in safety testing as well as the test protocols themselves and provides vehicle insurance cost information the agency has asserted preemptive regulatory authority over greenhouse gas emissions but this has been disputed by such state regulatory agencies as the california air resources board another of nhtsas major activities is the creation and maintenance of the data files maintained by the national center for statistics and analysis in particular the fatality analysis reporting system fars has become a resource for traffic safety research not only in the united states but throughout the world research contributions using fars by researchers from many countries appear in many nonus technical publications7 and provide a significant database and knowledge bank on the subject even with this database

speed by ralph nader an activist lawyer and accidental death and disability the neglected disease of modern society by the national academy of sciences in 1966 congress held a series of highly publicized hearings regarding highway safety passed legislation to make installation of seat belts mandatory and enacted publ 89–563 publ 89–564 and publ 89–670 which created the us department of transportation on october 15 1966 this legislation created several predecessor agencies which would eventually become nhtsa including the national traffic safety agency the national highway safety agency and the national highway safety bureau once the federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss came into effect vehicles not certified by the maker or importer as compliant with us safety standards were no longer legal to import into the united states nhtsa was officially established in 1970 by the highway safety act of 1970 title ii of publ 91–605 84 stat 1713 enacted december 31 1970 at 84 stat 1739 in 1972 the motor vehicle information and cost savings act publ 92–513 86 stat 947 enacted october 20 1972 expanded nhtsas scope to include consumer information programs since then automobiles have become far better in protecting their occupants in vehicle impacts the number of deaths on american highways hovers around 33000 annually9 a lower death rate per vehiclemile traveled than in the 1960s nhtsa has conducted numerous highprofile investigations of automotive safety issues including the audi 500060 minutes affair the ford explorer rollover problem and the toyota sticky accelerator pedal problem the agency has introduced a proposal to mandate electronic stability control on all passenger vehicles by the 2012 model year this technology was first brought to public attention in 1997 with the swedish moose test versus international consensusedit in 1958 under the auspices of the united nations a consortium called the economic commission for europe had been established to commonize vehicle regulations across europe so as to standardize best practices in vehicle design and equipment and minimize technical barriers to paneuropean vehicle trade and traffic this eventually became the world forum for harmonization of vehicle regulations which began to promulgate what would eventually become the uns ece regulations on vehicle design construction and safety performance although most of the worlds countries accept or require ececompliant vehicles—either as official signatories to ece regulations or by national regulations effectively identical to ece—the united states virtually alone in the world has declined to join the forum or accept ece regulations and blocks the importation of vehicles built to international ece regulations rather than the us safety regulations10 because of the unavailability in america of certain vehicle models a gray market arose in the late 1970s this provided an alternate legal method to acquire vehicles only sold overseas the success of the gray market however ate into the business of mercedesbenz of north america inc which launched a successful congressional lobbying effort to eliminate this alternative for consumers in 1988 despite the lack of any evidence suggesting greymarket vehicles were less safe than those built to comply with us regulations11 as a result it is no longer possible to import foreign vehicles into the united states as a personal import with few exceptions—primarily canadian cars with safety regulations substantially similar to the united states and vehicles imported temporarily for display or research purposes in practice the gray market involved a few thousand luxury cars annually before its virtual elimination in 198812 in 1998 nhtsa exempted vehicles older than 25 years from the rules it administers since these are presumed to be collector vehicles10 in 1999 certain very low production volume specialist vehicles were also exempt for show and display purposes however the ban on newer vehicles considered safe in countries with lower vehiclerelated death rates has led some to claim that the main effect of nhtsas regulatory activity is to protect the us market for a modified oligopoly consisting of the three usbased automakers and the american operations of foreignbrand producers it has been suggested13 that the impetus for nhtsas seeming preoccupation with market control rather than vehicular safety performance is a result of overt market protections such as tariffs and localcontent laws having become politically unpopular due to the increasing popularity of free trade this has driven us industry to adopt less visible forms of trade restrictions in the form of technical regulations different but demonstrably not superior to those outside the united states an example of the marketcontrol effects of nhtsas regulatory protocol is found in the agencys 1974 banning of the citroën sm automobile which contemporary journalists noted was one of the safest vehicles available at the time nhtsa disapproved the sm due to its highperformance lowglare steerable headlamps which were not of the outmoded sealed beam design mandatory in the us and its height adjustable suspension which made compliance with the 1973 bumper requirements impossible the bumper regulation was intended to control the costs resulting from low speed collisions not enhance occupant safety14 regulatory performanceedit us annual deaths per billion vehiclemiles traveled vmt vs annual vmt tens of billions 1921 to 2015 in the mid1960s when the framework was established for us vehicle safety regulations the us auto market was an oligopoly with just three companies gm ford and chrysler controlling 85 of the market15 at that time the united states had safer traffic than any country in the world whether measured by the number of traffic deaths per thousand vehicles or the number of traffic deaths per 100 million miles the federal motor vehicle safety standards are contained in the united states code of federal regulations title 49 part 571 this is commonly referred to as 49cfr571 with any particular fmvss appended after a period as for example 49cfr571301—the location of fmvss 301 additional federal vehicle standards are contained elsewhere in the cfr for instance 49cfr564 contains the specifications and requirements for the various types of replaceable headlamp light source bulb fmvss 209 was the first standard to become effective on march 1 1967 although a system of uniform auto safety performance and equipment regulations ece regulations had been in place in europe since 1958 the united states did not seek to adopt or harmonize with these ece regulations which have since been adopted by virtually all industrialized countries outside north america compared to the ece regulations american regulations are fundamentally different in philosophy content emphasis and enforcement protocol vehicles conforming to the internationalized originally european ece regulations are allowed or required throughout the entire rest of the world but such vehicles are illegal in the united states despite the evolution of the north american auto market to include most of the worlds major automakers and the ongoing proliferation of us safety regulations the previouslyexisting market oligopoly still exerts strong influence american vehicle equipment and construction regulations are based almost entirely on society of automotive engineers sae standards which were written almost entirely by us automakers in a 2004 book by former general motors safety researcher leonard evans government data fars for the us showed other countries achieving safety performance improvements over time greater than those achieved by the united states country 1979 fatalities 2002 fatalities percent change united states 51093 42815 −162 great britain 6352 3431 −460 canada 5863 2936 −499 australia 3508 1715 −511 research on the trends in use of heavy vehicles indicate that a significant difference between the us and other countries is the relatively high prevalence of pickup trucks and suvs in the us a 2003 study by the us transportation research board found that suvs and pickup trucks are significantly less safe than passenger cars that importedbrand vehicles tend to be safer than americanbrand vehicles and that the size and weight of a vehicle has a significantly smaller effect on safety than the quality of the vehicles engineering16 comparisons of past data with the present in the us can result in distortions due to a significant population increase and since the level of large commercial truck traffic has substantially increased from the 1960s while highway capacity has not kept pace with the increase in large commercial truck traffic on us highways1718 however other factors exert significant influence canada has lower roadway death and injury rates despite a vehicle mix comparable to that of the us19 nevertheless the widespread use of truckbased vehicles as passenger carriers is correlated with roadway deaths and injuries not only directly by dint of vehicular safety performance per se but also indirectly through the relatively low fuel costs that facilitate the use of such vehicles in north america motor vehicle fatalities decline as gasoline prices increase20 nhtsa has issued few regulations in the past 25 years most of the reduction in vehicle fatality rates during the last third of the 20th century were gained from the initial nhtsa safety standards during 1968–1984 and subsequent voluntary changes in vehicle crashworthiness by vehicle manufacturers21 cost–benefit requirementsedit beginning around 1980 there are nominally strict cost–benefit ratio requirements for every safety device system or design feature nhtsa mandates for installation on vehicles22 that is the device system or design feature may not be made mandatory unless it will save more money in property damage health care etc than it costs or must cost no more than a specified amount of money per life saved such requirements may be subject to manipulation of estimated costs and estimated benefits to justify or reject almost any standard fmvss 208 effectively mandates the installation of frontal airbags in all new vehicles in the united states for it is written such that no other technology can meet the stipulated requirements23 it has been argued that even using conservative cost figures and optimistic benefit figures airbags cost–benefit ratio so extreme that it may fall outside of the cost–benefit requirements for mandatory safety devices2425 these same cost–benefit requirements have been used as the basis for lightingrelated lags in american regulations for example virtually every country in the world has since at least the early 1970s required rear turn signals to emit amber light so they can immediately be discerned from adjacent red brake lamps us regulations still permit rear turn signals to emit red light on grounds of costeffectiveness262728 despite nhtsa research showing amber rear turn signals instead of red ones give a larger crashavoidance benefit than the 3rd brake light2930 vehicle manufacturers face considerable expense to certify a vehicle for us sale this amount is not widely publicized but automotive news cites a 2013 model vehicle where this modification cost us 42 million this cost is not eligible to be considered despite the lack of evidence that the differences between us and unece standards have a material impact on automobile safety31 fuel economyedit regulationsedit nhtsa also administers the controversial corporate average fuel economy cafe which is intended to incentivize the production of fuelefficient vehicles by dint of fuel economy requirements measured against the salesweighted average of each manufacturers range of vehicles the wall street journal and others argue this program forces people to buy smaller lighter lesssafe vehiclescitation needed cafe may be a driving factor behind the explosion in demand for suvs which are considered light trucks for cafe purposes and therefore are not required to meet the stricter standards for vehicles classified as carsdubious – discuss many governments outside north america regulate fuel economy by heavily taxing motor fuel andor by including a vehicles engine size or fuel economy in calculating vehicle registration taxes it is argued that such regulations are not politically feasible and that doing so would hurt the struggling us auto industry323334 another putative problem with cafe is that fuel economy is negatively correlated to vehicle weight—lighter vehicles giving better fuel economy—while vehicle weight is positively correlated to safety—larger and heavier vehicles better protect their occupants35 thus nhtsa must accomplish two potentially contradictory regulatory goals at the same time however transportation research board studies show safety disparities may exist among vehicles of differing price country of origin and quality not just among vehicles of different size and weight alone36 some other researchers dispute the incompatibility of reduction in vehicle weight and increased fuel economy37 performanceedit nhtsas summary of fuel economy performance ranks automakers according to their cafe38 lotus 302 miles per us

to nhtsaedit automakers faced an inherent conflict between nhtsas stringent headlight legislation which froze us headlight technology in 1940 and the corporate average fuel economy standard which effectively mandated that automakers develop ways to improve the ability of the car to cleave the air as a result in the early 1980s automakers lobbied for a modification of the mandate for fixed shape sealedbeam headlamps nhtsa adopted fords proposal for lowcost aerodynamic headlamps with polycarbonate lenses and transversefilament bulbs the minimum allowed performance and materials durability requirements of this new headlamp system are lower than those of the previous sealed beam systemcitation needed for the 1984 model year ford introduced the lincoln mark vii the first car since 1939 to be sold in the us market with architectural headlamps as part of its aerodynamic design these composite headlamps when new to the american market were commonly but improperly referred to as euro headlamps since aerodynamic headlamps were already common in europe though conceptually similar to european headlamps with nonstandardized shape and replaceablebulb construction these headlamps conform to the sae headlamp design standards contained in us federal motor vehicle safety standard 108 and not to the international safety standards used worldwide outside north america ncapedit consumer information label for a vehicle with at least one ncap star rating in 1979 nhtsa created the new car assessment program ncap in response to title ii of the motor vehicle information and cost savings act of 1972 to encourage manufacturers to build safer vehicles and consumers to buy them since that time the agency has improved the program by adding rating programs facilitating access to test results and revising the format of the information to make it easier for consumers to understand39 nhtsa asserts the program has influenced manufacturers to build vehicles that consistently achieve high ratings39 the first standardized 35 mph front crash test was may 21 1979 and the first results were released october 15 that year the agency established a frontal impact test protocol based on federal motor vehicle safety standard 208 occupant crash protection except that the frontal 4 ncap test is conducted at 35 mph 56 kmh rather than 30 mph 48 kmh as required by fmvss no 208 more recently in an effort to improve the dissemination of ncap ratings and as a result of the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users safetea–lu the agency has issued a final rule requiring manufacturers to place ncap star ratings on the monroney sticker automobile price sticker the rule has a september 1 2007 compliance date40 administrationedit nhtsas 2006 budget distribution41 the agency has an annual budget of 815 million 2007 the agency classifies most of its spending under the driver safety heading with a minority spent on vehicle safety and a smaller amount on environmental matters of which it is in charge ie vehicular fuel economy on april 9 2009 president barack obama nominated chuck hurley chief executive officer of mothers against drunk driving to be the next nhtsa administrator in addition to drunk driving his areas of expertise include air bag seat belt teen driving and child safety amid concern over hurleys ties to
