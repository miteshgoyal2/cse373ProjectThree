ship canal project began in 1911 and was officially completed in 1934 prior to construction of the lake washington ship canal otherwise known as the salmon bay waterway water used to exit lake washington via the black river which flowed from the south end of lake washington into the duwamish river as early as 1854 there was discussion of building a navigable connection between lake washington and puget sound for the purpose of transporting logs milled lumber and fishing vessels thirteen years later the united states navy endorsed a canal project which included a plan for building a naval shipyard on lake washington in 1891 the us army corps of engineers started planning the project some preliminary work was begun in 1906 and work began in earnest five years later the delays in canal planning and construction resulted in the us navy building the puget sound naval shipyard in bremerton washington which is located across the sound from seattle early effortsedit for centuries people had been dragging boats between the lakes giving names like carry a canoe sxwátsadweehl to the crossing points2 in 1854 seattle pioneer thomas mercer proposed canals connecting lake union and lake washington to puget sound in a speech at the first independence day celebration of the seattle areas first permanent white settlement shortly after its founding3 mercer gave the lakes the names they are presently called over the original lushootseed names used by the duwamish tenas chuck or xáxu7choo small greatamountofwater for lake union and hyas chuck or xacuabš greatamountofwater for lake washington lake union was chosen to suggest the future canals merging the waters and lake washington for george washington245 montlake portage canal in 1908 in 1860 local landowner harvey l pike tried to dig a ditch by himself with pick and shovel at montlake to transport logs between portage bay and union bay in the hopes of increasing the value of his property along the route6 giving up on digging the first portage canal himself in 1871 he joined thomas burke and daniel gilman in incorporating the lake washington canal company deeding his land to the company instead of finishing the canal the company instead built a tramway to carry coal brought by barge across lake washington6 in 1883 david denny and burke hired a crew of chinese laborers to complete the canal at montlake creating a 16foot 49 m channel that included a lock capable of floating logs down from lake washington to lake union6 the army corps of engineers investigated puget sound for military defense purposes and chose lake washington as the best location for a naval base due to the security of the waters proximity to supplies of fresh water coal and timber and the less corrosive effect on wooden ship hulls of a fresh water port37 a report by lieutenant thomas h hardy of october 13 1871 forwarded to congress by army general b s alexander of the board of engineers of the pacific coast said the coal fields of seattle coal and transportation company two miles east of lake sammamish supplied 1500 tons per month of steam ship grade coal and potentially twice this amount7 the route directly across the narrowest part of seattle that is semples canal from leschi straight across to presentday harbor island was rejected in this report because of the 200 to 300 foot height of the hills that would have to be cut through7 the route via the black and duwamish rivers would be crooked and several miles in length would let out into shoals rather than deep water and would have to be frequently dredged to remove sand brought by river flooding7 as to connecting lake union to shilshole bay — the route ultimately chosen — gen alexandar had serious objections including the expense and the need for dredging a channel and that the canal line let out in shoal water that was exposed to heavy seas and would be less defensible in wartime being exposed to the cannonade of an enemy7 alexander was less opposed to digging straight south from salmon bay through interbay to smith cove but would still terminate in shoals and be just as costly as his preferred route from lake union through mercers farm into elliott bay while being less defensible37 the estimated cost for the project was 47 million3 in the rivers and harbors act of 1902 congress directed the secretary of war to appoint a committee of three officers to study the feasibility of a canal and lock system to connect puget sound to lake washington lieutenant colonel william h heuer captain william c langfitt and lieutenant robert p johnson met august 1902 in seattle and conducted a survey of possible routes8 they examined the route of the lake washington waterway company via shilshole bay as well as a route from lake union to smith cove the montlake coal tramway and thomas mercers farm in november 1902 a public meeting was called in the chamber of commerce hall but was quickly adjourned because no one came to speak8 proposed canal routes included the black river semples canal across beacon hill two possible routes from lake union to elliott bay via lower queen anne and belltown the montlake cut and salmon bay to smith cove via interbay in 1906 as local debate over the location of the canals continued and funding from washington dc was delayed seattle developer james a moore known today for the moore theatre and moore haven florida proposed a canal that could accommodate small ships with two wooden locks connecting salmon bay to shilshole bay923–25 moore secured congressional approval for his project granting him rights to build3 in april of the same year hiram m chittenden came to seattle as the new army district engineer923–25 chittenden favored the same route to shilshole bay as moore but found the plan too modest and potentially unsafe3926 chittenden said moores hopefor budget of 500000 was insufficient and the locks should be built to accommodate larger vessels and that the wooden locks would eventually deteriorate and collapse draining lake washington into puget sound926 instead chittenden proposed a double concrete lock with steel gates allowing small craft to pass with less waste927 a single set of locks on the western end of salmon bay would be used in place of the small wooden lock near fremont avenue which would lower lake washington to the same level as lake union927 having a single lock between puget sound and the freshwater lakes would reduce the risk of flooding and reduce overall cost of the project927 before he could move forward chittenden had to sway local leaders away from supporting moores project3 after enthusiasm for his canal eroded and funding dried up moore transferred his rights to a publicprivate entity the lake washington canal association in 19073929 though chittenden hoped to cap his career with the construction of the locks ill health forced him to retire in 1909 though he continued lobbying congress for the project and served as a consulting engineer and as a seattle port commissioner until his death in october 1917931 lake washington ship canal and the black river showing course of river in 2013 and before 1916
