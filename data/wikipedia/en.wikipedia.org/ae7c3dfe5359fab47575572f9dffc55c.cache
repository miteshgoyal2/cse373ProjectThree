staff and their verification status on twitter this began when the sites social media editor john colucci tweeted a celebration of the site hitting over 1 million twitter followers44 besides colucci shatner also targeted several junior members of the staff for being nobodies unlike some of his actor colleagues who didnt have such distinction shatner claimed colucci and team were bullying him when giving a text interview to mashable45 over a month later shatner continued to discuss the issue on his tumblr page46 to which engadget replied with its own response defending its team and discussing the controversy around social media verification47 the vergeedit in early 2011 eight of the more prominent editorial and technology staff members left aol to build a new gadget site with ceo jim bankoff at sb nation48 on leaving joshua topolsky former editorinchief is quoted having said “we have been working on blogging technology that was developed in 2003 we haven’t made a hire since i started running the site and i thought we could be more successful elsewhere” it appears the departure of the team from aol which includes not only topolsky but editors nilay patel paul miller joanna stern ross miller chris ziegler chad mumm justin glow dan chilton thomas ricker and vladislav savov was primarily the cause of an internal memo distributed by aol detailing the aol way a 58page long company plan to grow aol into a media empire some employees suggested that aol was sacrificing journalism for page views and that it would be difficult for the organization to apply a one size fits all business model to reporting the group set up a placeholder site this is my next while they developed a new technology news site in partnership with vox media the new site called the verge was
