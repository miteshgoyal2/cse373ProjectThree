banker based in zaltbommel financed the purchase and setup of a modest empty factory building in eindhoven where the company started the production of carbonfilament lamps and other electrotechnical products in 1892 this first factory has been adapted and is used as a museum7 in 1895 after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy the philipses brought in anton gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative soon however he began to contribute many important business ideas with antons arrival the family business began to expand rapidly resulting in the founding of philips metaalgloeilampfabriek nv philips metal filament lamp factory ltd in eindhoven in 1908 followed in 1912 by the foundation of philips gloeilampenfabrieken nv philips lightbulb factories ltd after gerard and anton philips changed their family business by founding the philips corporation they laid the foundations for the later electronics multinational in the 1920s the company started to manufacture other products such as vacuum tubes in 1939 they introduced their electric razor the philishave marketed in the us using the norelco brand name the chapel is a radio with builtin loudspeaker which was designed during the early 1930s philips radioedit philips chapel radio model 930a 1931 on 11 march 1927 philips went on the air with shortwave radio station pcjj later pcj which was joined in 1929 by sister station phohi philips omroep hollandindië phohi broadcast in dutch to the dutch east indies now indonesia while pcjj broadcast in english spanish and german to the rest of the world the international program on sundays commenced in 1928 with host eddie startz hosting the happy station show which became the worlds longestrunning shortwave program broadcasts from the netherlands were interrupted by the german invasion in may 1940 the germans commandeered the transmitters in huizen to use for pronazi broadcasts some originating from germany others concerts from dutch broadcasters under german control philips radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in 1947 and renamed radio netherlands worldwide the dutch international service some pcj programs such as happy station continued on the new station stirling engineedit philips was instrumental in the revival of the stirling engine when in the early 1930s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored8 they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements9 encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced 16 w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of 30 mm × 25 mm10 various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late 1940s the type 10 was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at 180200 w electrical output from a bore and stroke of 55 mm × 27 mm was designated mp1002ca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951 but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced11 in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies12 shaversedit the first philips shaver was introduced in the 1930s and was simply called “the philishave” in the usa it was called the “norelco” which remains a part of their product line today world war iiedit on 9 may 1940 the philips directors learned that the german invasion of the netherlands was to take place the following day having prepared for this anton philips and his son in law frans otten as well as other philips family members fled to the united states taking a large amount of the company capital with them operating from the us as the north american philips company they managed to run the company throughout the war at the same time the company was moved on paper to the netherlands antilles to keep it out of american hands on 6 december 1942 the british no 2 group raf led an air raid which heavily damaged the philips radio factory in eindhoven with few casualties among the dutch workers and civilians13 the philips works in eindhoven was bombed again by the raf on 30 march 19431415 frits philips the son of anton was the only philips family member to stay in the netherlands he saved the lives of 382 jews by convincing the nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at philips16 in 1943 he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners at vught for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production for his actions in saving the hundreds of jews he was recognized by yad vashem in 1995 as a righteous among the nations17 1945 to 2001edit after the war the company was moved back to the netherlands with their headquarters in eindhoven the philips light tower in eindhoven originally a light bulb factory and later the company headquarters18 in 1949 the company began selling television sets19 in 1950 it formed philips records which eventually formed part of polygram philips introduced the audio compact audio cassette tape in 1963 and it was wildly successful compact cassettes were initially used for dictation machines for office typing stenographers and professional journalists as their sound quality improved cassettes would also be used to record sound and became the second mass media alongside vinyl records used to sell recorded music philips introduced the first combination portable radio and cassette recorder which was marketed as the radiorecorder and is now better known as the boom box later the cassette was used in telephone answering machines including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop the ccassette was used as the first mass storage device for early personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s philips reduced the cassette size for the professional needs with the minicassette although it would not be as successful as the olympus microcassette this became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully digital dictation machinescitation needed in 1972 philips launched the worlds first home video cassette recorder in the uk the n1500 its relatively bulky video cassettes could record 30 minutes or 45 minutes later onehour tapes were also offered as competition came from sonys betamax and the vhs group of manufacturers philips introduced the n1700 system which allowed doublelength recording for the first time a 2hour movie could fit onto one video cassette in 1977 the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the uk featuring comedian denis norden20 the concept was quickly copied by the japanese makers whose tapes were significantly cheaper philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the video 2000 system with tapes that could be used on both sides and had 8 hours of total recording time as philips only sold its systems on the pal standard and in europe and the japanese makers sold globally the scale advantages of the japanese proved insurmountable and philips withdrew the v2000 system and joined the vhs coalitioncitation needed philips had developed a laserdisc early on for selling movies but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales later philips joined with mca to launch the first commercial laserdisc standard and players in 1982 philips teamed with sony to launch the compact disc this format evolved into the cdr cdrw dvd and later bluray which philips launched with sony in 1997citation needed and 2006 respectively in 1984 philips split off its activities on the field of photolithographic integrated circuit production equipment the socalled wafer steppers into a joint venture with asm international located in veldhoven under the name asml

from nv philips gloeilampenfabrieken to philips electronics nv at the same time north american philips was formally dissolved and a new corporate division was formed in the us with the name philips electronics north america corpcitation needed in 19911992 philips along with their subsidiary magnavox released the philips cdi a combined cd player and home video game console it sold one million
