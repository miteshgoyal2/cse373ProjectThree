wales and northern ireland who jointly established ifab in 1882 and are recognised for the creation and history of the game changes to the laws of the game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates the fifa statutes form the overarching document guiding fifas governing system the governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances it consists of four general bodies the congress the executive committee the general secretariat and standing and adhoc committees30 discipline of national associationsedit fifa frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world one of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of fifas associate member organisations or if the associate is not functioning properly a 2007 fifa ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs and appear in official matches for a maximum of two in a year measured from 1 july to 30 june has led to controversy especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier as in the case of two former ireland internationals as a direct result of this controversy fifa modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with outofphase seasons video

meeting of the international football association board agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slowmotion playback which reflected or might reflect adversely on any decision of the referee32 in 2008 fifa president sepp blatter said let it be as it is and lets leave football with errors the television companies will have the right to say the referee was right or wrong but still the referee makes the decision – a man not a machine33 it has been said that instant replay is needed given the difficulty of tracking the activities of 22 players on such a large field34 and it has been proposed that instant replay be used in penalty incidents fouls which lead to bookings or red cards and whether the ball has crossed the goal line since those events are more likely than others to be gamechanging35 critics point out that instant replay is already in use in other sports including rugby union cricket american football canadian football basketball baseball tennis and ice hockey34363738 as one notable proponent of video replay portuguese coach carlos queiroz has been quoted as saying that the credibility of the game is at stake39 an incident during a secondround game

within the football world by detailing an alleged international cashforcontracts scandal following the collapse of fifas marketing partner international sport and leisure isl and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received the book also alleged that voterigging had occurred in the fight for sepp blatters continued control of fifa shortly after the release of foul a bbc television exposé by jennings and bbc producer roger corke for the bbc news programme panorama was broadcast in this hourlong programme screened on 11 june 2006 jennings and the panorama team agree that sepp blatter was being investigated by swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than £1m worth of bribes pocketed by football officials lord triesman the former chairman of the english football association described fifa as an organization that behaves like a mafia family highlighting the associations decadeslong traditions of bribes bungs and corruption51 all testimonies offered in the panorama exposé were provided through a disguised voice appearance or both save one mel brennan formerly a lecturer at towson university in the united states and from 2001 to 2003 head of special projects for concacaf a liaison to the efifa project and a 2002 fifa world cup delegate became the first highlevel football insider to go public with substantial allegations of greed corruption nonfeasance and malfeasance by concacaf and fifa leadership during the panorama exposé brennan—the highestlevel africanamerican in the history of world football governance—joined jennings trinidadian journalist lisana liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money at concacaf and drew connections between ostensible concacaf criminality and similar behaviors at fifa since then and in the light of fresh allegations of bribery and corruption and opaque action by fifa in late 201052 both jennings and brennan remain highly critical of fifa with brennan calling directly for an alternative to fifa to be considered by the stakeholders of the sport throughout the world53 in a further panorama documentary broadcast on bbc one on 29 november 2010 jennings alleged that three senior fifa officials nicolas leoz issa hayatou and ricardo teixeira had been paid huge bribes by fifas marketing partner isl between 1989 and 1999 which fifa had failed to investigate he claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by isl totaling about 100 million a former isl executive said that there were suspicions within isl that the company was only awarded the marketing contract for successive world cups by paying bribes to fifa officials the programme also alleged that another current official jack warner has been repeatedly involved in reselling world cup tickets to touts sepp blatter said that fifa had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via official channels the programme also criticized fifa for allegedly requiring world cup host bidding nations to agree to implement special laws for the world cup including a blanket tax exemption for fifa and sponsors and limitation of workers rights it alleged that governments of bidding nations are required to keep the details of the required laws confidential during the bidding process but that they were revealed by the dutch government which refused to agree to them as a result of which it was told by fifa that its bid could be adversely affected according to the programme following jennings earlier investigations he was banned from all fifa press conferences for reasons he says have not been made clear and the accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations either verbally or by letter british prime minister david cameron and andy anson head of englands world cup bid criticized the timing of the broadcast three days before fifas decision on the host for the 2018 fifa world cup on the grounds that it might damage englands bid the voters included officials accused by the programme5455 in june 2011 it came to light that the ioc had started inquiry proceedings against fifa honorary president joão havelange into claims of bribery the bbc panorama programme alleged that the brazilian accepted a 1 million bung in 1997 from isl the olympic governing body said the ioc takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any ioc members to be passed to our ethics commission56 in a 2014 interview american sports writer dave zirin said greed corruption nonfeasance and malfeasance are endemic to fifa leadership and that fifa should be abolished for the good of the game he said that currently fifa is in charge of both monitoring corruption in football matches and marketing and selling the sport but that two separate organizational bodies are needed an organizational body that monitors corruption and matchfixing and the like and an organization thats responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport zirin said the idea of having a single organization thats responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport57 guilty pleasedit between 2013 and 2015 four individuals and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to united states financial
