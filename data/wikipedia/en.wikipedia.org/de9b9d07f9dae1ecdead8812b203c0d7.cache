libertarianism women in conservatism conservatism portal v t e neoconservatism commonly shortened to neocon is a political movement born in the united states during the 1960s among hawkish liberal intellectuals who became disenchanted with the american lefts foreign policy1 many of its adherents became politically famous during the republican presidential administrations of the 1970s 1980s 1990s and 2000s neoconservatives peaked in influence during the administration of george w bush when they played a major role in promoting and planning the 2003 invasion of iraq2 prominent neoconservatives in the george w bush administration included paul wolfowitz elliott abrams richard perle and paul bremer senior officials vice president dick cheney and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld while not identifying as neoconservatives listened closely to neoconservative advisers regarding foreign policy especially the defense of israel and the promotion of american influence in the middle east the term neoconservative refers to those who made the ideological journey from the antistalinist left to the camp of american conservatism3 neoconservatives typically advocate the promotion of democracy and american national interest in international affairs including by means of military force and are known for espousing disdain for communism and for political radicalism45 the movement had its intellectual roots in the jewish monthly review magazine commentary published by the american jewish committee67 they spoke out against the new left and in that way helped define the movement89 c bradley thompson a professor at clemson university claims that most influential neoconservatives refer explicitly to the theoretical ideas in the philosophy of leo strauss 1899–197310

external links terminologyedit the term neoconservative was popularized in the united states during 1973 by the socialist leader michael harrington who used the term to define daniel bell daniel patrick moynihan and irving kristol whose ideologies differed from harringtons11 the neoconservative label was used by irving kristol in his 1979 article confessions of a true selfconfessed neoconservative12 his ideas have been influential since the 1950s when he cofounded and edited the magazine encounter13 another source was norman podhoretz editor of the magazine commentary from 1960 to 1995 by 1982 podhoretz was terming himself a neoconservative in a new york times magazine article titled the neoconservative anguish over reagans foreign policy1415 during the late 1970s and early 1980s the neoconservatives considered that liberalism had failed and no longer knew what it was talking about according to e j dionne16 seymour lipset asserts that the term neoconservative was used originally by socialists to criticize the politics of social democrats usa sdusa17 jonah goldberg argues that the term is ideological criticism against proponents of american modern liberalism who had become slightly more conservative1218 both lipset and goldberg are frequently described as neoconservatives historian justin vaisse in a booklength study for harvard university press writes that lipset and goldberg are in error neoconservative was used by socialist michael harrington to describe three men – noted above – who were not in sdusa and neoconservatism is a definable political movement19 the term neoconservative was the subject of increased media coverage during the presidency of george w bush2021 with particular emphasis on a perceived neoconservative influence on american foreign policy as part of the bush doctrine22 historyedit senator henry m scoop jackson inspiration for neoconservative foreign policy during the 1970s through the 1950s and early 1960s the future neoconservatives had endorsed the american civil rights movement racial integration and martin luther king jr23 from the 1950s to the 1960s there was general endorsement among liberals for military action to prevent a communist victory in vietnam24 neoconservatism was initiated by the repudiation of the new deal coalition by the american new left black power which accused northern jews of hypocrisy on integration and of supporting israel in the sixday war antianticommunism and which during the late 1960s included substantial endorsement of marxist–leninist politics and the new politics of the new left which norman podheretz said was too close to the counterculture and too alienated from the majority of the population many were particularly alarmed by what they claimed were antisemitic sentiments from black power advocates25 irving kristol edited the journal the public interest 1965–2005 featuring economists and political scientists which emphasized ways that government planning in the liberal state had produced unintended harmful consequences26 many early neoconservative political figures were disillusioned democratic politicians and intellectuals such as daniel patrick moynihan who served in the nixon administration and jeane kirkpatrick who served as president ronald reagans un ambassador a substantial number of neoconservatives were originally moderate socialists associated with the rightwing of the socialist party of america sp and its successor social democrats usa sdusa max shachtman a former trotskyist theorist who developed a strong antipathy towards the new left had numerous devotees among sdusa with strong links to george meanys aflcio following shachtman and meany this faction led the sp to oppose an immediate withdrawal from the vietnam war and oppose george mcgovern in the democratic primary race and to some extent the general election they also chose to cease their own partybuilding and concentrated on working within the democratic party eventually influencing it through the democratic leadership council27 thus the socialist party ceased to be in 1972 and sdusa emerged most of the leftwing of the party led by michael harrington immediately abandoned sdusa2829 sdusa leaders associated with neoconservatism include carl gershman penn kemble joshua muravchik and bayard rustin30313233 norman podhoretzs magazine commentary of the american jewish committee originally a journal of liberalism became a major publication for neoconservatives during the 1970s commentary published an article by jeane kirkpatrick an early and prototypical neoconservative albeit not a new yorker new york intellectualsedit many neoconservatives had been jewish intellectuals in new york city during the 1930s they were on the political left but strongly opposed stalinism some were trotskyists during the cold war they continued to oppose stalinism and to endorse democracy the great majority became liberal democrats3435 rejecting the american new left and mcgoverns new politicsedit as the policies of the new left made the democrats increasingly leftist these intellectuals became disillusioned with president lyndon b johnsons great society domestic programs the influential 1970 bestseller the real majority by ben wattenberg expressed that the real majority of the electorate endorsed economic liberalism but also social conservatism and warned democrats it could be disastrous to adopt liberal positions on certain social and crime issues36 the neoconservatives rejected the counterculture new left and what they considered antiamericanism in the noninterventionism of the activism against the vietnam war after the antiwar faction took control of the party during 1972 and nominated george mcgovern the democrats among them endorsed washington senator henry scoop jackson instead for his unsuccessful 1972 and 1976 campaigns for president among those who worked for jackson were future neoconservatives paul wolfowitz doug feith and richard perle37 during the late 1970s neoconservatives tended to endorse ronald reagan the republican who promised to confront soviet expansionism neocons organized in the american enterprise institute and the heritage foundation to counter the liberal establishment38 in another 2004 article michael lind also wrote39 neoconservatism originated in the 1970s as a movement of antisoviet liberals and social democrats in the tradition of truman kennedy johnson humphrey and henry scoop jackson many of whom preferred to call themselves paleoliberals after the end of the cold war many paleoliberals drifted back to the democratic center todays neocons are a shrunken remnant of the original broad neocon coalition nevertheless the origins of their ideology on the left are still apparent the fact that most of the younger neocons were never on the left is irrelevant they are the intellectual and in the case of william kristol and john podhoretz the literal heirs of older exleftists leo strauss and his studentsedit neoconservatism draws on several intellectual traditions the students of political science professor leo strauss 1899–1973 comprised one major group eugene sheppard notes that much scholarship tends to understand strauss as an inspirational founder of american neoconservatism40 strauss was a refugee from nazi germany who taught at the new school for social research in new york 1939–49 and the university of chicago 1949–195841 strauss asserted that the crisis of the west consists in the wests having become uncertain of its purpose his solution was a restoration of the vital ideas and faith that in the past had sustained the moral purpose of the west the greek classics classical republican and modern republican political philosophy and the judeochristian heritage are the essentials of the great tradition in strausss work4243 strauss emphasized the spirit of the greek classics and thomas g west 1991 argues that for strauss the american founding fathers were correct in their understanding of the classics in their principles of justice for strauss political community is defined by convictions about justice and happiness rather than by sovereignty and force he repudiated the philosophy of john locke as a bridge to 20thcentury historicism and nihilism and defended liberal democracy as closer to the spirit of the classics than other modern regimes44 for strauss the american awareness of ineradicable evil in human nature and hence the need for morality was a beneficial outgrowth of the premodern western tradition45 oneill 2009 notes that strauss wrote little about american topics but his students wrote a great deal and that strausss influence caused his students to reject historicism and positivism as morally relativist positions46 instead they promoted a socalled aristotelian perspective on america that produced a qualified defense of its liberal constitutionalism47 strausss emphasis on moral clarity led the straussians to develop an approach to international relations that catherine and michael zuckert 2008 call straussian wilsonianism or straussian idealism the defense of liberal democracy in the face of its vulnerability4648 strauss influenced weekly standard editor william kristol editor john podhoretz and military strategist paul wolfowitz4950 jeane kirkpatrickedit main article jeane kirkpatrick jeane kirkpatrick a theory of neoconservative foreign policy during the final years of the cold war was articulated by jeane kirkpatrick in dictatorships and double standards51 published in commentary magazine during november 1979 kirkpatrick criticized the foreign policy of jimmy carter which endorsed detente with the ussr she later served the reagan administration as ambassador to the united nations52 skepticism towards democracy promotionedit in dictatorships and double standards kirkpatrick distinguished between authoritarian regimes and the totalitarian regimes such as the soviet union she suggested that in some countries democracy was not tenable and the us had a choice between endorsing authoritarian governments which might evolve into democracies or marxist–leninist regimes which she argued had never been ended once they achieved totalitarian control in such tragic circumstances she argued that allying with authoritarian governments might be prudent kirkpatrick argued that by demanding rapid liberalization in traditionally autocratic countries the carter administration had delivered those countries to marxistleninists that were even more repressive she further accused the carter administration of a double standard of never having applied its rhetoric on the necessity of liberalization to communist governments the essay compares traditional autocracies and communist regimes traditional autocrats do not disturb the habitual rhythms of work and leisure habitual places of residence habitual patterns of family and personal relations because the miseries of traditional life are familiar they are bearable to ordinary people who growing up in the society learn to cope revolutionary communist regimes claim jurisdiction over the whole life of the society and make demands for change that so violate internalized values and habits that inhabitants flee by the tens of thousands kirkpatrick concluded that while the united states should encourage liberalization and democracy in autocratic countries it should not do so when the government risks violent overthrow and should expect gradual change rather than immediate transformation53 she wrote no idea holds greater sway in the mind of educated americans than the belief that it is possible to democratize governments anytime and anywhere under any circumstances decades if not centuries are normally required for people to acquire the necessary disciplines and habits in britain the road to democratic government took seven centuries to traverse the speed with which armies collapse bureaucracies abdicate and social structures dissolve once the autocrat is removed frequently surprises american policymakers54 1990sedit during the 1990s neoconservatives were once again opposed to the foreign policy establishment both during the republican administration of president george h w bush and that of his democratic successor president bill clinton many critics charged that the neoconservatives lost their influence as a result of the end of the ussr55 after the decision of george h w bush to leave saddam hussein in power after the first iraq war during 1991 many neoconservatives considered this policy and the decision not to endorse indigenous dissident groups such as the kurds and shiites in their 1991–1992 resistance to hussein as a betrayal of democratic principles5657585960 some of those same targets of criticism would later become fierce advocates of neoconservative policies during 1992 referring to the first iraq war then united states secretary of defense and future vice president richard cheney said i would guess if we had gone in there i would still have forces in baghdad today wed be running the country we would not have been able to get everybody out and bring everybody home and the question in my mind is how many additional american casualties is saddam hussein worth and the answer is not that damned many so i think we got it right both when we decided to expel him from kuwait but also when the president made the decision that wed achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern iraq61 within a few years of the gulf war in iraq many neoconservatives were endorsing the ouster of saddam hussein on 19 february 1998 an open letter to president clinton was published signed by dozens of pundits many identified with neoconservatism and later related groups such as the pnac urging decisive action to remove saddam from power62 neoconservatives were also members of the socalled blue team which argued for a confrontational policy toward the peoples republic of china and strong military and diplomatic endorsement for the republic of china also known as formosa or taiwan during the late 1990s irving kristol and other writers in neoconservative magazines began touting antidarwinist views as an endorsement of intelligent design since these neoconservatives were largely of secular origin a few commentators have speculated that this – along with endorsement of religion generally – may have been a case of a noble lie intended to protect public morality or even tactical politics to attract religious endorsers63 2000sedit administration of george w bushedit wikinews has related news vanity fair editor craig unger on the bush family feud neoconservatives and the christian right the bush campaign and the early bush administration did not exhibit strong endorsement of neoconservative principles as a presidential candidate bush had argued for a restrained foreign policy stating his opposition to the idea of nationbuilding64 and an early foreign policy confrontation with china was managed without the vociferousness suggested by some neoconservatives65 also early in the administration some neoconservatives criticized bushs administration as insufficiently supportive of israel and suggested bushs foreign policies were not substantially different from those of president clinton66 former us president george w bush with the former president of egypt hosni mubarak at camp david in 2002 during november 2010 bush wrote in his memoir decision points claiming mubarak endorsed the administrations position that iraq had wmds before the war with the country but kept it private for fear of inciting the arab street67 bushs policies changed dramatically immediately after the 11 september 2001 attacks during bushs state of the union speech of january 2002 he named iraq iran and north korea as states that constitute an axis of evil and pose a grave and growing danger bush suggested the possibility of preemptive war i will not wait on events while dangers gather i will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer the united states of america will not permit the worlds most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the worlds most destructive weapons6869 some major defense and nationalsecurity persons have been quite critical of what they believed was a neoconservative influence in getting the united states to go to war against iraq70 former nebraska republican us senator and secretary of defense chuck hagel who has been critical of the bush administrations adoption of neoconservative ideology in his book america our next chapter wrote so why did we invade iraq i believe it was the triumph of the socalled neoconservative ideology as well as bush administration arrogance and incompetence that took america into this war of choice they obviously made a convincing case to a president with very limited national security and foreign policy experience who keenly felt the burden of leading the nation in the wake of the deadliest terrorist attack ever on american soil bush doctrineedit president bush meets with secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and his staff at the pentagon 14 august 2006 the bush doctrine of preemptive war was stated explicitly in the national security council text national security strategy of the united states published 20 september 2002 we must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemys attack the united states will if necessary act preemptively71 the choice not to use the word preventive in the 2002 national security strategy and instead use the word preemptive was largely in anticipation of the widely perceived illegality of preventive attacks in international law via both charter law and customary law72 policy analysts noted that the bush doctrine as stated in the 2002 nsc document had a strong resemblance to recommendations presented originally in a controversial defense planning guidance draft written during 1992 by paul wolfowitz during the first bush administration73 the bush doctrine was greeted with accolades by many neoconservatives when asked whether he agreed with the bush doctrine max boot said he did and that i think bush is exactly right to say we cant sit back and wait for the next terrorist strike on manhattan we have to go out and stop the terrorists overseas we have to play the role of the global policeman but i also argue that we ought to go further74 discussing the significance of the bush doctrine neoconservative writer william kristol claimed the world is a mess and i think its very much to bushs credit that hes gotten serious about dealing with it the danger is not that were going to do too much the danger is that were going to do too little75 2008 presidential election and aftermathedit president bush and senator mccain at the white house 5 march 2008 john mccain who was the republican candidate for the 2008 united states presidential election endorsed continuing the second iraq war the issue that is most clearly identified with the neoconservatives the new york times reported further that his foreign policy views combined elements of neoconservatism and the main competing conservative opinion pragmatism also known as realism76 among mccains advisers are several prominent neoconservatives including robert kagan max boot and john bolton it may be too strong a term to say a fight is going on over john mccain’s soul said lawrence eagleburger who is a member of the pragmatist camp but he said there is no question that a lot of my far right friends have now decided that since you cant beat him lets persuade him to slide over as best we can on these critical issues barack obama campaigned for the democratic nomination during 2008 by attacking his opponents especially hillary clinton for originally endorsing bushs iraqwar policies obama maintained a selection of prominent military officials from the bush administration including robert gates bushs defense secretary and david petraeus bushs ranking general in iraq 2010sedit by 2010 us forces had switched from combat to a training role in iraq and they left in 201177 the neocons had little influence in the obama white house but neoconservatism remains a staple in republican party arsenal7879 evolution of opinionsedit usage and general viewsedit during the early 1970s socialist michael harrington was one of the first to use neoconservative in its modern meaning he characterized neoconservatives as former leftists – whom he derided as socialists for nixon – who had become more conservative11 these people tended to remain endorsers of social democracy but distinguished themselves by allying with the nixon administration with respect to foreign policy especially by their endorsement of the vietnam war and opposition to the ussr they still endorsed the welfare state but not necessarily in its contemporary form external video booknotes interview with irving kristol on neoconservatism the autobiography of an idea 1995 cspan irving kristol remarked that a neoconservative is a liberal mugged by reality one who became more conservative after seeing the results of liberal policies kristol also distinguished three specific aspects of neoconservatism from previous types of conservatism neoconservatives had a forwardlooking attitude from their liberal heritage rather than the reactionary and dour attitude of previous conservatives they had a meliorative attitude proposing alternate reforms rather than simply attacking social liberal reforms they took philosophical ideas and ideologies very seriously80 during january 2009 at the end of president george w bushs second term in office jonathan clarke a senior fellow at the carnegie council for ethics in international affairs proposed the following as the main characteristics of neoconservatism a tendency to see the world in binary goodevil terms a low tolerance for diplomacy a readiness to use military force an emphasis on us unilateral action a disdain for multilateral organizations and a focus on the middle east81 opinions concerning foreign policyedit international relations theory realism classical realism liberal realism english school neoclassical realism

development of a new rival defense planning guidance a document prepared during 1992 by under secretary for defense for policy paul wolfowitz is regarded by distinguished professor of the humanities john mcgowan at the university of north carolina as the quintessential statement of neoconservative thought the report says82 our first objective is to prevent the reemergence of a new rival either on the territory of the former soviet union or elsewhere that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the soviet union this is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would under consolidated control be sufficient to generate global power according to lead editor of einternational relations stephen mcglinchey neoconservatism is something of a chimera in modern politics for its opponents it is a distinct political ideology that emphasizes the blending of military power with wilsonian idealism yet for its supporters it is more of a persuasion that individuals of many types drift into and out of regardless of which is more correct it is now widely accepted that the neoconservative impulse has been visible in modern american foreign policy and that it has left a distinct impact83 neoconservatives claim the conviction that communism was a monstrous evil and a potent danger84 they endorse social welfare programs that were rejected by libertarians and paleoconservativescitation needed neoconservatism first developed during the late 1960s as an effort to oppose the radical cultural changes occurring within the united states irving kristol wrote if there is any one thing that neoconservatives are unanimous about it is their dislike of the counterculture85 norman podhoretz agreed revulsion against the counterculture accounted for more converts to neoconservatism than any other single factor86 neoconservatives began to emphasize foreign issues during the mid1970s87 donald rumsfeld and victoria nuland at the nato–ukraine consultations in vilnius lithuania october 24 2005 during 1979 an early study by liberal peter steinfels concentrated on the ideas of irving kristol daniel patrick moynihan and daniel bell he noted that the stress on foreign affairs emerged after the new left and the counterculture had dissolved as convincing foils for neoconservatism the essential source of their anxiety is not military or geopolitical or to be found overseas at all it is domestic and cultural and ideological88 neoconservative foreign policy is a descendant of socalled wilsonian idealism neoconservatives endorse democracy promotion by the us and other democracies based on the claim that they think that human rights belong to everyone they criticized the united nations and detente with the ussr on domestic policy they endorse a welfare state like european and canadian conservatives and unlike american conservatives according to norman podhoretz the neoconservatives dissociated themselves from the wholesale opposition to the welfare state which had marked american conservatism since the days of the new deal and while neoconservatives supported setting certain limits to the welfare state those limits did not involve issues of principle such as the legitimate size and role of the central government in the american constitutional order but were to be determined by practical considerations89 during april 2006 robert kagan wrote in the washington post that russia and china may be the greatest challenge liberalism faces today the main protagonists on the side of autocracy will not be the petty dictatorships of the middle east theoretically targeted by the bush doctrine they will be the two great autocratic powers china and russia which pose an old challenge not envisioned within the new war on terror paradigm their reactions to the color revolutions in ukraine georgia and kyrgyzstan were hostile and suspicious and understandably so might not the successful liberalization of ukraine urged and supported by the western democracies be but the prelude to the incorporation of that nation into nato and the european union – in short the expansion of western liberal hegemony9091 during july 2008 joe klein wrote in time that todays neoconservatives are more interested in confronting enemies than in cultivating friends he questioned the sincerity of neoconservative interest in exporting democracy and freedom saying neoconservatism in foreign policy is best described as unilateral bellicosity cloaked in the utopian rhetoric of freedom and democracy92 during february 2009 andrew sullivan wrote he no longer took neoconservatism seriously because its basic tenet was defense of israel93 the closer you examine it the clearer it is that neoconservatism in large part is simply about enabling the most irredentist elements in israel and sustaining a permanent war against anyone or any country who disagrees with the israeli right thats the conclusion ive been forced to these last few years and to insist that america adopt exactly the same constantwarassurvival that israelis have been slowly forced into but america is not israel and once that distinction is made much of the neoconservative ideology collapses neoconservatives respond to charges of merely rationalizing aid for israel by noting that their position on the middle east conflict was exactly congruous with the neoconservative position on conflicts everywhere else in the world including places where neither jews nor israeli interests could be found – not to mention the fact that nonjewish neoconservatives took the same stands on all of the issues as did their jewish confrères94 views on economicsedit while neoconservatism is concerned primarily with foreign policy there is also some discussion of internal economic policies neoconservatism generally endorses free markets and capitalism favoring supplyside economics but it has several disagreements with classical liberalism and fiscal conservatism irving kristol states that neocons are more relaxed about budget deficits and tend to reject the hayekian notion that the growth of government influence on society and public welfare is the road to serfdom95 indeed to safeguard democracy government intervention and budget deficits may sometimes be necessary kristol argues further neoconservative ideology stresses that while free markets do provide material goods in an efficient way they lack the moral guidance human beings need to fulfill their needs morality can be found only in tradition they say and contrary to libertarianism markets do pose questions that cannot be solved solely by economics so as the economy only makes up part of our lives it must not be allowed to take over and entirely dictate to our society96 critics consider neoconservatism a bellicose and heroic ideology opposed to mercantile and bourgeois virtues and therefore a variant of antieconomic thought97 political scientist zeev sternhell states neoconservatism has succeeded in convincing the great majority of americans that the main questions that concern a society are not economic and that social questions are really moral questions98 friction with other conservativesedit many moderate conservatives oppose neoconservative policies and have sharply negative views on it for example stefan halper and jonathan clarke a libertarian based at cato in their 2004 book on neoconservatism america alone the neoconservatives and the global order99 characterized the neoconservatives at that time as uniting … around three common themes a belief deriving from religious conviction that the human condition is defined as a choice between good and evil and that the true measure of political character is to be found in the willingness by the former themselves to confront the latter an assertion that the fundamental determinant of the relationship between states rests on military power and the willingness to use it a primary focus on the middle east and global islam as the principal theater for american overseas interests in putting these themes into practice neoconservatives analyze international issues in blackandwhite absolute moral categories they are fortified by a conviction that they alone hold the moral high ground and argue that disagreement is tantamount to defeatism focus on the unipolar power of the united states seeing the use of military force as the first not the last option of foreign policy they repudiate the lessons of vietnam which they interpret as undermining american will toward the use of force and embrace the lessons of munich interpreted as establishing the virtues of preemptive military action disdain conventional diplomatic agencies such as the state department and conventional countryspecific realist and pragmatic analysis they are hostile toward nonmilitary multilateral institutions and instinctively antagonistic toward international treaties and agreements global unilateralism is their watchword they are fortified by international criticism believing that it confirms american virtue look to the reagan administration as the exemplar of all these virtues and seek to establish their version of reagans legacy as the republican and national orthodoxy9910–11 friction with paleoconservatismedit main article neoconservatism and paleoconservatism starting during the 1980s disputes concerning israel and public policy contributed to a conflict with paleoconservatives pat buchanan terms neoconservatism a globalist interventionist open borders ideology100 paul gottfried has written that the neocons call for permanent revolution exists independently of their beliefs about israel101 characterizing the neos as ranters out of a dostoyevskian novel who are out to practice permanent revolution courtesy of the us government and questioning how anyone could mistake them for conservatives102 what make neocons most dangerous are not their isolated ghetto hangups like hating germans and southern whites and calling everyone and his cousin an antisemite but the leftist revolutionary fury they express102 he has also argued that domestic equality and the exportability of democracy are points of contention between them103 responding to a question about neoconservatives in 2004 william f buckley said i think those i know which is most of them are bright informed and idealistic but that they simply overrate the reach of us power and influence104 trotskyism allegationedit critics have argued that since the founders of neoconservatism included extrotskyites that therefore trotskyist traits continue to characterize neoconservative ideologies and practices105 during the reagan administration the charge was made that the foreign policy of the reagan administration was being managed by extrotskyistscitation needed this claim was called a myth by lipset 1988 p 34106 this trotskyist charge was repeated and widened by journalist michael lind during 2003 to assert a takeover of the foreign policy of the george w bush administration by former trotskyists107 linds amalgamation of the defense intellectuals with the traditions and theories of the largely jewishamerican trotskyist movement in linds words was criticized during 2003 by university of michigan professor alan m wald108 who had discussed trotskyism in his history of the new york intellectuals109110 111 the charge that neoconservativism is related to leninism has been made also francis fukuyama identified neoconservatism with leninism during 200621 he wrote that neoconservatives …believed that history can be pushed along with the right application of power and will leninism was a tragedy in its bolshevik version and it has returned as farce when practiced by the united states neoconservatism as both a political symbol and a body of thought has evolved into something i can no longer support21 criticismsedit the term neoconservative may be used pejoratively by selfdescribed paleoconservatives democrats liberals progressives realists or libertarians critics take issue with neoconservatives support for interventionistic foreign policy critics from the left take issue with what they characterize as unilateralism and lack of concern with international consensus through organizations such as the united nations112113114 critics from both the left and right have assailed neoconservatives for the role israel plays in their policies on the middle east115116 neoconservatives respond by describing their shared opinion as a belief that national security is best attained by actively promoting freedom and democracy abroad as in the democratic peace theory through the endorsement of democracy foreign aid and in certain cases military intervention this is different from the traditional conservative tendency to endorse friendly regimes in matters of trade and anticommunism even at the expense of undermining existing democratic systems republican congressman ron paul has been a longtime critic of neoconservativism as an attack on freedom and the us constitution including an extensive speech on the house floor addressing neoconservative beginnings and how neoconservatism is neither new nor conservative paul krugman in a column named years of shame commemorating the tenth anniversary of 911 attacks criticized the neoconservatives for causing a war unrelated to 911 attacks and fought for wrong reasons117118 imperialism and secrecyedit john mcgowan professor of humanities at the university of north carolina states after an extensive review of neoconservative literature and theory that neoconservatives are attempting to build an american empire seen as successor to the british empire its goal being to perpetuate a pax americana as imperialism is largely considered unacceptable by the american media neoconservatives do not articulate their ideas and goals in a frank manner in public discourse mcgowan states82 frank neoconservatives like robert kaplan and niall ferguson recognize that they are proposing imperialism as the alternative to liberal internationalism yet both kaplan and ferguson also understand that imperialism runs so counter to americans liberal tradition that it must remain a foreign policy that dare not speak its name while ferguson the brit laments that americans cannot just openly shoulder the white mans burden kaplan the american tells us that only through stealth and anxious foresight can the united states continue to pursue the imperial reality that already dominates our foreign policy but must be disavowed in light of our antiimperial traditions and the fact that imperialism is delegitimized in public discourse the bush administration justifying all of its actions by an appeal to national security has kept as many of those actions as it can secret and has scorned all limitations to executive power by other branches of government or international law antisemitism and dual loyaltyedit in the run up to the 2003 invasion of iraq charges of dual loyalty were leveled against jewish neoconservatives from across the political spectrum a heated debate ensued and the controversy continues into the present due to concerns over neoconservatives stance toward iran an abc news article providing an overview of the debate in the run up to the iraq war stated critics of us iraq policy on the right and the left have drawn accusations of antisemitism for asserting that certain members of bushs administration namely deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz richard perle chairman of the pentagons defense policy board and douglas feith undersecretary of defense for policy have dual loyalty – interests in both the united states and israel119 patrick buchanan issued a statement in a cover article for the american conservative neocons say we attack them because they are jewish we do not we attack them because their warmongering threatens our country even as it finds a reliable echo in ariel sharon120 jeffery goldberg of the atlantic interviewed joe klein in 2008 my friend and former colleague joe klein has made himself quite the figure of controversy over the past few weeks first he suggested that jewish neoconservatives have divided loyalties then… he argued that mccain has surrounded himself with jewish neoconservatives who want war with iran121 joe klein issued a refutation of the charges stating that he was antineoconservative listen people can vote whichever way they want for whatever reason they want i just dont want to see policy makers who make decisions on the basis of whether american policy will benefit israel or not in some cases you want to provide protection for israel certainly but you dont want to go to war with iran when jennifer rubin or abe foxman calls me antisemitic theyre wrong i am antineoconservative i think these people are following very perversely extremist policies and i really did believe that it was time for mainstream jews to stand up and say they dont represent us they dont represent israel121 mickey kaus of slate noted that max boot pete wehner jennifer rubin paul mirengoff and abraham foxman of the antidefamation league all wrote confidently outraged responses to kleins raising of the divided loyalties and went on to opine that it should be possible to publicly debate whether some jewish neoconservatives among others too easily convinced themselves that americas and israels interests happily coincided in the prosecution of the war122 glen greenwald also issued a response in support of klein as i’ve documented previously the very same rightwing advocates who scream antisemitism at anyone such as klein who raises the issue of devotion to israel themselves constantly argue that american jews do – and should – cast their votes in american elections based upon what is best for israel they nakedly trot out the dual loyalty argument in order to manipulate american jews to vote republican in us elections eg the gop supports israel and obama doesnt therefore american jews shouldn’t vote for obama while screaming antisemitism the minute the premise is used by their political opponents123 david brooks derided the fantasies of fullmooners fixated on a sort of yiddish trilateral commission beliefs which had hardened into common knowledge he rebutted those beliefs saying that people labeled neocons con is short for conservative and neo is short for jewish travel in widely different circles124 barry rubin argued that the neoconservative label is used as an antisemitic pejorative125 first neoconservative is a codeword for jewish as antisemites did with big business moguls in the nineteenth century and communist leaders in the twentieth the trick here is to take all those involved in some aspect of public life and single out those who are jewish the implication made is that this is a jewishled movement conducted not in the interests of all the in this case american people but to the benefit of jews and in this case israel notable people
