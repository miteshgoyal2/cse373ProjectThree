ameliorating poverty in the us with the simple expedient of the governments providing cash payments to families in need the societys paper stated the program would help families rise up the income ladder moving them from payment recipients to working taxpayers5 in the early 1970s it called for the normalization of relations with china and the abolition of the military draft6 when many young

arguing its positions in a vigorous and reasonable manner the ripon society has notably enriched our political dialogue “ ” president richard nixons statement about the ripon society january 23 1970 7

because it was also a time when the gop loudly and proudly proclaimed not what they stood against but what they stood for “ ” lou zickar ripon society8 foundingedit emil frankel and the bow groupedit emil frankel was a harvard law student in the early 1960s he had studied in england on a fulbright scholarship while in england he met members of a group called the bow group the bow group founders had been dissatisfied with the conservative partys image as the stupid party the bow group impressed frankel particularly regarding the level of detail that its members applied to study public policy problems and the proactive way its members became experts on policy topics9 at the same time john s saloma iii was a professor at massachusetts institute of technology like frankel saloma had studied in england on a fulbright scholarship both frankel and saloma became editors at advance magazine9 in december 1962 frankel and saloma circulated a confidential proposal for an american bow group9 saloma and frankel held a meeting on december 12 1962 in cambridge massachusetts at harvard college the meeting would become the first meeting of the group that eventually became known as the ripon society9 the name is a reference to ripon wisconsin the informal birthplace of the republican party the towns claim was disputed by jackson michigan where the first official meeting of the party was held but a republican organization was unlikely to name itself the jackson society9 the societys meetings took place monthly at locations around harvard some sixty individuals attended at least one ripon meeting during its first year and about half became active members most were graduate or professionals students and young professors from harvard mit and the fletcher school of law and diplomacy at tufts although conservatives liked to pretend that progressive east coast republicans were all tophatted aristocrats the members of the ripon society were mainly middleclass and a preponderance of them were from the midwest9 one of the main goals of the ripon society is to promote ideas and principles that have contributed to the gops past success these ideas include keeping the nation secure keeping taxes low and having a federal government that is not just smaller but smarter and more accountable to the people a call to historyedit on november 22 1963 a group of ripon society members were having lunch in a dining hall at harvard university during lunch they were planning a trip to campaign for nelson rockefeller for president who was at that time the republican governor of new york near the end of their lunch meeting the members got word that president john f kennedy had been shot9 political historian and author geoffrey kabaservice writes although they the ripon society members were republicans jfk had been their political inspiration when the news confirmed that kennedy had been killed they were caught between grief for their fallen hero and fear of lyndon johnson who succeeded to the presidency9 over the weeks following kennedys death the ripon members wrote a manifesto a call to excellence in leadership an open letter to the new generation of republicans newspapers around the us published highlights of the manifesto the new york herald tribune published it in full9 the media attention given to the call to excellence thrust ripon onto the national stage the washington star was one newspaper that editorially hailed the society as a new voice in the land…a voice that ought to be heeded10 another voice was president and republican dwight eisenhower who wrote my delight that an obviously intelligent group of people has taken the trouble to voice its consensus on this important subject and also to express my basic agreement in the mainstream of its thinking11 the ripon papersedit the ripon society wrote its first public statement in the weeks that followed kennedys assassination and published the statement on january 6 196412 while we yet sorrow so must we seize this moment before our thoughts slip away to be lost in the noise of life as usual it is in this context that we have chosen to speak we speak as a group of young republicans to that generation which must bear the responsibility for guiding our party and our country over the coming decades we speak for a point of view in the republican party that has too long been silent we believe that the future of our party lies not in extremism but in moderation the moderate course offers the republican party the best chance to build a durable majority position in american politics this is the direction the party must take if it is to win the confidence of the new americans who are not at home in the politics of another generation the new middle classes of the suburbs of the north and west – who have left the democratic cities but have not yet found a home in the republican party the young college graduates and professional men and women of our great university centers – more concerned with opportunity than security the moderate of the new south – who represent the hope for peaceful racial adjustment and who are insulted by a racist appeal more fitting another generation these and others like them hold the key to the future of our politics we believe that the republican party should accept the challenge to fight for the middle ground of american politics the party that will not acknowledge this political fact of life and courageously enter the contest for power does not merit and cannot possibly win the majority support of the american people12 john saloma founding presidentedit the first president of the society wasjohn s saloma iii serving from 1963 until 196713 in 1962 saloma founded the american bow group a society of

george w bush addressed the nation on immigration reform on may 15 2006 in 2006 tamar jacoby a senior fellow at the manhattan institute wrote an editorial in the ripon societys magazine the ripon forum about the immigration issue jacoby argued that the american public wanted congress and the president to finally solve the problem of illegal immigration and end it jacoby saw three options first the tough option would increase border enforcement jacoby argued that this option would not work because toughtalking rhetoric and increases in border patrol budgets had not changed the number of illegal immigrants coming into the united states per year the second option was to do nothing jacoby argued against this option too the third option was to reform the systems related to immigration and naturalization which president george w bush had pushed for45 the immigration issue was large enough to come into play as a major topic at a ripon society event in dublin ireland in 2013 the

election commissionedit in 2004 the ripon society requested a legal advisory opinion from the federal election commission fec ripon wanted to pay for a tv campaign commercial in favor of the reelection of congresswoman sue kelly rny ripons argument in favor of being allowed to run the commercial was that the commercial would promote homeland security policies that the ripon society and congresswoman kelly supported50 the requested advisory opinion amounted to a request for an interpretation of the federal election campaign act of 1971 as it applied to the specific details of the proposed campaign advertisement50 the fec responded by saying that the law prohibited ripon from paying for the ad if it was televised within congresswoman kellys congressional district however the fec said that ripon could pay for the ad if it were televised outside of her district and only if the ripon society did not coordinate with republican party officials50 in fec advisory opinion 200433
