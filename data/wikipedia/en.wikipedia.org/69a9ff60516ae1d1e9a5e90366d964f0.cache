google chrome os terms of service6 official website wwwgooglecomchromebook chrome os is an operating system designed by google that is based on the linux kernel and uses the google chrome web browser as its principal user interface as a result chrome os primarily supports web applications7 google announced the project in july 2009 conceiving it as an operating system in which both applications and user data reside in the cloud hence chrome os primarily runs web applications source code and a public demo came that november the first chrome os laptop known as a chromebook arrived in may 2011 initial chromebook shipments from samsung and acer occurred in july 2011 chrome os has an integrated media player and file manager it supports chrome apps which resemble native applications as well as remote access to the desktop a few android applications have been available for the operating system since 2014 reception was initially skeptical with some observers arguing that a browser running on any operating system was functionally equivalent as more chrome os machines have entered the market the operating system is now seldom evaluated apart from the hardware that runs it chrome os is only available preinstalled on hardware from google manufacturing partners an open source equivalent chromium os can be compiled from downloaded source code early on google provided design goals for chrome

external links supported applicationsedit initially chrome os was almost a pure web thin client operating system that rely primarily on servers to host web applications and related data storage89 google gradually began encouraging developers to create packaged applications and later chrome apps the latter employs html5 css adobe shockwave and javascript to provide a user experience closer to a native application1011 meanwhile in september 2014 google launched app runtime for chrome beta which allows certain ported12 android applications to run on chrome os runtime was launched with four android applications duolingo evernote sight words and vine13 open sourceedit chrome os is partially developed under the open source chromium os project14 as with other open source projects developers can modify the code from chromium os and build their own versions whereas chrome os code is only supported by google and its partners and only runs on hardware designed for the purpose unlike chromium os chrome os is automatically updated to the latest version15 historyedit google announced chrome os on july 7 20091 describing it as an operating system in which both applications and user data reside in the cloud to ascertain marketing requirements the company relied on informal metrics including monitoring the usage patterns of some 200 chrome os machines used by google employees developers also noted their own usage patterns matthew papakipos former16 engineering director for the chrome os project put three machines in his house and found himself logging in for brief sessions to make a single search query or send a short email17 on november 19 2009 google released chrome oss source code as the chromium os project18 at a november 19 2009 news conference sundar pichai at the time googles vice president overseeing chrome demonstrated an early version of the operating system he previewed a desktop which looked very similar to the chrome browser and in addition to the regular browser tabs also had application tabs which take less space and can be pinned for easier access at the conference the operating system booted up in seven seconds a time google said it would work to reduce15192021 also on november 19 2009 chris kenyon vice president of oem services at canonical ltd announced that canonical was under contract to contribute engineering resources to the project with the intent to build on existing open source components and tools where feasible22 the launch date for retail hardware featuring chrome os was delayed from late 201023 to june 15 2011 hardwareedit main articles chromebook chromebox and chromebit a chromebook laptops running chrome os are known collectively as chromebooks the first was the cr48 a reference hardware design that google gave to testers and reviewers beginning in december 2010 retail machines followed in may 2011 a year later in may 2012 a desktop design marketed as a chromebox was released by samsung in march 2015 a partnership with aopen was announced and the first commercial chromebox was developed24 in early 2014 lg electronics introduced the first device belonging to the new allinone form factor called chromebase chromebase devices are essentially chromebox hardware inside a monitor with builtin camera microphone and speakers the chromebit is an hdmi dongle running chrome os when placed in an hdmi slot on a television set or computer monitor the device turns that display into a personal computer the device was announced in march 2015 and shipped that november25 chrome os supports dualmonitor setups on devices with a video out port feature updatesedit in april 2012 google made the first update to chrome oss user interface since the operating system had launched introducing a hardwareaccelerated window manager called aura along with a conventional taskbar the additions marked a departure from the operating systems original concept of a single browser with tabs and gave chrome os the look and feel of a more conventional desktop operating system in a way this almost feels as if google is admitting defeat here wrote frederic lardinois on techcrunch he argued that google had traded its original version of simplicity for greater functionality that’s not necessarily a bad thing though and may just help chrome os gain more mainstream acceptance as new users will surely find it to be a more familiar experience26 relationship to androidedit googles offering two open source operating systems android27 and chrome os has drawn some criticism and market confusion as both are clientbased and overlap in functionality steve ballmer microsoft ceo at the time accused google of not being able to make up its mind28 steven levy wrote that the dissonance between the two systems was apparent at google io 2011 the event featured a daily press conference in which each team leader androids andy rubin and chromes sundar pichai unconvincingly tried to explain why the systems werent competitive29 google cofounder sergey brin addressed the question by saying that owning two promising operating systems was a problem that most companies would love to face29 brin suggested that the two operating systems will likely converge over time30 the speculation over convergence increased in march 2013 when chrome os chief pichai replaced rubin as the senior vice president in charge of android thereby putting pichai in charge of both31 the relationship between android and chrome os became more substantial at google io 2014 where developers presented a demo demonstrating native android software running on chrome os through a native client3233 in october 2015 the wall street journal reported that chrome os would be folded into android so that a single os would result by 2017 the resulting os will be android but it will be expanded to run on laptops3435 google responded that while the company has been working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems theres no plan to phase out chrome os36 applicationsedit integrated media player file manageredit google integrates a media player into both chrome os and the chrome browser enabling users to play back mp3s view jpegs and handle other multimedia files while offline37 it supports drm videos38 chrome os also includes an integrated file manager resembling those found on other operating systems with the ability to display directories and the files they contain from both google drive and local storage as well as to preview and manage file contents using a variety of web applications including google docs and box39 since january 2015 chrome os can also integrate additional storage sources into the file manager relying on installed extensions that use the file system provider api40 chrome appsedit main article google chrome app google has encouraged developers to build not just conventional web applications for chrome os but chrome apps formerly known as packaged apps from a user perspective chrome apps resemble conventional native applications they can be launched outside of the chrome browser are offline by default can manage multiple windows and interact with other applications technologies employed include html5 javascript and css414243 android applicationsedit at google io 2014 a proof of concept showing android applications including flipboard running on chrome os was presented in september 2014 google introduced a beta version of the app runtime for chrome arc which allows selected android applications to be used on chrome os using a native clientbased environment that provides the platforms necessary to run android software android applications do not require any modifications to run on chrome os but may be modified to better support a mouse and keyboard environment at its introduction chrome os support was only available for selected android applications32 in 2016 google introduced the ability to run android apps on supported chrome os devices with access to the entire google play store the previous native clientbased solution was dropped in favor of a container containing androids frameworks and dependencies initially based on android 60 which allows android apps to have direct access to the chrome os platform and allow the os to interact with android contracts such as sharing engineering director zelidrag hornung explained that arc had been scrapped due to its limitations including its incompatibility with the android native development toolkit ndk and that it was unable to pass googles own compatibility test suite4445 remote application access and virtual desktop accessedit in june 2010 google software engineer gary kačmarčík wrote that chrome os will access remote applications through a technology unofficially called chromoting which would resemble microsofts remote desktop connection37 the name has since been changed to chrome remote desktop and is probably closer to running an application via remote desktop services or by first connecting to a host machine by using rdp or vnc46 initial rollouts of chrome os laptops chromebooks indicate an interest in enabling users to access virtual desktops4748 designedit early in the project google provided publicly many details of the chrome oss design goals and direction49 although the company has not followed up with a technical description of the completed operating system user interfaceedit old chromechromium os login screen design goals for chrome oss user interface included using minimal screen space by combining applications and standard web pages into a single tab strip rather than separating the two designers considered a reduced window management scheme that would operate only in fullscreen mode secondary tasks would be handled with panels floating windows that dock to the bottom of the screen for tasks like chat and music players split screens were also under consideration for viewing two pieces of content sidebyside chrome os would follow the chrome browsers practice of leveraging html5s offline modes background processing and notifications designers proposed using search and pinned tabs as a way to quickly locate and access applications50 new window manager and graphics engineedit on april 10 2012 a new build of chrome os offered a choice between the original fullscreen window interface and overlapping resizable windows such as found on microsoft windows and apples macos the feature was implemented through the ash window manager which runs atop the aura hardwareaccelerated graphics engine the april 2012 upgrade also included the ability to display smaller overlapping browser windows each with its own translucent tabs browser tabs that can be torn and dragged to new positions or merged with another tab strip and a mouseenabled shortcut list across the bottom of the screen one icon on the task bar shows a list of installed applications and bookmarks writing in cnet stephen shankland argued that with overlapping windows google is anchoring itself into the past as both ios and microsofts metro interface are largely or entirely fullscreen even so chrome os already is different enough that its best to preserve any familiarity that can be preserved515253 architectureedit in preliminary design documents for the chromium os open source project google described a threetier architecture firmware browser and window manager and systemlevel software and userland services54 the firmware contributes to fast boot time by not probing for hardware such as floppy disk drives that are no longer common on computers especially netbooks the firmware also contributes to security by verifying each step in the boot process and incorporating system recovery54 systemlevel software includes the linux kernel that has been patched to improve boot performance userland software has been trimmed to essentials with management by upstart which can launch services in parallel respawn crashed jobs and defer services in the interest of faster booting54 the window manager handles user interaction with multiple client windows much like other x window managers54 hardware supportedit chrome os is initially intended for secondary devices like netbooks not as a users primary pc19 and will run on hardware incorporating an x86 or armbased processor55 while chrome os will support hard disk drives google has requested that its hardware partners use solidstate drives for performance and reliability reasons15 as well as the lower capacity requirements inherent in an operating system that accesses applications and most user data on remote servers in november 2009 matthew papakipos engineering director for the chrome os claimed that the chrome os consumes onesixtieth as much drive space as windows 756 printingedit google cloud print is a google service that helps any application on any device to print on any printer while the cloud provides virtually any connected device with information access the task of developing and maintaining print subsystems for every combination of hardware and operating system—from desktops to netbooks to mobile devices—simply isnt feasible5758 the cloud service requires installation of a piece of software called proxy as part of the chrome os the proxy registers the printer with the service manages the print jobs provides the printer driver functionality and gives status alerts for each job59 in 2016 google included native cups support in chrome os as an experimental feature that may eventually become an official feature with cups support turned on it becomes possible to use most usb printers even if they do not support google cloud print6061 link handlingedit chrome os was designed with the intention of storing user documents and files on remote servers both chrome os and the chrome browser may introduce difficulties to end users when handling specific file types offline for example when opening an image or document residing on a local storage device it may be unclear whether and which specific web application should be automatically opened for viewing or the handling should be performed by a traditional application acting as a preview utility matthew papakipos chrome os engineering director noted in 2010 that windows developers have faced the same fundamental problem quicktime is fighting with windows media player which is fighting with chrome173 securityedit in march 2010 google software security engineer will drewry discussed chrome os security drewry described chrome os as a hardened operating system featuring autoupdating and sandbox features that will reduce malware exposure he said that chrome os netbooks will be shipped with trusted platform module tpm and include both a trusted bootpath and a physical switch under the battery compartment that actuates a developer mode that mode drops some specialized security functions but increases developer flexibility drewry also emphasized that the open source nature of the operating system will contribute greatly to its security by allowing constant developer feedback62 at a december 2010 press conference google claimed that chrome os would be the most secure consumer operating system due in part to a verified boot ability in which the initial boot code stored in readonly memory checks for system compromises63 shell accessedit chrome os includes the chrome shell or crosh which documents minimal functionality such as ping and ssh at crosh startup in the older chrome os versions originally in acer c710 no bashlike shell abilities were provided in the later chromebooks such as acer c720 bash is available from crosh where the entire linux filesystem can be found and explored in developer mode a fullfeatured bash64 shell which is supposed to be used for development purposes65 can be opened via vt2 and is also accessible using the crosh command shell66 to access full privileges in shell eg sudo the root password is required it is chronos in chrome os and facepunch in chrome os vanilla67 release channels and updatesedit chrome os uses the same release system as google chrome there are three distinct channels stable beta and developer preview called the dev channel the stable channel is updated with features and fixes that have been thoroughly tested in the beta channel and the beta channel is updated approximately once a month with stable and complete features from the developer channel new ideas get tested in the developer channel which can be very unstable at times6869 a fourth canary channel was confirmed to exist by google developer francois beaufort and hacker kenny strawn by entering the chrome os shell in developer mode typing the command shell to access the bash shell and finally entering the command updateengineclient channel canarychannel update it is possible to return to verified boot mode after entering the canary channel but the channel updater disappears and the only way to return to another channel is using the powerwash factory reset70 chrome os on windowsedit on windows 8 exceptions allow the default desktop web browser to offer a variant that can run inside its fullscreen metro shell and access features such as the share charm without necessarily needing to be written with windows runtime chromes windows 8 mode was previously a tabletoptimized version of the standard chrome interface in october 2013 the mode was changed on developer channel to offer a variant of the chrome os desktop7172737475 receptionedit at its debut chrome os was viewed as a competitor to microsoft both directly to microsoft windows and indirectly the companys word processing and spreadsheet applications—the latter through chrome oss reliance on cloud computing7677 but chrome os engineering director matthew papakipos argued that the two operating systems would not fully overlap in functionality because chrome os is intended for netbooks which lack the computational power to run a resourceintensive program like adobe photoshop17 some observers claimed that other operating systems already filled the niche that chrome os was aiming for with the added advantage of supporting native applications in addition to a browser tony bradley of pc world wrote in november 2009 “ we can already do most if not all of what chrome os promises to deliver using a windows 7 or linuxbased netbook users can simply not install anything but a web browser and connect to the vast array of google products and other webbased services and applications netbooks have been successful at capturing the lowend pc market and they provide a webcentric computing experience today i am not sure why we should get excited that a year from now well be able to do the same thing but locked into doing it from the fourthplace web browser78 ” after this 2009 statement chrome browser rose to become the number one browser used worldwide79 see alsoedit google portal linux
