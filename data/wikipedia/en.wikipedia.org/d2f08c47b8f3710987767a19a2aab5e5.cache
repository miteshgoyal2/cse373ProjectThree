world and the oldest university press it originated from letters patent granted to the university of cambridge by henry viii in 1534 and has been producing books continuously since the first university press book was printed cambridge is one of the two privileged presses the other being oxford university press authors published by cambridge have included john milton william harvey isaac newton bertrand russell and stephen hawking5 university printing began in cambridge when the first practising university printer thomas thomas set up a printing house on the site of what became the senate house lawn – a few yards from where the presss bookshop now stands in those days the stationers company in london jealously guarded its monopoly of printing which partly explains the delay between the date of the universitys letters patent and the printing of the first book in 1591 thomass successor john legate printed the first cambridge bible an octavo edition of the popular geneva bible the london stationers objected strenuously claiming that they had the monopoly on bible printing the universitys response was to point out the provision in its charter to print all manner of books thus began the presss tradition of publishing the bible a tradition that has endured for over four centuries beginning with the geneva bible and continuing with the authorized version the revised version the new english bible and the revised english bible the restrictions and compromises forced upon cambridge by the dispute with the london stationers did not really come to an end until the scholar richard bentley was given the power to set up a newstyle press in 1696 in july 1697 the duke of somerset made a loan of £200 to the university towards the printing house and presse and james halman registrary of the university lent £100 for the same purpose6 it was in bentleys time in 1698 that a body of senior scholars the curators known from 1733 as the syndics was appointed to be responsible to the university for the presss affairs the press syndicates publishing committee still meets regularly eighteen times a year and its role still includes the review and approval of the presss planned output john baskerville became university printer in the mideighteenth century baskervilles concern was the production of the finest possible books using his own typedesign and printing techniques the university printing house on the main site of the press baskerville wrote the importance of the work demands all my attention not only for my own eternal reputation but i hope also to convince the world that the university in the honour done me has not entirely misplaced their favours caxton would have found nothing to surprise him if he had walked into the presss printing house in the eighteenth century all the type was still being set by hand wooden presses capable of producing only 1000 sheets a day at best were still in use and books were still being individually bound by hand a technological breakthrough was badly needed and it came when lord stanhope perfected the making of stereotype plates this involved making a mould of the whole surface of a page of type and then casting plates from that mould the press was the first to use this technique and in 1805 produced the technically successful and muchreprinted cambridge stereotype bible the letters patent of cambridge university press by henry viii allow the press to print all manner of books the fine initial with the kings portrait inside it and the large first line of script are still discernible by the 1850s the press was using steampowered machine presses employing two to three hundred people and occupying several buildings in the silver street and mill lane area including the one that the press still occupies the pitt building 1833 which was built specifically for the press and in honour of william pitt the younger under the stewardship of c j clay who was university printer from 1854 to 1882 the press increased the size and scale of its academic and educational publishing operation an important factor in this increase was the inauguration of its list of schoolbooks including what came to be known as the pitt press series during clays administration the press also undertook a sizable copublishing venture with oxford the revised version of the bible which was begun in 1870 and completed in 1885 it was in this period as well that the syndics of the press turned down what later became the oxford english dictionary—a proposal for which was brought to cambridge by james murray lexicographer before he turned to oxford the appointment of r t wright as secretary of the press syndicate in 1892 marked the beginning of the presss development as a modern publishing business with a clearly defined editorial policy and administrative structure it was wright with two great historians lord acton and f w maitland who devised the plan for one of the most distinctive cambridge contributions to publishing—the cambridge histories the cambridge modern history was published between 1902 and 1912 nine years later the press issued the first volumes of the freshly edited complete works of shakespeare a project of nearly equal scope that was not finished until 1966 the presss list in science and mathematics began to thrive with men of the stature of albert einstein and ernest rutherford subsequently becoming press authors the presss impressive contribution to journal publishing began in 1893 and today it publishes over 300 journals in 1992 the press opened its own bookshop at 1 trinity street in the centre of cambridge books have been sold continuously on this site since at least 1581 perhaps even as early as 1505 making it the oldest known bookshop site in britain7 in 2012 the press decided to end the tradition of printing after 428 years and now uses third parties to provide all of its print publications governanceedit the pitt building in cambridge which used to be the headquarters of cambridge university press and now serves as a conference centre for the press the press has since 1698 been governed by the press syndics originally known as the curators8 made up of 18 senior academics from the university of cambridge who represent a wide variety of subjects9 the syndicate has several subcommittees an operating board an academic publishing committee an elt education publishing committee and an audit committee the operating board oversees the presss financial strategic and operational affairs while the two publishing committees provide quality assurance and formal approval of the publishing strategy10 the chair of the syndicate is currently sir david bell the operational responsibility of the press is delegated by the syndics to the presss chief executive peter phillips and the press board structureedit cambridge university press is a global organisation with three market facing publishing groups these are academic publishingedit this group

of an errata sheet for the book the american library association issued a recommendation to libraries still holding alms for jihad given the intense interest in the book and the desire of readers to learn about the controversy first hand we recommend that us libraries keep the book available for their users the publishers decision did not have the support of the books authors and was criticised by some who claimed it was incompatible with freedom of speech and with freedom of the press and that it indicated that english libel laws were excessively strict1718 in a new york times book review 7 october 2007 united states congressman frank r wolf described cambridges settlement as basically a book burning19 cup pointed out that at that time it had already sold most of its copies of the book
