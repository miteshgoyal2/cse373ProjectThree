news where she cohosted the monday edition of 2020 with charles gibson and began independent interviews a field which would soon become her trademark kathleen gingrich interviewedit in a january 5 1995 interview with kathleen gingrich mother of republican politician newt gingrich on eye to eye mrs gingrich said she could not say what her son thought about first lady hillary clinton on the air chung asked mrs gingrich to just whisper it to me just between you and me and mrs gingrich replied that her son thought of clinton as a bitch6 many people interpreted chungs suggestion that if mrs gingrich would whisper this statement it would be promised that the statement would be off the record bill carter for the new york times reported ms chung had become the object of some of the most ferocious criticism justified or not ever directed at any network anchor as a result of her now infamous interview with speaker newt gingrichs mother kathleen7 the interview was also parodied on saturday night live8 oklahoma city bombing interviewedit a few months later in the wake of the april 1995 oklahoma city bombing chung was widely criticized for sarcasm as she asked an oklahoma city fire department spokesman can the oklahoma city fire department handle this many oklahomans felt the question was insensitive to the situation for instance a few women created bite me connie chung shirts in response to the interview9 thousands of viewers in oklahoma and elsewhere called and wrote letters of protest over the tone of the questions10 moreover coanchor dan rather was irate that chung was sent from new york to the assignment while he was already in nearby texas11 consequently after public outcry and rathers complaints chung was given a choice to resign or move to weekend anchor or morning anchor or resign chung left the network after being removed as coanchor of cbs evening newscitation needed abcedit in 1997 chung made the jump to abc news as a reporter on 2020 and

not want to broadcast 10 hours a week in the early morning hours cnnedit chung briefly hosted her own show on cnn entitled connie chung tonight for which she was paid 2 million per year though her arrival at cnn was heavily hyped by the network her show was panned by critics cnn changed her show from live to tapedelay to improve its continuity although it performed moderately well in the ratings a 500000 increase in viewers her show was suspended once the 2003 iraq war began during the war she was reduced to reading hourly headlines once cnn resumed regular programming chung requested that cnn resume broadcasting her show as soon as possible the network responded by cancelling it even though her contract had not yet expired in an interview cnn founder ted turner called the show just awful12 martina navratilova interviewedit in july 2002 chung interviewed tennis legend martina navratilova who at that point had been a naturalized us citizen for more than 20 years about her recent criticisms of the us political system chung labelled these criticisms unamerican and unpatriotic and suggested navratilova should go back to czechoslovakia which had ceased to be a united nation nine years earlier rather than use her celebrity status to gain a platform for her complaints when navratilova asked why it was unpatriotic to speak out chung replied well you know the old line love it or leave it13 msnbcedit in january 2006 chung and maury povich began hosting a show titled weekends with maury and connie on msnbc it was chungs first appearance as a television host since 2003 the show was later canceled and aired its final episode on june 17 2006 on this episode chung dressed in a white evening gown and dancing atop a black piano sang a parody to the tune of thanks for the memory video clips of the bizarre offkey farewell performance circulated on internet video sites connie herself commented all i want to be sure of is that viewers understood it was a giant selfparody if anyone took it seriously they really need to get a life14 on the june 27 2006 episode of the tonight show jay leno interviewed chung about her thanks for the memory parody during the interview chung poked fun at her shows low ratings referring to the musical number as a private joke for our two viewers interview styleedit chungs interviews were largely gentle but often they were punctuated by a rapidfire barrage of sharp questions despite this her interviews were still widely recognized as being decidedly softer than those of other interviewers such as barbara walters or mike wallace consequently her interviews were often used as a public relations move by those looking to overcome scandal or controversy some of her more famous interview subjects include claus von bülow and us representative gary condit whom chung interviewed first after the chandra levy disappearance1 chung was the first journalist to interview basketball legend earvin magic johnson after he went public about being hivpositive chung was a judge for the miss universe 2011 contest teachingedit chung accepted a teaching fellowship at the john f kennedy school of government at harvard university15
