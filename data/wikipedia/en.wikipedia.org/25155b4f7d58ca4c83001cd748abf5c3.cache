babok v t e computer programming often shortened to programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs programming involves activities such as analysis developing understanding generating algorithms verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption and implementation commonly referred to as coding12 of algorithms in a target programming language source code is written in one or more programming languages the purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem the process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects including knowledge of the application domain specialized algorithms and formal logic related tasks include testing debugging and maintaining the source code implementation of the build system and management of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs these might be considered part of the programming process but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming implementation or coding reserved for the actual writing of source code software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices contents 1 history 2 modern programming 21 quality

by an analytical engine she is often recognized as historys first computer programmer programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 ad when the automata of aljazari were programmable via pegs and cams to play various rhythms and drum patterns3 and the 1801 jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the program a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them however the first computer program is generally dated to 1843 when mathematician ada lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of bernoulli numbers intended to be carried out by charles babbages analytical engine4 data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards which were kept in order and arranged in program decks in the 1880s herman hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machinereadable form5 later a control panel plugboard added to his 1906 type i tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs and by the late 1940s unit record equipment such as the ibm 602 and ibm 604 were programmed by control panels in a similar way as were the first electronic computers however with the concept of the storedprogram computers introduced in 1949 both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory machine code was the language of early programs written in the instruction set of the particular machine often in binary notation assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format eg add x total with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses however because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages wired control panel for an ibm 402 accounting machine highlevel languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are more abstract and less bound to the underlying hardware they harness the power of computers to make programming easier6 by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula directly eg y x2 5x 9 fortran the first widely used highlevel language to have a functional implementation came out in 19577 and many other languages were soon developed in particular cobol aimed at commercial data processing and lisp for computer research programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape see computer programming in the punch card era by the late 1960s data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers text editors were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards modern programmingedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed august 2010 learn how and when to remove this template message quality requirementsedit whatever the approach to development may be the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties the following properties are among the most important reliability how often the results of a program are correct this depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms and minimization of programming mistakes such as mistakes in resource management eg buffer overflows and race conditions and logic errors such as division by zero or offbyone errors robustness how well a program anticipates problems due to errors not bugs this includes situations such as incorrect inappropriate or corrupt data unavailability of needed resources such as memory operating system services and network connections user error and unexpected power outages usability the ergonomics of a program the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues this involves a wide range of textual graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity intuitiveness cohesiveness and completeness of a programs user interface portability the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a program can be compiledinterpreted and run this depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the different platforms including hardware and operating system resources expected behavior of the hardware and operating system and availability of platform specific compilers and sometimes libraries for the language of the source code maintainability the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to make improvements or customizations fix bugs and security holes or adapt it to new environments good practices8 during initial development make the difference in this regard this quality may not be directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term efficiencyperformance measure of system resources a program consumes processor time memory space slow devices such as disks network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction the less the better this also includes careful management of resources for example cleaning up temporary files and eliminating memory leaks readability of source codeedit in computer programming readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose control flow and operation of source code it affects the aspects of quality above including portability usability and most importantly maintainability readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading trying to understand and modifying existing source code rather than writing new source code unreadable code often leads to bugs inefficiencies and duplicated code a study9 found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it following a consistent programming style often helps readability however readability is more than just programming style many factors having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to efficiently compile and execute the code contribute to readability10 some of these factors include different indent styles whitespace comments decomposition naming conventions for objects such as variables classes procedures etc the presentation aspects of this such as indents line breaks color highlighting and so on are often handled by the source code editor but the content aspects reflect the programmers talent and skills various visual programming languages have also been developed with the intent to resolve readability concerns by adopting nontraditional approaches to code structure and display integrated development environments ides aim to integrate all such help techniques like code refactoring can enhance readability algorithmic complexityedit the academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem for this purpose algorithms are classified into orders using socalled big o notation which expresses resource use such as execution time or memory consumption in terms of the size of an input expert programmers are familiar with a variety of wellestablished algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances methodologiesedit the first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis followed by testing to determine value modeling implementation and failure elimination debugging there exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks one approach popular for requirements analysis is use case analysis many programmers use forms of agile software development where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years there are many approaches to the software development process popular modeling techniques include objectoriented analysis and design ooad and modeldriven architecture mda the unified modeling language uml is a notation used for both the ooad and mda a similar technique used for database design is entityrelationship modeling er modeling implementation techniques include imperative languages objectoriented or procedural functional languages and logic languages measuring language usageedit main article measuring programming language popularity it is very difficult to determine what are the most popular of modern programming languages methods of measuring programming language popularity include counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language11 the number of books sold and courses teaching the language this overestimates the importance of newer languages and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as cobol some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications while some languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications for example cobol is still strong in corporate data centers12 often on large mainframe computers fortran in engineering applications scripting languages in web development and c in embedded software many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use new languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language with new functionality added for example c adds objectorientation to c and java adds memory management and bytecode to c but as a result loses efficiency and the ability for lowlevel manipulation debuggingedit the bug from 1947 which is at the origin of a popular but incorrect etymology for the common term for a software defect main article debugging debugging is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can have significant consequences for its users some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages use of a static code analysis tool can help detect some possible problems normally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem this can be a nontrivial task for example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs also specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem after the bug is reproduced the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug for example a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some large source file however after simplification of the test case only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash such simplification can be done manually using a divideandconquer approach the programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists when debugging the problem in a gui the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear debugging is often done with ides like eclipse visual studio xcode kdevelop netbeans and codeblocks standalone debuggers like gdb are also used and these often provide less of a visual environment usually using a command line some text editors such as emacs allow gdb to be invoked through them to provide a visual environment programming languagesedit main articles programming language and list of programming languages different programming languages support different styles of programming called programming paradigms the choice of language used is subject to many considerations such as company policy suitability to task availability of thirdparty packages or individual preference ideally the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected tradeoffs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team the availability of compilers for that language and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute languages form an approximate spectrum from lowlevel to highlevel lowlevel languages are typically more machineoriented and faster to execute whereas highlevel languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly it is usually easier to code in highlevel languages than in lowlevel ones allen downey in his book how to think like a computer scientist writes the details look different in different languages but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language input gather data from the keyboard a file or some other device output display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device arithmetic perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication conditional execution check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements repetition perform some action repeatedly usually with some variation many computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by shared libraries provided the functions in a library follow the appropriate runtime conventions eg method of passing arguments then these functions may be written in any other language programmersedit main article programmer see also software developer and software engineer
