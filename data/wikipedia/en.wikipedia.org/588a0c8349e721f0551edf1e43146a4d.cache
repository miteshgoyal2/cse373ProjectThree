fun at the inland revenue extortion also called shakedown outwrestling and exaction is a criminal offense of obtaining money property or services from an individual or institution through coercion it is sometimes euphemistically referred to as a protection racket since the racketeers often phrase their demands a payment for protection from real or hypothetical threats from unspecified other parties though often and almost always the person or organization offering protection is the same one willing to cause harm if the money is not paid and such is implied in the protection offer extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime groups the actual obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force1 but additionally in its formal definition means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant2 extortion is distinguished from robbery in robbery whether armed or not the offender takes property from the victim by the immediate use of force or fear that force will be immediately used as in the classic line your money or your life extortion which is not limited to the taking of property involves the verbal or written instillation of fear that something will happen to the victim if they do not comply with the extortionists will another key distinction is that extortion always involves a verbal or written threat whereas robbery does not in united states federal law extortion can be committed with or without the use of force and with or without the use of a weapon in blackmail which always involves extortion the extortionist threatens to reveal information about a victim or their family members that is potentially embarrassing socially damaging or incriminating unless a demand for money property or services is met the term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to pricegouging though neither is legally considered extortion it is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will to another in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences neither extortion nor blackmail requires a threat of a criminal act such as violence merely a threat used to elicit actions money or property from the object of the extortion such threats include the filing of reports true or not of criminal behavior to the police revelation of damaging facts such as pictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position etc contents 1
