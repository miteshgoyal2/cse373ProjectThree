whois from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about a method for checking information about ownership of a domain name for an irc command called whois see list of internet relay chat commands § whois whois pronounced as the phrase who is is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an internet resource such as a domain name an ip address block or an autonomous system but is also used for a wider range of other information the protocol stores and delivers database content in a

handled all domain registrations which was darpa itself the process of registration was established in rfc 920 whois was standardized in the early 1980s to look up domains people and other resources related to domain and number registrations as all registration was done by one organization at that time one centralized server was used for whois queries this made looking up such information very easy responsibility of domain registration remained with darpa as the arpanet became the internet during the 1980s uunet began offering domain registration service however they simply handled the paperwork which they forwarded to the darpa network information center nic then the national science foundation directed that management of internet domain registration would be handled by commercial thirdparty entities internic was formed in 1993 under contract with the nsf consisting of network solutions inc general atomics and att the general atomics contract was canceled after several years due to performance issues 20th century whois servers were highly permissive and would allow wildcard searches a whois query of a persons last name would yield all individuals with that name a query with a given keyword returned all registered domains containing that keyword a query for a given administrative contact returned all domains the administrator was associated with since the advent of the commercialized internet multiple registrars and unethical spammers such permissive searching is no longer available on december 1 1999 management of the toplevel domains tlds com net and org was assigned to icann at the time these tlds were converted to a thin whois model existing whois clients stopped working at that time a month later it had selfdetecting common gateway interface support so that the same program could operate a webbased whois lookup and an external tld table to support multiple whois servers based on the tld of the request this eventually became the model of the modern whois client by 2005 there were many more generic toplevel domains than there had been in the early 1980s there are also many more countrycode toplevel domains this has led to a complex network of domain name registrars and registrar associations especially as the management of internet infrastructure has become more internationalized as such performing a whois query on a domain requires knowing the correct authoritative whois server to use tools to do whois proxy searches have become common crisp and irisedit in 2003 an ietf committee was formed to create a new standard for looking up information on domain names and network numbers cross registry information service protocol crisp2 between january 2005 and july 2006 the working name for this proposed new standard was internet

protocol described in rfc 742 1977 the nicnamewhois protocol was first described in rfc 812 in 1982 by ken harrenstien and vic white of the network information center at sri international whois was originally implemented on the network control program ncp but found its major use when the tcpip suite was standardized across the arpanet and later the internet the protocol specification is the following original quote10 connect to the service host tcp service port 43 decimal ncp icp to socket 43 decimal establishing two 8bit connections send a single command line ending with crlf receive information in response to the command line the server closes its connections as soon as the output is finished the command line server query is normally a single name specification ie the name of a resource however servers accept a query consisting of only the question mark to return a description of acceptable command line formats substitution or wildcard formats also exist eg appending a fullstop period to the query name returns all entries beginning with the query name on the modern internet whois services are typically communicated using the transmission control protocol tcp servers listen to requests on the wellknown port number 43 clients are simple applications that establish a communications channel to the server transmit a text record with the name of the resource to be queried and await the response in form of a sequence of text records found in the database this simplicity of the protocol also permits an application and a command line interface user to query a whois server using the telnet protocol implementationedit whois lookups were traditionally performed with a command line interface application but now many alternative webbased tools exist whois has a sister protocol called referral whois rwhois a whois database consists of a set of text records for each resource these text records consists of various items of information about the resource itself and any associated information of assignees registrants administrative information such as creation and expiration dates two data models exist for storing resource information in a whois database the thick and the thin model thin and thick lookupsedit whois information can be stored and looked up according to either a thick or a thin data model thick a thick whois server stores the complete whois information from all the registrars for the particular set of data so that one whois server can respond with whois information on all org domains for example thin a thin whois server stores only the name of the whois server of the registrar of a domain which in turn has the full details on the data being looked up such as the com whois servers which refer the whois query to the registrar where the domain was registered the thick model usually ensures consistent data and slightly faster queries since only one whois server needs to be contacted if a registrar goes out of business a thick registry contains all important information if the registrant entered correct data and privacy features were not used to obscure the data and registration information can be retained but with a thin registry the contact information might not be available and it could be difficult for the rightful registrant to retain control of the domain11 if a whois client did not understand how to deal with this situation it would display the full information from the registrar unfortunately the whois protocol has no standard for determining how to distinguish the thin model from the thick model specific details of which records are stored vary among domain name registries some toplevel domains including com and net operate a thin whois requiring domain registrars to maintain their own customers data the other global toplevel registries including org operate a thick model12 each countrycode toplevel registry has its own national rules softwareedit the first applications written for the whois information system were command line interface tools for unix and unixlike operating systems ie solaris linux etc whois client and server software is distributed as free opensource software and binary distributions are included with all unixlike systems various commercial unix implementations may use a proprietary implementation for example solaris 7 a whois command line client passes a phrase given as an argument directly to the whois server various free open source examples can still be found on sites such as sourceforgenet however most modern whois tools implement command line flags or options such as the h option to access a specific server host but default servers are preconfigured additional options may allow control of the port number to connect on displaying additional debugging data or changing recursionreferral behavior like most tcpip clientserver applications a whois client takes the user input and then opens an internet socket to its destination server the whois protocol manages the transmission of the query and reception of results webedit with the advent of the world wide web and especially the loosening up of the network solutions monopoly looking up whois information via the web has become quite common at present popular webbased whoisqueries may be conducted from arin13 ripe14 and apnic15 most early webbased whois clients were merely frontends to a commandline client where the resulting output just gets displayed on a web page with little if any cleanup or formatting currently web based whois clients usually perform the whois queries directly and then format the results for display many such clients are proprietary authored by domain name registrars the need for webbased clients came from the fact that commandline whois clients largely existed only in the unix and large computing worlds microsoft windows and macintosh computers had no whois clients installed by default so registrars had to find a way to provide access to whois data for potential customers many endusers still rely on such clients even though command line and graphical clients exist now for most home pc platforms microsoft provides the sysinternals suite that includes a whois client at no cost there are also many sites not owned by registrars or internetrelated companies these support most of main tld and remain free but most of webbased whois sites are incomplete and do not support all tld nor ip search16 cpan has several perl modules available that work with whois servers many of them are not current and do not fully function with the current 2005 whois server infrastructure however there is still much useful functionality to derive including looking up as numbers and registrant contactscitation needed serversedit this section does

message regional internet registriesedit regional internet registries whois servers operated by regional internet registries rir can be queried directly to determine the internet service provider responsible for a particular resource the records of each of these registries are crossreferenced so that a query to arin for a record which belongs to ripe will return a placeholder pointing to the ripe whois server this lets the whois user making the query know that the detailed information resides on the ripe server in addition to the rirs servers commercial services exist such as the routing assets database used by some large networks eg large internet providers that acquired other isps in several rir areas server discoveryedit there is currently no standard for determining the responsible whois server for a dns domain though a number of methods are in common use for toplevel domains tlds some whois lookups require searching the procuring domain registrar to display domain owner details query exampleedit normally the contact information of the resources assignee is returned however some registrars offer private registration in which case the contact information of the registrar is shown instead some registry operators are wholesalers meaning that they typically provide domain name services to a large number of retail registrars who in turn offer them to consumers for private registration only the identity of the wholesale registrar may be returned in this case the identity of the individual as well as the retail registrar may be hidden below is an example of whois data returned for an individual resource holder this is the result of a whois query of examplecom whois examplecom querying whoisverisigngrscom redirected to whoisianaorg querying whoisianaorg

iana referral whoisedit referral whois rwhois is an extension of the original whois protocol and service rwhois extends the concepts of whois in a scalable hierarchical fashion potentially creating a system with a treelike architecture queries are deterministically routed to servers based on hierarchical labels reducing a query to the primary repository of information17 lookups of ip address allocations are often limited to the larger classless interdomain routing cidr blocks eg 24 22 16 because usually only the regional internet registries rirs and domain registrars run rwhois or whois servers although rwhois is intended to be run by even smaller local internet registries to provide more granular information about ip address assignment rwhois is intended to replace whois providing an organized hierarchy of referral services where one could connect to any rwhois server request a lookup and be automatically redirected to the correct servers however while the technical functionality is in place adoption of the rwhois standard has been weak rwhois services are typically communicated using the transmission control protocol tcp servers listen to requests on the wellknown port number 4321 rwhois was first specified in rfc 1714 in 1994 by network solutions17 but the specification was superseded in 1997 by rfc 216718 the referral features of rwhois are different than the feature of a whois server to refer responses to another server which rwhois also implements criticismedit one criticism of whois is the lack of full access to the data1920 few parties have realtime access to the complete databases others cite the competing goal of domain privacy as a criticism although this problem is strongly mitigated by domain privacy services currently the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann broadly requires that the mailing address phone number and email address of those owning or administrating a domain name to be made publicly available through the whois directories the registrants domain owners contact details such as address and telephone number are easily accessible to anyone who queries a whois server however that policy enables spammers direct marketers identity thieves or other attackers to loot the directory for personal information about these people although icann has been exploring changing whois to enable greater privacy there is a lack of consensus among major stakeholders as to what type of change should be made21 some domain registrars offer private registrations also known as domain privacy by which the contact information of the registrar is shown instead of the customers with the offer of private registration from many registrars some of the risk has been mitigated studies have shown that spammers can and do harvest plaintext email addresses from whois servers22 for this reason some whois servers and websites offering whois queries have implemented ratelimiting systems such as webbased captcha and limited amounts of search queries per user ip address the whois protocol was not written with an international audience in mind a whois server andor client cannot determine the text encoding in effect for the query or the database content many servers were originally using usascii and internationalization concerns werent taken into consideration until much later23 this might impact the usability or usefulness of the whois protocol in countries outside the usa1 in the case of internationalized domain names it is the responsibility of the client application to perform the translation of the domain name between its native language script and the dns name in punycode accuracy of informationedit in cases where the registrants domain owner identity is public anyone can easily confirm the status of a domain via whois in the case of private registrations ascertaining registration information may be more difficult if a registrant who acquired a domain name wants to verify the registrar has completed the registration process three steps may be required perform a whois and confirm that the resource is at least registered with icann determine the name of the wholesale registrar and contact the wholesaler and obtain the name of the retail registrar this provides some confidence that the retailer actually registered the name but if the registrar goes out of business as with the failure of registerfly in 2007 the rightful domain holder with privacyprotected registrations may have difficulty regaining the administration of hisher domain name11 registrants using private registration can attempt to protect themselves by using a registrar that places customer data in escrow with a third party icann requires that every registrant of a domain name be given the opportunity to correct any inaccurate contact data associated with hisher domain for this reason registrars are required to periodically send the holder the contact information on record for verification but they do not provide any guarantee about the accuracy of information if the registrant provided inaccurate information law and policyedit whois has generated policy issues in the united states federal government as noted above whois creates a privacy issue which is also tied to free speech and anonymity however whois is an important tool for law enforcement officers investigating violations like spam and phishing to track down the holders of domain names as a result law enforcement agencies have sought to make whois records both open and verified24 the federal trade commission has testified about how inaccurate whois records thwart their investigations25 congressional hearings have been conducted about the importance of whois in 2001 2002 and 200626 the fraudulent online identity sanctions act27 make it a violation of trademark and copyright law if a person knowingly provided or caused to be provided materially false contact information in making maintaining or renewing the registration of a domain name used in connection with the violation28 where the latter violation refers to a prior violation of trademark or copyright law the act does not make the submission of false whois data illegal in itself only if used to shield oneself from prosecution for crimes committed using that domain name icann proposal to abolish whoisedit the expert working group ewg of the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann recommended on 24 june 2013 that whois should be scrapped it recommends that whois be replaced with a system that keeps information secret from most internet users and only discloses information for permissible purposes29 icanns list of permissible purposes includes domainname research domainname sale and purchase regulatory enforcement personal data protection legal actions and abuse mitigation30 although whois has been a key tool of journalists in determining who was disseminating certain information on the internet31 the use of whois by the free press is not included in icann’s proposed list of permissible purposes the ewg collected public input on the initial report until 13 september 2013 its final report was issued on 6 june 2014 without meaningful changes to the recommendations32 icann is now in the process of reinventing whois working on icann whois beta3334 standards documentsedit rfc
