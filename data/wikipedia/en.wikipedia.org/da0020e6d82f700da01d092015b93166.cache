historyedit formation and early history 1965–1973edit rudolf schenker the bands rhythm guitarist launched the band in 1965 at first the band had beat influences and schenker himself handled the vocals19 things began to come together in 1970 when schenkers younger brother michael and vocalist klaus meine joined the band in 1972 the group recorded and released their debut album lonesome crow with lothar heimberg on bass and wolfgang dziony on drums20 during the lonesome crow tour the scorpions opened for upcoming british band ufo near the end of the tour guitarist michael schenker accepted an offer of lead guitar for ufo uli jon roth a friend of michaels was then introduced to the band and he helped them to finish off the tour the departure of michael schenker led to the breakup of the band in 1973 uli roth who had helped the scorpions complete the lonesome crow tour was offered the role as lead guitarist but turned the band down preferring instead to remain in the band dawn road rudolf schenker eventually decided that he wanted to work with roth but did not want to resurrect the last scorpions lineup he attended some of dawn roads rehearsals and ultimately decided to join the band which consisted of roth francis buchholz bass achim kirschning keyboards and jürgen rosenthal drums uli roth and buchholz persuaded rudolf schenker to invite klaus meine to join on vocals which he soon did while there were more members of dawn road than scorpions in the band they decided to use the scorpions name because it was well known in the german hard rock scene and an album had been released under that name21 rise to fame 1974–1978edit in 1974 the new lineup released fly to the rainbow the album proved to be more successful than lonesome crow and songs such as speedys coming and the title track established the bands sound achim kirschning decided to leave after the recordings soon after jürgen rosenthal had to leave as he was being drafted into the army in 1976 he would join a german progressive rock band called eloy recording three albums he was replaced in july 1974 by jurgen fechter in 1975 rudy lenners from belgium became the next drummer that year 1975 the band released in trance which marked the beginning of their long collaboration with german producer dieter dierks the album was a huge step forward for the scorpions and established their heavy metal formula it garnered a fan base at home and abroad with cuts such as in trance dark lady and robot man meanwhile as the hunters the band recorded fuchs geh voran and wenn es richtig losgeht german cover versions of action and fox on the run by sweet for emis electrola label22 in 1976 the scorpions released virgin killer the album cover of which featured a nude prepubescent girl behind a broken pane of glass the cover art was designed by stefan bohle who was the product manager for rca records23 their label at the time the cover brought the band considerable market exposure but was subsequently pulled or replaced in other countries the album itself garnered widespread praise for its music from select critics and fan base in 2008 the cover art on the english wikipedia was blacklisted by the internet watch foundation the following year rudy lenners resigned for personal reasons and was replaced by herman rarebell for the followup taken by force rca records made a determined effort to promote the album in stores and on the radio the albums single steamrock fever was added to some of rcas radio promotional records roth was not happy with the commercial direction the band was taking although he performed on the bands japan tour he departed to form his own band electric sun prior to the release of the resultant double live album tokyo tapes tokyo tapes was released in the us and europe six months after its japanese release by that time in mid 1978 after auditioning around 140 guitarists the scorpions recruited guitarist matthias jabs commercial success 1978–1992edit following the addition of jabs scorpions left rca for mercury records in the united states and harvestemi electrola worldwide to record their next album lovedrive just weeks after quitting ufo michael schenker returned to the group for a short period during the recordings for the album this gave the band three guitarists though schenkers contribution to the final release was limited to only three songs the result was lovedrive an album which some critics consider to be the pinnacle of their career24 containing such fan favourites as loving you sunday morning always somewhere holiday and the instrumental coast to coast it firmly cemented the scorpions formula of hard rock songs mixed with melodic ballads the albums provocative artwork was named best album sleeve of 1979 by playboy magazine yet ultimately changed for american release lovedrive reached no 55 on the us charts demonstrating that the band was gathering an international following after the completion and release of the album the band decided to retain michael in the band forcing jabs to leave however in april 1979 during their tour in france michael quit and jabs was brought in permanently to replace him the scorpions logo in 1980 the band released animal magnetism again with a provocative cover this time showing a girl kneeling and a doberman pinscher sitting in front of a man animal magnetism contained classics such as the zoo and make it real soon after the albums release meine began experiencing throat problems he required surgery on his vocal cords and doubts were raised about whether he would ever sing again meanwhile the band began working on their next album blackout in 1981 don dokken was brought in to provide guide and backing vocals while meine recovered25 meine eventually healed completely and was able to finish the album blackout was released in 1982 and quickly became the bands best selling album to date eventually going platinum meines voice showed no signs of weakness and fan response to the album was good blackout spawned two singles no one like you and cant live without you gaining in popularity from the success of blackout the scorpions performed to over 375000 fans on day 2 at the threeday us festival concert held in san bernardino california during memorial day weekend of 1983 the concert was aired live on mtv giving the band wide exposure in a live show the 1984 album love at first sting cemented the scorpions status as an internationally popular band propelled by the single rock you like a hurricane love at first sting climbed the charts and went double platinum in the usa a few months after its release mtv gave the albums videos rock you like a hurricane bad boys running wild big city nights and the power ballad still loving you significant airtime greatly contributing to the albums success the channel even supplied scorpions with the nickname the ambassadors of rock to the chagrin of industry insiders who recognised the executive influence behind the scenes rolling stone magazine named them the heroes of heavy metal the band toured extensively behind love at first sting and released their second live album world wide live in 1985 recorded over a yearlong world tour and released at the height of their popularity the album was another success for the band peaking at no 14 in the charts in the us and at no 18 in the uk after their extensive world tours the band finally returned to the studio to record savage amusement released in 1988 four years after their previous studio album savage amusement represented a more polished and mature sound similar to the style def leppard had found success with the album sold well but was considered somewhat of a critical disappointment however british heavy rock magazine kerrang did award the album five ks out of five on the savage amusement tour in 1988 the scorpions became only the second western group not american to play in the soviet union uriah heep had performed in december 1987 in leningrad the following year the band returned to perform at the moscow music peace festival as a result the scorpions developed an extended russian fan base and still return to perform26 wishing to distance themselves from the savage amusement style the band separated from their longtime producer and sixth scorpion dieter dierks replacing him with keith olsen when they returned to the studio in 1990 crazy world was released that same year and displayed a less polished sound the album was propelled in large part by the massive success of the ballad wind of change the song muses on the sociopolitical changes that were occurring in eastern europe and in other parts of the world at the end of the cold war on 21 july 1990 they joined many other guests for roger waters massive performance of the wall in berlin scorpions performed both versions of in the flesh from the wall after the crazy world tour francis buchholz the bands longserving bassist left the group later days 1993–2009edit in 1993 the scorpions released face the heat bass was handled by ralph rieckermann for the recording process the band brought in producer bruce fairbairn the albums sound was more metal than melodic neither the heavy metal single alien nation nor the ballad under the same sun came close to matching the success of wind of change face the heat was a moderate success in 1995 a new album live bites was produced the disc documented retro live performances from their savage amusement tour in 1988 all the way through the face the heat tour in 1994 while the album had a technologically cleaner sound in comparison to their bestselling live album world wide live it was not as successful prior to recording their 13th studio album 1996s pure instinct drummer herman rarebell left the band to set up a recording label curt cress took charge of the drumsticks for the album before louisville kentuckyborn james kottak took over permanently the album had many ballads still the albums singles wild child and the soothing ballad you and i both enjoyed moderate success 1999 saw the release of eye ii eye and a significant change in the bands style mixing in elements of pop and techno while the album was slickly produced it was not received well by fans the video to the albums first european single to be no 1 featured a monica lewinsky lookalike which did little to improve its popularity the following year the scorpions had an artistic collaboration with the berlin philharmonic that resulted in a 10song album named moment of glory the album went a long way toward rebuilding the bands reputation after the harsh criticism of eye ii eye however critics accused them of following on the coattails of metallicas similar collaboration sm with the san francisco symphony which had been released the previous year even though the orchestra had first approached the scorpions with the idea in 1995 scorpions in 2007 in 2001 the scorpions released acoustica a live unplugged album featuring acoustic reworkings of the bands biggest hits plus new tracks while appreciated by fans the lack of a new studio album was frustrating to some and acoustica did little to return the band to the spotlight in 2004 the band released unbreakable an album that was hailed by critics as a longawaited return to form the album was the heaviest the band had released since face the heat whether a result of poor promotion by the bands label or the long time between studio releases unbreakable received little airplay and did not chart scorpions toured extensively behind the album and played as special guests with judas priest during the 2005 british tour—these were the scorpions first dates in the uk since 1999 in early 2006 the scorpions released the dvd 1 night in vienna that included 14 live tracks and a complete rockumentary in la the band spent about four months in the studio with producers james michael and desmond child working on a concept album titled humanity hour i which was released in late may 200727 and was followed by the humanity world tour in 2007 the band collaborated with two of their signature tracks in the video game series guitar hero no one like you was featured on the rocks the 80s version of the game while rock you like a hurricane was released on guitar hero 3 legends of rock on 14 may 2007 the scorpions released humanity – hour i in europe humanity – hour i became available in the us on august 28 on new door records entering the billboard charts at number no 63 in a september 2007 podcast interview meine said the album was not so much a concept album but rather a collection of songs with a common theme we didnt want to make another record with songs about boys chasing girls i mean come on give me a break meine said28 asked in 2007 if the band was planning to release a humanity – hour ii meine replied that is what everybody is asking there might be who knows right now we are at the beginning of the world tour it is exciting to play the new songs and they go very well with the classics it is exciting that there is a whole new audience out there there are many longtime fans but there are a lot of young kids we just played in london and in paris and there were young kids rocking out to songs that were written way before they were born it is amazing i don’t want to think about hour ii right now because hour i is so exciting it is very inspiring to see how much the audience enjoys this new music — klaus meine29 on 20 december 2007 the scorpions played at a concert for the elite of
