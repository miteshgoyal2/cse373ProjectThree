the seattle municipal street railway converted its last two streetcar routes 19 eighth avenue northwest and 21 phinney avenue to buses now numbered 28 and 5 respectively6 both used westlake avenue to reach the fremont bridge from downtown7 restoration of rail service on westlake avenue was originally envisioned by microsoft cofounder paul allen to help improve the south lake union neighborhood in which his venture capital company vulcan inc is heavily invested8 allens main supporter from the beginning was seattle mayor greg nickels but he was not universally supported by the seattle city council which was concerned about the lack of public support for the line and questioned if it should be moved ahead of seattles other transportation needs9 after heavy lobbying by south lake union businesses including vulcan the seattle city council approved the development of the neighborhood into a biotechnology and biomedical research center included in that plan was funding to investigate a 13mile 21 km us45 million streetcar line the line was approved in 2005 at a cost of 505 million with 25 million paid by property owners along the streetcars route and the remainder paid by federal state and local funds10 the final cost was 564 million additional costs were mostly utility work needed after the line opened11 the majority of property owners along the alignment supported the project despite being asked to pay increased taxes to fund its construction only 12 of 750 affected property owners formally objected to the proposed local improvement district tax12 the project was modeled after the portland streetcar a similar modernstreetcar system that had opened in portland oregon in 200113 the city council gave final approval to the project in march 200614 and construction began in july 200613 some local residents and business owners opposed to the streetcar claimed that it was originally called the south lake union trolley which abbreviates to slut while there is no evidence that this name was ever used as an official name the acronyms popularity has caused it to become an unofficial one415 service was inaugurated on december 12 2007 and until the end of the
