105432 local time on february 28 the intraslab earthquake had a moment magnitude of 68 and a maximum mercalli intensity of viii severe the epicenter was in the southern puget sound northeast of olympia but the shock was felt in oregon canada eastern washington and idaho4 this was one of several large earthquakes that occurred in the puget sound region in the prior 52 years and caused property damage valued at between one and four billion dollars one person died of a heart attack and several hundred were injured contents 1 earthquake 11 damage 12 ground effects 2 response 3 see also 4 references 5 external links earthquakeedit see also geology of the pacific northwest and puget sound faults the puget sound area is prone to deep earthquakes due to the juan de fuca tectonic plates subduction under the north american plate at 35 to 45 cm a year4 as part of the cascadia subduction zone which causes stress in the north american plate as the juan de fuca plate sinks into the mantle similar significant earthquakes occurred in the same general region on april 29 1965 magnitude 67 depth 59 km 37 mi and april 13 1949 magnitude 67 depth 50 km 31 mi damageedit a large van was crushed by bricks in a seattle parking lot although there were no directlyrelated deaths local news outlets reported that there was one death from a heart attack5 about 400 people were injured5 most of the property damage occurred very near the epicenter or in unreinforced concrete or masonry buildings such as those in the first hill pioneer square and sodo neighborhoods of seattle the trinity parish church on first hill was severely damaged6 the air traffic control tower at sea–tac airport was heavily damaged it has since been replaced with a more earthquakeresistant tower the quake splintered a buttress under the dome of the capitol building in olympia but previous earthquakeresistance work prevented more serious harm to the building7 additionally power outages affected downtown seattle8 the us militarys ft lewis and mcchord air force base received damage and there was very slight damage in victoria british columbia9 the fourth avenue bridge in olympia was severely damaged in the foreground is a piling for a temporary bridge following the quake many buildings and structures in the area were closed temporarily for inspection this included several bridges all state offices in olympia and boeings factories in the seattle area various schools in the state also closed for the day the fourth avenue bridge in downtown olympia was heavily damaged and was later torn down and rebuilt1011 in seattle the alaskan way viaduct and its seawall were damaged forcing the viaduct to close for emergency repairs and ultimately factoring into the decision to replace the viaduct entirely12 approximately 305 million of insured losses and a total of 2 billion worth of damage was caused in the state of washington the area was declared a natural disaster area by president george w bush and was therefore able to receive federal recovery assistance the number of businesses in the heavily affected region was relatively small13 at least 20 of businesses surrounding the heavily affected area took direct losses while 2 had direct losses of over 10000 none of these businesses received money for direct damage from federal aid or insurance13 many businesses did not receive any aid at all those that did receive aid had no help with indirect losses indirect losses varied from inventory or data corruption disruption in the workplace productivity etc data and inventory losses were possibly the most damaging especially for retail stores retail stores lost inventory as well as peoples interest for a period of time after the quake one of the vital elements to prevent damage and injury were well structured buildings this can prevent the loss of life as well as inventory13 businesses that did not sustain very much damage also gained a sense of security that may be unreliable as the moment magnitude was high but the hypocenter was deep under the earth this earthquake was a 68 moment magnitude that caused 2 billion damage while the northridge earthquake was a 67 moment magnitude but caused more than 20 billion worth of damage as the hypocenter of the northridge earthquake was much shallower and closer to the surface of the earth1314 ground effectsedit named after the nisqually delta this earthquake hit the southern end of puget sound causing damage to the ports of seattle and tacoma155 in the month following the earthquake the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the usgs assembled a team to map the bathymetry of the deltas near the epicenter this revealed multiple submarine failures on the puyallup and duwamish delta fronts in other areas liquefaction sand boils landslides and soil slumping occurred15 liquefaction was also determined to be a main contributor to increased stream flows with multiple stream gauges collecting data before and after the earthquake there was a regular pattern of higher increased stream flow around areas where liquefaction occurred16 soil liquefaction was also observed at a wildlife refuge causing damage to the buildings within17 responseedit a rapid response plan was developed a year later the region realized how they avoided a potential extremely damaging catastrophe many businesses organizations hospitals etc were asked to sign a regional disaster plan this would allow disaster relief teams to locate and aid places much faster than before it would also be able to direct limited resources to places with greatest immediate need418 see alsoedit wikimedia commons has media related to 2001 nisqually earthquake list of earthquakes in 2001 list of earthquakes in the united states
