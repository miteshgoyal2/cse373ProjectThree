american businessmen martin bromley irving bromberg and james humpert formed a company called standard games in honolulu hawaii to provide coinoperated amusement machines to military bases they saw that the onset of world war ii and the consequent increase in the number of military personnel would mean there would be demand for something for those stationed at military bases to do in their leisure time after the war the founders sold that company and established a new distributor called service games named for the military focus in 1951 the government of the united states outlawed slot machines in us territories so bromley sent two of his employees richard stewart and ray lemaire to tokyo japan in 1952 to establish a new distributor the company provided coinoperated slot machines to us bases in japan and changed its name again to service games of japan by 19535678 david rosen an american officer in the united states air force stationed in japan launched a twominute photo booth business in tokyo in 19545 this company eventually became rosen enterprises and in 1957 began importing coinoperated games to japan on may 31 1960 service games japan was closed a few days later on june 3 two new companies were established to take over its business activities nihon goraku bussan and nihon kikai seizo9 by 1965 rosen enterprises grew to a chain of over 200 arcades rosen then orchestrated a merger between rosen enterprises and nihon goraku bussan becoming chief executive of the new company sega enterprises which derived its name from service games10 within a year sega began the transition from importer to manufacturer with the release of the submarine simulator game periscope the game sported light and sound effects considered innovative for that time eventually becoming quite successful in japan it was soon exported to both europe and the united states becoming the first arcade game in the us to cost 25 cents per play10 in 1969 rosen sold sega to american conglomerate gulf and western industries although he remained as ceo following the sale under rosens leadership sega continued to grow and prosper and in 1974 gulf and western made sega enterprises ltd a subsidiary of an american company renamed sega enterprises inc allowing them to take the companys stock public golden age of arcade games 1978–1983 sega prospered heavily from the arcade gaming boom of the late 1970s with revenues climbing to over us100 million by 197910 in 1982 segas revenues surpassed 214 million that year they introduced the first game with isometric graphics zaxxon11 the industrys first stereoscopic 3d game subroc 3d and the first laserdisc video game astron belt astron belt wasnt released in the us until 1983 after dragons lair other notable games from sega during this period are head on 1979 monaco gp 1979 carnival 1980 turbo 1981 space fury 1981 astro blaster 1981 and pengo 1982 entry into the home console market 1982–1989 in 19834 sega published atari 2600 versions of some of its arcade games and also tapper from ballymidway12 carnival space fury turbo and zaxxon were licensed to coleco as launch titles for the colecovision console in 1982 some of these and other titles were licensed to different companies for 8bit computer versions the atari 8bit computer port of zaxxon is from datasoft for example while the commodore 64 port is from synapse11 an overabundance of games in 1983 led to the video game crash causing segas revenues to drop to 136 million seeking an alternate source of revenue from the slumping arcade market13 sega designed and released its first home video game console the sg1000 for the third generation of home consoles gw sold the us assets of sega enterprises that same year to pinball manufacturer bally manufacturing and in january 1984 rosen resigned his post with the company10 the sg1000 had an unexpectedly successful launch year but was quickly pushed into obscurity by nintendos nes which though it launched the same day as the sg1000 had more advanced hardware and greater third party support13 the japanese assets of sega were purchased for 38 million by a group of investors led by rosen robert deith and hayao nakayama a japanese businessman who owned esco boueki esco trading an arcade game distribution company that had been acquired by rosen in 19791014 nakayama became the new ceo of sega robert deith chairman of the board and rosen became head of its subsidiary in the united states in 1984 the multibilliondollar japanese conglomerate csk bought sega renamed it to sega enterprises headquartered it in japan and two years later shares of its stock were being traded on the tokyo stock exchange david rosens friend isao okawa the chairman of csk became chairman of sega10 sega also released the sega master system and the first game featuring alex kidd who would be segas unofficial mascot until he was replaced by sonic the hedgehog in 1991 while the master system was technically superior to the nes15 it failed to capture market share in north america and japan due to highly aggressive strategies by nintendo and ineffective marketing by tonka who marketed the console on behalf of sega in the united states16 however the master system was highly successful in europe australia new zealand and brazil with games still being sold well into the 1990s alongside the mega drive and nintendos nes and snes in the mid1980s sega released hangon and after burner arcade titles that make use of hydraulic cabinet functionality and force feedback control sega also released the 360degree rotating machine r360 for arcade system boards sega released the system series and the super scaler series ufo catcher was introduced in 1985 and is japans most commonly installed claw crane game17

north america in 1989 sega of america launched an antinintendo campaign to carry the momentum to the new generation of games with its slogan genesis does what nintendont this was initially implemented by sega of america president michael katz18 when nintendo launched its super nintendo entertainment system in north america in august 1991 sega changed its slogan to welcome to the next level the same year sega of americas leadership passed from katz to tom kalinske who further escalated the console war that was developing19 as a preemptive strike against the release of the snes sega rebranded itself with a new game and mascot sonic the hedgehog this shift led to a wider success for the genesis and would eventually propel sega to 65 of the market in north america for a brief time simultaneously after much delay sega released the sega cd in japan in 1991 and in north america in 1992 as a hardware addon to the genesis greatly reducing space limitations on their games sonic the hedgehog 2 was also released in 1992 for the genesis and became the most successful game sega ever produced selling over six million copies in total20 during this period local north american development also increased with the establishments of sega technical institute in 1990 sega midwest studio in 1992 sega multimedia studio in 1993 and the acquisition of interactive designs in 1992 in 1990 sega launched the game gear to compete against nintendos game boy however due to issues with its short battery life lack of original titles and weak support from sega the game gear was unable to surpass the game boy selling approximately 11 million units the game gear was succeeded by the sega nomad in 1995 and discontinued in 1997 in 1992 sega introduced the model series of arcade hardware which saw the release of virtua fighter and virtua racing which laid the foundation for 3d racing and fighting games21 in 1994 sega released the sega 32x in an attempt to upgrade the genesis to the standards of more advanced systems at the time it sold well initially but had problems with lack of software and hype about the upcoming sega saturn and sonys playstation22 within a year it was in the bargain bins of many stores23 on november 22 1994 sega launched the sega saturn in japan it utilized two 32bit processors however poor sales in the west led to the console being abandoned by 199824 the lack of strong titles based on established genesis franchises along with its high price in comparison to the sony playstation were among the reasons for the consoles failure25 notable titles in japan include sakura wars panzer dragoon and arcade ports such as the house of the dead virtua fighter 2 and sega rally championship sega made forays in the pc market with the 1995 establishment of segasoft which was tasked with creating original saturn and pc titles2627 the mid1990s also saw sega making efforts to expand beyond its image as a strictly kidsoriented family entertainment company by publishing a number of games with extreme violence and sexual themes and introducing the deep water label to mark games with mature content28 in december 1994 sega channel a subscription gaming service delivered by local cable companies affiliated with time warner cable was launched in the united states through which subscribers received a special cartridge adapter that connected to the cable connection at its peak the sega channel had approximately 250000 subscribers various technical issues began disrupting the service in late 1997 eventually leading to the sega channel being discontinued worldwide in 199829 on november 27 1998 sega launched the dreamcast in japancitation needed the console was competitively priced partly due to the use of offtheshelf components but it also featured technology that allowed for more technically impressive games than its direct competitors the nintendo 64 and playstationcitation needed an analog 56k modem was also included allowing for online multiplayer it featured titles such as the actionpuzzle title chuchu rocket phantasy star online the first consolebased massively multiplayer online roleplaying game mmorpg quake iii arena and alien front online the first console game with online voice chat the dreamcasts launch in japan was a failure launching with a small library of software and in the shadow of the upcoming playstation 2 the system would gain little ground despite several successful games in the regioncitation needed after closures of all their former american developers in 1995 and the closure of the pc segasoft division sega invested in the american visual concepts and the french no cliché although the latter was closed in 2001 the dreamcasts western launch in 1999 was accompanied by a large amount of both firstparty and thirdparty software and an aggressive marketing campaign in contrast to the japanese launch the western launch earned the distinction of the most successful hardware launch in history selling a thenunprecedented 500000 consoles in its first week in north america24 sega was able to hold onto this momentum in the us almost until the launch of sonys playstation 2citation needed the dreamcast is home to several innovative and critically acclaimed games including one of the first celshaded titles jet set radio jet grind radio in north america seaman a game involving communication with a fishtype creature via microphone samba de amigo a rhythm game involving the use of maracas and shenmue a largescope adventure game with freeform gameplay and a detailed ingame

the sega seal of quality was an icon placed on the packaging of all video games that had segas official approval to be played on a sega console system similarly to the nintendo seal of quality the intention was to avoid the mistakes that led to the north american video game crash of 1983 by ensuring games were compatible with the intended console system and to censor content felt inappropriate the seal appeared on a video games box and marketing as a means of informing the consumer that sega had previewed the game before its release and had met a certain level of quality standard including graphics sound challenge and content appropriateness sega never required a thirdparty software developer to earn the official seal as a precondition for publication although most developers chose to do so furthermore a game could earn the seal even if it contained certain themes that its bigger competitor nintendo would have prohibited blood scantily clad females and graphic violence video games released on a sega home console system could still censored by the software developer for other taboo or controversial depiction including profanity nudity prostitution and homosexuality in 1993 sega of america permitted acclaim to keep the graphic violence and gore in its port of midways popular arcade game mortal kombat as this game and other games sparked a national controversy over violent content in video games sega created the videogame rating council to give a descriptive rating to every game sold on a sega home console system in the united states this rating along with the seal would appear on the games box and marketing the videogame rating council was phased out in 1994 with the adoption of the industry wide entertainment software rating board sega gradually shifted the scope of their seal of quality to focus less on content and more on compatibility the seal was phased out after the discontinuation of the dreamcast in 2001 see also list of sega video game consoles
