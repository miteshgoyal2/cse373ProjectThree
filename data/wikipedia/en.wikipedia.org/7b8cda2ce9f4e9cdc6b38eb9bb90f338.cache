designedit melanogenesis inhibitors have been discovered and developed through several methods including screening of synthetic chemical libraries high throughput screening is occasionally used screening of plant extracts2 computational in silico search34 found as a side effect of previously known drugs5678 and exploration of structural analogues of previously known tyrosinase inhibitors910 based on knowledge in varying degrees of their structureactivity relationship thus the development and discovery of melanogenesis inhibitors illustrates many of the methods used in drug design some of the most potent competitive reversible tyrosinase inhibitors are synthetic compounds with a potency hundreds of times that of kojic acid mechanisms of actionedit see also melanocyte melanin enzyme inhibitor skin color and hair color for a review of mechanism of action of skin whitening agents see chang 201211 or ebanks wickett boissy 200912 melanin is the main substance responsible for the color of the skin melanin is class of dark polymers generated by the body through the process of melanogenesis among the melanin pigmenting the skin and hair 2 types can be distinguished based on its chemical composition and biological route of synthesis the blackbrown eumelanin and the redyellow pheomelanin the variation of skin color among individuals is mostly because of variation of the content of melanin in the skin skin with little or no melanin is almost white other factors influence skin color in a lesser degree including the amount of blood in blood vessels because of the color of blood skin thickness and content of carotenoids in skin1314 melanin in synthesized in melanosomes which are organelles produced in melanocytes melanocytes are cells dedicated to this function that are present in the skin hair follicles and other structures of the body the synthesis of melanin also called melanogenesis and melanization involves a chain of enzymecatalyzed chemical reactions and nonenzymecatalyzed reactionsnotes 2 the main precursor to melanin is ltyrosine the first step of melanogenesis is the conversion of ltyrosine to ldopa this is the first and ratelimiting step and is catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase tyr161163 other enzymes involved in the synthesis include tyrosinaserelated protein 1 trp1 and tyrosinaserelated protein 2 trp2 trp2 is also known as dopachrome tautomerase dct ltyrosine is taken by the melanocytes from the intercellular medium then transported to the melanosomes ltyrosine is also synthesized within the melanocytes from lphenylalanine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase pah161164 melanosomes are transferred to keratinocytes the most abundant cell type in the skin most of the melanin of skin is found in keratinocytes additionally melanocytes interact with keratinocytes through chemical signaling see § preventing the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes skin whitening agents work by reducing the presence of melanin in the skin to accomplish this there are several possible mechanism of actionsnotes 312 inhibition of the activity of tyrosinase the catalytic action of tyrosinase is inhibited slowed or nearly stopped by the skin whitening agent inhibition of the expression or activation of tyrosinase the antimelanogenic agent causes that less tyrosinase is generated or that tyrosinase is not activated to its functional form scavenging of the intermediate products of melanin synthesis preventing the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes directly destroying existing melanin destroying melanocytes inhibition of the activity of tyrosinaseedit further information enzyme inhibitor many tyrosinase inhibitors have been discovered or developed very many inhibitors of tyrosinase are known most are of the reversible typenotes 4 for a review of tyrosinase inhibitors see chang 20092 reviews of patents on tyrosinase inhibitors have been published1718 evaluation of effectivitynotes 5 the potency how little of a substance is needed to achieve an effect of reversible inhibitors is usually given in terms of its ic50 the ic50 is highly dependent on the assay conditions making it incomparable among different assays unless designed to be comparable it is customary practice in studies of tyrosinase inhibitors to assay one or several well known inhibitors as a positive control and point of comparison the relative activity ra of a compound under investigation is its activity divided by the activity of the positive control in turn the activity of a compound is usually defined as 1ic50 the ra is less dependent on assay conditions that the ic50 and is suitable to compare the results of different assays provided the same positive control was used the positive control is commonly kojic acid upregulation of tyrosinase caused by tyrosinase inhibitors several skin whitening agents including some which are tyrosinase inhibitors have been found to cause an increase in the expression of tyrosinase which by itself would increase melanin synthesis1911 irreversible inhibitors of tyrosinase include nnonyl transcaffeate20 αna8siw11coo40 a polyoxometalate21 a structural analog of aloe emodin22 structural analogues of barbituric acid232425 structural analogues of chalcone26 sodium hydrogen sulfite27 structural analogues of coumarin28 structural analogues of the following 2 compounds

trp1 and trp2 mart1 pmel17 and many other important proteins involved in the function of melanocytesnotes 6 downregulation of mitf decreases melanogenesisnotes 6 and is a mechanism of action of some skin whitening agents1139 as an heuristic rule agents acting through downregulation of mitf are more likely to have side effects that selective tyrosinase inhibitorsnotes 7 various signaling pathways and genetic mutations mutations influence the expression of mitfnotes 84243 inhibitors of melanogenesis whose mechanism of action includes reducing the genetic expression of melanogenic enzymes include caffeoylserotonin44 ap73645 pomegranate extract46 and betulinic acid extracted from vitis amurensis root47 the mc1r receptor and campedit the melanocortin 1 receptor mc1r is a transmembrane

have been designed examples include the peptides afamelanotide and melanotan ii48 mutations of the mc1r gene correlate and in some individuals are at least partially responsible for red hair white skin and an increased risk for skin cancernotes 114853495455565758161175 serotonin signalingedit melanocytes express serotonin receptors and are capable of producing serotonin pharmacological interference with the serotonin system of melanocytes can result in either increased or decreased melanin synthesis serotonin itself is a weak inhibitor of tyrosinase59 with 011 times the potency of kojic acidnotes 12 nonetheless serotonin increases synthesis of melanin when its overall effect on melanocytes as opposed to isolated tyrosinase is evaluated60 activation of 5ht2b receptors with bw723c86 inhibits melanogenesis61 while activation of 5ht2a receptors with the amphetamine structural analog doi promotes melanogenesis62 the serotonin reuptake inhibitor sri 6nitroquipazine inhibits melanogenesis invitro63 preventing the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytesedit see also human skin § structure and epidermis for an overview of the interaction between keratinocytes and melanocytes see yamaguchi hearing 200940 keratinocytes in the skin within the skin melanocytes are present in the basal layer of the epidermis from these melanocytes originate dendrites that reach keratinocytesnotes 13 keratinocytes are the most abundant cell type in the epidermisnotes 14 in the skin there are approximately 36 keratinocytes per melanocytenotes 13 keratinocytes are continuously generated in the basal layer of the epidermis and displace older keratinocytes of the skin towards the surface melanosome transfer melanosomes along with the melanin they contain is transferred from melanocytes to keratinocytes when keratinocytes are low in the epidermisnotes 15 keratinocytes carry the melanosomes with them as they move towards the surface keratinocytes contribute to skin pigmentation holding the melanin originated in melanocytes and induce melanogenesis through chemical signals directed at melanocytesnotes 8 the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes is a necessary condition for the visible pigmentation of the skin64 blocking this transfer is a mechanism of action of some skin whitening agents3912 skin whitening agents that block melanocyte transfer include niacinamide heparin65 madecassoside66 soybean67 and saccharomyces cerevisiae a species of yeast68 the proteaseactivated receptor 2 par2 is a transmembrane and gprotein coupled receptor expressed in keratinocytes and involved in melanocyte transfernotes 16notes 17 antagonists of par2 inhibit the transfer of melanosomes and have a skin whitening affects while agonists of par2 have the opposite effect as expectednotes 17 the common endogenous agonists of par2 are serine proteases which irreversibly activate par2 by cleaving a part of the extracellular terminal of this receptor thereby exposing a part of it that subsequently works as a ligand tethered to the reset of the receptor at the molecular scale some synthetic agonists of par2 are short peptides that imitate the aforesaid tethered ligand but do not cleave the extracellular terminal directly destroying existing melaninedit several species of fungi produce enzymes that reduce pigmentation by degrading melanin73 these enzymes often require the presence of hydrogen peroxide and sometimes the presence of mg2 ions to work73 they have been proposed as a safer alternative to hydrogen peroxide for cosmetic hair depigmentation73 the enzyme lignin peroxidase produced by the fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium has been studied as an ingredient suitable for skinwhitening a doubleblind placebocontrolled splitface randomized study found this enzyme to be effective and superior to hydroquinone in skin whitening74 in a noncontrolled study this enzyme was applied to volunteers with facial melasma during 8 weeks the treatment was found effective in reducing pigmentation in both skin affected by melasma and skin unaffected by melasma75 destroying melanocytesedit some compounds are known to destroy melanocytes this mechanism of action is often used to remove the remaining pigmentation in cases of vitiligo7677 nonpharmacological treatmentsedit most skinlightening treatments which can reduce or block some amount of melanin production are aimed at inhibiting tyrosinase many treatments use a combination of topical lotions or gels containing melanininhibiting ingredients along with a sunscreen and a prescription retinoid depending on how the skin responds to these treatments exfoliants ‒either in the form of topical cosmetic or chemical peels‒ and lasers may be used new development using led systems are also showing good results7879808182 whitening agentsedit premelanin synthesisedit tretinoinedit research has shown that the use of tretinoin also known as alltrans retinoic acid can only be somewhat effective in treating skin discolorations79838485 users of tretinoin have to avoid sunlight as the skin can tan using tretinoin always makes the skin more sensitive to uva and uvb rays during melanin synthesisedit hydroquinoneedit main article hydroquinone in medical literature hydroquinone is considered the primary topical ingredient for inhibiting melanin production86878889 its components have potent antioxidant abilities90 topical hydroquinone comes in 2 available in cosmetics to 4 or more concentrations available from a physician or by prescription alone or in combination with tretinoin 005 to 01 research has shown hydroquinone and tretinoin to prevent sun or hormoneinduced melasma79 hydroquinone is a strong inhibitor of melanin production meaning that it prevents dark skin from making the substance responsible for skin color91 hydroquinone does not bleach the skin but lightens it and can only disrupt the synthesis and production of melanin hyperpigmentation it has been banned in some european countries eg france because of fears of a cancer risk however other european countries eg spain have both prescription and nonprescription formulations92 some concerns about hydroquinones safety on skin have been expressed but the research when it comes to topical application indicates negative reactions are minor or a result of using extremely high concentrations or from other skinlightening agents such as glucocorticoids or mercury iodine any perceived risk is most likely applicable for african women93 hydroquinone has been shown to cause leukemia in mice and other animals the european union banned it from cosmetics in 2001 but it shows up in bootleg creams in the developing world it is sold in the united states as an overthecounter drug but with a concentration of hydroquinone not exceeding 2 percent because of hydroquinones action on the skin it can be an irritant particularly in higher concentrations of 4 or greater and predictably when combined with tretinoin some medications have been created that combine 4 hydroquinone with tretinoin and a form of cortisone the cortisone is included as an antiinflammatory the negative side effect of repeated application of cortisone is countered by the positive effect of the tretinoin so that it does not cause thinning of skin and damage to collagen94 arbutinedit some of alternative lighteners are derived from natural sources of hydroquinone these include mitracarpus scaber extract uva ursi bearberry extract morus bombycis mulberry morus alba white mulberry and broussonetia papyrifera paper mulberry all of these contain arbutin technically known as hydroquinoneβdglucoside which can inhibit melanin production pure forms of arbutin are considered more potent for affecting skin lightening arbutin is derived from the leaves of bearberry cranberry mulberry or blueberry shrubs and also is present in most types of pears it can have melanininhibiting properties95 arbutin and other plant extracts are considered safe alternatives to commonly used depigmenting agents to make the skin fairer medical studies have shown the efficiency of arbutin for skin lightening96not in citation given there are patents controlling its use for skin lightening arbutin actually exists in two isomers alpha and beta the alpha isomer offers higher stability over the beta isomer and is the preferred form for skin lightening indications kojic acidedit kojic acid is a byproduct in the fermentation process of malting rice for use in the manufacturing of sake the japanese rice wine some research shows kojic acid to be effective for inhibiting melanin production97 however kojic acid is an unstable ingredient in cosmetic formulations upon exposure to air or sunlight it can turn brown and lose its efficacy many cosmetic companies use kojic dipalmitate as an alternative because it is more stable in formulations however there is no research showing kojic dipalmitate to be as effective as kojic acid although it is a good antioxidant further some controversial research has suggested that kojic acid may have carcinogenic properties in large doses98 other further studies show that kojic acid is not carcinogenic but can cause allergic contact dermatitis99 and skin irritation100 azelaic acidedit azelaic acid is a component of grains such as wheat rye and barley it is applied topically in a cream formulation at a 1020 concentration azelaic acid is used to treat acne but there also is research showing it to be effective for skin discolorations101 other research also indicates azelaic acid may be an option for inhibiting melanin production78 vitamin cedit vitamin c and its various forms ascorbic acid magnesium ascorbyl phosphate etc are considered an effective antioxidant for the skin and help to lighten skinmedical citation needed one study102 found it raises glutathione levels in the body another study found that brownish guinea pigs given vitamin c vitamin e and lcysteine simultaneously led to lighter skin103 glutathioneedit glutathione is a tripeptide molecule found in mammalian bodies it is an antioxidant that plays an important role in preventing oxidative damage to the skin in addition to its many recognized biological functions glutathione has also been associated with skin lightening ability while skin whitening reduces melanin which serves as the natural protection from uv exposure glutathiones antioxidant property also protects the skin from uv radiation a doubleblind placebocontrolled study found glutathione to be effective as a skin whitening agent and in reducing dark spots the dose regime was 500 mg per day split in 2 equal doses per day for 2 – 4 weeks104 in contrast a study that examined the effect of glutathione and related compounds invitro found that glutathione monoethyl ester but not glutathione had a depigmenting effect105 a review of the use of glutathione for skin whitening was published in 2016106 glutathione is an ingredient in some cosmetics preparations glutathione for skin whitening is available in cream soap lotion nasal spray and injectable form glutathione that is applied on the skin in the form of lotion is not efficiently absorbed by the skin cells as the thiol group undergoes rapid formation of disulfide when taken orally glutathione is hydrolyzed by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract resulting in reduced bioavailability the level of glutathione increased in smalls amounts temporarily when large oral doses were administered107 as a result the effectiveness of externally administered glutathione is slowed down by its inability to cross cell membranes efficiently and its rapid degradation by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract on the contrary intravenous glutathione delivers very high doses directly into the systemic circulation and is the preferred mode of administering glutathione however this method of administrating the antioxidant might flood the cells with glutathione that may cause reductive stress this might expose people to potential health risks associated with longterm use of high dose of glutathione of all the glutathione products glutathione tablet remains the most effective type glutathione can be combined with many other agents like vitamin c to increase its absorption nacetyl cysteine to boost its level and other antioxidants like vitamin e some oral intake of glutathione could have dangerous effect when combined with other skin whitening agents such as hydroquinone which is a carcinogenic element and monobenzone which causes irreversible depigmentation postmelanin synthesisedit alpha hydroxy acidsedit alpha hydroxy acids ahas – primarily in the form of lactic acid and glycolic acid – are the most researched forms of ahas because they have a molecular size that allows effective penetration into the top layers of skin it is generally assumed that in and of themselves ahas in concentrations of 4 to 15 are not effective for inhibiting melanin production and will not lighten skin discolorations in that manner it is believed that their benefit is in helping cell turnover rates and removing unhealthy or abnormal layers of superficial skin cells exfoliation where hyperpigmented cells can accumulate however other research has shown that lactic and glycolic acids can indeed inhibit melanin production separate from their actions as an exfoliant on skin108 alpha hydroxy acid peels using 50 concentrations or greater may remove skin discolorations only a qualified physician should perform these types of facial peels109 niacinamideedit niacinamide is claimed to be a much safer alternative when applied topically for skin or genitalia whitening according to research by procter gamble a cosmetics company niacinamide has no adverse sideeffects it also promotes acne reduction increases skin moisture and reduces fine wrinkles110 otherungroupededit depigmenting agentsedit most commonly depigmentation of the skin is linked to people born with vitiligo which produces differing areas of light and dark skin these individuals if they so decided to use a lightening process to even out their skin tone could apply a topical cream containing the organic compound monobenzone to lessen the remaining pigment monobenzone may cause destruction of melanocytes and permanent depigmentation an alternate method of lightening is to use the chemical mequinol over an extended period of time increasingly people who are not afflicted with the vitiligo experiment with lower concentrations of monobenzone creams in the hope of lightening their skin tone evenly however monobenzone is not recommended for skin conditions other than vitiligo mercuryedit many skin whiteners contain toxic mercury such as mercuryii chloride or ammoniated mercury as the active ingredient however mercury has been banned in most countries for use in skin whitening 1976 in europe 1990 in the usa because it accumulates on skin and it can have the opposite results in the long term as late as january 2016 the fda published a warning not to use a particular brand of whitener – viansilks crema piel de seda silky skin cream sold in the united states due to its mercury content111 tranexamic acidedit tranexamic acid is sometimes used in skin whitening as a topical agent injected into a lesion and taken by mouth both alone and as an adjunct to laser therapy as of 2017 its safety seemed reasonable but its efficacy for this purpose was uncertain because there had been no large scale randomized controlled studies nor long term followup studies112113 otheredit other options with some amount of research regarding their potential skin lightening abilities are licorice extract specifically glabridin there is also a small amount of research showing oral supplements of pomegranate extract ellagic acid vitamin e and ferulic acid can inhibit melanin production114 laser treatmentsedit both ablative and nonablative lasers can have a profound effect on melasmacitation needed however the results are not always consistent and problems have been reported such as hypo or hyperpigmentation laser treatments of this kind are more likely to result in problems for those with darker skin tones115 cryosurgeryedit another alternative to laser treatment is cryosurgery using liquid nitrogen controlled destruction of skin cells causes the skin to naturally regenerate itself excess melanin comes to the surface and peels off in a few days this is particularly useful in sensitive areas like the genitals where laser treatment could leave a scar efficacy of the treatment depends on the depth of the pigment freckles in any part of the body can be treated the same waycitation needed adverse effectsedit there is evidence to suggest that some types of skinwhitening products use active ingredients such as mercurous chloride and hydroquinone which can be harmful hydroquinone is not available without a prescription in europe it is only available when prescribed by a medical doctor eg a general practitioner this is also the case in many other countries where hydroquinone can only be prescribed by a doctor for certain skin conditions a test of common skin lightening creams available in nigeria showed that they caused mutations in bacteria and were possibly carcinogenic116 a study that examined skin whitening creams in mexico found a high concentration of mercury in several of them117 society and cultureedit in india the sales of skin lightening creams in 2012 totaled around 258 tons and in 2013 sales were about 300 million118119 as of 2013 the global market for skin lighteners was projected to reach us198 billion by 2018 based on sales growth primarily in asia africa and the middle east120 see alsoedit

quotations text between square brackets are additional notes not present in the source instead of whitening the terms lightening brightening depigmentation and bleaching are also used the chemical pathways of the synthesis of melanin has been described by many papers however it is often oversimplified the following references are suggested kondo hearing 201115 chang 20092 and slominski et al 200416 in addition to inhibition of tyrosinase catalytic activity other approaches to treat hyperpigmentation include inhibition of tyrosinase mrna transcription aberration of tyrosinase glycosylation and maturation acceleration of tyrosinase degradation interference with melanosome maturation and transfer inhibition of inflammationinduced melanogenic response and acceleration of skin turnover accordingly a huge number of depigmenting agents or whitening agents developed by those alternative approaches have been successfully identified and deeply reviewed in many articles references omitted2 in contrast to the huge number of reversible inhibitors has been identified rarely irreversible inhibitors of tyrosinase were found until now these irreversible inhibitors which are also called specific inactivators can form irreversibly covalent bond with the target enzyme and then inactivate it2 inhibitor strength is usually expressed as the inhibitory ic50 value which is the concentration of an inhibitor needed to inhibit half of the enzyme activity in the tested condition however for the tyrosinase inhibitors in the literature the ic50 values are incomparable due to the varied assay conditions including different substrate concentrations varied incubation time and different batches of commercial tyrosinase fortunately in most studies conducted to discover new tyrosinase inhibitors a wellknown tyrosinase inhibitor such as kojic acid is often used as a positive standard at the same time hence in order to compare the inhibitors described in different literature in a more practical manner a relative inhibitory activity ra which is calculated by dividing the ic50 value of kojic acid with that of a newly found inhibitor in the same report is used to express and compare the inhibitory strength of an inhibitor with others in this review2 a b the transcriptional level is the first stage by which the expression of tyrosinase and related melanogenic enzymes may be modulated influential in this process the microphthalmiaassociated transcription factor mitf is a basic helixloophelix leucine zipper transcription factor that regulates melanocyte cellular differentiation as well as the transcription of melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase tyrp1 and tyrp2 and melanosome structural proteins mart1 and pmel17 references omitted12 in addition to being involved in the survival proliferation and differentiation of melanocytes mitf is the master regulator of melanogenesis in melanocytes via binding to the m box of a promoter region and regulating the gene expression of tyrosinase trp1 and trp2 references omitted the upregulation of mitf activity activates the expression of the melanogenesisrelated enzymes thus stimulating melanogenesis in contrast the downregulation of mitf activity depresses the expression of the related enzymes thereby inhibiting melanogenesis11 because tyrosinase is produced only by melanocytic cells tyrosinase inhibitors have highly specific targeting to melanogenesis in the cells without other side effects in contrast those melanogenesis inhibitors targeting to the tyrosinase gene expressions or protein degradations are rarely used as clinical hypopigmenting agents due to their nonspecific and global effects via intracellular signaling pathways11 a b c many papers have described the signaling pathways affecting melanogenesis and other functions of melanocytes the following reviews are suggested reading all of which are available online at no cost for a description with emphasis on the relation with skin whitening see chang 201211 or smit vicanova pavel 200939 for a description with emphasis on physiology see yamaguchi hearing 200940 or kondo 201115 for a description of intramelanocyte signaling pathways see imokawa ishida 201441 an extensive and detailed review was written by slominski et al 200416 a b alpha melanocytestimulating hormone αmsh a peptide derived from proopiomelanocortin pomc regulates melanogenesis via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate campdependent pathway references omitted when binding to its receptor melanocortin receptor 1 mc1r on the membrane of melanocytes the hormone activates adenylate cyclase ac to produce camp as an intracellular second message via a gproteincoupled receptor gpcrtype activation camp activates protein kinase a pka which then activates the gene expression of mitf via phosphorylation of the camp response elementbinding protein creb finally mitf efficiently activates the melanogenesisrelated enzymes and stimulates melanogenesis once αmsh binds to mc1r up to a 100fold increase in melanogenesis attends in addition to αmsh other pomcderived peptides such as βmsh and adrenocorticotropic hormone acth also stimulate melanogenesis via the same pathway11 αmsh binding to melanocortin 1 receptor mc1r on melanocytes in the basal epidermis generates the second messenger camp via interactions between mc1r and adenylyl cyclase and leads to activation of protein kinase a and the camp responsive binding element creb and microphthalmia mitf transcription factors creb and mitf directly enhance melanin production by raising levels of tyrosinase and other melanin biosynthetic enzymes thus mshmc1r signaling leads to enhanced pigment synthesis by melanocytes and accumulation of melanin by epidermal keratinocytes etcetera the mc1r is found on the surface of melanocytes where it binds to αmelanocyte stimulating hormone msh and transmits differentiation signals into the cell through activation of adenylyl cyclase and generation of camp references omitted camp signaling leads to activation of the protein kinase a pka cascade which in turn leads to increased levels andor activity of many melanogenic enzymes to enhance production and export of melanin by melanocytes references and figure omitted52 the assertion that asip is the only endogenous antagonist is found in yamaguchi hearing 200940 lossofsignaling mc1r polymorphisms are commonly found among fairskinned sunsensitive and skin cancerprone populations eg northern europeans the most prevalent mc1r mutations d84e r151c r160w and d294h are commonly referred to as “rhc”

ic50serotonin550 µmoll ic50kojic acid68 µmoll a b in the skin melanocytes are situated on the basal layer which separates dermis and epidermis one melanocyte is surrounded by approximately 36 keratinocytes together they form the socalled epidermal melanin unit the melanin produced and stored inside the melanocyte in the melanosomal compartment is transported via dendrites to the overlaying keratinocytes39 each melanocyte resides in the basal epithelial layer and by virtue of its dendrites interacts with approximately 36 keratinocytes to transfer melanosomes and protect the skin from photoinduced carcinogenesis furthermore the amount and type of melanin produced and transferred to the keratinocytes with subsequent incorporation aggregation and degradation influences skin complexion coloration reference omitted12 wu hammer 2014 describe the number of keratinocytes per melanocyte as above 4064 keratinocytes are the most abundant cells in the epidermis and are characterized by their expression of cytokeratins and formation of desmosomes and tight junctions with each other to form an effective physicochemical barrier52 research about the mechanism of melanosome transfer has been reviewed by wu hammer 201464 proteaseactivated receptor par2 is a member of a novel gproteincoupled seventransmembrane receptor family in epidermis par2 is expressed in keratinocytes references omitted but not melanocytes references omitted a central role for par2 in keratinocyte uptake of melanosomes has been established references omitted par2 has been linked to the upregulation of cox2 and the release of arachidonic acid and secretion of pge2 and pgf2α references omitted several reports have suggested that par2 mediates cutaneous pigmentation through increased uptake of melanosomes by keratinocytes and by the release of pge2 and pgf2α that stimulate melanocyte dendricity references omitted66 a b references about par2 and its role in skin
