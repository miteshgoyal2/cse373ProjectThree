cluster of steepsided peaks surrounded by heavily forested foothills and incised by deep valleys they are surrounded by water on three sides separated from the pacific by the 20 to 35 km 12 to 22 mi wide coastal plain1 the general form of the range is more or less circular or somewhat horseshoeshaped and the drainage pattern is radial2 rivers radiate outwards to all sides clockwise from windward

with five wilderness areas5 and on the southwest side by the clearwater state forest with one natural area preserve washington department of natural resources and the quinault indian reservation6 state parks and wildlife areas occur in the lower elevations climateedit precipitation varies greatly throughout the range from the wet western slopes to the arid eastern ridges mount olympus nearly 8000 feet 2400 m tall is a mere 35 miles 56 km from the pacific ocean one of the steepest reliefs globally and accounting for the high precipitation of the area as much as 240 inches 6100 mm of snow and rain on mount olympus7 140 to 170 inches 3600 to 4300 mm of rain falls on the hoh rainforest annually8 receiving the most precipitation of anywhere in the continental united states9 areas to the northeast of the mountains are located in a rain shadow and receive as little as 16 in 410 mm of precipitation10 annual precipitation increases to about 30 in 760 mm on the edges of the rain shadow around port townsend the san juan islands and everett9 80 of precipitation falls during the winter on the coastal plain the winter temperature stays between −2 to 7 °c 28 to 45 °f during the summer it warms up to stay between 10 and 24 °c 50 and 75 °f11 as a consequence of the high precipitation is the large number of snowfields and glaciers reaching down to 1500 m 5000 ft above sea level there are about 184 glaciers crowning the olympics peaks12 the most prominent glaciers are those on mount olympus covering approximately 10 square miles 26 km2 beyond the olympic complex are the glaciers of mount carrie the bailey range mount christie and mount anderson13 geologyedit the olympics are made up of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust they are primarily eocene sandstones turbidites and basaltic oceanic crust14 unlike the cascades the olympic mountains are not volcanic and contain no granite7 millions of years ago vents and fissures opened under the pacific ocean and lava flowed forth creating huge underwater mountains and ranges called seamounts the farallon tectonic plate that formed a part of the pacific ocean floor separate from the pacific plate inched eastward toward north america about 35 million years ago and most of the sea floor subducted beneath the continental land mass of the north america plate some of the sea floor however was scraped off and jammed against the mainland creating the dome that was the forerunner of todays olympics in this particular case the future olympics were being jammed into a corner created by the vancouver island and north cascades microcontinents attached to the western edge of the north america plate this is thought to be the origin of the curved shape of the olympic basaltic horseshoe an arc of basalt running east along the strait of juan de fuca south along hood canal and then west to lake quinault2 thrustfaulting northeast into the vancouver islandnorth cascades corner pushes olympic rock upward and southwestward resulting in strata that appear to be standing on edge and that intermix with strata of different mineral composition7 all this occurred under water the olympics began to rise above the sea only 10–20 million years ago7 the olympics were shaped in the pleistocene era by both alpine and continental glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times the valleys of the hoh queets and quinault rivers are typical ushaped valleys carved by advancing alpine glaciers piles of talus and rockfall were created by retreating alpine glaciers in the high mountains the major rivers have their headwaters in alpine glacially carved cirques during the orting followed by the stuck the salmon springs and the fraser glaciations the vast continental cordilleran ice sheet descended from alaska south through british columbia to the olympics7 the ice split into the juan de fuca and puget ice lobes as they encountered the resistant olympic mountains carving out the current waterways and advanced as far south as present day olympia ice flowed up the river valleys as far as 3800 feet 1200 m carrying granitic glacial erratics with it7 ecologyedit the hoh rainforest supports many trees and epiphytes the mountains support a variety of different ecosystems varying by elevation and relative eastwest location which influences the local climate primarily precipitation floraedit olympic forests are coniferous forests unique among mesic temperate forests in their almost complete dominance by conifers rather than by hardwoods15 the hardwoodconifer timber volume ratio is 11000 in the maritime pacific northwest another unique feature of olympic forests is the size and longevity of the dominant tree species every coniferous genus represented here is represented by its largest and longestlived species and some of its second and third ranked species as well15 biomass accumulations are among the highest in the temperate forest zones dominance of conifers is thought to be a result of the amount and timing of precipitation15 the dry summers limit the growth of deciduous trees such as most hardwoods evergreens such as most conifers are able to take advantage of the winter precipitation by continuing to photosynthesize through fall winter and early spring when deciduous trees are not able to photosynthesize no deciduous conifers occur in the olympics larch trees occur in the muchdrier eastern cascades but not in the olympics or western cascades there is only one species of evergreen hardwood the madrone7 the great size and age of conifers here is thought to be a result of the relative lack of frequent windstorms like tropical cyclones15 along the western flanks of the mountains the increased orographic precipitation supports temperate rain forests in the quinault queets hoh and bogachiel river valleys at low elevations16 protection by olympic national park has allowed these rain forests to retain old growth trees which supports a varied ecosystem17 the olympic rain forests are composed primarily of sitka spruce and western hemlock as are the surrounding lowland sitka spruce forests but are distinct in having a relative abundance of groves of bigleaf maple and vine maple which support large epiphytic communities of mosses lichens ferns and clubmosses an abundance of nurse logs on the forest floor a relatively open forest canopy and sparse shrub layer and a dense moss layer on the forest floor the rain forests are the wintering grounds for herds of roosevelt elk and it is thought that browsing by the elk is responsible for the open shrub layer and the dominance of sitka spruce over western hemlock15 the rain forests are just one type of forest found in the olympic mountains franklin and dyrness 15 set out 5 forest zones sitka spruce western hemlock silver fir mountain hemlock and subalpine parkland other authors include a sixth douglasfir zone18 different plant associations are typical of one or more forest zones for instance the rain forest plant association described above is a member of the sitka spruce forest zone the sitka spruce zone is a lowland zone dominated by sitka spruce and western hemlock precipitation is high winters are mild elevations are low this forest zone is typically found at very low elevations on the western coastal plain and not in mountainous areas although it can be found as high as 1900 feet 580 m1519 the lower elevations of the olympic mountains from roughly 480 feet 150 m up to 1800 feet 550 m – 3700 feet 1100 m feature the western hemlock zone socalled because in most of the zone the climax tree species would be western hemlock even though much of the area is dominated by douglasfir15 the reason for this is that douglasfir is an early seral species and reproduces primarily after disturbances such as fire logging landslides and windstorms western hemlock does not reproduce well on disturbed exposed soil but germinates under the canopy of douglasfir eventually overtaking the forest by shading out the douglasfir which cannot reproduce in shade in this zone despite the high annual precipitation drought stress in summer is sufficiently severe to limit growth of many species such as sitka spruce hardwoods such as bigleaf maple willows and red alder are limited to disturbed sites and riparian areas redcedar grows in the wettest sites15 a very small area of the northeastern rain shadow contains the limited douglasfir zone where it is too dry for western hemlock18 queets river douglasfir moving up in elevation and moisture availability is the silver fir zone up to about 3900 feet 1200 m this zone gets more precipitation and more of it as snow than the lower warmer drier western hemlock zone15 the cold and the snowpack combine to limit growth of lowerelevation plants on the other hand silver fir is less drought tolerant and less fire tolerant than either douglasfir or western hemlock slide alder alnus viridis sinuata grows in snowcreep areas and avalanche chutes along with yellowcedar meadows of thimbleberry also grow in this zone often intergrading between the slide alder chutes and the silver fir forest15 the next higher forest zone is the mountain hemlock zone the highest forest zone in the olympic mountains15 in this zone most precipitation falls as snow and the snowfree growing season is very short in the drier rainshadow side of the mountains mountain hemlock is largely replaced by subalpine fir at the higher elevations of the mountain hemlocksubalpine fir zone tree cover is reduced to isolated stands of trees called tree islands surrounded by subalpine meadows in the subalpine parkland zone variations in substrate topography moisture and snowpack depth and duration determine the vegetation community tree islands form on convex topography which tends to gather less snow and shed it sooner than surrounding level or concave topography15 in the west the subalpine zone is dominated by mountain hemlock17 it occurs along with subalpine fir from 1100 to 1650 metres 3610 to 5410 ft in the bailey range however the range of this forest type is not extensive and does not extend much west of mount olympus nor is it common in the east chamaecyparis nootkatensisyellowcedar is sometimes found in relation to these plants20 in the east and other drier areas the subalpine zone is dominated by subalpine fir17 it can occur with other trees including mountain hemlock silver fir and yellowcedar but what characterizes these zones is the dominance of subalpine fir these forests occur on the eastern ridges from 1300 to 1800 metres 4300 to 5900 ft20 in the olympics the treeline is between 5000 feet 1500 m and 6000 feet 1800 m21 but can be as low as under 4000 feet 1200 m in some places2 treeline is a function of both elevation and precipitation particularly the amount of snow that falls each winter7 the growing season for trees is relatively short in the higher elevations of the windward olympics compared to similar elevations in other mountain ranges due to the large accumulations of snow that take a long time to melt each year hurricane ridge supports dry subalpine and alpine conditions in the olympics subalpine meadows in the olympic mountains are of 5 types heath shrub meadows are dominated by ericaceous huckleberries and heathers lush herbaceous meadows are typified by sitka valerian and showy sedge drier areas or those with longer snow cover grow dwarf sedge carex nigricans or grass festuca viridis meadows phlox diffusa typifies the low herbaceous meadows of pumice talus and scree slopes and other rocky areas15 american sawwort is common in both mountain meadows and lower subalpine parklands in the olympics15 above timberline is the alpine zone not a forest zone since no trees can grow this high the alpine zone in the olympics is much more limited in size than in other temperate mountain ranges from 1800 metres 5900 ft to 2250 metres 7380 ft15 the high precipitation of the olympics creates permanent snow and ice at lower elevations than is typical for other mountain ranges cutting off the alpine vegetation zone most of the alpine vegetation is on the rain shadow side in the northeastern olympics where there is less permanent snow and ice alpine vegetation is low herbaceous typified by phlox diffusa and species of carex many of the olympic mountain’s endemic plants occur here such as piper’s bellflower campanula piperi and olympic violet viola flettii7 endemic plantsedit pipers bellflower an olympic mountain endemic near mt

mountains are the fisher martes pennanti and the gray wolf canis lupus the fisher was declared extirpated from washington state when no fishers were detected during statewide carnivore surveys in the 1990s and 2000s a reintroduction project was initiated in 2007 in partnership with olympic national park22 the gray wolf was extirpated from washington state in the early 20th century the last wolf documented in the olympics was trapped in 19207 in the early 21st century wolves are naturally migrating back into eastern and northcentral washington state but there is no evidence of wolf migration into the olympics and no plan to translocate wolves to the olympics23 the gray wolf is listed as endangered by the us fish and wildlife service 23 and the fisher is listed as state endangered by the washington fish and wildlife commission22 previous to the extirpation of the gray wolf coyotes canis latrans occurred in the lowlands of the olympic peninsula but not in the mountains7 with the absence of wolves coyotes have been moving up into the higher elevations of the mountains and may be responsible for population declines in the olympic marmot the mountain goat oreamnos americanus is not native to the olympic mountains but was introduced for hunting in the 1920s24 by a coalition of the forest service the clallam county game warden and the state game commission25 mountain goats in the olympics have been associated with damage to alpine vegetation and soil erosion7 and have shown aggression towards people in 1999 a mountain goat gored a hiker at the summit of mt ellinor in olympic national forest and in 2010 a mountain goat fatally gored a hiker on the klahane ridge trail in olympic national park26 in 2012 the trail to mt ellinor was closed in summer due to aggressive goats reopening in the fall27 roosevelt elk cervus canadensis roosevelti range along the pacific coast from the russian river to vancouver island7 olympic and vancouver island elk are some of the last pure roosevelt elk herds left those in the cascades have mixed with rocky mountain elk olympic national park has the largest population of roosevelt elk in the world some herds spend winter in lowland valleys summer in high country in subalpine meadows other herds live yearround in lowland forests and meadows elk prefer more humid areas the sitka spruce wet western hemlock and mountain hemlock zones18 elk browsing is believed to be responsible for the open parklike structure of the olympic rainforests the elk graze on hemlock and shrubs leaving the sitka spruce to grow elk browsing also increases diversity of grasses and forbs elk exclosure experiments in rainforest valleys show more species of vegetation growing outside the exclosures where elk browse than inside while there are more brush and saplings inside exclosures there are more grasses and forbs outside7 elk browsing improves forage for other herbivores like deer voles and snowshoe hares elk prefer old growth forest and young alder groves over the large evenaged plantations common on commercial timber land although they will use small recent clearcuts where they mimic natural forest openings7 both the press and o’neil expeditions were impressed by the quantity and tameness of the elk2829 both expedition leaders prohibited shooting the elk and deer except when the expedition was in need of meat the olympic national monument was formed to protect the elk after the herds were reduced to less than 2000 animals the population rebounded and in 1937 a hunting season for elk was opened in the hoh river valley 200025 to 40007 hunters came several times as many as expected25 one hunter was accidentally shot and died a second hunter drowned in the hoh river a pack horse was shot the hoh river flooded stranding hunters and washing away their camps forest service and state game personnel were overwhelmed with rescue efforts lost stranded or injured hunters and dispute resolution over 800 elk were killed some left lying in the forest7 proponents of a national park used the 1937 elk hunt as an argument in favor of permanent protection for olympic’s elk herds not all the elk herds are protected inside the national park some migrate in and out of the park and others live entirely outside the park these are subject to regulated hunting when not in the national park blacktail deer odocoileus hemionus columbianus prefer drier areas than elk such as the dry western hemlock douglasfir and subalpine fir zones18 similar to the elk blacktail deer winter in lowlands or along southfacing ridges and summer in the high country meadows2 american black bear ursus americanus are numerous in the olympics2 olympic bears eat salmon rodents huckleberries tree bark insects and deer or elk carcasses cougar felis concolor is the largest carnivore in the olympics their main prey are deer and elk but they also hunt porcupines and insects they are rarely seen in the olympics but are thought to be widespread and relatively common27 mountain beaver aplodontia rufa is a large primitive rodent endemic to the pacific northwest they are common in the olympics preferring wet scrubby thickets and second growth timber2 banana slug ariolimax columbianus is another pacific northwest endemic slugs are abundant in the olympic forests outweighing mammals and birds combined19 they thrive in the cool damp shade of the forests the banana slug is the largest and most conspicuous of olympic slugs northern spotted owl strix occidentalis caurina is an oldgrowth dependent species and is listed as threatened under the endangered species act the majority of spotted owls on the olympic peninsula along with the largest preserve of temperate oldgrowth forest live in the national park7 spotted owls prey on flying squirrels and snowshoe hares and are themselves preyed on by great horned owls bubo virginianus the density of the canopy of an oldgrowth forest gives the spotted owls some protection from the larger less agile great horned owls rufous hummingbird selasphorus rufus is the only hummingbird in the olympics they overwinter in mexico and southern california arriving in the olympics in february or march with the flowering of the indian plum oemleria cerasifera harlequin duck histrionicus histrionicus breeds in fastmoving mountain streams in the olympics they spend the rest of the year in coastal waters2 osprey pandion haliaetus and bald eagle haliaeetus leucocephalus fish in olympic rivers nesting in large old trees both are relatively common the bald eagle more so along the coast than in the mountains2 olympic rivers are dominated by pacific salmonids the oncorhynchus2 chinook coho pink rainbow and steelhead and cutthroat all spawn in olympic rivers chum and sockeye also live in coastal olympic peninsula rivers but do not reach into the mountains bull trout salvelinus confluentus and dolly varden trout s malma also live in olympic rivers27 endemic faunaedit there are

primarily in the olympics and other mountainous areas of western washington the tailed frog ascaphus truei of pacific northwest mountain streams and the mountain beaver aplodontia rufa of the coastal pacific northwest7 historyedit prehistoryedit for the original inhabitants of the olympic peninsula the highest peaks of the mountains were the only refuges during the great floods at the beginning of time30 for the elwha klallam people that peak was mount carrie for the skokomish it was a peak west of mt ellinor the thunderbird figure of the hoh tribe lived on mt olympus in a den under blue glacier people in the skokomish quinault and elwha watersheds regularly traveled into the high country to hunt elk gather huckleberries and beargrass and perform spirit quests trails across the mountains allowed members of the various tribes to visit and trade with each other730 the crossolympic expeditions of the 1890s found tree blazes that they took to mark indian trails2829 archeological evidence shows that the olympic mountains were inhabited by paleolithic hunters after the retreat of the cordilleran ice sheet7 stone tools in the deer park area date to 7600 years ago prior to the volcanic eruption of mount mazama similar tools have been found near lake cushman and throughout the olympic subalpine meadows and ridges as well as in coastal areas in addition a fragment of a woven basket found in the olympic subalpine of obstruction point was radiocarbon dated to nearly 3000 years ago730 the mountains were originally called sunado by the duwamish indians31 while the first european to see them the spanish navigator juan pérez named mount olympus santa rosalia in 177432 but the english captain john meares seeing them in 1788 thought he would honor the greek explorer juan de fuca who claimed to have found the fabled northwest passage nearby by naming the mountain after the mythical home of greek gods which is mount olympus in greece various names for the mountains were used based on the name mount olympus including the olympic range the olympian mountains and the olympus range31 alternate proposals never caught on and in 1864 the seattle weekly gazette persuaded the government to make the presentday name official33 although other names continued to be used31 olympic mountains from esquimalt bc 1921 fg goodenough photographer first oneil expedition 1885edit though readily visible from many parts of western washington especially seattle the interior was almost entirely unexplored until 1885 when 2nd lt joseph p oneil of the 14th infantry stationed at fort vancouver led a small expedition into the northern olympics from port angeles29 o’neil led an expedition of 3 enlisted men 2 civilian engineers and 8 mules out of port angeles in july 1885 the expedition cut a mule trail from port angeles up to hurricane ridge and camped near the current site of the national park visitor center from there they explored and built trail to the east and south exploring the upper dungeness and dosewallips river watersheds and to cameron basin near mt anderson o’neil was recalled by the army in august to be transferred to fort leavenworth in kansas and the expedition had to return to fort townsend the obstruction peak road and portions of the hurricane ridge road and the klahane ridge grand pass and lost pass trails in olympic national park originated with the mule trails built by this expedition329 in late 1889 charles a gilman and his son samuel explored the east fork quinault up to its headwaters but chose to return the way they came rather than cross over the mountains29 press expedition 1889–90edit the first crossing of the olympic mountains was done from november 1889 through may 1890 by the press expedition a group of 5 men led by canadian james h christie sponsored by the seattle newspaper press which ascended the elwha river and descended the north fork quinault river the press party included 2 mules which both died in separate incidents and 4 dogs 1 of which was killed by an elk28 the press expedition crossed in winter in order to beat oneils planned expedition for the summer of 1890 initially the expedition built a boat on the elwha to tow their cargo upriver but the icy water and deep snow covering boulders and fallen trees made this mode of transportation very slow – after 2 weeks the men had towed the boat 4 miles 64 km it did however carry cargo where the mules could not christie and his men abandoned the boat and switched to the mules when they reached the head of navigation on the elwha but the mules both died in separate incidents fairly early in the expedition deep snow steep slopes and fallen trees made travel extremely difficult for the mules along with lack of forage28 the expedition carried minimal food expecting to find game28 in the lowlands game and fish were plentiful but the heavy snow that winter drove game out of the mountains and for long stretches in the high mountains the men were reduced to eating ‘flour soup’ unlike o’neil’s military expeditions the press expedition had no resupply line once into the high mountains and the deep snow with no game they went weeks with no meat and little to eat besides flour and beans the men carried all the cargo on their own backs through one of the roughest and most labyrinthine sections of the high mountains through snow 10 to 15 feet 30 to 46 m deep on climbing a peak to get a view of the area christie estimated the snow at the peak to be 25 feet 76 m deep avalanches occurred on a daily basis crossing low divide between the upper elwha and the headwaters of the north fork quinault the men climbed a vertical cliff requiring christie to climb to a ledge and then lower a rope to the men below packs dogs and men were hauled up the cliff by rope once on the quinault side of the divide the men shot and ate a bear the first meat they had had for several weeks of strenuous winter mountain travel28 deep snow prevented proper trail building for much of their route although they did cut a rough trail along the lower reach of the elwha river and blazed trees along their route28 they used elk trails wherever possible and walked in the river when there was no other way through due to steep terrain or dense brush it took the expedition four months of slogging through dense brush and windthrows swamps steep canyons and deep wet slushy snow just to reach the inner mountains once in the high mountains the relief was so precipitous that the men estimated they traveled up and down as much as 6 miles 97 km to cover 2 miles 32 km horizontal miles28 once on the mainstem quinault river the men built a raft but it wrecked on a logjam28 the men saved the dogs and the one pack that contained their maps photographs and records made along the route but lost all their food armaments utensils fishing tackle shelter and the few mineral and plant specimens and animal skins they had collected and the men were split on opposite sides of the river unable to reach each other they continued walking down the river eating salmonberry shoots and spruce bark until a settler and a quinault indian guide canoeing to lake quinault rescued them28 when the o’neil expedition of 1890 reached the mainstem quinault river a few months later they found some of the items the press expedition had lost in the wreck29 the settler and neighboring indians took the expedition across lake quinault and down the lower river to the coast in mid may nearly six months after they left port angeles28 from the mouth of the quinault they traveled to aberdeen and then to seattle their account of their expedition along with photographs and a fullpage map was printed in a special edition of the press on july 16 1890 the elwha river and north fork quinault trails in olympic national park follow the route of the press expedition with a detour through the highest mountains and around the vertical cliff at low divide3 second oneil expedition 1890edit oneil returned to washington in 1887 and started planning another expedition29 the olympic exploring expedition led by o’neil crossed the southern olympics in the summer of 1890 ascending the north fork skokomish river and descending the east fork quinault river building a mule trail the entire distance29 this expedition was larger than the 1885 expedition and would be resupplied by mule train from hoodsport on hood canal allowing time for scientific exploration of the area the expedition consisted of 10 soldiers 1 civilian mule packer 4 civilian scientists from the oregon alpine club 11 mules 1 bell mare to lead the mule train and up to 4 dogs the scientists collected specimens of plants animals and minerals which they shipped back to portland by way of the mule train to hoodsport the majority of the party was assigned to cutting the mule trail while 2 or 3 man exploring parties fanned out and scouts went ahead the scouts and side exploring parties scrambled up slopes on all fours pulling themselves up by grabbing onto vegetation descended similar slopes by sliding deliberately or inadvertently hacked and crawled through dense brush and windthrow waded up rivers and streams when there was no other way through felled trees to bridge ravines and rivers and traversed narrow ridges of crumbling verticallyoriented shale hornet and yellow jacket wasp attacks were a daily occurrence sending men scrambling and mules stampeding one over a cliff to her death where the men crossed swamps devils club thorns impaled the men and broke off in their skin creating painful inflammations29 once camped in the central mountains o’neil sent out small exploring parties to the duckabush dosewallips south fork skokomish wynoochee and humptulips rivers and to mount olympus and the queets river one party of 3 men climbed what they thought was mount olympus but was in reality one of the neighboring peaks athena ii a fourth member of the summit party became separated on the climb and ended up descending the queets river alone and was taken in by a quinault indian family they were reluctant to believe that he had crossed the olympics not believing it was possible to do so but they accepted his story when he was able to point out reference points on a map many members of this expedition spoke chinook jargon from their settlement he was able to rejoin the expedition in hoquiam oneils reports on his explorations resulted in his recommendation that the region be declared a national park2934 20th centuryedit mount olympus itself was not ascended until 1907 one of the first successes of the mountaineers which had been organized in seattle just a few years earlier35 a number of the more obscure and leastaccessible peaks in the range were not ascended until the 1970s president grover cleveland protected the forests of the olympic peninsula with the olympic forest reserve in 189734 initially the reserve consisted of over 2 million acres nearly the entire peninsula7 forest service surveyors dodwell and rixon spent three years surveying timber cruising and mapping the new reserve their report published in 1902 reported that most of the land was not suited to agriculture but local politicians had already convinced president william mckinley to remove the most valuable lowland timber from the reserve claiming it should be open to homesteading private timber companies paid ‘homesteaders’ to file claims on land that they then sold to the timber company7 at the same time commercial hunters reduced the olympic elk herds to fewer than 2000 animals prompting the state legislature to impose a temporary moratorium on elk hunting in the olympics the forest reserve was reorganized under gifford pinchot as the olympic national forest in 1905 with an emphasis on commercial utilization of timber and minerals and fire protection as well as hunting and trapping25 with the passing of the antiquities act in 1906 which allowed the president to designate national monuments mount olympus national monument administered by the forest service was proclaimed by theodore roosevelt in 1909 in order to protect the elk herds in 1914 the new supervisor of the forest service henry graves made a trip to the olympics to determine if commercial timber and minerals were being tied up in the national monument25 as a result of grave’s report president woodrow wilson removed a third of a million acres from the monument the elwha river was dammed in 1910 with construction of the elwha dam36 a second dam was built a few miles upstream in 1927 neither dam had any fish passage for the salmonid runs completely eliminating salmonids from over 70 miles of river37 congress authorized removal of these dams in 1992 and work began in 201138 the north fork skokomish river was dammed in the 1920s by the city of tacoma enlarging the original lake cushman by 600339 a settlement was reached in 2009 with the skokomish indian tribe over damages to fisheries and game habitat damages to tribal lands through flooding and trespass on tribal lands for the power transmission line as part of the settlement migrating salmon will be trucked around the dam39 the wynoochee river was dammed in the late 1960s by the army corps of engineers for flood control but in 1994 the dam was taken over by the city of tacoma for power generation340 migrating salmon are trucked around the dam and tacoma public utilities funds mitigation for roosevelt elk wintering habitat that was lost under the reservoir40 with the building of the spruce railroad during world war i and the completion of the olympic highway in 1931 logging in the olympics intensified along with demand for recreational facilities25 during this period the forest service built roads and campgrounds and encouraged private businesses with special use permits to build tourist facilities such as a winter sports facility at deer park and the chalets in enchanted valley and at low divide special use permits were also issued for private summer cabins at lakes cushman and quinault and the olympic hot springs resort during the great depression the olympic national forest used the civilian conservation corps to build logging roads and railroads bridges campgrounds shelters fire lookouts ranger stations and a fish hatchery they also fought fires and planted tree seedlings25 pressure for a national park built with the acceleration of logging and road building7 the forest service campaigned in peninsula logging and mill towns against the national park and both the forest service and the park service jockeyed for public support and endorsement from various conservation groups for administration of the monument25 in 1935 a special committee was convened on the national park proposal the majority reported that the olympics fully rated protection as a national park but one member issued a minority report stating that public pressure for recreational facilities would require the park service to build roads campgrounds and chalets thus negating any benefit from national park status25 both the forest service and the park service sponsored backcountry trips through the high olympics that summer to promote their stewardship of the mountains in 1937 president franklin d roosevelt visited the olympics to determine their suitability as a national park and was greeted in port angeles by more than 3000 local school children asking him to ‘give us our olympic national park’7 he signed olympic national park into law in 1938 in 1953 the park was enlarged with the addition of the coastal strip34 and more coastal areas along lake ozette were added in 19767 also that year unesco named the park an international biosphere reserve and a world heritage site in 1981 in 1984 congress designated 5 wilderness areas in the olympic national forest7 and declared 95 of olympic national park a wilderness area in 198834 see alsoedit list of mountain ranges in
