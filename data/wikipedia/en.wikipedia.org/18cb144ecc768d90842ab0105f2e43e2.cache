department of justice and by the european commission on february 19 2008 both the department of justice and the commission cleared the transaction subject to minor divestments18 the department of justice required the parties to sell copies of the data contained in the following products thomsons worldscope a global fundamentals product reuters estimates an earnings estimates product and reuters aftermarket embargoed research database an analyst research distribution product the proposed settlement further requires the licensing of related intellectual property access to personnel and transitional support to ensure that the buyer of each set of data can continue to update its database so as to continue to offer users a viable and competitive product19 the european commission imposed similar divestments according to the commissions press release the parties committed to divest the databases containing the content sets of such financial information products together with relevant assets personnel and customer base as appropriate to allow purchasers of the databases and assets to quickly establish themselves as a credible competitive force in the marketplace in competition with the merged entity reestablishing the premerger rivalry in the respective fields20 these remedies were viewed as very minor given the scope of the transaction according to the financial times the remedy proposed by the competition authorities will affect no more than 25m of the new thomson reuters group’s 13bnplus combined revenues21 the transaction was cleared by the canadian competition bureau22 in november 2009 the european commission opened formal antitrust proceedings23 against thomson reuters concerning a potential infringement of the ec treatys rules on

prevented from translating reuters instrument codes rics to alternative identification codes of other datafeed suppliers socalled mapping to the detriment of competition in december 2012 the european

restriction was waived for the purchase by thomson whose family holding company the woodbridge company currently owns 53 of the enlarged business robert peston business editor at bbc news stated that this has worried reuters journalists both because they are concerned that reuters journalism business will be marginalized by the financial data provision business of the combined company and because of the threat to reuterss reputation for unbiased journalism by the appearance of one majority shareholder pehr gyllenhammar chairman of the reuters founders share company explained that the reuters trusts first principle had been waived for the thomson family because of the poor financial circumstances that reuters had been in stating the future of reuters takes precedence over the principles if reuters were not strong enough to continue on its own the principles would have no meaning he stated not having met david thomson but having discussed the matter with geoff beattie the president of woodbridge that the thomson family had agreed to vote as directed by the reuters founders share company on any matter that the trustees might deem to threaten the five principles of the reuters trust woodbridge will be allowed an exemption from the first principle as long as it remains controlled by the thomson family26272829 operationsedit this sections factual accuracy may be compromised due to
