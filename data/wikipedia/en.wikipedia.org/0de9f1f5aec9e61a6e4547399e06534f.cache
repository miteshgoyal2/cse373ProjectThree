alexander graham bell conceived the technical aspects of the telephone and invented it in july 18749 while residing with his parents at their farm in tutela heights10 on the outskirts of brantford ontario he later refined its design at brantford after producing his first working prototype in boston11 canadas first telephone factory created by james cowherd of brantford was a threestory brick building that soon started manufacturing telephones for the bell system leading to the citys style as the telephone city12note 1 after cowherds death in 1881 which resulted in the closure of his brantford factory a mechanical production department was created within the bell telephone company of canada and production of canadian telephones and telephone equipment was transferred to montreal in 188215 due to restrictions on importing telephone equipment from the united states17 in addition to phones four years later the department started manufacturing its first switchboard a 50 line standard magneto switchboard1518 the small manufacturing department expanded yearly with the growth and popularity of the telephone to 50 employees in 188819 by 1890 it had been transformed into its own branch of operations with 200 employees and a new factory was under construction15 as the manufacturing branch expanded its production ability increased beyond the demand for phones and it faced closure for several months a year without manufacturing other products20 this was a problem because the bell telephone company of canadas later renamed to bell canada charter would not allow them to build other products so in 1895 the bell telephone of canada was required to spin off its manufacturing arm to build phones for sale to other companies as well as other devices such as fire alarm boxes police street call boxes and fire department call equipment this company was incorporated as the northern electric and manufacturing company limited15 northern electric and manufacturing
