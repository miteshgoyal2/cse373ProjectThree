celebrating jewish holidays and that he considers himself jewish9 beck began life in a rooming house near downtown los angeles as a child he lived in a declining neighborhood just off hollywood boulevard10 by the time we left there they were ripping out miles of houses en masse and building lowrent giant apartment blocks he later recalled6 the lowerclass family struggled financially moving to hoover and ninth street a neighborhood populated primarily by koreans and salvadorian refugees6 he was sent for a time to live with his paternal grandparents in kansas with beck later remarking that i think they were kind of concerned about his weird home life11 since his paternal grandfather was a presbyterian minister beck grew up influenced by church music and hymns11 beck also spent time in europe with his maternal grandfather al hansen a visual collage artist and a pioneer in the avantgarde fluxus movement5 after his parents separated when he was ten6 beck stayed with his mother and brother in los angeles where he was influenced by the citys diverse musical offerings—everything from hip hop to latin music and his mothers art scene—all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published workcitation needed beck obtained his first guitar at 16 and became a street musician often playing lead belly covers at lafayette park12 during his teens beck discovered the music of sonic youth pussy galore and x but remained uninterested in most music outside folk until many years into his career56 the first contemporary music that made a direct connection with beck was hip hop which he first heard on grandmaster flash records in the early 1980s6 growing up in a predominantly latin district he found himself the only white child at his school and he quickly learned to breakdance6 when he was 17 beck grew fascinated after hearing a mississippi john hurt record at a friends house13 and spent hours in his room trying to emulate the countryblues guitarists finger picking techniques11 shortly thereafter beck explored blues and folk music further discovering woody guthrie and blind willie johnson13 feeling like a total outcast beck dropped out of school after junior high13 he later said that although he felt school was important he felt unsafe there10 when he applied to the new performing arts high school downtown he was rejected14 his brother channing took him to postbeat jazz places in echo park and silver lake he hung out at the los angeles city college perusing records books and old sheet music in its library he used a fake id to sit in on classes there and he also befriended a literature instructor and his poet wife14 he worked at a string of menial jobs including loading trucks and operating a leaf blower13 careeredit early performing and first releases 1985–93edit beck began as a folk musician switching between country blues delta blues and more traditional rural folk music in his teens6 he began performing on city buses often covering mississippi john hurt alongside original sometimes improvisational compositions11 id get on the bus and start playing mississippi john hurt with totally improvised lyrics some drunk would start yelling at me calling me axl rose so id start singing about axl rose and the levee and bus passes and strychnine mixing the whole thing up he later recalled11 he was also in a band called youthless that hosted dadaistinspired freeform events at city coffee shops6 we had radio shack mics and this homemade speaker and wed draft people in the audience to recite comic books or do a beatbox thing or wed tie the whole audience up in masking tape beck recalled6 in 1989 beck caught a bus to new york city with little more than eight dollars and a guitar11 he spent the summer attempting to find a job and a place to live with little success11 beck eventually began to frequent manhattans lower east side and stumbled upon the tail end of the east villages antifolk scenes first wave5 beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians—including cindy lee berryhill kirk kelly paleface and lach headed by roger manning—whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream1315 the whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones said beck of his new york years everybody knew each other you could go up onstage and say anything and you wouldnt feel weird or feel any pressure15 inspired by that freedom and by the local spokenword performers beck began to write freeassociative surrealistic songs about pizza mtv and working at mcdonalds turning mundane thoughts into songs15 beck was roommates with paleface sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together16 daunted by the prospect of another homeless new york winter beck returned to his home of los angeles in early 19911317 i was tired of being cold tired of getting beat up he later remarked it was hard to be in new york with no money no place i kinda used up all the friends i had everyone on the scene got sick of me11 back in los angeles beck began to work at a video store in silver lake doing things like alphabetizing the pornography section11 he began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as als bar and rajis51113 in order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music beck would play in a spontaneous joking manner18 id be banging away on a son house tune and the whole audience would be talking so maybe out of desperation or boredom or the audiences boredom id make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening he later remarked19 virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play strange folk songs accompanied by what could best be described as performance art while sometimes wearing a star wars stormtrooper mask13 beck met someone who offered to help record demos in his living room and he began to pass cassette tapes around13 eventually beck gained key boosters in margaret mittleman the west coasts director of talent acquisitions for bmg music publishing and the partners behind independent record label bong load custom records tom rothrock rob schnapf and brad lambert5 schnapf saw beck perform at jabberjaw and felt he would suit their small venture13 beck expressed a loose interest in hip hop and rothrock introduced him to carl stephenson a record producer for rapalot records1320 in 1992 beck visited stephensons home to collaborate the result—the slidesampling hip hop track loser—was a oneoff experiment that beck set aside going back to his folk songs making his home tapes such as golden feelings and releasing several independent singles13 mellow gold and independent albums 1993–94edit by 1993 beck was living in a ratinfested shed near a los angeles alleyway with little money11 bong load issued loser as a single in march 1993 on 12 vinyl with only 500 copies pressed21 beck felt that loser was mediocre and only agreed to its release at rothrocks insistence22 loser unexpectedly received radio airplay starting in los angeles where college radio station kxlu was the first to play it21 and later on santa monica college radio station kcrw where radio host chris douridas played the song on morning becomes eclectic the stations flagship music program i called the record label that day and asked to have beck play live on the air douridas said he came in that friday rapped to a tape of loser and did his song mtv makes me want to smoke crack13 that night beck performed at the los angeles club cafe troy to a packed audience and talent scouts from major labels13 the song then spread to seattle through kndd and kroqfm began playing the song on an almost hourly basis21 as bong load struggled to press more copies of loser beck was beset with offers to sign with major labels23 during the bidding war in november beck spent several days in olympia washington recording material with calvin johnson of beat happening which would later see release the following year on johnsons k records as one foot in the grave24 a fierce bidding war ensued with geffen records ar director mark kates signing beck in december 1993 despite intense competition from warner bros and capitol1324 becks nonexclusive contract with geffen allowed him an unusual amount of creative freedom with beck remaining free to release material through such small independent labels as flipside which issued the sprawling 25track collection of preloser recordings titled stereopathetic soulmanure on february 22 the following year1324 by the time beck released his first album for geffen the lowbudget genreblending mellow gold on march 113 loser was already in the top 40 and its video in mtvs buzz bin10 loser quickly ascended the charts in the us reaching a peak of number ten on the billboard hot 100 singles chart and topping the modern rock tracks chart25 the song also charted in the uk australia new zealand and throughout europe becks newfound position of attention led to his characterization as the king of slackers as the media dubbed him the center of the new socalled slacker movement26 critics feeling it the essential followup to radioheads creep24 found vacantness in the lyrics of loser strongly associated with generation x although beck himself strongly contested his position as the face of the slacker generation slacker my ass i mean i never had any slack i was working a 4anhour job trying to stay alive that slacker stuff is for people who have the time to be depressed about everything11 backlash and odelay 1994–97edit feeling as though he were constantly trying to prove myself10 beck suffered a backlash with skeptics denouncing him as a selfindulgent fake and the latest marketing opportunity27 in the summer of 1994 beck was struggling and many of his fellow musicians thought he had lost his way6 combined with the songs wildly popular music video and the world tour beck reacted believing the attention could not last resulting in a status as a onehit wonder at other concerts crowds were treated to twenty minutes of reggae or miles davis or jazzpunk iterations of loser14 at oneday festivals in california he surrounded himself with an artnoise combo the drummer set fire to his cymbals the lead guitarist played his char with the strings faced towards his body and beck changed the words to loser so that nobody could sing along6 i cant tell you how many times i was looking at faces that were looking back at me with complete bewilderment—or just pointing and shaking their heads and laughing—while performing during that period he later recalled28 despite this beck gained the respect of his peers such as tom petty and johnny cash and created an entire wave of bands determined to recapture the mellow gold sound29 feeling his previous releases were just collections of demos recorded over the course of several years beck desired to enter the studio and record an album in a continuous linear fashion which became odelay28 beck blends country blues rap jazz and rock on odelay the result of a year and half of feverish cutting pasting layering dubbing and of course sampling12 each day the musicians started from scratch30 often working on songs for 16 hours straight12 odelays conception lies in an unfinished studio album beck first embarked on following the success of loser chronicling the difficult time he experienced there was a cycle of everyone dying around me he recalled later29 he was constantly recording and eventually put together an album of somber orchestrated folk tunes one that perhaps could have been a commercial blockbuster along with similarly themed work by smashing pumpkins nine inch nails and nirvana29 instead beck plucked one song from it—the odelay album closer ramshackle—and shelved the rest brother and feather in your cap were however later released as bsides629 beck was introduced to the dust brothers producers of the beastie boys album pauls boutique whose cutandpaste sampleheavy production suited becks vision of a more fun accessible albumcitation needed after a record executive explained that odelay would be a huge mistake he spent many months thinking that id blown it forever14 odelay was released on june 18 1996 to commercial success and critical acclaim the record produced several hit singles including where its at devils haircut and the new pollution31 and was nominated for the grammy award for album of the year in 1997 winning a grammy award for best alternative music album as well as a grammy award for best male rock vocal performance for where its at during one busy week in january 1997 he landed his grammy nominations appeared on saturday night live and howard stern and did a lastminute trot on the rosie odonnell show the combined buzz gave odelay a second wind leading to an expanded fan base and additional exposure19 beck enjoyed but like several executives at geffen was bewildered by the success of odelay he would often get recognized in public which made him feel strange its just weird it doesnt feel right it doesnt feel natural to me i dont think i was made for that i was never good at that he later told pitchfork28 odelay sold two million copies and put onehit wonder criticisms to rest during this time he contributed the song deadweight to the soundtrack of the film a life less ordinary 199732 mutations and midnite vultures 1998–2001edit having not been in a proper studio since deadweight beck felt anxious to go in and just do some stuff real quick and compiled several songs he had had for years32 beck and his bandmates hammered out fourteen songs in fourteen days although just twelve made it onto the album 1998s mutations32 beck decided on nigel godrich producer for radioheads ok computer the previous year to be behind the boards for the project32 godrich was leaving the united states for england in a short time which led to the albums quick production schedule—no looking back no doctoring anything32 the whole point of the record was to capture the performance of the musicians live an uncharacteristic farcry from the cutandpaste aesthetic of odelay32 though the album was originally slated for release by bong load records geffen intervened and issued the record against becks wishes3334 the artist then sought to void his contracts with both record labels and in turn the labels sued him for breach of contract the litigation went on for years and it remains unclear to this day if it has ever been completely resolved35 beck was later awarded best alternative music performance for mutations at the 42nd grammy awards36 midnite vultures becks next studio effort was originally recorded as a double album and more than 25 nearly completed songs were left behind28 in the studio beck and producers studied contemporary hip hop and rb specifically r kelly in order to embrace and incorporate those influences in the way al green and stax records had done in previous decades28 in july 1998 a core group began to assemble at becks pasadena home bassist justin meldaljohnsen keyboardist roger joseph manning jr and producerengineers mickey petralia and tony hoffer30 dozens of session players passed through including becks father david campbell who played viola and arranged some of the strings the musicians held communal meals and mountainbike rides on dusty trails nearby but remained focused on becks instructions to make an uptempo album that would be fun to play on tour night after night30 i had so many things going on said beck of the recording process i had a couple of rooms of computers hooked up i was doing b sides for japan i was programming beats in one room and someone would be cooking dinner in the other room30 in november 1999 geffen released the muchanticipated midnite vultures37 which attracted confusion fans and critics misguidedly worried whether it was serious or a goof and as a result the new york times wrote that the album never won the audience it deserved38 the record was supported by an extensive world tour for beck it was a return to the highenergy performances that had been his trademark as far back as lollapalooza the live stage set included a red bed that descended from the ceiling for the song debra and the touring band was complemented by a brass section39 midnite vultures was nominated for best album at the 43rd annual grammy awards40 sea change 2002–03edit in 2000 beck and his fiancée stylist leigh limon ended their nineyear relationship41 beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection during which he wrote the bleak acousticbased tracks later found on sea change42 beck sat on the songs not wanting to talk about his personal life he later said that he wanted to focus on music and not really strew my baggage across the public lobby eventually however he decided the songs spoke to a common experience a relationship breakup and that it would not seem selfindulgent to record them43 in 2001 beck drifted back to the songs and called producer nigel godrich44 retailers initially predicted that the album would not receive much radio support but they also believed that becks maverick reputation and critical acclaim in addition to the possibility of multiple grammy nominations might offset sea changes noncommercial sound43 sea change issued by geffen in september 2002 was regardless a commercial hit and critical darling38 with rolling stone revering it as the best album beck has ever made an impeccable album of truth and light from the end of love this is his blood on the tracks45 the album was later listed by the magazine as one of the best records of the decade and of alltime and it also placed second on the years pazz jop critics poll sea change yielded a lowkey theaterbased acoustic tour as well as a larger tour with the flaming lips as becks opening and backing band4647 beck was playful and energetic sometimes throwing in covers of the rolling stones big star the zombies and the velvet underground4548 following the release of sea change beck felt newer compositions were sketches for something more evolved in the same direction and wrote nearly 35 more songs in the coming months keeping demos of them on tapes in a suitcase28 during his solo tour the tapes were left backstage during a stop in washington dc and beck was never able to recover them it was disheartening to the musician who felt the two years of songwriting represented something more technically complex as a result beck took a break and wrote no original compositions in 200328 feeling as though it might take him a while to get back to that songwriting territory he entered the studio with dust brothers to complete a project that dated back to odelay nearly half of the songs had existed since the 1990s28 guero and the information 2004–07edit guero becks eighth studio album was recorded over the span of nine months during which several significant events occurred in his life his girlfriend marissa ribisi became pregnant they were married their son cosimo was born and they moved out of silver lake3849 the collaboration with the dust brothers his second was notable for their use of hightech measures to achieve a lofi sound38 for example after recording a sonically perfect version of a song at one of the nicest recording studios in hollywood the dust brothers processed it in an echoplex to create a gritty reverbheavy sound we did this hightech recording and ran it through a transistor radio it sounded too good that was the problem38 initially due to be released in october 2004 guero faced delays and did not come out till march 2005 though unmastered copies of the tracks surfaced online in january50 beck in 2005 guero debuted at number two on the billboard 200 selling 162000 copies an alltime sales high51 lead single epro peaked at number one at modern rock radio making it his first charttopper since loser52 beck inspired by the nintendocore remix scene and feeling a connection with its lofi homerecording method collaborated with artists 8bit and paza on hell yes an ep issued in february 200549 in december 2005 geffen also issued guerolito a fully reworked version of guero featuring remixes by the beastie boys adrock the dust brothers john king and scottish electronic duo boards of

12track promotionalonly history of beck compilation cd sampler that featured a combination of older and newer beck tracks53 beck in 2006 the information becks ninth studio album began production around the same time as guero in 2003 working with producer nigel godrich beck built a studio in his garden where they wrote many of the tracks54 the idea was to get people in a room together recording live hitting bad notes and screaming said beck adding that the album is best described as introspective hip hop55 beck described the recording process as painful noting that he edited down songs constantly and he perhaps recorded the album three times56 for the release beck was allowed for the first time to fulfill a longrunning wish for an unconventional rollout he made lowbudget videos to accompany each song packaged the cd with sheets of stickers so buyers could customize the cover and leaked tracks and videos on his website months ahead of the albums release5457 digital download releases automatically downloaded the songs additional video for each single sale and physical copies came bundled with an additional dvd featuring fifteen videos54 modern guilt 2008edit in 2007 beck released the single timebomb which was nominated for a grammy award for best solo rock vocal performance58 for his next studio effort his tenth beck tapped danger mouse to produce and the two first met in december 2007 to record the duo knocked out two tracks in two days but the notion that the album would be finished in a timely fashion soon evaporated58 beck had known danger mouse casually before as many of his former musicians ended up working with danger mouses side project gnarls barkley still the musicians were surprised at how well they got along59 following the grueling recording schedule beck was exhausted calling it the most intense work ive ever done on anything relating that he did at least 10 weeks with no days off until four or five in the morning every night59 becks original vision was a short 10track burst with twominute songs but the songs gradually grew as he fit two years of songwriting into two and a half months59 modern guilt 2008 was full of offkilter rhythms and leftfield breakdowns with an overall 1960s vibe record club song reader production work and nonalbum singles 2009–13edit modern guilt was the final release in becks contract with geffen records beck then 38 had held the contract since his early 20s5859 released from his label contract and going independent beck began working more heavily on his own sevenyearold label which went through a variety of names28 his focus on smaller more quixotic projects14 beck moonlighted as a producer working with artists such as charlotte gainsbourg thurston moore and stephen malkmus28

released in december 2012 is 20 songs presented only as sheet music in the hopes that enterprising musicians will record their own versions68 the idea of song reader came about nearly fifteen years prior shortly after the release of odelay14 when sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound he aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible to recreate the simplicity of the standards and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the great american songbook14 in 2013 beck began playing special song reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of song reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions69 beck performing in 2013 in the summer of 2013 beck was reported to be working on two new studio albums one a more selfcontained acoustic disc in the vein of one foot in the grave and
