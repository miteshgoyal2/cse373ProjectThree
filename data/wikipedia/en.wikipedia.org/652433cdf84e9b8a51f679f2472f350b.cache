toronto willis tower sears tower chicago stratosphere las vegas space needle seattle the top of the space needle the architecture of the space needle is the result of a compromise between the designs of two men edward e carlson and john graham jr the two leading ideas for the world fair involved businessman edward e carlsons sketch of a giant balloon tethered to the ground see the gently sloping base and architect john grahams concept of a flying saucer see the halo that houses the restaurant and observation deck7 victor steinbrueck introduced the hourglass profile of the tower10 the space needle was built to withstand wind speeds of 200 mph 322 kmh double the requirements in the building code of 1962 the 68 mw nisqually earthquake jolted the needle enough in 2001 for water to slosh out of the toilets in the restrooms the space needle will not sustain serious structural damage during earthquakes of magnitudes below 9 also made to withstand category 5 hurricaneforce winds the space needle sways only 1 inch per 10 mph 16 mm per 10 kmh of wind speed for decades the hovering disk of the space needle was home to two restaurants 500 ft 150 m above the ground the space needle restaurant which was originally named eye of the needle and emerald suite these were closed in 2000 to make way for skycity a larger restaurant that features pacific northwest cuisine it rotates 360 degrees in exactly fortyseven minutes11 in 1993 the elevators were replaced with new computerized versions the new elevators descend at a rate of 10 miles per hour 45 ms on december 31 1999 a powerful beam of light was unveiled for the first time called the legacy light or skybeam it is powered by lamps that total 85 million candela shining skyward from the top of the space needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in seattle the concept of this beam was derived from the official 1962 worlds fair poster which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design it is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates12 originally planned to be turned on 75 nights per year it has generally been used fewer than a dozen times per year it did remain lit for eleven days in a row from september 11 2001 to september 22 2001 in response to the september 11 2001 attacks13 a 1962 seattle worlds fair poster14 showed a grand spiral entryway leading to the elevator that was ultimately omitted from final building plans15 the stairway was eventually added as part of the pavilion and spacebase remodel in june 2000 the main stairwell has 848 steps from the basement to the top of the observation deck7 at approximately 605 ft 184 m the space needle was the tallest building west of the mississippi river at the time it was built by howard s wright construction co but is now dwarfed by other structures along the seattle skyline among them the columbia center at 967 ft 295 m16 unlike many other similar structures such as the cn tower in toronto the space needle is not used for broadcasting purposes historyedit constructionedit edward f carlson chairman of the 1962 worlds fair in seattle originally had an idea for erecting a tower with a restaurant at the worlds fair carlson was then president of a hotel company and not previously known for art or design but he was inspired by a recent visit to the stuttgart tower of germany john graham an architect who had won praise for designing the northgate mall in seattle soon became involved grahams first move was to alter the restaurant featured in the plans to a revolving restaurant in the same manner as on a tower la ronde he had previously designed for the ala moana shopping center the proposed space needle had no land where they could build since it was not financed by the city land had to be purchased that was within the fairgrounds the investors thought that there would be no land available to build a tower and the search for a site was nearly dead when in 1961 they discovered a plot 120 by 120 ft 37 by 37 m containing switching equipment for the fire and police alarm systems the land sold for 75000 at this point only one year remained before the worlds fair would begin it was privately built and financed by the pentagram corporation which consisted of bagley wright contractor howard s wright architect john graham ned skinner and norton clapp in 1977 bagley skinner and clapp sold their interest to howard wright who now controls it under the name of space needle corporation17 the earthquake stability of the space needle was ensured when a hole was dug 30 ft 91 m deep and 120 ft 37 m across and 467 concrete trucks took one full day to fill it the foundation weighs 5850 tons including 250 tons of reinforcing steel the same as the aboveground structure the structure is bolted to the foundation with 72 bolts each one 30 ft 91 m long with time an issue the construction team worked around the clock the domed top housing the top five levels including the restaurants and observation deck was perfectly balanced so that the restaurant could rotate with the help of one tiny electric motor originally 08 kilowatts 11 hp later replaced with a 11 kilowatts 15 hp motor with paint colors named orbital olive for the body astronaut white for the legs reentry red for the saucer and galaxy gold for the roof the space needle was finished in less than one year it was completed in april 1962 at a cost of 45 million the last elevator car was installed the day before the fair opened on april 21 during the course of the fair nearly 20000 people a day rode the elevators to the observation deck the 20000 mark was never reached missed by fewer than 50 people one day at the time of construction it was the tallest building in the west taking the title from the smith tower across town that had held that title since 1914 the revolving restaurant was operated by western international hotels of which carlson was president18 under a 20year contract from april 1 1962 to april 1 198219 carillonedit an imitation carillon20 a multibell musical device was installed in the space needle and played several times a day during the worlds fair the instrument built by the schulmerich bells company of hatfield pennsylvania21 under the name carillon americana recreated the sounds of 538 bells and was the largest in the world until eclipsed by a 732 bell instrument at the 1964 new york worlds fair the operators console was located in the base of the space needle completely enclosed in glass to allow observation of the musician playing the instrument it was also capable of being played from a roll just as a player piano would be the fortyfour stentors speakers of the carillon were located underneath the needles disc at the 200 foot level and were audible over the entire fairgrounds and up to ten miles away22 the carillon was disassembled after the fairs close the carillon bells were featured on an lp record called bells on hifi catalog number ar8 produced by americana records of sellersville pennsylvania there are 12 pieces recorded on the carillon americana before it was installed in the space needle performed by noted carilloneur john klein 191519812324 after the fairedit the space needle seen here in may 2012 was painted galaxy gold for its 50th anniversary celebration in 1974 author stephen cosgroves childrens book wheedle on the needle postulated a furry creature called a wheedle who lived on top of the space needle and caused its light to flash its closing quatrain is theres a wheedle on the needle  i know just what youre thinking  but if you look up late at night  youll see his red nose blinking the wheedle has since become a fixture of seattle it even became the mascot of the seattle supersonics national basketball association nba franchise who played in nearby keyarena originally known as the seattle center coliseum the supersonics moved to oklahoma city on july 3 2008 in 1982 the skyline level was added at a height of 100 ft 30 m while this level had been depicted in the original plans for the space needle it was not built until this time today the skyline banquet facility can accommodate groups of 20–360 people renovations were completed in 2000 that cost approximately the same as the original construction price 21 million in current currency renovations between 1999 and 2000 included the skycity restaurant spacebase retail store skybeam installation observation deck overhaul lighting additions and repainting every year on new years eve the space needle celebrates with a fireworks show at midnight that is synchronized to music the worldwide renowned fireworks artist from bellevue alberto navarro has been designing the show for the past 20 year since its inception in 1994 in 2000 public celebrations were canceled but the fireworks show was still performed because of perceived terror threats against the structure after investigations into the foiled millennium bombing plots on may 19 2007 the space needle welcomed its 45 millionth visitor greg novoa of san francisco he received a free trip for two to paris which included a vip dinner at the eiffel tower25 in may 2008 the space needle received its first professional cleaning since the opening of the 1962 worlds fair the monument was pressure washed by kärcher26 with water at a pressure of 20000 kilopascals 2900 psi and a temperature of 90 °c 194 °f no detergents were used in consideration of the seattle center and the emp building27 as part of the celebration of its 50th anniversary

glass fence surrounding the deck onto the edge and jumped off in what the seattle police department called an obvious suicide32 police found a correspondence in wolfs purse that was from a friend extending their condolences regarding the recent death of wolfs husband32 following the two suicides in 1974 a netting and additional fencing were installed on the observation deck33 however another
