society headquarters office in washington dc ieee computer society traces its origins to the subcommittee on largescale computing established in 1946 by the american institute of electrical engineers aiee6 and to the professional group on electronic computers pgec established in 1951 by the institute of radio engineers ire7 when the aiee merged with the ire in 1963 to form the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee these two committees became the ieee computer group8 the group established its own constitution and bylaws in 1971 to become the ieee computer society1 the cs maintains its headquarters in washington dc and additional offices in california and japan9 main activitiesedit ieee computer society publications office in los alamitos california the computer society maintains volunteer boards in six program areas education membership professional activities publications standards and technical and conference activities in addition 12 standing committees administer activities such as the cs elections and its awards programs to recognize professional excellence10 education and professional developmentedit the computer society participates in ongoing development of college computing curricula jointly with the association for computing machinery acm11 other educational activities include software development certification programs12 and online access to elearning courseware and books13 publicationsedit the computer society is a leading publisher of technical material in computing14 its publications include 13 peerreviewed technical magazines and 20 scholarly journals called transactions as well as conference proceedings books and a variety of digital products15 the computer society digital library csdl provides subscriber access to all cs publications16 in 2008 the computer society launched computing now a web portal featuring free access to a rotation of csdl articles along with technical news cs blogs and multimedia content17 as most publications were delivered digitally in 2014 the computer society launched the complementary monthly digest computing edge magazine which consists of curated articles from its magazines18 technical conferences and activitiesedit steve wozniak relating tales of his television jammer hijinks from college at the first techignite conference the computer society sponsors more than 170 technical conferences each year19 and coordinates the operation of several technical committees councils and task forces20 the cs also maintains 12 standards committees to develop ieee standards in various areas of computer and software engineering eg the design automation standards committee and the ieee 802 lanman standards committee21 in 2010 the cs introduced special technical communities stcs as a new way for members to develop communities focusing on selected technical areas22 current topics include broadening participation cloud computing education egov haptics multicore operating systems smart grids social networking sustainable computing systems engineering and wearable and ubiquitous technologies23 technical committeesedit ieeecs currently has 26 technical committees and two technical councils24 a technical committee tc is an international network of professionals with common interests in computer hardware software its applications and interdisciplinary fields within the umbrella of ieeecs a technical council is essentially a very large technical committee and a task force is an emerging technical committee a tc serves as the focal point of the various technical activities within a technical discipline which influences the standards development conferences publications and educational activities of ieeecs following are the current technical
