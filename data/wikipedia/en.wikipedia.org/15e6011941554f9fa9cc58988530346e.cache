conservatism green conservatism lgbt conservatism libertarianism women in conservatism conservatism portal v t e compassionate conservatism is a political philosophy that stresses using traditionally conservative techniques and concepts in order to improve the general welfare of society the term itself is often credited to us historian and politician doug wead who used it as the title of a speech in 1979 although its origins lie in paternalism1 this label and philosophy has been espoused by us republican and democratic politicians since then though in recent times it has been strongly associated with former us president george w bush who commonly used the term to describe his personal views1 this philosophy has also been espoused in the united kingdom by former prime minister david cameron and in new zealand by former prime minister john key compassionate conservatism has also been applied to the christian democratic political ideology prevalent in europe and latin america2 contents 1 origins of the term 2 as a political descriptor 21 use in the 1990s and 2000s 22 reception and criticism 23 decline 3 in the united kingdom 4 see also 5 references 6 external links origins of the termedit historian and presidential advisor doug wead may have been the first person to use the phrase compassionate conservative in 1977 wead wrote a book about kolkata india entitled the compassionate touch3 in 1979 he gave a popular speech entitled the compassionate conservative at the annual washington charity dinner tapes of the speech were sold across the country at corporate seminars4 wead contended that the policies of republican conservatives should be motivated by compassion not protecting the status quo and wead declared himself to be a bleeding heart conservative meaning that he cared for people and sincerely believed that a free marketplace was better for the poor in 1981 in a perhapsunrelated usage vernon jordan of the national urban league said of the reagan administration5 i do not challenge the conservatism of this administration i do challenge its failure to exhibit a compassionate conservatism that adapts itself to the realities of a society ridden by class and race distinction — vernon jordan in 1982 wead coauthored with ronald reagans secretary of the interior james g watt the book the courage of a conservative and developed his ideas further in chapter five of the book which was entitled the compassionate conservative6 in 1984 us representative james r jones dok told the new york times7 i think we should adopt the slogan of compassionate conservatismwe can be fiscally conservative without losing our commitment to the needy and we must redirect our policy in that direction — rep james r jones earlier the same year republican ray shamie proclaimed that i believe in a visionary and compassionate conservatism8 in june 1986 wead wrote an article for the christian herald describing thenvicepresident george h w bush to whom he served as an aide as a compassionate conservative9 according to journalist jacob weisberg george w bush george h w bushs son first picked up the term compassionate conservative from wead in 198710 in 1992 when doug wead ran for us representative from arizona he wrote a campaign book entitled time for a change the first chapter was called the compassionate conservative and outlined weads philosophy that the masses didnt care if republican policies worked if the attitude and purpose behind the policies were uncaring11 some insist the doctrine was invented by dr marvin olasky who went on to memorialize it in his books renewing american compassion 1996 and compassionate conservatism what it is what it does and how it can transform america 2000 and myron magnet of the manhattan institute olasky has been called the godfather of compassionate conservatism12 the phrase was popularized when george w bush adopted it as one of his key slogans during his 2000 presidential campaign against al gore bush also wrote the foreword to olaskys compassionate conservatism olasky said others had come up with the term first as a political descriptoredit use in the 1990s and 2000sedit compassionate conservatism has been defined as the belief that conservatism and compassion complement each other a compassionate conservative might see the social problems of the united states such as health care or immigration as issues that are better solved through cooperation with private companies charities and religious institutions rather than directly through government departments as former bush chief speechwriter michael gerson put it compassionate conservatism is the theory that the government should encourage the effective provision of social services without providing the service itself13 magnet and olasky said 19th century compassionate conservatism was based in part on the christian doctrine of original sin which held that “man is sinful and likely to want something for nothing … man’s sinful nature leads to indolence” olasky renewing american compassion 64 41 in the words of magnet14 compassionate conservatives offer a new way of thinking about the poor they know that telling the poor that they are mere passive victims whether of racism or of vast economic forces is not only false but also destructive paralyzing the poor with thoughts of their own helplessness and inadequacy the poor need the larger societys moral support they need to hear the message of personal responsibility and selfreliance the optimistic assurance that if they try – as they must – they will make it they need to know too that they cant blame the system for their own wrongdoing — myron magnet the wall street journal compassionate conservative philosophy argues for policies in support of traditional families welfare reform to promote individual responsibility cf workfare active policing standardsbased schools cf no child left behind act and assistance economic or otherwise to poor countries around the world us president george w bush said15 it is compassionate to actively help our citizens in need it is conservative to insist on accountability and results — president george w bush bush began his presidency hoping to make compassionate conservatism his centerpiece after the september 11 2001 attacks he focused less on this theme but according to professor and author ira chernus its fundamental ideas became central in his rhetoric about the war on terrorism16 reception and criticismedit nicholas lemann writing in new yorker magazine in 2015 wrote that george w bushs description of himself in the 2000 campaign as a compassionate conservative was brilliantly vague—liberals heard it as im not all that conservative and conservatives heard it as im deeply religious it was about him as a person not a program17 in a july 1999 speech to the democratic leadership council thenpresident bill clinton criticized bushs compassionate conservative selfdescription saying this compassionate conservatism has a great ring to it you know it sounds so good and ive really worked hard to try to figure out what it means i made an honest effort and near as i can tell heres what it means it means i like you i do and i would like to be for the patients bill of rights and id like to be for closing the gun show loophole and id like not to squander the surplus and you know save social security and medicare for the next generation id like to raise the minimum wage id like to do these things but i just cant and i feel terrible about it18 similarly in december 2005 thenbritish prime minister tony blair speaking in the house of commons said the only difference between compassionate conservatism and conservatism is that under compassionate conservatism they tell you theyre not going to help you but theyre really sorry about it19 some critics of george w bush criticized the phrase compassionate conservatism as simply sugarcoating an empty phrase to make traditional conservatism sound more appealing to moderate voters liberal commentator joe conason noting bushs policy of tax cuts wrote in 2003 that so far being a compassionate conservative appears to mean nothing very different from being a hardhearted stingy oldfashioned conservative20 others on the left have viewed it as an effort to remove americas social safety net out of the hands of the government and give it to christian churches liberals make a big mistake if they dismiss compassionate conservatism as just a hypocritical catch phrase wrote university of colorado religion professor ira chernus for the right it is a serious scheme to give tax dollars to churches through socalled faithbased initiatives 21 nobel prize–winning keynesian economist and columnist paul krugman has called it a dog whistle to the religious right referencing marvin olaskys the tragedy of american compassion who believed the poor must help themselves and that poverty was the fault not of society but of the poor and of social workers22 krugman endorses23 digbys analysis24 that rightwing compassionate charity assumes that the giver has the right to investigate and dictate the life of the receiver even for the smallest charity conversely the phrase has also been attacked from the right john j diiulio jr wrote that bushs duty of hope speech delivered in indianapolis in may 1999 drew a negative reaction from his partys right wings many republican conservative activists hated the centerhugging compassionate conservative others favored it but only as a rhetorical trojan horse if a compassionate conservative was actually a governmentshrinking libertarian in religious drag then fine but if bush really meant what he said gorelike about volunteerism not being enough or about rejecting as destructive the reagantested idea that government itself is the main problem then many conservative republicans would not suffer it25 herman cain criticized the idea of compassionate conservatism as leading to the bush administrations increased government spending saying that it completely betrayed conservative voters and their decades of grassroots activism and alienated the partys conservative base noting bush policies such as the medicare prescriptiondrug benefit which increased the size of the medicare program by around 500 billion26 in 2006 conservative commentator jonah goldberg has written that compassionate conservatism as implemented by george w bush differs markedly from the theoretical concept as countless writers have noted in national review over the last five years most conservatives never really understood what compassionate conservatism was beyond a convenient marketing slogan to attract swing voters the reality — as even some members of the bush team will sheepishly concede — is that there was nothing behind the curtain27 similarly conservative commentator fred barnes wrote bush has famously defined himself as a compassionate conservative with a positive agenda almost by definition this makes him a big government conservative28 declineedit the phrase and the idea of compassionate conservativism declined after the bush administration left office in december 2011 christian commentator jim wallis of sojourners citing harsh rhetoric toward the poor and immigrants from candidates for the 2012 republican presidential nomination wrote that the compassionate conservative agenda has virtually disappeared from the republican party29 in january 2012 commentator amy sullivan wrote that just three years after george w bush left the white house compassionate conservatives are an endangered species in the new tea party era theyve all but disappeared from congress and their philosophy is reviled within the gop as biggovernment conservatism30 sullivan noted that republican presidential candidates have jostled to take the hardest line in opposing governmentfunded programs to help the poor30 washington post columnist eugene robinson made similar observations31 in the united kingdomedit according to a 2006 report by the british think tank policy exchange compassionate conservative has been one of the most prominent themes of the conservative party under david cameron32 in speeches and the partys statement of aims and values around 2005 and 2006 cameron and other senior conservatives emphasized a modern compassionate conservatism theme32 at the 2011 conservative party conference the party released a pamphlet titled modern compassionate conservatism and senior leaders such as cameron and foreign secretary william hague said that had pushed for compassionate and cuddly policies33 in 2015 michael gove said when david cameron ran for the leadership of my party he did so and i supported him because he defined himself as a modern compassionate conservative throughout the last five years david cameron has governed and i have been privileged to support him as a modern compassionate conservative34 the compassionate conservative idea is seen as a way for the conservatives to distance themselves from the nasty party image of the past34 see alsoedit conservatism portal christian
