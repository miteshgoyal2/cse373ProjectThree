passengers and a range of 2500 to 5750 nautical miles 4630 to 10650 km4 developed as boeings first jet airliner the 707 is a sweptwing design with podded engines although it was not the first jetliner in service the 707 was the first to be commercially successful dominating passenger air transport in the 1960s and remaining common through the 1970s the 707 is generally credited with ushering in the jet age56 it established boeing as one of the largest manufacturers of passenger aircraft and led to the later series of airliners with 7x7 designations the later 720 727 737 and 757 share elements of the 707s fuselage design the 707 was developed from the boeing 36780 a prototype jet first flown in 1954 a larger fuselage crosssection and other modifications resulted in the initialproduction 707120 powered by pratt whitney jt3c turbojet engines which first flew on december 20 1957 pan american world airways began regular 707 service on october 26 1958 later derivatives included the shortened longrange 707138 and the stretched 707320 both of which entered service in 1959 a smaller shortrange variant the 720 was introduced in 1960 the 707420 a version of the stretched 707 with rollsroyce conway turbofans debuted in 1960 while pratt whitney jt3d turbofans debuted on the 707120b and 707320b models in 1961 and 1962 respectively the 707 has been used on domestic transcontinental and transatlantic flights and for cargo and military applications a convertible passengerfreighter model the 707320c entered service in 1963 and passenger 707s have been modified to freighter

aircraft the company had produced innovative and important bombers from the b17 flying fortress and b29 superfortress to the jetpowered b47 stratojet and b52 stratofortress the companys civil aviation department lagged far behind douglas and other competitors the only noteworthy airliners being the boeing 314 clipper and 307 stratoliner during 1949–1950 boeing embarked on studies for a new jet transport realizing that any design must be aimed at both the military and civilian markets at the time aerial refueling was becoming a standard technique for military aircraft with over 800 kc97 stratofreighters on order with the advent of the jet age a new tanker was required to meet the usafs fleet of jetpowered bombers this was where boeings new design would potentially win military orders7 boeing studied numerous wing and engine layouts for its new transporttanker some of which were based on the b47 and c97 before settling on 367−80 the dash 80 took less than two years from project launch in 1952 to rollout on may 14 1954 then first flew on july 15 1954 it was powered by the pratt whitney jt3c turbojet engine which was the civilian version of the j57 used on many military aircraft of the day including the f100 super sabre fighter and the b52 bomber the prototype was a proofofconcept aircraft for both military and civilian use the united states air force was the first customer using it as the basis for the kc135 stratotanker aerial refueling platform whether the passenger 707 would be profitable was far from certain at the time boeing was making nearly all of its money from military contracts its last passenger transport the boeing 377 stratocruiser had netted the company a 15 million loss before it was purchased by the air force as the kc97 stratofreighter8 in a demonstration flight over lake washington outside seattle on august 7 1955 test pilot tex johnston performed a barrel roll in the 36780 prototype9 boeing 707123b cockpit the 132inch 335 m wide fuselage of the dash 80 was large enough for fourabreast twoplustwo seating like the stratocruiser answering customers demands and under douglas competition boeing soon realized this would not provide a viable payload so it widened the fuselage to 144 in 3660 mm to allow fiveabreast seating and use of the kc135s tooling10 douglas aircraft had launched its dc8 with a fuselage width of 147 in 3730 mm the airlines liked the extra space and sixabreast seating so boeing increased the 707s width again to compete this time to 148 in 3760 mm11 production and testing members of

challenged and removed december 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message the initial standard model was the 707120 with jt3c turbojet engines qantas ordered a shorterbodied version called the 707138 which was a −120 with six fuselage frames removed three in front of the wings and three aft the frames in the 707 were each 20 in 500 mm apart so this resulted in a net shortening of 10 ft 3 m to 134 ft 6 in 410 m because the maximum takeoff weight remained the same as that of the −120 247000 lb or 112 t the −138 was able to fly the longer routes that qantas needed14 braniff international airways ordered the higherthrust version with pratt whitney jt4a engines the 707220 the final major derivative was the 707320 which featured an extendedspan wing and jt4a engines while the 707420 was the same as the −320 but with conway turbofan engines british certification requirements relating to goarounds with one engine inoperative also forced boeing to increase the height of the tail fin on all 707 variants as well as add a ventral fin which was retrofitted on earlier −120 and −220 aircraft these modifications also aided in the mitigation of dutch roll by providing more stability in yaw a pakistan international airlines boeing 707 at munichriem airport during the state visit of pakistan president ayub khan to germany january 1961 though initially fitted with turbojet engines the dominant engine for the boeing 707 family was the pratt whitney jt3d a turbofan variant of the jt3c with lower fuel consumption and higher thrust jt3dengined 707s and 720s were denoted with a b suffix while many 707120bs and 720bs were conversions of existing jt3cpowered machines 707320bs were available only as newly built aircraft as they had a stronger structure to support a maximum takeoff weight increased by 19000 lb 8600 kg along with modifications to the wing the 707320b series enabled nonstop westbound flights from europe to the us west coast and from the us to japan the final 707 variant was the 707320c c for convertible which had a large fuselage door for cargo it had a revised wing with threesectioned leadingedge flaps improving takeoff and landing performance and allowing the ventral fin to be removed although the taller fin was retained the 707320bs built after 1963 used the same wing as the −320c and were known as 707320b advanced aircraft production of the passenger 707 ended in 1978 in total 1010 707s were built for civilian use though many of these found their way to military service the 707 production line remained open for purposebuilt military variants until 1991 with the last newbuild 707 airframes built as e3 and e6 aircraft traces of the 707 are still found in the 737 which uses a modified version of the 707s fuselage as well as the same external nose and cockpit configurations as those of the 707 these were also used on the previous 727 while the 757 also used the 707 fuselage crosssection design wings fourwheel landinggear bogies on a 707–120 the 707s wings are swept back at 35° and like all sweptwing aircraft display an undesirable dutch roll flying characteristic that manifests itself as an alternating yawing and rolling motion boeing already had considerable experience with this on the b47 and b52 and had developed the yaw damper system on the b47 that would be applied to later sweptwing configurations like the 707 however many novice 707 pilots had no experience with this phenomenon as they were transitioning from straightwing propellerdriven aircraft such as the douglas dc7 and lockheed constellation on one customeracceptance flight where the yaw damper was turned off to familiarize the new pilots with flying techniques a trainee pilots actions violently exacerbated the dutch roll motion and caused three of the four engines to be torn from the wings the plane a brand new 707227 n7071 destined for braniff crashlanded on a river bed north of seattle at arlington washington killing four of the eight occupants15 in his autobiography test pilot johnston describes a dutch roll incident he experienced as a passenger on an early commercial 707 flight as the aircrafts movements did not cease and most of the passengers became ill he suspected a misrigging of the directional autopilot yaw damper he went to the cockpit and found the crew unable to understand and resolve the situation he introduced himself and relieved the ashenfaced captain who immediately left the cockpit feeling ill johnston disconnected the faulty autopilot and manually stabilized the plane with two slight control movements16 engines view of number 1 top left and 2 center pratt whitney jt3d engines on the port side of a boeing 707320c the number 1 engine mount does not have the hump for a pressurization turbocompressor the 707 uses enginedriven turbocompressors to supply pressurized air for cabin pressurization on many commercial 707s the outer port number 1 engine mount is distinctly different from the other three as this engine is not fitted with a turbocompressor latermodel 707s typically had this configuration although american airlines had turbocompressors on engines 2 and 3 only early 707 models often had turbocompressor fairings on all four engines but with only two or three compressors installed17 the jt3d3b engines are readily identifiable by the large gray secondary air inlet doors in the nose cowl these doors are fully open sucked in at the rear during takeoff to provide additional air when the engines are throttled back to cruise the doors are shut the 707 was the first commercial jet aircraft to be fitted with clamshelltype thrust reversers on each of the four engines18 upgraded engines omega airs 707330c testbed for the 707re program takes off from the mojave

committed to 20 707s and 25 douglas dc8s dramatically increasing their passenger capacity in available revenue passenger seatmiles per hourper day over its existing fleet of propeller aircraft the competition between the 707 and douglas dc8 was fierce pan american ordered these planes when and as they did so that they would be the operators of the firstoff production line for each aircraft type until their initial batch of the aircraft had been delivered to them and put into operation pan american would have the distinction of being not only the launch customer for both transcontinental american jets but the exclusive operator of american intercontinental jet transports for at least a year the only rival in intercontinental jet aircraft production at the time was the british de havilland comet however this was never real competition for the american market as the comet series had been the subject of fatal accidents due to design flaws early in its introduction withdrawn from service virtually redesigned from scratch and reintroduced as version 4 it was also smaller and slower than the 707 several major airlines committed only to the second place in the production race douglas dc8 douglas aircraft was the more established and preferred by airlines and their passengers maker of passenger aircraft at the time douglas had correctly decided to await the validation of a larger and more fuel efficient engine jt4a from pratt whitney and to design a larger and longer range aircraft around this engine to stay competitive boeing made a late and costly decision to redesign and enlarge the 707s wing to help increase range and payload the new version was numbered 707320citation needed pan am was the first airline to operate the 707 the carrier inaugurated 707 service with a christening at national airport on october 17 1958 attended by president eisenhower followed by a transatlantic flight for vips personal guests of founder juan trippe from baltimores friendship international airport to paris21 the aircrafts first commercial flight was from idlewild airport new york to le bourget paris on october 26 1958 with a fuel stop in gander newfoundland in december national airlines operated the first us domestic jet airline flights between new yorkidlewild and miami using 707s leased from pan am american airlines was the first domestic airline to fly its own jets on january 25 1959 twa started domestic 707131 flights in march and continental airlines started 707124 flights in june airlines that had ordered only the dc8 such as united delta and eastern were left without jets until september and lost market share on transcontinental flights qantas was the first nonus airline to use the 707s starting in 1959citation needed an air france boeing 707–328 at hannoverlangenhagen airport 1972 the 707 quickly became the most popular jetliner of its time its popularity led to rapid developments in airport terminals runways airline catering baggage handling reservations systems and other air transport infrastructure the advent of the 707 also led to the upgrading of air traffic control systems to prevent interference with military jet operations22 as the 1960s drew to a close the exponential growth in air travel led to the 707 being a victim of its own success the 707 was now too small to handle the increased numbers of passengers on the routes for which it was designed stretching the fuselage was not a viable option because the installation of larger more powerful engines would need a larger undercarriage which was not feasible given the designs limited ground clearance at takeoff boeings answer to the problem was the first widebody airliner—the boeing 747 the 707s firstgeneration engine technology was also rapidly becoming obsolete in the areas of noise and fuel economy especially after the 1973 oil crisiscitation needed saha airlines 707 landing at tehranmehrabad in 2011 saha airlines was the last commercial operator of the 707 in 1982 during the falklands war the argentine air force extensively used 707s for longrange maritime patrol with some of them being intercepted and shepherded away by royal navy sea harriers23 it also led to the conversion of british nimrods to carry sidewinder airtoair missiles after a casual encountercitation needed trans world airlines flew the last scheduled 707 flight for passengers by a us carrier on october 30 198324 although 707s remained in scheduled service by airlines from other nations for much longer middle east airlines of lebanon flew 707s and 720s in frontline passenger service until the end of the 1990s since lade of argentina took its 707320bs from regular service in 2007 saha airlines of iran was the last airline to keep 707s in scheduled passenger service until april 201325 operations of the 707 were threatened by the enactment of international noise regulations in 1985 shannon engineering of seattle developed a hush kit with funding from tracor inc of austin texas by the late 1980s 172 boeing 707s had been equipped with the quiet 707 package boeing acknowledged that more 707s were in service then than before the hush kit was available26 most

707020 was the original designation for what ultimately became the boeing 720 launch customer united air lines was a douglas dc8 customer and preferred not to be seen as buying the competing 707 hence the 720 designation american airlines always referred to its 720s as 707s 707120 turkish airlines 707121b in 1976 the 707120 was the first production 707 variant with a longer wider fuselage and greater wingspan than the dash 80 the cabin had a full set of rectangular windows and could seat up to 189 passengers28 it was designed for transcontinental routes and often required a refueling stop when flying across the north atlantic it had four pratt whitney jt3c6 turbojets civilian versions of the military j57 initially producing 13000 lb 578 kn with water injection maximum takeoff weight was 247000 lb and first flight was on december 20 1957 major orders were the launch order for 20 707121 aircraft by pan am and an american airlines order for 30 707123 aircraft the first revenue flight was on october 26 195829 56 were built plus seven shortbodied −138s the last −120 was delivered to western in may 1960 the 707138 was a −120 with a fuselage 10 ft shorter than the others with 5 ft three frames removed ahead and behind the wing giving increased range maximum takeoff weight was the same 247000 lb as the standard version it was a variant for qantas thus had its customer number 38 the seven −138s were delivered to qantas june–september 1959 and first carried passengers that july a 707120b vc137b wing showing the new inboard leading edge like the 720s at museum of flight seattle 2009 the 707120b had pratt whitney jt3d1 turbofan engines which were quieter more powerful and more fuelefficient producing 17000 lbf 756 kn each with the later jt3d3 version giving 18000 lbf 80 kn this thrust did not require water injection eliminating both the system and 5000–6000 lb of water the −120b had the wing modifications introduced on the 720 and a longer tailplane a total of 72 were built 31 for american and 41 for twa plus six shortbodied −138bs for qantas american had its 23 surviving −123s converted to 123bs but twa did not convert its 15 131s the only other conversions were pan americans five surviving −121s and one surviving −139 the three aircraft delivered to the usaf as −153s and the seven shortbodied qantas −138s the first flight of the −120b was on june 22 1960 and american carried the first passengers in march 1961 the last delivery was to american in april 1969 maximum weight was 258000 lb 117025 kg for both the long and shortbodied versions 707220 the 707220 was designed for hot and high operations with more powerful 15800 lb 703 kn pratt whitney jt4a3 turbojets five of these were produced but only four were ultimately delivered with one being lost during a test flight all were for braniff international airways and carried the model number 707227 the first entered service in december 1959 this version was made obsolete by the arrival of the turbofanpowered 707120b 707320 the 707320 intercontinental is a stretched version of the turbojetpowered 707120 initially powered by jt4a3 or jt4a5 turbojets producing 15800 lb 703 kn each most eventually got 17500 lb 784 kn jt4a11s the interior allowed up to 189 passengers the same as the 120 and 220 series but improved twoclass capacity due to an 80in fuselage stretch ahead of the wing from 138 ft 10 in 4232 m to 145 ft 6 in 4435 m with extensions to the fin and horizontal stabilizer extending the aircrafts length further30 the longer wing carried more fuel increasing range by 1600 miles 2600 km and allowing the aircraft to operate as true transoceanic aircraft the wing modifications included outboard and inboard inserts as well as a kink in the trailing edge to add area inboard14 takeoff weight was increased to 302000 lb 137000 kg initially and to 312000 lb 142000 kg with the higherrated jt4as and center section tanks its first flight was on january 11 1958 69 turbojet 707320s were delivered through january 1963 the first passengers being carried by pan am in august 1959 707420 conwaypowered boac 707436 at sydney airport in 1970 the 707420 was identical to the −320 but fitted with rollsroyce conway 508 rco12 turbofans or bypass turbojets as rollsroyce called them of 18000 lb 79 kn thrust each31 the first announced customer was lufthansa boacs controversial order was announced six months later but the british carrier got the first serviceready aircraft off the production line the british air registration board refused to give the aircraft a certificate of airworthiness citing insufficient lateral control excessive rudder forces and the ability to overrotate on takeoff stalling the wing on the ground a fault of the de havilland comet 1 boeing responded by adding 40 inches to the vertical stabilizer applying full instead of partial rudder boost and fitting an underfin to prevent overrotation these modifications except to the fin under the tail became standard on all 707 variants and were retrofitted to all earlier 707s the 37 420s were delivered to boac lufthansa airindia el al and varig through november 1963 lufthansa was the first to carry passengers in march 1960 707320b a boeing 707320b of pan american world airways in 1979 the 707320b had the application of the jt3d turbofan to the intercontinental but with aerodynamic refinements the wing was modified from the −320 by adding a second inboard kink a dogtoothed leading edge and curved lowdrag wingtips instead of the earlier blunt ones14 these wingtips increased overall wingspan by 30 ft takeoff gross weight was increased to 328000 lb 149000 kg the 175 707320b aircraft were all newbuild no original −320 models were converted to fan engines in civilian use first service was june 1962 with pan am the 707320b advanced is an improved version of the −320b adding the threesection leadingedge flaps already seen on the −320c these reduced takeoff and landing speeds and altered the lift distribution of the wing allowing the ventral fin found on earlier 707s to be deleted from 1965 320bs had the uprated −320c undercarriage allowing the same 335000 lb 152000 kg mtow these were often identified as 707320bah 707320c ecuatoriana de aviación 707321c in january 1987 the 707320c has a convertible passenger–freight configuration which became the most widely produced variant of the 707 the 707320c added a strengthened floor and a new cargo door to the −320b model the wing was fitted with threesection leadingedge flaps which allowed the deletion of the underfin three hundred and thirtyfive of these variants were built including a small number with jt3d7 engines 19000 lb or 846 kn takeoff thrust and a takeoff gross weight of 335000 lb 152000 kg ironically most −320cs were delivered as passenger aircraft airlines hoping that the cargo door would increase secondhand values the addition of two additional emergency exits one on either side aft of the wing raised the maximum passenger capacity to a theoretical 219 only a few aircraft were delivered as pure freighters one of the final orders was by the iranian government for 14 7073j9c aircraft capable of vip transportation communication and inflight refuelling tasks 707700 the 707700 was a test aircraft used to study the feasibility of using cfm international cfm56 engines on a 707 airframe and possibly retrofitting existing aircraft with the engine after testing in 1979 n707qt the last commercial 707 airframe was restored to 707320c configuration and delivered to the moroccan air force as a tanker aircraft via a civilian order boeing abandoned the retrofit program since it felt it would be a threat to the boeing 757 program the information gathered from testing led to the eventual retrofitting of cfm56 engines to the usaf c135kc135r models and some military versions of the 707 also used the cfm56 the douglas dc8 super 70 series with cfm56 engines was developed and extended the dc8s life in a stricter noise regulatory environment so more dc8s than 707s are in service nowcitation needed other variants the 707620 was a proposed domestic rangestretched variant of the 707320b the 707620 was to carry around 200 passengers while retaining several aspects of the 707320b it would have been delivered around 1968 and would have also been boeings answer to the stretched douglas dc8 series 60 had the 707620 been built it would have cost around us800000032 however engineers discovered that a longer fuselage and wing meant a painstaking redesign of the wing and landinggear structures rather than spend money on upgrading the 707 engineer joe sutter stated the company decided spending money on the 707 wasnt worth it the project was cancelled in 1966 in favor of the newer boeing 74733 the 707820 was a proposed intercontinental stretched variant of the 707320b it was to be powered by four pratt whitney jt3d15 turbofan engines and would have had a 10foot 30 m extension in wingspan two variations were proposed the 707820505 model and the 707820506 model the 505 model would have had a fuselage 45 feet 14 m longer than the 707320b and would have carried 209 passengers in mixedclass configuration and 260 passengers in alleconomy configuration the 506 model would have had a fuselage 55 feet 17 m longer than the 707320b and would have carried 225 passengers in mixed class configuration and 279 passengers in all economy configuration like the 707620 the 707820 was also set to compete with the stretched dc8s the design was being pitched to american twa boac and pan am at the time of its proposal in early 196534 the 707820 would have cost us1000000032 like the 707620 the 707820 would have required a massive structural redesign
