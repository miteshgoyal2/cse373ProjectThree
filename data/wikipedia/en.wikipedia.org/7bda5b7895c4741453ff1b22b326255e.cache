fewest dropped callsedit during the first quarter of 2006 telephia reported that during an extensive nationwide test of major wireless carriers in 350 metropolitan markets around the country cingular dropped the fewest number of calls across the country in turn cingular began aggressively advertising the allover network citing telephia as the leading independent research company telephias report was in stark contrast to the consumers union publication consumer reports based on a survey of 50000 of its members in 18 cities which criticized cingular for static and dropped calls45 furthermore jd power and associates consistently ranked cingular at or near the bottom of every geographical region in its 2006 wireless call quality study which is based on a smaller survey of 23000 wireless users this campaign had to come to an abrupt end telephia which tests wireless networks by making over 6 million calls per year in what it claims is the worlds largest wireless network test program initially refused to provide details on its study and a spokesman for the company has said according to the boston globe that cingular shouldnt have even mentioned the companys name to a reporter46 the research company later stated that cingular did indeed have a statistically significant lower droppedcall rate than the competition across some markettime period groupings but that telephia had no knowledge of the specific methodology markets time periods or statistical thresholds that cingular used for its lowest dropped call claim47 while att has abandoned its verbal claim of the fewest dropped calls in its commercials it continues to show situations where two persons are speaking with each other on their phones and one of the users call drops att now states we are still continuing to run ads that emphasize the importance of not dropping calls that campaign is continuing48 apple iphoneedit on june 29 2007 the apple iphone was introduced to the united states market and it made

for the iphone and that it lacked a sufficient number of cell towers to meet the heavy data demands imposed upon the network by iphone users59 sales of the popular iphone resumed december 30 200960 this incident has revived speculation that atts wireless network is not up to the demands of the current generation of 3g smartphones5761 the official att statement is that a large amount of
