on wikidata paranoia is an instinct or thought process believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety or fear often to the point of delusion and irrationality1 paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory or beliefs of conspiracy concerning a perceived threat towards oneself eg everyone is out to get me which is an american parochial phrase paranoia is distinct from phobias which also involve irrational fear but usually no blame making false accusations and the general distrust of others also frequently accompany paranoia for example an incident most people would view as an accident or coincidence a paranoid person might believe was intentional paranoia is a central symptom of psychosis2 it is also a matter of personal tolerance for the individual that might be in

typically have a biased perception of reality often exhibiting more hostile beliefs3 a paranoid person may view someone elses accidental behavior as though it is with intent or threatening an investigation of a nonclinical paranoid population found that feeling powerless and depressed isolating oneself and relinquishing activities are characteristics that could be associated with those exhibiting more frequent paranoia4 some scientists have created different subtypes for the various symptoms of paranoia including erotic persecutory litigious and exalted5 due to the suspicious and troublesome personality traits of paranoia it is unlikely that someone with paranoia will thrive in interpersonal relationships most commonly paranoid individuals tend to be of a single status6 according to some research there is a hierarchy for paranoia the least common types of paranoia at the very top of the hierarchy would be those involving more serious threats social anxiety is at the bottom of this hierarchy as the most frequently exhibited level of paranoia7 causesedit social and environmentaledit social circumstances appear to be highly influential on paranoid beliefs based on data collected by means of a mental health survey distributed to residents of ciudad juárez chihuahua in mexico and el paso texas in the united states paranoid beliefs seem to be associated with feelings of powerlessness and victimization enhanced by social situations potential causes of these effects included a sense of believing in external control and mistrust which can be strengthened by lower socioeconomic status those living in a lower socioeconomic status may feel less in control of their own lives in addition this study explains that females have the tendency to believe in external control at a higher rate than males potentially making females more susceptible to mistrust and the effects of socioeconomic status on paranoia8 emanuel messinger reports that surveys have revealed that those exhibiting paranoia can evolve from parental relationships and distrustworthy environments these environments could include being very disciplinary stringent and unstable it was even noted that indulging and pampering thereby impressing the child that he is something special and warrants special privileges can be contributing backgrounds9 experiences likely to enhance or manifest the symptoms of paranoia include increased rates of disappointment stress and a hopeless state of mind10 discrimination has also been reported as a potential predictor of paranoid delusions such reports that paranoia seemed to appear more in older patients that had experienced higher levels of discrimination throughout their lives in addition to this it has been noted that immigrants are quite susceptible to forms of psychosis this could be due to the aforementioned effects of discriminatory events and humiliation11 psychologicaledit while many more recent theories have been offered on the causes of delusional paranoia lake hypothesized that two common moodbased symptoms grandiosity and guilt may underlie functional paranoia12 colbi 1981 defined paranoid cognition in terms of persecutory delusions and false beliefs whose propositional content clusters around ideas of being harassed threatened harmed subjugated persecuted accused mistreated wronged tormented disparaged vilified and so on by malevolent others either specific individuals or groups p 518 three components of paranoid cognition have been identified by robins post a suspicions without enough basis that others are exploiting harming or deceiving them b preoccupation with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends or associates c reluctance to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against them 1997 p 3 paranoid cognition has been conceptualized by clinical psychology almost exclusively in terms of psychodynamic constructs and dispositional variables from this point of view paranoid cognition is a manifestation of an intrapsychic conflictdisturbance for instance colby 1981 suggested that the biases of blaming others for one’s problems serve to alleviate the distress produced by the feeling of being humiliated and helps to repudiate the belief that the self is to blame for such incompetence this intrapsychic perspective emphasize that the cause of paranoid cognitions are inside the head of the people social perceiver and dismiss the fact that paranoid cognition may be related with the social context in which such cognitions are embedded this point is extremely relevant because when origins of distrust and suspicion two components of paranoid cognition are studied many researchers have accentuated the importance of social interaction particularly when social interaction has gone awry even more a model of trust development pointed out that trust increase or decrease as a function of the cumulative history of interaction between two or more persons13 another relevant difference can be discerned among “’pathological and nonpathological forms of trust and distrust”’ according to deutsch the main difference is that nonpathological forms are flexible and responsive to changing circumstances pathological forms reflect exaggerated perceptual biases and judgmental predispositions that can arise and perpetuate them are reflexively caused errors similar to a selffulfilling prophecy it has been suggested that a ‘hierarchy’ of paranoia exists extending from mild social evaluative concerns through ideas of social reference to persecutory beliefs concerning mild moderate and severe threat14 physicaledit a paranoid reaction may be caused from a decline in brain circulation as a result of high blood pressure or hardening of the arterial walls9 based on data obtained by the dutch nemisis project in 2005 there was an association between impaired hearing and the onset of symptoms of psychosis which was based on a fiveyear follow up some older studies have actually declared that a state of paranoia can be produced in patients that were under a hypnotic state of deafness this idea however generated much skepticism during its time15 mechanismsedit abnormal reasoningedit many researcherswho believe that individuals with paranoia have some sort of cognitive deficit or impairment in reasoning ability or lack social credibility studies have shown that there may not be a direct relationship between the impairments and psychotic delusions but they rather effect other areas of an individuals life such as social circumstances which can be important factors about delusionswho other researchers have shown that cognitive abilities may be altered such as when cameras or recordings are involved16 this phenomenon appears to be a common theme among those exhibiting psychotic delusions an investigation involving one hundred delusional patients did indeed reveal that these individuals may have a tendency to jump to conclusions rather than look for other potential information17 anomalous perceptual experiencesedit a very prominent example of this theory is the capgras delusion or syndrome named after the psychiatrist joseph capgras18 this involves an individual perceiving that a certain important person within their life has been taken over by an impersonator ellis and young 1990 report that the capgras delusion may be a result of an impaired ability of recognition such as brain damage15 those suffering from the capgras syndrome tend to have more suspicious personalities and have unusual visualizations about the world and surrounding environments19 hyperacute attention is said to be more common in those with paranoia by being able to attend to unfavorable emotions at a higher level it is also likely that because paranoid personalities focus on threatening events and believe that most intentions are against them they will be more inclined to recognize these behaviors more frequently16 motivational factorsedit the attribution model has been well talked about regarding paranoid or delusional individuals the idea is that they like to assign issues to external events a motivation behind this characteristic may involve the need for that person to develop a better selfimage and maintain selfconfidence there have been debates about whether or not paranoid individuals are more likely to have a low or high selfperception and results have been generated for both of these hypotheses20 researchers have made a distinction between positive selfesteem and negative selfesteem revealing that paranoid delusional individuals have more of a negative selfevaluation21 diagnosisedit in the dsmivtr paranoia is diagnosed in the form of22 paranoid personality disorder23 f600 paranoid schizophrenia a subtype of schizophrenia f200 the persecutory type of delusional disorder which is also called querulous paranoia when the focus is to remedy some injustice by legal action24 f220 according to clinical psychologist p j mckenna as a noun paranoia denotes a disorder which has been argued in and out of existence and whose clinical features course boundaries and virtually every other aspect of which is controversial employed as an adjective paranoid has become attached to a diverse set of presentations from paranoid schizophrenia through paranoid depression to paranoid personality—not to mention a motley collection of paranoid psychoses reactions and states—and this is to restrict discussion to functional disorders even when abbreviated down to the prefix para the term crops up causing trouble as the contentious but stubbornly persistent concept of paraphrenia25 at least 50 of the diagnosed cases of schizophrenia experience delusions of reference and delusions of persecution2627 paranoia perceptions and behavior may be part of many mental illnesses such as depression and dementia but they are more prevalent in three mental disorders paranoid schizophrenia delusional disorder persecutory type and paranoid personality disorder historyedit the word paranoia comes from the greek παράνοια paranoia madness28 and that from παρά para beside by29 and νόος noos mind30 the term was used to describe a mental illness in which a delusional belief is the sole or most prominent feature in this definition the belief does not have to be persecutory to be classified as paranoid so any number of delusional beliefs can be classified as paranoiacitation needed for example a person who has the sole delusional belief that he is an important religious figure would be classified by kraepelin as having pure paranoia according to michael phelan padraig wright and julian stern 200031 paranoia and paraphrenia are debated entities that were detached from dementia praecox by kraepelin who explained paranoia as a continuous systematized delusion arising much later in life with no presence of either hallucinations or a deteriorating course paraphrenia as an identical syndrome to paranoia but with hallucinations even at the present time a delusion need not be suspicious or fearful to be classified as paranoid a person might be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia without delusions of persecution simply because their delusions refer mainly to themselves relations to violenceedit it has generally been agreed upon that individuals with paranoid delusions will have the tendency to take action based on their beliefs32 more research is needed on the particular types of actions that are pursued based on paranoid delusions some researchers have made attempts to distinguish the different variations of actions brought on as a result of delusions wessely et al 1993 did just this by studying individuals with delusions of which more than half had reportedly taken action or behaved as a result of these delusions however the overall actions were not of a violent nature in most of the informants the authors note that other studies such as one by taylor 1985 have shown that violent behaviors were more common in certain types of paranoid individuals mainly those considered to be offensive such as prisoners33 other researchers have found associations between childhood abusive behaviors and the appearance of violent behaviors in psychotic individuals this could be a result of their inability to cope with aggression as well as other people especially when constantly attending to potential threats in their environment34 the attention to threat itself has been proposed as one of the major contributors of violent actions in paranoid people although there has been much deliberation about this as well35 other studies have shown that there may only be certain types of delusions that promote any violent behaviors persecutory delusions seem to be one of these36 having resentful emotions towards others and the inability to be able to understand what other people are feeling seem to have an association with violence in paranoid individuals this was based on a study of paranoid schizophrenics one of the common mental disorders that exhibit paranoid symptoms theory of mind capabilities in relation to empathy the results of this study revealed specifically that although the violent patients were more successful at the higher level theory of mind tasks they were not as good at being able to interpret others emotions or claims37 paranoid social cognitionedit social psychological research has proposed a mild form of paranoid cognition paranoid social cognition that has its origins in social determinants more than intrapsychic conflict3839404142 this perspective states that in milder forms paranoid cognitions may be very common among normal individuals for instance it is not strange that people may exhibit in their daily life selfcentered thought such as they are being talked about suspiciousness about other’ intentions and assumptions of ill or hostility ie people may feel as if everything is going against them according to kramer 1998 these milder forms of paranoid cognition may be considered as an adaptive response to cope with or make sense of disturbing and threatening social environment paranoid cognition captures the idea that dysphoric selfconsciousness may be related with the position that people occupies within a social system this selfconsciousness conduces to a hypervigilant and ruminative mode to process social information that finally will stimulate a variety of paranoidlike forms of social misperception and misjudgment43 this model identifies four components that are essential to understand paranoid social cognition situational antecedents dysphoric selfconsciousness hypervigilance and rumination and judgmental biases situational antecedentsedit perceived social distinctiveness perceived evaluative scrutiny and uncertainty about the social standing perceived social distinctiveness according to the social identity theory44 people categorize themselves in terms of characteristics that made them unique or different from others under certain circumstances4544 gender ethnicity age or experience may become extremely relevant to explain people’s behavior when these attributes make them unique in a social group this distinctive attribute may have influence not only in how people are perceived but may also affect the way they perceive themselves for instance a young member in an organization interacting with more experienced colleagues may become more selfconscious because he may feel different in the group tending to overestimate the extent to which he is evaluated by others and constructing interaction with other members in a selfreferential way perceived evaluative scrutiny according to this model dysphoric selfconsciousness may increase when people feel under moderate or intensive evaluative social scrutiny for instance when an asymmetric relationship is analyzed as the relationship among a doctoral student and their advisors students tend to remember more behaviors and events that they interpret as affecting their level of trust in the relationship compared to their advisors suggesting that students are more willing to put attention to their advisor that the advisor are motivated to pay attention to them also students spent more time ruminating about the behaviors events and their relationship in generalcitation needed uncertainty about social standingthe knowledge about the social standing is another factor that may induce paranoid social cognition many researchers have argued that experiencing uncertainty about a social position in a social system constitutes an adverse psychological state one which people are highly motivated to reduce for instance a younger member in a social organization is more likely to experience uncertainty probabilistically about his social standing as compared to an older member in the same organization all else being fairly equal the chief difference is tenure time in service in which an experienced member of the organization is more comfortable and familiar with social norms and rules as a result of ones own moral ambivalences new members are prone to experience heightened selfawareness and hypervigilance and might interpret others behavior in a selfreferential waycitation needed dysphoric selfconsciousnessedit refers to an aversive form of heightened public selfconsciousness characterized by the feelings that one is under intensive evaluative scrutiny4046 becoming selftormenting will increase the odds of interpreting others behaviors in a selfreferential way according to this model it means that if one is dysphoric it could be because someone is watching and if someone is watching its because something must be wrong whatever the danger or fault may be the selftorment is projected onto the group hypervigilance and ruminationedit selfconsciousness was characterized as an aversive psychological state according to this model people experiencing selfconsciousness will be highly motivated to reduce it trying to make sense of what they are experiencing these attempts promote hyper vigilance and rumination in a circular relationship more hyper vigilance generates more rumination whereupon more rumination generates more hyper vigilance hyper vigilance can be thought of as a way to appraise threatening social information but in contrast to adaptive vigilance hyper vigilance will produce elevated levels of arousal fear anxiety and threat perception47 rumination is another possible response to threatening social information rumination can be related to the paranoid social cognition because it can increase negative thinking about negative events and evoke a pessimistic explanatory style judgmental biasesedit three main judgmental consequences have been identified39 the sinister attribution error this bias captures the tendency that social perceivers have to overattribute lack of trustworthiness to others the overly personalistic construal of social interaction refers to the inclination that paranoid perceiver has to interpret others’ action in a disproportional selfreferential way increasing the belief that he or she is target of others’ thoughts and actions a special kind of bias in the biased punctuation of social interaction which entail an overperception of causal linking among independent events the exaggerated perception of conspiracy refers to the disposition that the paranoid perceiver has to overattribute social coherence and coordination to others’ actions under this point of view the paranoid perceiver will attribute linkages among people who are engaged in independent actions see alsoedit wikiquote has quotations
