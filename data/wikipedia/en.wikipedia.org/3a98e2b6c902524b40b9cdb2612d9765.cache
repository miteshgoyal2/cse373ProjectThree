the pastor jedidiah morse 1761–1826 who was also a geographer and his wife elizabeth ann finley breese 1766–18281 his father was a great preacher of the calvinist faith and supporter of the american federalist party he thought it helped preserve puritan traditions strict observance of sabbath among other things and believed in the federalist support of an alliance with britain and a strong central government morse strongly believed in education within a federalist framework alongside the instillation of calvinist virtues morals and prayers for his first son after attending phillips academy in andover massachusetts samuel morse went on to yale college to receive instruction in the subjects of religious philosophy mathematics and science of horses while at yale he attended lectures on electricity from benjamin silliman and jeremiah day and was a member of the society of brothers in unity he supported himself by painting in 1810 he graduated from yale with phi beta kappa honors painting selfportrait of morse in 1812 national portrait gallery morse expressed some of his calvinist beliefs in his painting landing of the pilgrims through the depiction of simple clothing as well as the peoples austere facial features his image captured the psychology of the federalists calvinists from england brought to north america ideas of religion and government thus linking the two countries this work attracted the attention of the notable artist washington allston allston wanted morse to accompany him to england to meet the artist benjamin west allston arranged — with morses father — a threeyear stay for painting study in england the two men set sail aboard the libya on july 15 1811 in england morse perfected his painting techniques under allstons watchful eye by the end of 1811 he gained admittance to the royal academy at the academy he was moved by the art of the renaissance and paid close attention to the works of michelangelo and raphael after observing and practicing life drawing and absorbing its anatomical demands the young artist produced his masterpiece the dying hercules he first made a sculpture as a study for the painting dying hercules morses early masterpiece to some the dying hercules seemed to represent a political statement against the british and also the american federalists the muscles symbolized the strength of the young and vibrant united states versus the british and britishamerican supporters during morses time in britain the americans and british were engaged in the war of 1812 both societies were conflicted over loyalties antifederalist americans aligned themselves with the french abhorred the british and believed a strong central government to be inherently dangerous to democracy as the war raged on morses letters to his parents became more antifederalist in tone in one such letter morse wrote i assert that the federalists in the northern states have done more injury to their country by their violent opposition measures than a french alliance could their proceedings are copied into the english papers read before parliament and circulated through their country and what do they say of them they call them federalists cowards a base set say they are traitors to their country and ought to be hanged like traitorscitation needed jonas platt new york politician by morse oil on canvas 1828 brooklyn museum although jedidiah morse did not change samuels political views he continued as an influence critics believe that the elder morses calvinist ideas are integral to morses judgment of jupiter another significant work completed in england jupiter is shown in a cloud accompanied by his eagle with his hand spread above the parties and he is pronouncing judgment marpessa with an expression of compunction and shame is throwing herself into the arms of her husband idas who tenderly loved marpessa is eagerly rushing forward to receive her while apollo stares with surprise critics have suggested that jupiter represents gods omnipotence — watching every move that is made some call the portrait a moral teaching by morse on infidelity although marpessa fell victim she realized that her eternal salvation was important and desisted from her wicked ways apollo shows no remorse for what he did but stands with a puzzled look many american paintings throughout the early nineteenth century had religious themes and morse was an early exemplar of this judgment of jupiter allowed morse to express his support of antifederalism while maintaining his strong spiritual convictions benjamin west sought to present the jupiter at another royal academy exhibition but morses time had run out he left england on august 21 1815 to return to the united states and begin his fulltime career as a painter the decade 1815–1825 marked significant growth in morses work as he sought to capture the essence of americas culture and life he painted the federalist former president john adams 1816 the federalists and antifederalists clashed over dartmouth college morse painted portraits of francis brown — the colleges president — and judge woodward 1817 who was involved in bringing the dartmouth case before the us supreme court morse maintained a studio at 94 tradd st charleston south carolina for a short period morse also sought commissions among the elite of charleston south carolina morses 1818 painting of mrs emma quash symbolized the opulence of charleston the young artist was doing well for himself between 1819 and 1821 morse went through great changes in his life including a decline in commissions due to the panic of 1819 unable to stop the rift within calvinism his father was forced to resign from his ministerial position which he had held for three decades the new branch that formed was the congregational unitarians morse considered them to be antifederalists as their beliefs were related to religious salvation although samuel morse respected his fathers religious opinions he sympathized with the unitarians among the converts to unitarianism were the prominent pickerings of portsmouth new hampshire whom morse had painted some critics thought his sympathies represented his own antifederalism morse was commissioned to paint president james monroe in 1820 he embodied jeffersonian democracy by favoring the common man over the aristocrat morse had moved to new haven his commissions for the hall of congress 1821 and a portrait of the marquis de lafayette 1825 engaged his sense of democratic nationalism the hall of congress was designed to capitalize on the success of françoismarius granets the capuchin chapel in rome which toured the united states extensively throughout the 1820s attracting audiences willing to pay the 25cent admission fee2 the chapel of the virgin at subiaco 1830 the artist chose to paint the house of representatives in a similar way with careful attention to architecture and dramatic lighting he also wished to select a uniquely american topic that would bring glory to the young nation his subject did just that showing american democracy in action he traveled to washington dc to draw the architecture of the new capitol and placed eighty individuals within the painting he chose to portray a night scene balancing the architecture of the rotunda with the figures and using lamplight to highlight the work pairs of people those who stood alone individuals bent over their desks working were each painted simply but with faces of character morse chose nighttime to convey that congress dedication to the principles of democracy transcended day the hall of congress failed to draw a crowd when exhibited in new york city in 1821 by contrast john trumbulls declaration of independence had won popular acclaim the previous year viewers may have felt that the architecture of the hall of congress overshadows the individuals making it hard to appreciate the drama of what was happening morse was honored to paint the marquis de lafayette the leading french supporter of the american revolution he felt compelled to paint a grand portrait of the man who helped to establish a free and independent america he features lafayette against a magnificent sunset he has positioned lafayette to the right of three pedestals one has a bust of benjamin franklin another of george washington and the third seems reserved for lafayette a peaceful woodland landscape below him symbolized american tranquility and prosperity as it approached the age of fifty the developing friendship between morse and lafayette and their discussions of the revolutionary war affected the artist after his return to new york city in 1826 he helped found the national academy of design in new york city he served as the academys president from 1826 to 1845 and again from 1861 to 1862 from 1830 to 1832 morse traveled and studied in europe to improve his painting skills visiting italy switzerland and france during his time in paris he developed a friendship with the writer james fennimore cooper3 as a project he painted miniature copies of 38 of the louvres famous paintings on a single canvas 6 ft x 9 ft which he entitled the gallery of the louvre he completed the work upon his return to the united states on a subsequent visit to paris in 1839 morse met louis daguerre he became interested in the latters daguerreotype—the first practical means of photography4 morse wrote a letter to the new york observer describing the invention which was published widely in the american press and provided a broad awareness of the new technology5 some

telegraph as noted in 1825 new york city had commissioned morse to paint a portrait of lafayette in washington dc while morse was painting a horse messenger delivered a letter from his father that read your dear wife is convalescent the next day he received a letter from his father detailing his wifes sudden death7 morse immediately left washington for his home at new haven leaving the portrait of lafayette unfinished by the time he arrived his wife had already been buried8 heartbroken that for days he was unaware of his wifes failing health and her death he decided to explore a means of rapid long distance communication9 while returning by ship from europe in 1832 morse encountered charles thomas jackson of boston a man who was well schooled in electromagnetism witnessing various experiments with jacksons electromagnet morse developed the concept of a singlewire telegraph he set aside his painting the gallery of the louvre10 the original morse telegraph submitted with his patent application is part of the collections of the national museum of american history at the smithsonian institution11 in time the morse code which he developed would become the primary language of telegraphy in the world it is still the standard for rhythmic transmission of data meanwhile william cooke and professor charles wheatstone had learned of the wilhelm weber and carl gauss electromagnetic telegraph in 1833 they had reached the stage of launching a commercial telegraph prior to morse despite starting later in england cooke became fascinated by electrical telegraphy in 1836 four years after morse aided by his greater financial resources cooke abandoned his primary subject of anatomy and built a small electrical telegraph within three weeks wheatstone also was experimenting with telegraphy and most importantly understood that a single large battery would not carry a telegraphic signal over long distances he theorized that numerous small batteries were far more successful and efficient in this task wheatstone was building on the primary research of joseph henry an american physicist cooke and wheatstone formed a partnership and patented the electrical telegraph in may 1837 and within a short time had provided the great western railway with a 13mile 21 km stretch of telegraph however within a few years cooke and wheatstones multiplewire signaling method would be overtaken by morses cheaper method in an 1848 letter to a friend morse describes how vigorously he fought to be called the sole inventor of the electromagnetic telegraph despite the previous inventions12 i have been so constantly under the necessity of watching the movements of the most unprincipled set of pirates i have ever known that all my time has been occupied in defense in putting evidence into something like legal shape that i am the inventor of the electromagnetic telegraph would you have believed it ten years ago that a question could be raised on that subject — s morse13 relays leonard gale who helped morse achieve the technological breakthrough of getting the telegraphic signal to travel long distances over wire morse encountered the problem of getting a telegraphic signal to carry over more than a few hundred yards of wire his breakthrough came from the insights of professor leonard gale who taught chemistry at new york university he was a personal friend of joseph henry with gales help morse introduced extra circuits or relays at frequent intervals and was soon able to send a message through ten miles 16 km of wire this was the great breakthrough he had been seeking14 morse and gale were soon joined by alfred vail an enthusiastic young man with excellent skills insights and money at the speedwell ironworks in morristown new jersey on january 11 1838 morse and vail made the first public demonstration of the electric telegraph although morse and alfred vail had done most of the research and development in the ironworks facilities they chose a nearby factory house as the demonstration site without the repeatera the range of the telegraph was limited to two miles 32 km and the inventors had pulled two miles 32 km of wires inside the factory house through an elaborate scheme the first public transmission with the message a patient waiter is no loser was witnessed by a mostly local crowd15 morse traveled to washington dc in 1838 seeking federal sponsorship for a telegraph line but was not successful he went to europe seeking both sponsorship and patents but in london discovered that cooke and wheatstone had already established priority after his return to the us morse finally gained financial backing by maine congressman francis ormand jonathan smith federal support morse made his last trip to washington dc in december 1842 stringing wires between two committee rooms in the capitol and sent messages back and forth to demonstrate his telegraph system16 congress appropriated 30000 in 1843 for construction of an experimental 38mile 61 km telegraph line between washington dc and baltimore along the rightofway of the baltimore and ohio railroad17 an impressive demonstration occurred on may 1 1844 when news of the whig partys nomination of henry clay for us president was telegraphed from the partys convention in baltimore to the capitol building in washington17 the first telegraph office on may 24 1844 the line was officially opened as morse sent the nowfamous words what hath god wrought from the supreme court chamber in the basement of the us capitol building in washington dc to the bos mount clare station in baltimore18 annie ellsworth chose these words from the bible numbers 2323 her father us patent commissioner henry leavitt ellsworth had championed morses invention and secured early funding for it his telegraph could transmit thirty characters per minute19 in may 1845 the magnetic telegraph company was formed in order to build telegraph lines from new york city toward philadelphia boston buffalo new york and the mississippi20 telegraphic lines rapidly spread throughout the united states in the next few years with 12000 miles of wire laid by 1850 morse at one time adopted wheatstone and carl august von steinheils idea of broadcasting an electrical telegraph signal through a body of water or down steel railroad tracks or anything conductive he went to great lengths to win a lawsuit for the right to be called inventor of the telegraph and promoted himself as being an inventor but alfred vail also played an important role in the development of the morse code which was based on earlier codes for the electromagnetic telegraph patent morse with his recorder photograph taken by mathew brady in 1857 morse received a patent for the telegraph in 1847 at the old beylerbeyi palace the present beylerbeyi palace was built in 1861–1865 on the same location in istanbul which was issued by sultan abdülmecid who personally tested the new invention21 he was elected an associate fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 184922 the original patent went to the breese side of the family after the death of samuel morse in the 1850s morse went to copenhagen and visited the thorvaldsens museum where the sculptors grave is in the inner courtyard he was received by king frederick vii who decorated him with the order of the dannebrog morse expressed his wish to donate his portrait from 1830 to the king the thorvaldsen portrait today belongs to margrethe ii of denmark the morse telegraphic apparatus was officially adopted as the standard for european telegraphy in 1851 only the united kingdom with its extensive overseas empire kept the needle telegraph of cooke and wheatstoneb in 1858 morse introduced wired communication to latin america when he established a telegraph system in puerto rico then a spanish colony morses oldest daughter susan walker morse 1819–1885 would often visit her uncle charles pickering walker who owned the hacienda concordia in the town of guayama during one of her visits she met edward lind a danish merchant who worked in his brotherinlaws hacienda la henriqueta in the town of arroyo they later married24 lind purchased the hacienda from his sister when she became a widow morse who often spent his winters at the hacienda with his daughter and soninlaw set a twomile telegraph line connecting his soninlaws hacienda to their house in arroyo the line was inaugurated on march 1 1859 in a ceremony flanked by the spanish and american flags2526 the first words transmitted by samuel morse that day in puerto rico were puerto rico beautiful jewel when you are linked with the other jewels of the antilles in the necklace of the worlds telegraph yours will not shine less brilliantly in the crown of your queen24 there is an argument amongst historians that morse may have received the idea of a plausible telegraph from harrison gray dyar some eighteen years earlier than his patentc political views cover of foreign conspiracy against the liberties of the united states by samuel fb morse 1835 edition morse was a leader in the anticatholic and antiimmigration movement of the mid19th century in 1836 he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of new york under the antiimmigrant nativist partys banner receiving only 1496 votes when morse visited rome he allegedly refused to take his hat off in the presence of the pope morse worked to unite protestants against catholic institutions including schools wanted to forbid catholics from holding public office and promoted changing immigration laws to limit immigration from catholic countries on this topic he wrote we must first stop the leak in the ship through which muddy waters from without threaten to sink us28 he wrote numerous letters to the new york observer his brother sidney was the editor at the time urging people to fight the perceived catholic menace these were widely reprinted in other newspapers among other claims he believed that the austrian government and catholic aid organizations were subsidizing catholic immigration to the united states in order to gain control of the country29 in his foreign conspiracy against the liberties of the united states30 morse wrote surely american protestants freemen have discernment enough to discover beneath them the cloven foot of this subtle foreign heresy they will see that popery is now what it has ever been a system of the darkest political intrigue and despotism cloaking itself to avoid attack under the sacred name of religion they will be deeply impressed with the truth that popery is a political as well as a religious system that in this respect it differs totally from all other sects from all other forms of religion in the country31 in the 1850s morse became well known as a defender of slavery considering it to be sanctioned by god this was a position held by many southerners and others in his treatise an argument on the ethical position of slavery he wrote my creed on the subject of slavery is short slavery per se is not sin it is a social condition ordained from the beginning of the world for the wisest purposes benevolent and disciplinary by divine wisdom the mere holding of slaves therefore is a condition having per se nothing of moral character in it any more than the being a parent or employer or ruler32 marriages morse married lucretia pickering walker on september 29 1818 in concord new hampshire she died on february 7 1825 shortly after the birth of their third child susan b 1819 charles b 1823 james b 1825 he married his second wife sarah elizabeth griswold on august 10 1848 in utica new york and had four children samuel b 1849 cornelia b 1851 william b 1853 edward b 1857 later years litigation over telegraph patent in the united states morse held his telegraph patent for many years but it was both ignored and contested in 1853 the telegraph patent caseoreilly v morse came before the us supreme court where after very lengthy investigation chief justice roger b taney ruled that morse had been the first to combine the battery electromagnetism the electromagnet and the correct battery configuration into a workable practical telegraph33 however in spite of this clear ruling morse still received no official recognition from the united states government the supreme court did not accept all of morses claims the oreilly v morse case has become widely known among patent lawyers because the supreme court explicitly denied morses claim 834 for any and all use of the electromagnetic force for purposes of transmitting intelligible signals to any distance35 morses repeater circuit for telegraphy basis for supreme courts holding some claims of morses patent valid the supreme court sustained however morses claim to such telecommunication when effectuated by means of morses inventive repeater apparatus this was an electrical circuit in which a cascade of many sets comprising a relay and a battery were connected in series so that when each relay closed it closed a circuit to cause the next battery to power the succeeding relay as suggested in the accompanying figure this caused morses signal to pass along the cascade without degrading into noise as its amplitude decreased with the distance traveled each time the amplitude of the signal approaches the noise level the repeater in effect a nonlinear amplifier boosts the signal amplitude well above the noise level this use of repeaters permitted a message to be sent to great distances which was previously not feasible effect of repeaters the supreme court thus held that morse could properly claim a patent monopoly on the system or process of transmitting signals at any distance by means of the repeater circuitry indicated above but he could not properly claim a monopoly over any and all uses of electromagnetic force to transmit signals the apparatus limitation in the former type of claim limited the patent monopoly to what morse taught and gave the world the lack of that limitation in the latter type of claim ie claim 8 both gave morse more than was commensurate with what he had contributed to society and discouraged the inventive efforts of others who might come up with different andor better ways to send signals at a distance using the electromagnetic force36 the problem that morse faced37 and how he solved it is discussed in more detail in the article oreilly v morse in summary the solution as the supreme court stated was the repeater apparatus described in the preceding paragraphs the importance of this legal precedent in patent law cannot be overstated as it became the foundation of the law governing the eligibility of computer program implemented inventions as well as inventions implementing natural laws to be granted patents38 foreign recognition portrait of samuel f b morse taken by mathew brady in 1866 medals worn from wearers right to left top row nichan iftikhar ottoman order of the

catholic spain assisted by the american ambassador in paris the governments of europe were approached about their long neglect of morse while their countries were using his invention there was a widespread recognition that something must be done and in 1858 morse was awarded the sum of 400000 french francs equivalent to about 80000 at the time by the governments of france austria belgium the netherlands piedmont russia sweden tuscany and turkey each of which contributed a share according to the number of morse instruments in use in each country39 in 1858 he was also elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences transatlantic cable morse lent his support to cyrus west fields ambitious plan to construct the first transoceanic telegraph line morse had experimented with underwater telegraph circuits since 1842 he invested 10000 in fields atlantic telegraph company took a seat on its board of directors and was appointed honorary electrician40 in 1856 morse traveled to london to help charles tilston bright and edward whitehouse test a 2000milelength of spooled cable41 after the first two cablelaying attempts failed field reorganized the project removing morse from direct involvement42 though the cable broke three times during the third attempt it was successfully repaired and the first transatlantic telegraph messages were sent in 1858 the cable failed after just three months of use though field had to wait out the civil war the cable laid in 1866 proved more durable and the era of reliable transatlantic telegraph service had begun in addition to the telegraph morse invented a marblecutting machine that could carve threedimensional sculptures in marble or stone he could not patent it however because of an existing 1820 thomas blanchard design nativist views last years and death samuel morse gave large sums to charity he also became interested in the relationship of science and religion and provided the funds to establish a lectureship on the relation of the bible to the sciences43 though he was rarely awarded any royalties for the later uses and implementations of his inventions he was able to live comfortably he died in new york city on april 2 187244 and was interred at greenwood cemetery in brooklyn new york by the time of his death his estate was valued at some 500000 10 million today45 honors and awards statue

antiquarian society in 181546 despite honors and financial awards received from foreign countries there was no such recognition in the us until he neared the end of his life when on june 10 1871 a bronze statue of samuel morse was unveiled in central park new york city an engraved portrait of morse appeared on the reverse side of the united states twodollar bill silver certificate series of

electromagnetism as a motive power and yet not produce the described effect that is print at a distance intelligible marks or signs to produce that effect it must be combined with and passed through and operate upon certain complicated and delicate machinery adjusted and arranged upon philosophical principles and prepared by the highest mechanical skill and it is the high praise of professor morse that he has been able by a new combination of known powers of which electromagnetism is one to discover a method by which intelligible marks or signs may be printed at a distance and for the method or process thus discovered he is entitled to a patent but he has not discovered that the electromagnetic current used as motive power in any other method and with any other combination will do as well see oreilly v morse 56 us 62 113 120 1853 the supreme court said the great difficulty in their way was the fact that the galvanic current however strong in the beginning became gradually weaker as it advanced on the wire and was not strong enough to produce a mechanical effect after a certain distance had been traversed 56 us at 107 see for example alice corporation pty ltd v cls bank
