timberlake210 and the 1960s acts the shirelles doris troy and the beach boys211 swifts fifth album the popfocused 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts including annie lennox phil collins and like a prayerera madonna212 musical style swifts les paul guitar and cordless microphone on exhibit in the artist gallery of the musical instrument museum of phoenix in arizona swifts music contains elements of pop pop rock and country213 she selfidentified as a country artist until the 2014 release of 1989 which she described as a sonically cohesive pop album214 rolling stone asserted swift might get played on the country station but shes one of the few genuine rock stars weve got these days215 the new york times noted there isnt much in ms swifts music to indicate country—a few banjo strums a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage a bedazzled guitar—but theres something in her winsome vulnerable delivery thats unique to nashville216 according to the guardian swift cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a scandinavian pop factory217 swifts vocals have been described by sophie schillaci from the hollywood reporter as sweet but soft218 in studio recordings the los angeles times identified swifts defining vocal gesture as the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow giving her beloved girltime hits their air of easy intimacy219 rolling stone in a speak now review remarked swifts voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough220 in another review of speak now the village voice noted that her phrasing was previously bland and muddled but thats changed she can still sound strained and thin and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy but shes learned how to make words sound like what they mean221 the hollywood reporter opines that her live vocals are fine but they do not match those of her peers218 in 2009 they were also described as flat thin and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt222 however swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with autotune223 in an interview with the new yorker swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter i write songs and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across22 a writer for the tennessean conceded in 2010 that swift is not the best technical singer but described her as the best communicator that weve got224 swifts vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has put a lot of work into improving it225 it was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons226 she has said that she only feels nervous performing if im not sure what the audience thinks of me like at award shows227 songwriting swift uses her life experiences as an inspiration in her work228 in her songs swift often addresses the anonymous crushes of her high school years and celebrities229 swift frequently criticizes exboyfriends230 an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by the village voice being told what songs mean is like having a really pushy professor and it imperils a true appreciation of swifts talent which is not confessional but dramatic231 however new york believes the media scrutiny over her decision to mine her personal life for music … is sexist inasmuch as its not asked of her male peers232 the singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual and that they are sometimes based on observations233 aside from her liner note clues swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically because these are real people you try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus234 swift during her speak now world tour in pittsburgh 2011 for a female to write about her feelings and then be portrayed as some clingy insane desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her i think thats taking something that potentially should be celebrated—a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way—thats taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist — swift in response to criticism of her songwriting235 the guardian has praised swift for writing about teenage years with a kind of wistful sepiatoned nostalgia over the course of her first two albums217 new york has remarked that many singersongwriters have made great records as teens but none made great records so explicitly about their teens the magazine has also compared her work to brian wilson236 in fearless swift featured fairy tale imagery and explored the disconnect between fairy tales and the reality of love237 her later albums address more adult relationships197 in addition to romance and love swifts songs have discussed parentchild relationships friendships238239 alienation fame and career ambitions186 swift frequently includes a tossedoff phrase to suggest large and serious things that wont fit in the song things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative240 rolling stone describes swift as a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for versechorusbridge architecture241 according to the village voice she uses thirdverse point of view reversals frequently240 in terms of imagery repetition is evident in swifts songwriting in the guardians words she spends so much time kissin in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasnt developed trenchfoot217 slant magazine adds to swifts credit she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of her fourth album242 although reviews of swifts work are almost uniformly positive the new yorker has said she is generally portrayed more as a skilled technician than as a
