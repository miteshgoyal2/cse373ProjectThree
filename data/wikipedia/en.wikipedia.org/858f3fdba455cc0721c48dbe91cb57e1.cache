united states by appearing on two or more of the record charts which track differing musical styles or genres1 if the second chart combines genres such as a hot 100 list the work is not a crossover in some contexts the term crossover can have negative connotations associated with cultural appropriation implying the dilution of a musics distinctive qualities to appeal to mass tastes for example in the early years of rock and roll many songs originally recorded by africanamerican musicians were rerecorded by white artists such as pat boone in a more toneddown style often with changed lyrics that lacked the hard edge of the original versions these covers were popular with a much broader audience2 in practice crossover frequently results from the appearance of the music in question in a film soundtrack for instance sacred harp music experienced a spurt of crossover popularity as a result of its appearance in the 2003 film cold mountain and bluegrass music experienced a revival due to the

with playwright bertolt brecht on projects such as the threepenny opera nevertheless gave an early indication of his interest in writing in an easily accessible popular musical style this trend in his work came to full fruition in later life in the united states where he switched primarily to writing the scores for broadway musicals such as knickerbocker holiday and one touch of venus some of the
