chest compressions often with artificial ventilation in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest it is recommended in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing for example agonal respirations1 cpr involves chest compressions for adults between 5 cm 20 in and 6 cm 24 in deep and at a rate of at least 100 to 120 per minute2 the rescuer may also provide artificial ventilation by either exhaling air into the subjects mouth or nose mouthtomouth resuscitation or using a device that pushes air into the subjects lungs mechanical ventilation current recommendations place emphasis on early and highquality chest compressions over artificial ventilation a simplified cpr method involving chest compressions only is recommended for untrained rescuers3 in children however only doing compressions may result in worse outcomes4 cpr alone is unlikely to restart the heart its main purpose is to restore partial flow of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart the objective is to delay tissue death and to extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage administration of an electric shock to the subjects heart termed defibrillation is usually needed in order to restore a viable or perfusing heart rhythm defibrillation is effective only for certain heart rhythms namely ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia rather than asystole or pulseless electrical activity cpr may succeed in inducing a heart rhythm that may be shockable in general cpr is continued until the person has a return of spontaneous circulation rosc or is declared dead5 play media

medical usesedit cpr is indicated for any person unresponsive with no breathing or breathing only in occasional agonal gasps as it is most likely that they are in cardiac arrest6s643 if a person still has a pulse but is not breathing respiratory arrest artificial ventilations may be more appropriate but due to the difficulty people have in accurately assessing the presence or absence of a pulse cpr guidelines recommend that lay persons should not be instructed to check the pulse while giving healthcare professionals the option to check a pulse7 in those with cardiac arrest due to trauma cpr is considered futile but still recommended8 correcting the underlying cause such as a pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade may help8 effectivenessedit type of arrest rosc survival source witnessed

cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserving the body for defibrillation and advanced life support even in the case of a nonshockable rhythm such as pulseless electrical activity pea where defibrillation is not indicated effective cpr is no less important used alone cpr will result in few complete recoveries though the outcome without cpr is almost uniformly fatal12 studies have shown that immediate cpr followed by defibrillation within 3–5 minutes of sudden vf cardiac arrest dramatically improves survival in cities such as seattle where cpr training is widespread and defibrillation by ems personnel follows quickly the survival rate is about 20 percent for all causes and as high as 57 percent if a witnessed shockable arrest13 in cities such as new york without those advantages the survival rate is only 5 percent for witnessed shockable arrest14 in adults compressiononly cpr by bystanders appears to be better than chest compressions with rescue breathing15 compressiononly cpr may be less effective in children than in adults as cardiac arrest in children is more likely to have a noncardiac cause in a 2010 prospective study of cardiac arrest in children age 1–17 for arrests with a noncardiac cause provision by bystanders of conventional cpr with rescue breathing yielded a favorable neurological outcome at one month more often than did compressiononly cpr or 554 for arrests with a cardiac cause in this cohort there was no difference between the two techniques or 12016 this is consistent with american heart association guidelines for parents17 when done by trained responders 30 compressions interrupted by two breaths appears to have a slightly better result than continuous chest compressions with breaths being delivered while compressions are ongoing15 there is a higher proportion of patients who achieve spontaneous circulation rosc where their heart starts beating on its own again than ultimately survive to be discharged from hospital see table above this may be due to medical staff being ultimately unable to address the cause of the cardiac arrest to other comorbidities or to the patient being gravely ill in more than one way ultimately only 5–10 of patients in cardiac arrest will survive after an attempted resuscitation18 complicationsedit while cpr is a last resort intervention without which a person without a pulse will all but certainly die the physical nature of how cpr is performed does lead to complications that may need to be rectified common complications due to cpr are rib fractures sternal fractures bleeding in the anterior mediastinum heart contusion19 hemopericardium202122 upper airway complications damage to the abdominal viscera lacerations of the liver and spleen fat emboli pulmonary complications pneumothorax hemothorax lung contusions2324 the most common injuries sustained from cpr are rib fractures with literature suggesting an incidence between 13 and 97 and sternal fractures with an incidence between 1 to 4325 whilst these iatrogenic injuries can require further intervention assuming the patient survives the cardiac arrest only 05 of them are lifethreatening in their own right24 the type and frequency of injury can be affected by factors such as gender and age for instance women have a higher risk of sternal fractures than men and risk for rib fractures increases significantly with age26 children and infants have a low risk of rib fractures during cpr with an incidence less than 2 although when they do occur they are usually anterior and multiple252728 where cpr is performed in error by a bystander on a person not in cardiac arrest around 2 have injury as a result although 12 experienced discomfort29 methodsedit cpr technique as demonstrated on a dummy mouthtomouth resuscitation cpr training cpr is being administered while a second rescuer prepares for defibrillation in 2010 the american heart association and international liaison committee on resuscitation updated their cpr guidelines6s64030 the importance of high quality cpr sufficient rate and depth without excessively ventilating was emphasized6s640 the order of interventions was changed for all age groups except newborns from airway breathing chest compressions abc to chest compressions airway breathing cab6s642 an exception to this recommendation is for those believed to be in a respiratory arrest airway obstruction drug overdose etc6s642 the most important aspect of cpr are few interruptions of chest compressions a sufficient speed and depth of compressions completely relaxing pressure between compressions and not ventilating too much31 it is unclear if a few minutes of cpr before defibrillation results in different outcomes than immediate defibrillation32 compressions with rescue breathsedit a universal compression to ventilation ratio of 302 is recommended for adults338 with children if at least 2 trained rescuers are present a ratio of 152 is preferred338 in newborns a rate of 31 is recommended unless a cardiac cause is known in which case a 152 ratio is reasonable6s647 if an advanced airway such as an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway is in place artificial ventilation should occur without pauses in compressions at a rate of 8–10 per minute34 the recommended order of interventions is chest compressions airway breathing or cab in most situations6s642 with a compression rate of at least 100 per minute in all groups338 recommended compression depth in adults and children is at least 5 cm 2 inches and in infants it is 4 centimetres 16 in338 as of 2010 the resuscitation council uk still recommends abc for children35 as it can be difficult to determine the presence or absence of a pulse the pulse check has been removed for lay providers and should not be performed for more than 10 seconds by healthcare providers338 in adults rescuers should use two hands for the chest compressions while in children they should use one and with infants two fingers index and middle fingers36 compression onlyedit for adults with cardiac arrest compressiononly handsonly or cardiocerebral resuscitation cpr which involves chest compressions without artificial ventilation is recommended as the method of choice for the untrained rescuer or those who are not proficient as it is easier to perform and instructions are easier to give over a phone6s6436s64333837 in adults with outofhospital cardiac arrest compressiononly cpr by the lay public has an equal or higher success rate than standard cpr3738 it is hoped that the use of compressiononly delivery will increase the chances of the lay public delivering cpr39 compressiononly cpr is not as good for children who are more likely to have cardiac arrest from respiratory causes two reviews have found that compressiononly cpr had no more success than no cpr whatsoever386s646 rescue breaths for children and especially for babies should be relatively gentle38 either a ratio of compressions to breaths of 302 or 152 was found to have better results for children40 both children and adults should receive a hundred chest compressions per minute other exceptions besides children include cases of drownings and drug overdose in both these cases compressions and rescue breaths are recommended if the bystander is trained and is willing to do so as per the american heart association the beat of the bee gees song stayin alive provides an ideal rhythm in terms of beats per minute to use for handsonly cpr41 one can also hum queens another one bites the dust which is exactly 100 beatsperminute and contains a memorable repeating drum pattern42 for those in cardiac arrest due to non heart related causes and in people less than 20 years of age standard cpr is superior to compressiononly cpr4344 prone cpredit standard cpr is performed with the person in supine position prone cpr or reverse cpr is cpr performed on a person lying on their chest by turning the head to the side and compressing the back due to the heads being turned the risk of vomiting and complications caused by aspiration pneumonia may be reduced45 the american heart associations current guideline recommends to perform cpr in the supine position and limits prone cpr to situations where the patient cannot be turned46 pregnancyedit during pregnancy when a woman is lying on her back the uterus may compress the inferior vena cava and thus decrease venous return8 it is therefore recommended that the uterus be pushed to the womans left if this is not effective either roll the woman 30° or healthcare professionals should consider emergency resuscitative hysterotomy8 family presenceedit evidence generally supports family being present during cpr47 this includes in cpr for children48 otheredit interposed abdominal compressions may be beneficial in the hospital environment49 there is no evidence of benefit prehospital or in children49 cooling during cpr is being studied as currently results are unclear whether or not it improves outcomes50 internal cardiac massage is manual squeezing of the exposed heart itself carried out through a surgical incision into the chest cavity usually when the chest is already open for cardiac surgery pathophysiologyedit cpr is used on people in cardiac arrest in order to oxygenate the blood and maintain a cardiac output to keep vital organs alive blood circulation and oxygenation are required to transport oxygen to the tissues the physiology of cpr involves generating a pressure gradient between the arterial and venous vascular beds cpr achieves this via multiple mechanisms 51 the brain may sustain damage after blood flow has been stopped for about four minutes and irreversible damage after about seven minutes5253545556 typically if blood flow ceases for one to two hours then body cells die therefore in general cpr is effective only if performed within seven minutes of the stoppage of blood flow57 the heart also rapidly loses the ability to maintain a normal rhythm low body temperatures as sometimes seen in neardrownings prolong the time the brain survives following cardiac arrest effective cpr enables enough oxygen to reach the brain to delay brain stem death and allows the heart to remain responsive to defibrillation attempts additional devicesedit while several adjunctive devices are available none other than defibrillation as of 2010 have consistently been found to be better than standard cpr for outofhospital cardiac arrest6s644 these devices can be split into three broad groups timing devices devices that assist the rescuer in achieving the correct technique especially depth and speed of compressions and devices that take over the process completely timing devicesedit timing devices can feature a metronome an item carried by many ambulance crews in order to assist the rescuer in achieving the correct rate some units can also give timing reminders for performing compressions ventilating and changing operators58 manual assist devicesedit mechanical chest compression devices are not currently recommended for widespread use59 there have not been enough high quality studies performed to determine if using mechanical assist devices for chest compression saves more lives compared with using the traditional hand compression technique59 audible and visual prompting may improve the quality of cpr and prevent the decrease of compression rate and depth that naturally occurs with fatigue606162636465 and to address this potential improvement a number of devices have been developed to help improve cpr technique these items can be devices to be placed on top of the chest with the rescuers hands going over the device and a display or audio feedback giving information on depth force or rate66 or in a wearable format such as a glove67 several published evaluations show that these devices can improve the performance of chest compressions6869 as well as its use during actual cpr on a cardiac arrest victim which relies on the rescuer carrying the device with them these devices can also be used as part of training programs to improve basic skills in performing correct chest compressions70 automatic devicesedit mechanical cpr has not seen as much use as mechanical ventilation devices on the market include lucas2 developed at the university hospital of lund71 and return of spontaneous circulation72 and autopulse both use straps around the chest lucas2 uses a gas driven piston and motor driven constricting band there are several advantages to automated devices they allow rescuers to focus on performing other interventions they do not fatigue and begin to perform less effective compressions as humans do they are able to perform effective compressions in limitedspace environments such as air ambulances where manual compressions are difficult and they allow ambulance workers to be strapped in safely rather than standing over a patient in a speeding vehicle73 however the disadvantages are cost to purchase time to train emergency personnel to use them interruption to cpr to implement potential for incorrect application and the need for multiple device sizes several studies have shown little or no improvement in survival rates747576 but acknowledge the need for more study77 mobile appsedit to support training and incident management mobile apps have been published on the largest app markets an evaluation of 61 available apps has revealed that a large number do not follow international guidelines for basic life support and many apps are not designed in a userfriendly way78 as a result the red cross updated and endorsed its emergency preparedness application which uses pictures text and videos to assist the user the uk resuscitation council has an app called lifesaver which shows how to perform cpr79 prevalenceedit chance of receiving cpredit various studies suggest that in outofhome cardiac arrest bystanders in the usa attempt cpr in between 1480 and 4581 of the time with a median of 3282 internationally rates of bystander cpr reported to be as low as 1 and as high as 4483 however the effectiveness of this cpr is variable and the studies suggest only around half of bystander cpr is performed correctly8485 one study found that members of the public having received cpr training in the past lack the skills and confidence needed to save lives the reports authors suggested that better training is needed to improve the willingness to respond to cardiac arrest82 there is a relation between age and the chance of cpr being commenced younger people are far more likely to have cpr attempted on them before the arrival of emergency medical services8086 bystanders more commonly administer cpr when in public than when at the persons home although health care professionals are responsible for more than half of outofhospital resuscitation attempts81 people with no connection to the person are more likely to perform cpr than are a member of their family87 there is also a clear relation between cause of arrest and the likelihood of a bystander initiating cpr lay persons are most likely to give cpr to younger people in cardiac arrest in a public place when it has a medical cause those in arrest from trauma exsanguination or intoxication are less likely to receive cpr87 it is believed that there is a higher chance that cpr will be performed if the bystander is told to perform only the chest compression element of the resuscitation3988 chance of receiving cpr in timeedit cpr is likely to be effective only if commenced within 6 minutes after the blood flow stops89 because permanent brain cell damage occurs when fresh blood infuses the cells after that time since the cells of the brain become dormant in as little as 4–6 minutes in an oxygen deprived environment and therefore cannot survive the reintroduction of oxygen in a traditional resuscitation research using cardioplegic blood infusion resulted in a 794 survival rate with cardiac arrest intervals of 72±43 minutes traditional methods achieve a 15 survival rate in this scenario by comparison new research is currently needed to determine what role cpr electroshock and new advanced gradual resuscitation techniques will have with this new knowledge90 a notable exception is cardiac arrest that occurs in conjunction with exposure to very cold temperatures hypothermia seems to protect by slowing down metabolic and physiologic processes greatly decreasing the tissues need for oxygen91 there are cases where cpr defibrillation and advanced warming techniques have revived victims after substantial periods of hypothermia92 society and cultureedit portrayed effectivenessedit cpr is often severely misrepresented in movies and television as being highly effective in resuscitating a person who is not breathing and has no circulation a 1996 study published in the new england journal of medicine showed that cpr success rates in television shows was 75 for immediate circulation and 67 survival to discharge93 this gives the general public an unrealistic expectation of a successful outcome93 when educated on the actual survival rates the proportion of patients over 60 years of age desiring cpr should they suffer a cardiac arrest drops from 41 to 2294 stage cpredit chest compressions are capable of causing significant local blunt trauma including bruising or fracture of the sternum or ribs95 performing cpr on a healthy person may or may not disrupt normal heart rhythm but regardless the technique should not be performed on a healthy person because of the risk of trauma the portrayal of cpr technique on television and film often is purposely incorrect actors simulating the performance of cpr may bend their elbows while appearing to compress to prevent force from reaching the chest of the actor portraying the victim selfcpr hoaxedit a form of selfcpr termed cough cpr was the subject of a hoax chain email entitled how to survive a heart attack when alone which wrongly cited viahealth rochester general hospital as the source of the technique rochester general hospital has denied any connection with the technique9697 cough cpr in the sense of resuscitating oneself is impossible because a prominent symptom of cardiac arrest is unconsciousness98 which makes coughing impossible in cases of myocardial infarction heart attack during which the person may well remain conscious but which is not by itself a form of arrest attempting cough cpr will increase the workload on the heart and will likely prove harmful the american heart association aha and other resuscitation bodies99 do not endorse cough cpr which it terms a misnomer as it is not a form of resuscitation the aha does recognize a limited legitimate use of the coughing technique this coughing technique to maintain blood flow during brief arrhythmias has been useful in the hospital particularly during cardiac catheterization in such cases the patients ecg is monitored continuously and a physician is present100 when coughing is used on trained and monitored patients in hospitals it has been shown to be effective only for 90 seconds99 learning from moviesedit in at least one case it has been alleged that cpr learned from a movie was used to save a persons life in april 2011 it was claimed that nineyearold tristin saghin saved his sisters life by administering cpr on her after she fell into a swimming pool using only the knowledge of cpr that he had gleaned from a motion picture black hawk down101 handsonly cpr portrayaledit less than 13 of those people who experience a cardiac arrest at home work or in a public location have cpr performed on them most bystanders are worried that they might do something wrong102 on october 28 2009 the american heart association and the ad council launched a handsonly cpr public service announcement and website as a means to address this issue103 in july 2011 new content was added to the website including a digital app that helps a user learn how to perform handsonly cpr104 historyedit main article history of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the 19th century doctor h r silvester described a method the silvester method of artificial ventilation in which the patient is laid on their back and their arms are raised above their head to aid inhalation and then pressed against their chest to aid exhalation105 the procedure is repeated sixteen times per minute this type of artificial ventilation is occasionally seen in films made in the early 20th century a second technique called the holger nielsen technique described in the first edition of the boy scout handbook in the united states in 1911 was a form of artificial ventilation where the person was laid face down with their head to the side resting on the palms of both hands upward pressure applied at the patient’s elbows raised the upper body while pressure on their back forced air into the lungs in essence the silvester method with the patient flipped over this form is seen well into the 1950s it is used in an episode of lassie during the mid1950s and was often used sometimes for comedic effect in theatrical cartoons of the time see tom and jerrys the cat and the mermouse 1949 this method would continue to be shown for historical purposes sidebyside with modern cpr in the boy scout handbook until its ninth edition in 1979 the technique was later banned from firstaid manuals in the uk similar techniques were described in early 20th century jujutsu and judo books as being used as far back as the early 17th century a new york times correspondent reported those techniques being used successfully in japan in 1910 in jujutsu and later on judo those techniques were called kappo or kutasu106107108109 however it was not until the middle of the 20th century that the wider medical community started to recognize and promote artificial ventilation in the form of mouthtomouth resuscitation combined with chest compressions as a key part of resuscitation following cardiac arrest the combination was first seen in a 1962 training video called the pulse of life created by james jude guy knickerbocker and peter safar jude and knickerbocker along with william kouwenhoven and joseph s redding had recently discovered the method of external chest compressions whereas safar had worked with redding and james elam to prove the effectiveness of mouthtomouth resuscitation it was at johns hopkins university where the technique of cpr was originally developed the first effort at testing the technique was performed on a dog by redding safar and jw pearson soon afterward the technique was used to save the life of a child110 their combined findings were presented at the annual maryland medical society meeting on september 16 1960 in ocean city and gained widespread acceptance over the following decade helped by the video and speaking tour they undertook peter safar wrote the book abc of resuscitation in 1957 in the us it was first promoted as a technique for the public to learn in the 1970s111 mouthtomouth resuscitation was combined with chest compressions based on the assumption that active ventilation is necessary to keep circulating blood oxygenated and the combination was accepted without comparing its effectiveness with chest compressions alone however research over the past decade has shown that assumption to be in error resulting in the ahas acknowledgment of the effectiveness of chest compressions alone see compression only in this article112 cpr has continued to advance with recent developments including an emphasis on constant rapid heart stimulation and a deemphasis on the respiration aspect studies have shown that people who had rapid constant heartonly chest compression are 22 more likely to survive than those receiving conventional cpr that included breathing whats more because people tend to be reluctant to do mouthtomouth chestonly cpr nearly doubles the chances of survival overall by increasing the odds of receiving cpr in the first place113 other animalsedit it is feasible to perform cpr on animals including cats and dogs the principles and practices are virtually identical to cpr for humans except that resuscitation is usually done through the animals nose not the mouth cpr should only be performed on unconscious animals to avoid the risk of being bitten a conscious animal would not require chest compressions animals depending on species may have a lower bone density than humans and so cpr can cause bones to become weakened after it is performed114 researchedit cerebral performance category cpc scores are used as a research tool to describe “good” and “poor” outcomes level 1 is conscious and alert with normal function level 2 is only slight disability level 3 is moderate disability level 4 is severe disability level 5 is comatose or persistent vegetative state level 6 is brain dead or death from other causes115 see alsoedit
