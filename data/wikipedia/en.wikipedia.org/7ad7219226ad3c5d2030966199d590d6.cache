public company started off as a spice trader the voc is often considered by many to be the first historical model of a multinational corporation or transnational corporation in its modern sense1234 a

external links namesedit a multinational corporation mnc can also be referred to as a multinational enterprise mne a transnational enterprise tne a transnational corporation tnc an international corporation or a stateless corporation7 there are subtle but real differences between these three labels as well as those labels of multinational corporation and a worldwide enterprise overviewedit toyota is one of the worlds largest multinational corporations with their headquarters in toyota city japan a multinational corporation mnc is usually a large corporation incorporated in one country which produces or sells goods or services in various countries8 the two main characteristics of mncs are their large size and the fact that their worldwide activities are centrally controlled by the parent companies9 importing and exporting goods and services making significant investments in a foreign country buying and selling licenses in foreign markets engaging in contract manufacturing—permitting a local manufacturer in a foreign country to produce their products opening manufacturing facilities or assembly operations in foreign countries mncs may gain from their global presence in a variety of ways first of all mncs can benefit from the economy of scale by spreading rd expenditures and advertising costs over their global sales pooling global purchasing power over suppliers and utilizing their technological and managerial knowhow globally with minimal additional costs furthermore mncs can use their global presence to take advantage of underpriced labor services available in certain developing countries and gain access to special rd capabilities residing in advanced foreign countries10 the problem of moral and legal constraints upon the behavior of multinational corporations given that they are effectively stateless actors is one of several urgent global socioeconomic problems that emerged during the late twentieth century11 potentially the best concept for analyzing societys governance limitations over modern corporations is the concept of stateless corporations coined at least as early as 1990 in business week the conception was theoretically clarified in 1992 that an empirical strategy for defining a stateless corporation is with analytical tools at the intersection between demographic analysis and transportation research this intersection is known as logistics management and it describes the importance of rapidly increasing global mobility of resources in a long history of analysis of multinational corporations we are some quarter century into an era of stateless corporations corporations which meet the realities of the needs of source materials on a worldwide basis and to produce and customize products for individual countries12 one of the first multinational business organizations the east india company arose in 160013 after the east india company came the dutch east india company founded march 20 1602 which would become the largest company in the world for nearly 200 years14 the main characteristics of multinational companies are in general there is a national strength of large companies as the main body in the way of foreign direct investment or acquire local enterprises established subsidiaries or branches in many countries it usually has a complete decisionmaking system and the highest decisionmaking center each subsidiary or branch has its own decisionmaking body according to their different features and operations to make decisions but its decision must be subordinated to the highest decisionmaking center mncs seek markets in worldwide and rational production layout professional fixedpoint production fixedpoint sales products in order to achieve maximum profit due to strong economic and technical strength with fast information transmission as well as funding for rapid crossborder transfers the multinational has stronger competitiveness in the world many large multinational companies have varying degrees of monopoly in some area due to economic and technical strength or production advantages theoretical backgroundedit the actions of multinational corporations are strongly supported by economic liberalism and free market system in a globalized international society according to the economic realist view individuals act in rational ways to maximize their selfinterest and therefore when individuals act rationally markets are created and they function best in free market system where there is little government interference as a result international wealth is maximized with free exchange of goods and services15 to many economic liberals multinational corporations are the vanguard of the liberal order16 they are the embodiment par excellence of the liberal ideal of an interdependent world economy they have taken the integration of national economies beyond trade and money to the internationalization of production for the first time in history production marketing and investment are being organized on a global scale rather than in terms of isolated national economies17 international business is also a specialist field of academic research economic theories of the multinational corporation include internalization theory and the eclectic paradigm the latter is also known as the oli framework the other theoretical dimension of the role of multinational corporations concerns the relationship between the globalization of economic engagement and the culture of national and local responses this has a history of selfconscious cultural management going back at least to the 1960s for example “ ernest dichter architect of exxon’s international campaign writing in the harvard business review in 1962 was fully aware that the means to overcoming cultural resistance depended on an “understanding” of the countries in which a corporation operated he observed that companies with “foresight to capitalize on international opportunities” must recognize that “cultural anthropology will be an important tool for competitive marketing” however the projected outcome of this was not the assimilation of international firms into national cultures but the creation of a “world customer” the idea of a global corporate village entailed the management and reconstitution of parochial attachments to one’s nation it involved not a denial of the naturalness of national attachments but an internationalization of the way a nation defines itself18 ” transnational corporationsedit the united east india company voc a pioneering early model of transnational corporations at the dawn of modern capitalism 17thcentury etching of the oostindisch huis dutch for east india house the main headquarters of the united east india company voc in amsterdam the fort batavia seen from west kali besar andries beeckman c 1656 while the voc established its overseas administrative center as the second headquarters in batavia presentday jakarta the company also had important operations elsewhere a transnational corporation differs from a traditional multinational corporation in that it does not identify itself with one national home while traditional multinational corporations are national companies with foreign subsidiaries19 transnational corporations spread out their operations in many countries to sustain high levels of local responsiveness20 an example of a transnational corporation is nestlé who employ senior executives from many countries and tries to make decisions from a global perspective rather than from one centralized headquarters21 another example is royal dutch shell whose headquarters are in the hague netherlands but whose registered office and main executive body are headquartered in london united kingdom multinational enterpriseedit the multinational enterprise mne is the term used by international economist and similarly defined with the multinational corporation mnc as an enterprise that controls and manages production establishments known as plants located in at least two countries22 the multinational enterprise mne will engage in foreign direct investment fdi as the firm makes direct investments in host country plants for equity ownership and managerial control to avoid some transaction costs23 a few examples of mnes are apple inc and nike inc who maximize economies of scale through foreign direct investments in international plants to manufacture value chain stages of production multinational corporation and colonialismedit see also charter company and neocolonialism the history of multinational corporations is closely intertwined the history of colonialism with the first multinational corporations founded to undertake colonial expeditions at the behest of their european monarchical patrons24 prior to the era of new imperialism a majority european colonies not held by the spanish and portuguese crowns were administered by chartered multinational corporations25 examples of such corporations include the british east india company26 the swedish africa company and the hudson’s bay company27 these early corporations facilitated colonialism by engaging in international trade and exploration and creating colonial trading posts28 many of these corporations such as the south australia company and the virginia company played a direct role in formal colonization by creating and maintaining settler colonies28 without exception these early corporations created differential economic outcomes between their home country and their colonies via a process of exploiting colonial resources and labour and investing the resultant profits and net gain in the home country29 the end result of this process was the enrichment of the colonizer and the impoverishment of the colonized30 some multinational corporations such as the royal african company were also responsible for the logistical component of the atlantic slave trade31 maintaining the ships and ports required for this vast enterprise during the 19th century formal corporate rule over colonial holdings largely gave way to statecontrolled colonies3233 however corporate control over colonial economic affairs persisted in a majority of colonies2832 during the process of decolonization the european colonial charter companies were disbanded28 with the final colonial corporation the mozambique company dissolving in 1972 however the economic impact of corporate colonial exploitation has proved to be lasting and far reaching34 with some commentators asserting that this impact is among the chief causes of contemporary global income inequality30 contemporary critics of multinational corporations have charged that some present day multinational corporations follow the pattern of exploitation and differential wealth distribution established by the now defunct colonial charter corporations particularly with regards to corporations based in the developed world that operate resource extraction enterprises in the developing world35 such as royal dutch shell and barrick gold some of these critics argue that the operations of multinational corporations in the developing world take place within the broader context of neocolonialism36 however multinational corporations from emerging markets are playing an evergreater role increasingly impacting the global economy37 criticism of multinationalsedit main articles antiglobalization movement and anticorporate activism anticorporate advocates criticize multinational corporations for entering countries that have low human rights or environmental standards38 in the world economy facilitated by multinational corporations capital will increasingly be able to play workers communities and nations off against one another as they demand tax regulation and wage concessions while threatening to move in other words increased mobility of multinational corporations benefit capital while workers and communities lose some negative outcomes generated by multinational corporations include increased inequality unemployment and wage stagnation39 the aggressive use of tax avoidance schemes allows multinational corporations to gain competitive advantages over small and mediumsized enterprises40 organizations such as the tax justice network criticize governments for allowing multinational organizations to escape tax since less money can be spent for public services41 the 5 cons of multinational corporations 1 the market dominance of multinational corporations the market dominance of multinational corporations makes it hard for the local small firms to succeed and thrive for instance there are arguments stating that the larger supermarkets squeeze out a notable margin of the local corner stores that lead to lesser diversity 2 consumer’s expenses companies are usually interested at the consumer’s expense the multinational companies commonly have the power of monopoly that gives them the chance of making excess profit 3 pushing local firms out of business in the developing economies these giant multinationals use the economies of scale for pushing the local firms out of their businesses 4 criticized for using slave labor multinational corporations are being criticized for using the socalled slave labor wherein the workers are paid with very small wages 5 environment threat for the sake of profit these global companies commonly contribute to pollution as well as make use of the nonrenewable resources that can be a threat to the environment see alsoedit corporation
