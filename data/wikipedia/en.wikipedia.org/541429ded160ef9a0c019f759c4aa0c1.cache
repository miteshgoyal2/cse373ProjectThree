anagram from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about words that are remade by rearranging their letters for the game see anagrams for the band see anagram band an anagram is word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase typically using all the original letters exactly once1 for example the word anagram can be rearranged into nag a ram the original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram someone who creates anagrams may be called an anagrammatist2 and the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject contents 1 examples 2 history 21 influence of latin 22 early

further reading examplesedit anagrams may be created as a commentary on the subject for example it may be a synonym or antonym of its subject a parody a criticism satire rail safety fairy tales roast beef eat for bse 3 it sometimes changes a proper noun or personal name into a sentence william shakespeare i am a weakish speller madam curie radium came it can change parts of speech such as the adjective silent to the verb listen anagrams itself can be anagrammatized as ars magna latin the great art4 historyedit anagrams can be traced back to the time of moses as themuru or changing which was to find the hidden and mystical meaning in names5 they were popular throughout europe during the middle ages for example with the poet and composer guillaume de machaut6 they are said to go back at least to the greek poet lycophron in the third century bce but this relies on an account of lycophron given by john tzetzes in the 12th century7 anagrams in latin were considered witty over many centuries est vir qui adest explained below was cited as the example in samuel johnsons a dictionary of the english language any historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question in particular spelling in english only slowly became fixed there were attempts to regulate anagram formation an important one in english being that of george puttenhams of the anagram or posy transposed in the art of english poesie 1589 influence of latinedit as a literary game when latin was the common property of the literate latin anagrams were prominent two examples are the change of ave maria gratia plena dominus tecum hail mary full of grace the lord is with you into virgo serena pia munda et immaculata serene virgin pious clean and spotless and the anagrammatic answer to pilates question quid est veritas what is truth namely est vir qui adest it is the man who is here the origins of these are not documented latin continued to influence letter values such as i j u v and w vv there was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be perfect if the letters were all used once but allowing for these interchanges this can be seen in a popular latin anagram against the jesuits societas jesu turned into vitiosa seces or cut off the wicked things puttenham in the time of elizabeth i of england wished to start from elissabet anglorum regina elizabeth queen of the english to obtain multa regnabis ense gloria by thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown he explains carefully that h is a note of aspiration only and no letter and that z in greek or hebrew is a mere ss the rules were not completely fixed in the 17th century william camden in his remains commented singling out some letters—æ k w and z—not found in the classical roman alphabet8 the precise in this practice strictly observing all the parts of the definition are only bold with h either in omitting or retaining it for that it cannot challenge the right of a letter but the licentiats somewhat licentiously lest they should prejudice poetical liberty will pardon themselves for doubling or rejecting a letter if the sence fall aptly and think it no injury to use e for æ v for w s for z and c for k and contrariwise — william camden remains early modern periodedit when it comes to the 17th century and anagrams in english or other languages there is a great deal of documented evidence of learned interest the lawyer thomas egerton was praised through the anagram gestat honorem he carries honor the physician george ent took the anagrammatic motto genio surget he rises through spiritgenius which requires his first name as georgius9 james is courtiers discovered in james stuart a just master and converted charles james stuart into claims arthurs seat even at that point in time the letters i and j were moreorless interchangeable walter quin tutor to the future charles i worked hard on multilingual anagrams on the name of father james10 a notorious murder scandal the overbury case threw up two imperfect anagrams that were aided by typically loose spelling and were recorded by simonds dewes francis howard for frances carr countess of somerset her maiden name spelled in a variant became car findes a whore with the letters e hardly counted and the victim thomas overbury as thomas overburie was written as o o a busie murther an old form of murder with a v counted as u1112 william drummond of hawthornden in an essay on the character of a perfect anagram tried to lay down rules for permissible substitutions such as s standing for z and letter omissions13 william camden14 provided a definition of anagrammatisme as a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters as his elements and a new connection of it by artificial transposition without addition subtraction or change of any letter into different words making some perfect sense applyable ie applicable to the person named dryden in macflecknoe disdainfully called the pastime the torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways15 eleanor audeley wife of sir john davies is said to have been brought before the high commissionclarification needed in 1634 for extravagances stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to reveale o daniel and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by sir john lambe the dean of the arches dame eleanor davies never soe mad a ladie1617 an example from france was a flattering anagram for cardinal richelieu comparing him to hercules or at least one of his hands hercules being a kingly symbol where armand de richelieu became ardue main dhercule difficult hand of hercules18 modern periodedit examples from the nineteenth century are the transposition of horatio nelson into honor est a nilo latin honor is from the nile and of florence nightingale into flit on cheering angel19 the victorian love of anagramming as recreation is alluded to by augustus de morgan20 using his own name as example great gun do us a sum is attributed to his son william de morgan but a family friend john thomas graves was prolific and a manuscript with over 2800 has been preserved212223 with the advent of surrealism as a poetic movement anagrams regained the artistic respect they had had in the baroque period the german poet unica zürn who made extensive use of anagram techniques came to regard obsession with anagrams as a dangerous fever because it created isolation of the author24 the surrealist leader andré breton coined the anagram avida dollars for salvador dalí to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism applicationsedit while anagramming is certainly a recreation first there are ways in which anagrams are put to use and these can be more serious or at least not quite frivolous and formless for example psychologists use anagramoriented tests often called anagram solution tasks to assess the implicit memory of young adults and adults alike25 establishment of priorityedit natural philosophers astronomers and others of the 17th century transposed their discoveries into latin anagrams to establish their priority in this way they laid claim to new discoveries before their results were ready for publication galileo used smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras for altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi i have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form for discovering the rings of saturn in 16102627 galileo announced his discovery that venus had phases like the moon in the form haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur oy latin these immature ones have already been read in vain by me oy that is when rearranged cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum latin the mother of loves venus imitates the figures of cynthia the moon when robert hooke discovered hookes law in 1660 he first published it in anagram form ceiiinosssttuv for ut tensio sic vis latin as the tension so the force28 in a related use from 1975 british naturalist sir peter scott coined the scientific term nessiteras rhombopteryx greek for the monster or wonder of ness with the diamondshaped fin for the apocryphal loch ness monster29 shortly afterwards several london newspapers pointed out that nessiteras rhombopteryx anagrams into monster hoax by sir peter s however robert rines who previously made two underwater photographs allegedly showing the monster countered with the fact that they can also be arranged into yes both pix are monsters r30 pseudonymsedit anagrams are connected to pseudonyms by the fact that they may conceal or reveal or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity for example jim morrison used an anagram of his name in the doors song la woman calling himself mr mojo risin the use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names as happened in the 18th century when edward cave wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the house of commons31 in a genre such as farce or parody anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect pseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names thus calvinus becomes alcuinus here v u or françois rabelais alcofribas nasier the name voltaire of françois marie arouet fits this pattern and is allowed to be an anagram of arouet le jeune u v j i that is arouet the younger other examples include arrigo boito tobia gorrio edward gorey ogdred weary regera dowdy or e g deadworry and others vladimir nabokov vivian darkbloom vivian bloodmark blavdak vinomori or dorian vivalkomb ted morgan sanche de gramont dave barry ray adverb glen duncan declan gunn32 damon albarn dan abnormal anna madrigal a man and a girl tom marvolo riddle i am lord voldemort buckethead death cube k daniel clowes enid coleslaw siobhán donaghy shanghai nobody several of these are imperfect anagrams letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation titlesedit anagrams used for titles afford scope for some types of wit examples homer hickam jrs book rocket boys was adapted into the 1999 film october sky33 the tapes for the revival of the bbc show doctor who were labeled with the anagram torchwood which later went on to be used as the name for a spinoff show the 1980s tv series the ateam had a season 1 anagram episode called black day at bad rock a word play on the 1955 spenser tracy western movie bad day at black rock the new wave band missing persons bestselling album was called spring session m hiphop artist mf doom recorded a 2004 album called mmfood brian enos album before and after science includes a song entitled kings lead hat an anagram of talking heads a band eno has worked with juan maria solares piano ballad jura ser anomalía literally heshe swears to be an anomaly is an anagram of the composers full name his composition for english horn titled a dot in time is an anagram of meditation which

and another composition re person i knew is a tribute to his producer orrin keepnews the title of imogen heaps album imegaphone is an anagram of her name progressive rock group rush published a song

bands name and also spanish for the painter coincidencesedit in hebrew the name gernot zippe גרנוט ציפה the inventor of the zippetype centrifuge is an anagram of the word centrifuge צנטריפוגה games and puzzlesedit anagrams are in themselves a recreational activity but they also make up part of many other games puzzles and game shows the jumble is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the united states requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution cryptic crossword puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like confused or in disarray an example would be businessman burst into tears 9 letters the solution stationer is an anagram of into tears the letters of which have burst out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of businessman some games even use anagrams in their plot for example the game undertale uses delta rune as an anagram of its title to represent the dreemurr royal family and the name of their symbol numerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill some examples in anagrams players flip tiles over one at a time and race to take words they can steal each others words by rearranging the letters and extending the words in a version of scrabble called clabbers the name itself being an anagram of scrabble tiles may be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to a valid word on the british game show countdown contestants are given 30 seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters in boggle players make constrained words from a grid of sixteen random letters by joining adjacent cubes on the british game show brainteaser contestants are shown a word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word at the end of the game there is a pyramid which starts with a threeletter word a letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find a solution the pattern continues until the player reaches the final eightletter anagram the player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time in bananagrams players place tiles from a pool into crosswordstyle word arrangements in a race to see who can finish the pool of tiles first other anagram games include bonza word game bookworm video game dabble jumble letterpress video game perquackey puzzlage word force wordspot and words with friends ciphersedit multiple anagramming is a technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms such as a permutation cipher a transposition cipher and the jefferson disk34 solutions may be computationally found using a jumble algorithm methods of constructionedit sometimes it is possible to see anagrams in words unaided by tools though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes anagram dictionaries could also be used computer programs known as anagram servers anagram solvers or anagrammers offer a much faster route to creating anagrams and a large number of these programs are available on the internet the program or server carries out an exhaustive search of a database of words to produce a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase using a jumble algorithm some programs such as lexpert restrict to oneword answers many anagram servers for example the words oracle can control the search results by excluding or including certain words limiting the number or length of words in each anagram or limiting the number of results anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games the disadvantage of computer anagram solvers especially when applied to multiword anagrams is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating they usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often this approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations some anagrammatists indicate the method they used anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done manually or by hand those made by utilizing a computer may be noted by machine or by computer or may indicate the name of the computer program using anagram genius there are also a few natural instances english words unconsciously created by switching letters around the french chaise longue long chair became the american chaise lounge by metathesis transposition of letters andor sounds it has also been speculated that the english curd comes from the latin crudus raw
