external links party power struggleedit this convention marked the beginning of a split in the party resulting from a power struggle between incumbent taft and former president theodore roosevelt this was the first year for republican primaries though roosevelt had endorsed taft as his successor tafts perceived drift to the right had alienated roosevelt who launched a challenge to tafts renomination roosevelt overwhelmingly won the primaries — winning 9 out of 12 states 8 by landslide margins taft won only the state of massachusetts by a small margin he even lost his home state of ohio to roosevelt senator robert m la follette sr a reformer won two states through the primaries senator la follette won a total of 36 delegates president taft won 48 delegates and roosevelt won 278 delegates however 36 states did not hold primaries but instead selected delegates via state conventions entering the convention the roosevelt and taft forces seemed evenly matched and a compromise candidate seemed possible1 the taft and roosevelt camps engaged in a fight for the delegations of various states with taft emerging victorious and roosevelt claiming that several delegations were fraudulently seated2 following the seating of the antiroosevelt delegations california governor hiram johnson proclaimed that progressives would form a new party to nominate roosevelt2 though many of roosevelts delegates remained at the convention most refused to take part in the presidential ballot in protest of the contested delegates3 roosevelt ultimately ran a third party campaign as part of the progressive party nicknamed the bull moose party taft and roosevelt both lost the 1912 election to the democratic nominee woodrow wilson like taft vice president james s sherman of new york was renominated by the party4 though taft and sherman did not get along early in their tenure the two became closer allies as tafts split with roosevelt deepened and taft did not object to the renomination of sherman4 tafts allies sought progressive leaders such as idaho senator william e borah and vermont governor john a mead to join the ticket but both declined to be considered4 missouri governor herbert s hadley and former vice president charles fairbanks were also mentioned as possibilities4 sherman died shortly before the election and was not replaced on the ticket5 in january after the election had already been decided republican leaders appointed columbia university president nicholas butler to fill out the ticket for the purposes of receiving electoral votes5 detailed
