old people call it the blues as his début single13 released summer 196214 it almost broke into the billboard 100 spending one week of august at 101 before dropping out of sight15 two followup singles little water boy and contract on love both had no success and the two albums released in reverse order of recording—the jazz soul of little stevie in september 1962 and tribute to uncle ray in october 1962—also met with little success1216 at the end of 1962 when wonder was 12 years old he joined the motortown revue touring the chitlin circuit of theatres across america that accepted black artists

that had occurred20 his next few recordings however were not successful his voice was changing as he got older and some motown executives were considering cancelling his recording contract20 during 1964 wonder appeared in two films as himself muscle beach party and bikini beach but these were not successful either21 sylvia moy persuaded label owner berry gordy to give wonder another chance20 dropping the little from his name moy and wonder worked together to create the hit uptight everythings alright20 and wonder went on to have a number of other hits during the mid1960s including with a childs heart and blowin in the wind18 a bob dylan cover cosung by his mentor producer clarence paul22 he also began to work in the motown songwriting department composing songs both for himself and his label mates including the tears of a clown a no 1 hit for smokey robinson and the miracles it was first released in 1967 mostly unnoticed as the last track of their make it happen lp but eventually became a major success when rereleased as a single in 1970 which prompted robinson to reconsider his intention of leaving the group23 in 1968 he recorded an album of instrumental souljazz tracks mostly harmonica solos under the title eivets rednow which is stevie wonder spelled backwards24 the album failed to get much attention and its only single a cover of alfie only reached number

time as marvin gayes whats going on as both albums had similar ambitions and themes they have been compared in a contemporaneous review by vince aletti in rolling stone gayes was seen as successful

he allowed his motown contract to expire27 in 1970 wonder cowrote and played numerous instruments on the hit its a shame for fellow motown act the spinners his contribution was meant to be a showcase of his talent and thus a weapon in his ongoing negotiations with gordy about creative autonomy28 during this period wonder independently recorded two albums and signed a contract with motown records the 120page contract was a precedent at motown and gave wonder a much higher royalty rate29 wonder returned to motown in march 1972 with music of my mind unlike most previous albums on motown which usually consisted of a collection of singles bsides and covers music of my mind was a fulllength artistic statement with songs flowing together thematically29 wonders lyrics dealt with social
