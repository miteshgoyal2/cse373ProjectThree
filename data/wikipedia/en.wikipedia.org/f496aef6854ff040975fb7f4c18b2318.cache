change some historians have denounced the book as being poor scholarship7 propaganda8 and not scholarly9 other reviewers described the book as provocative10 and a wealth of challenging insights backed up by thorough research11 the audiobook version of liberal fascism was narrated by johnny heller goldberg followed the book with the tyranny of cliches how liberals cheat in the war of ideas in 2012

never having been nominated but only one of thousands of entrants14better source needed commentaryedit frequent topicsedit some frequent topics of his articles include censorship meritocracy liberty federalism and interpretation of the constitution his attacks on the ethics and morals of liberals and democrats and his disagreements with libertarians also appear often in his writings he was a supporter of the iraq war and has advocated for american military intervention elsewhere in the world he has defended historical colonialism in places such as africa as more beneficial than it is generally given credit for in one column he suggested that us imperialism on the continent could help solve its persistent problems15 when he wrote in october 2006 that invading iraq was a mistake he called it a noble mistake and still maintained that liberal opponents to the war policy wanted america to fail in other words their objection isnt to war per se its to wars that advance us interests i must confess one of the things that made me reluctant to conclude that the iraq war was a mistake was my distaste for the shabbiness of the arguments on the antiwar side16 he popularized and expanded on a commentary by the late time writer william henry iii henry had written on the subject of multiculturalism and cultural equality stating that it is scarcely the same thing to put a man on the moon as to put a bone in your nose goldberg stated that multiculturalism — which is simply egalitarianism wrapped in rainbowcolored paper—has elevated the notion that all ideas are equal all systems equivalent all cultures of comparable worth15 he has criticized the idea of social justice as meaning anything its champions want it to mean or good things no one needs to argue for and no one dare be against17 relations with other writers and public figuresedit goldberg has publicly feuded with people on the political left like juan cole over us iraq policy and air america radio commentators such as janeane garofalo who has accused him of being a chickenhawk on the iraq war on february 8 2005 goldberg offered cole a wager of 1000 that iraq wont have a civil war that it will have a viable constitution and that a majority of iraqis and americans will in two years time agree that the war was worth it18 cole refused to accept and the wager was never made19 goldberg later conceded that if cole had accepted the bet cole would have won20 peter beinart and goldberg engaged in a discussion on bloggingheadstv21 goldberg and peter beinart of the new republic for a time hosted a conservative vs liberal webtv show whats your problem which originally could be found on national review online22 but has appeared on bloggingheadstv21 as of 2013 goldberg and beinart continue to debate one another most recently at an event sponsored by the young americas foundation at the university of virginia in 201223 goldberg and others at national review online including editor rich lowry broke with conservative writer ann coulter over statements she made about the september 11 2001 attacks that they considered irresponsible coulter stopped writing for national review online after the publishing of her column on september 13 2001 opining that we should invade their countries kill their leaders and convert them to christianity24 in his book crippled america then republican presidential candidate donald trump criticized goldberg referring to him as truly odious and sarcastically called him brilliant for wrongly predicting that trump would probably withdraw from the race rather than file financial disclosures25 mediaedit regarding fox news goldberg said look i think liberals have reasonable gripes with fox news it does lean to the right primarily in its opinion programming but also in its story selection which is fine by me and elsewhere but its worth remembering that fox is less a bastion of ideological conservatismclarification needed and more a populist tabloidy network26 goldberg has criticized liberals for disliking fox news claiming they have no problem with the editorializing of msnbcs keith olbermann or chris matthews they think its just plain wrong for conservatives to play that game26 goldberg has referred to olbermann as msnbc’s answer to a question no one asked27 humor and lighter topicsedit the goldberg file frequently involves humor often at the expense of liberals alec baldwin who goldberg insinuates cannot read has been a frequent target of such jibes goldberg also makes occasional allusions to star trek28 later battlestar galactica became a favorite topic29 goldberg also likes to link to timewaster online games in his postings at the corner familyedit goldberg is married to jessica gavora former chief speechwriter and a senior policy adviser to former attorney general john ashcroft30 and they have a daughter their first dog adopted from the washington dc shelter was named snowball at first and then cosmo cosmos
