verizon offers models equipped with 3g4g lte connectivity 100–200 mb of free wireless data per month for two years4243 googles early marketing efforts relied primarily on handson experience giving away samsung machines to 10 cr48 pilot program participants along with the title chromebook guru and lending chromebooks to passengers on some virgin america flights444546 at the end of september 2011 google launched the chrome zone a store within a store inside the currys and pc world superstore in london47 the store had a googlestyle look and feel with splashes of color all around the retail store front48 the concept was later changed to a broader instore google shop which has not expanded beyond the pc world on tottenham court road49 in addition to these marketing strategies google chrome has created several chromebook minis that demonstrate the ease of use and simplicity of the devices in a comical manner for example when the question how do you back up a chromebook is asked it is implied to refer to data backup but instead shows two hands pushing a chromebook back to the end of a table this is followed by the statement you dont have to back up a chromebook showing how all data is stored on the web50 in an article published on zdnet in june 2011 entitled five chromebook concerns for businesses steven j vaughannichols faulted the devices for lack of virtual private network capability not supporting some wifi security methods in particular wifi protected access ii wpa2 enterprise with extensible authentication protocoltransport layer security eaptls or cisco’s lightweight extensible authentication protocol leap he also noted that its file manager does not work the need to use the undocumented crosh shell to accomplish basic tasks such as setting up a secure shell ssh network connection as well as serious deficiencies in documentation51 in one of the first customer reviews the city of orlando florida reported on their initial testing of 600 chromebooks as part of a broader study related to accessing virtual desktops early indications show potential value in reducing it support costs end users have indicated that the chromebook is easy to travel with and starts up quickly one stated that if i just need to stay connected for emergencies i take my chrome but when traveling for business she would still take her laptop orlando does plan to continue to use the chromebooks52 on november 21 2011 google announced price reductions on all chromebooks53 since then the wifionly samsung series 5 was reduced to 349 the 3g samsung series 5 was reduced to 449 and the acer ac700 was reduced to 299 the updated series 5 550 and the chromebox the first chrome os desktop machines were released by samsung in may 201254555657 while the two lowest cost chromebooks

models released after may 2012 include 100 gb–109 tb of google drive cloud storage and 12 gogo wifi passes6162 by january 2013 acers chromebook sales were being driven by heavy internet users with educational institutions and the platform represented 510 percent of the companys us shipments according to acer president jim wong he called those numbers sustainable contrasting them with low windows 8 sales which he blamed for a slump in the market wong said that the company would consider marketing chromebooks to other developed countries as well as to corporations he noted that although chrome os is free to license for hardware vendors it has required greater marketing expenditure than windows offsetting the licensing savings63 during the first 11 months of 2013 176 million chromebooks sold in the united states representing 21 of the us commercial businesstobusiness laptop market during the same period in 2012 chromebooks sold 400000 units and had a negligible market share6 in january 2015 silviu stahie noted in softpedia that chromebooks were eating into microsofts market share he said microsoft is engaged in a silent war and its actually losing they are fighting an enemy that is so insidious and so cunning that its actually hurting the company more than anything else the enemy is called chromebooks and they are using linuxthere is no sign that things are slowing down and microsoft really needs a win and soon if it wants to remain relevant64 in 2015 chromebooks by sales volume to companies in the us are second after windows based devices with android tablets overtaking apples devices in 2014 chromebook sales through the us b2b channels increased 43 percent during the first half of 2015 helping to keep overall b2b pc and tablet sales from falling sales of google osequipped android and chrome devices saw a 29 percent increase over 2014 propelled by chromebook sales while apple devices declined 12 percent and windows devices fell 8 percent65 education marketedit a paradise valley unified school district student using a chromebook as part of the organizations pilot project the education market has been the chromebooks most notable success competing on the low cost of the hardware software and upkeep the simplicity of the machines which could be a drawback in other markets has proven an advantage to school districts by reducing training and maintenance costs66 by january 2012 even while commercial sales were flat google placed nearly 27000 chromebooks in schools across 41 states in the us including oneonone programs which allocate a computer for every student in south carolina illinois and iowa67 as of august 2012 over 500 school districts in the united states and europe were using the device6869 in 2016 chromebooks represented 58 percent of the 26 million mobile devices purchased by us schools and about 64 percent of that market outside the us by contrast sales of apple tablets and laptops to us schools dropped that year to 19 percent compared with 52 percent in 201266 helping spur chromebook sales is google classroom an app designed for teachers in 2014 that serves as a hub for classroom activities including attendance classroom discussions homework and communication with students and parents66 there have however been concerns about privacy within the context of the education market for chromebooks school officials at schools issuing chromebooks for students have affirmed that students have no right to privacy when using schoolissued chromebooks even at home and that all online and offline activity can be monitored by the school using thirdparty software preinstalled on the laptops70 further the electronic frontier foundation has complained that google itself is violating the privacy of students by enabling the synchronisation function within google chrome chrome sync by default allowing web browsing histories and other data of students including those under13 to be stored on google servers and potentially used for purposes other than authorised educational purposes7172 a point of contention has been the fact that users of schoolissued chromebooks cannot change these settings themselves as a measure to protect their privacy as only the administrator who issued the laptops can change them7172 the eff claims that this violates a student privacy pledge already signed by google in 2014717273 eff staff attorney nate cardozo stated minors shouldnt be tracked or used as guinea pigs with their data treated as a profit center if google wants to use students data to improve google products then it needs to get express consent from parents71 list of chromebooksedit this list is incomplete you can help by expanding it available brand model code namea74 processor battery ram screen resolution

oss keyboard settings google addressed complaints that the operating system offers little functionality when the host device is not connected to the internet demonstrated an offline version of google docs and announced a 3g plan that would give users 100 mb of free data each month with additional paid plans available from verizon30109 the devices usb port is capable of supporting a keyboard mouse ethernet adapter or usb storage but not a printer as chrome os offers no print stack110 adding further hardware outside of the previously mentioned items will likely cause problems with the operating systems self knowing security model111 users instead were encouraged to use a secure service called google cloud print to print to legacy printers connected to their desktop computers or to connect an hp eprint kodak hero kodak esp or epson connect printer to the google cloud print service for a cloud aware printer connection112 the cr48 prototype laptop gave reviewers their first opportunity to evaluate chrome os running on a device ryan paul of ars technica wrote that the machine met the basic requirements for web surfing gaming and personal productivity but falls short for more intensive tasks he praised googles approach to security but wondered whether mainstream computer users would accept an operating system whose only application is a browser he thought chrome os could appeal to some niche audiences people who just need a browser or companies that rely on google apps and other web applications but the operating system was decidedly not a fullfledged alternative to the general purpose computing environments that currently ship on netbooks paul wrote that most of chrome oss advantages can be found in other software environments without having to sacrifice native applications102 in reviewing the cr48 on december 29 2010 kurt bakke of conceivably tech wrote that a chromebook had become the most frequently used family appliance in his household its 15 second startup time and dedicated google user accounts made it the goto device for quick searches email as well as youtube and facebook activities but the device did not replace other five notebooks in the house one for gaming two for the kids and two more for general use the biggest complaint i heard was its lack of performance in flash applications113 in ongoing testing wolfgang gruener also writing in conceivably tech said that cloud computing at cellular data speeds is unacceptable and that the lack of offline ability turns the cr48 into a useless brick when not connected114 its difficult to use the chromebook as an everyday device and give up what you are used to on a macwindows pc while you surely enjoy the dedicated cloud computing capabilities occasionally115 pixeledit main article chromebook pixel chromebook pixel wifi launched by google in february 2013 the chromebook pixel remains the highend machine in the chromebook family the laptop has an unusual 32 display aspect ratio touch screen featuring what was at its debut the highest pixel density of any laptop116 a faster cpu than its predecessors in the intel core i5 and an exterior design described by wired as an austere rectangular block of aluminum with subtly rounded edges117 a second pixel featuring lte wireless communication and twice the storage capacity was shipped for arrival on april 12 2013118 the machine received much media attention with many reviewers questioning the pixels value proposition compared to similarly priced windows machines and the macbook air119120 samsungedit samsung series 5edit samsung series 5 reviewing the samsung series 5 specifications scott stein of cnet was unimpressed with a machine with a 12inch screen and just 16 gb of onboard storage chrome os might be lighter than windows xp but wed still prefer more media storage space at this price you could also get an 116inch 290 mm wifi amd e350powered ultraportable running windows 755 on the other hand mg siegler of techcrunch wrote a largely favorable review praising the improvements in speed and trackpad sensitivity over the cr48 prototype as well as the long battery life and the fact that all models are priced below the ipad121 in june 2011 ifixit dismantled a samsung series 5 and concluded that it was essentially an improved cr48 they rated it as 610 for repairability predominantly because the case has to be opened to change the battery and because the ram chip is soldered to the motherboard ifixit noted that the mostlyplastic construction felt a little cheap on the plus side they stated that the screen was easy to remove and most of the components including the solidstate drive would be easy to replace ifixits kyle wiens wrote that the series 5 fixes the major shortfalls of the cr48 and adds the polish necessary to strike lust into the heart of a broad consumer base sleek looks 8 hours of battery life and optimized performance122 samsung series 5 550edit in may 2012 samsung introduced the chromebook series 5 550 with a wifi model and more expensive 3g model123 reviews generally questioned the value proposition dana wollman of engadget wrote that the chromebooks keyboard put thousanddollar ultrabooks to shame and offered better display quality than on many laptops selling for twice as much but the price seems to exist in a vacuum—a place where tablet apps arent growing more sophisticated where transformerlike win8 tablets arent on the way and where there arent some solid budget windows machines to choose from124 joe wilcox of betanews wrote that price to performance and how it compares to other choices is where chromebook crumbles for many potential buyers he noted that the new models sell for more than their predecessors and while the priceperformance ratio is quite favorable compared to the macbook air by the specs there are plenty of lowercost options125 samsung series 3edit samsung series 3 chromebook in october 2012 the series 3 chromebook was introduced at a san francisco event with the samsung chromebook xe303 the device was cheaper thinner and lighter than the chromebook 550 google marketed the series 3 as the computer for everyone due to its simple operating system chrome os and affordable price target markets included students and firsttime computer users as well as households looking for an extra computer126127 the lower price proved a watershed for some reviewers new york times technology columnist david pogue reversed his earlier thumbsdown verdict on the chromebook writing that 250 changes everything the price is half that of an ipad even less than an ipad mini or an ipod touch and you’re getting a laptop he wrote that the chromebook does many of the things people use computers and laptops for playing flash videos and opening microsoft office documents in other words google is correct when it asserts that the chromebook is perfect for schools second computers in homes and businesses who deploy hundreds of machines1011 cnets review of the series 3 chromebook was even more favorable saying the machine largely delivered as a computer for students and as an additional computer for a household—especially for users who are already using google web applications like google docs google drive and gmail its got workable if not standout hardware its battery life is good it switches on quickly and the 249 price tag means its not as much of a commitment as the 550 samsung series 5 550 that arrived in may the review subtracted points for performance its fine for many tasks but power users accustomed to having more than a couple dozen browser tabs open should steer clear126 samsung chromebook 3edit the chromebook 3 is distinct from and distinguished from the similarly named samsung series 3 in several respects newer released 2016 different architecture intel celeron n3050 instead of exynos 5 dual arm cortex128 thinner 07128 and less expensive about 100 less than the series 3128 while
