publisher john walter on 1 january 1785 as the daily universal register with walter in the role of editor walter had lost his job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company where he was working went bankrupt because of the complaints of a jamaican hurricane being unemployed walter decided to set a new business up it was in that time when henry johnson invented the logography a new typography that was faster and more precise three years later it was proved that it was not as efficient as had been said walter bought the logographys patent and to use it he decided to open a printing house where he would daily produce an advertising sheet the first publication of the newspaper the daily universal register in great britain was 1 january 1785 unhappy because people always omitted the word universal ellias changed the title after 940 editions on 1 january 1788 to the times13 in 1803 walter handed ownership and editorship to his son of the same name walter sr had spent sixteen months in newgate prison for libel printed in the times but his pioneering efforts to obtain continental news especially from france helped build the papers reputation among policy makers and financiers the times used contributions from significant figures in the fields of politics science literature and the arts to build its reputation for much of its early life the profits of the times were very large and the competition minimal so it could pay far better than its rivals for information or writers beginning in 1814 the paper was printed on the new steamdriven cylinder press developed by friedrich koenig14 in 1815 the times had a circulation of 500015 thomas barnes was appointed general editor in 1817 in the same year the papers printer james lawson died and passed the business onto his son john joseph lawson1802–1852 under the editorship of barnes and his successor in 1841 john thadeus delane the influence of the times rose to great heights especially in politics and amongst the city of london peter fraser and edward sterling were two noted journalists and gained for the times the pompoussatirical nickname the thunderer from we thundered out the other day an article on social and political reform the increased circulation and influence of the paper was based in part to its early adoption of the steamdriven rotary printing press distribution via steam trains to rapidly growing concentrations of urban populations helped ensure the profitability of the paper and its growing influence16 the times was the first newspaper to send war correspondents to cover particular conflicts w h russell the papers correspondent with the army in the crimean war was immensely influential17 with his dispatches back to england a wounded british officer reading the timess report of the end of the crimean war in john everett millais painting peace concluded in other events of the nineteenth century the times opposed the repeal of the corn laws until the number of demonstrations convinced the editorial board otherwise and only reluctantly supported aid to victims of the irish potato famine it enthusiastically supported the great reform bill of 1832 which reduced corruption and increased the electorate from 400000 people to 800000 people still a small minority of the population during the american civil war the times represented the view of the wealthy classes favouring the secessionists but it was not a supporter of slavery the third john walter the founders grandson succeeded his father in 1847 the paper continued as more or less independent but from the 1850s the times was beginning to suffer from the rise in competition from the penny press notably the daily telegraph and the morning post during the 19th century it was not infrequent for the foreign office to approach the times and ask for continental intelligence which was often superior to that conveyed by official sourcescitation needed 1890 to 1981edit the times faced financial extinction in 1890 under arthur fraser walter but it was rescued by an energetic editor charles frederic moberly bell during his tenure 1890–1911 the times became associated with selling the encyclopædia britannica using aggressive american marketing methods introduced by horace everett hooper and his advertising executive henry haxton due to legal fights between the britannicas two owners hooper and walter montgomery jackson the times severed its connection in 1908 and was bought by pioneering newspaper magnate alfred harmsworth later lord northcliffe in editorials published on 29 and 31 july 1914 wickham steed the timess chief editor argued that the british empire should enter world war i18 on 8 may 1920 also under the editorship of steed the times in an editorial endorsed the antisemitic fabrication the protocols of the learned elders of zion as a genuine document and called jews the worlds greatest danger in the leader entitled the jewish peril a disturbing pamphlet call for inquiry steed wrote about the protocols of the elders of zion what are these protocols are they authentic if so what malevolent assembly concocted these plans and gloated over their exposition are they forgery if so whence comes the uncanny note of prophecy prophecy in part fulfilled in part so far gone in the way of fulfillment19 the following year when philip graves the constantinople modern istanbul correspondent of the times exposed the protocols as a forgery the times retracted the editorial of the previous year in 1922 john jacob astor son of the 1st viscount astor bought the times from the northcliffe estate the paper gained a measure of notoriety in the 1930s with its advocacy of german appeasement editor geoffrey dawson was closely allied with those in the government who practised appeasement most notably neville chamberlain kim philby a double agent with primary allegiance to the soviet union was a correspondent for the newspaper in spain during the spanish civil war of the late 1930s philby was admired for his courage in obtaining highquality reporting from the front lines of the bloody conflict he later joined british military intelligence mi6 during world war ii was promoted into senior positions after the war ended and defected to the soviet union when discovery was inevitable in 196320 roy thomson between 1941 and 1946 the leftwing british historian e h carr was assistant editor carr was well known for the strongly prosoviet tone of his editorials21 in december 1944 when fighting broke out in athens between the greek communist elas and the british army carr in a times leader sided with the communists leading winston churchill to condemn him and the article in a speech to the house of commons22 as a result of carrs editorial the times became popularly known during that stage of world war ii as the threepenny daily worker the price of the communist partys daily worker being one penny23 on 3 may 1966 it resumed printing news on the front page – previously the front page had been given over to small advertisements usually of interest to the moneyed classes in british society also in 1966 the royal arms which had been a feature of the newspapers masthead since its inception was abandoned24 in 1967 members of the astor family sold the paper to canadian publishing magnate roy thomson his thomson corporation brought it under the same ownership as the sunday times to form times newspapers limited an industrial dispute prompted the management to shut the paper for nearly a year from 1 december 1978 to 12 november 197925 the thomson corporation management were struggling to run the business due to the 1979 energy crisis and union demands management sought a buyer who was in a position to guarantee the survival of both titles and had the resources and was committed to funding the introduction of modern printing methods several suitors appeared including robert maxwell tiny rowland and lord rothermere however only one buyer was in a position to meet the full thomson remit australian media magnate rupert murdoch robert holmes à court another australian magnate had previously tried to buy the times in 1980 from 1981edit the times cover 5 june 2013 in 1981 the times and the sunday times were bought from thomson by rupert murdochs news international26 the acquisition followed three weeks of intensive bargaining with the unions by company negotiators john collier and bill oneill the royal arms was reintroduced to the masthead at about this time but whereas previously it had been that of the reigning monarch it would now be that of the house of hanover who were on the throne when the newspaper was founded after 14 years as editor william reesmogg resigned upon completion of the change of ownership27 murdoch began to make his mark on the paper by appointing harold evans as his replacement28 one of his most important changes was the introduction of new technology and efficiency measures between march 1981 and may 1982 following agreement with print unions the hotmetal linotype printing process used to print the times since the 19th century was phased out and replaced by computer input and photocomposition this allowed print room staff at the times and the sunday times to be reduced by half however direct input of text by journalists singlestroke input was still not achieved and this was to remain an interim measure until the wapping dispute of 1986 when the times moved from new printing house square in grays inn road near fleet street to new offices in wapping2930 robert fisk31 seven times british international journalist of the year32 resigned as foreign correspondent in 1988 over what he saw as political censorship of his article on the shootingdown of iran air flight 655 in july 1988 he wrote in detail about his reasons for resigning from the paper due to meddling with his stories and the papers proisrael stance33 in june 1990 the times ceased its policy of using courtesy titles mr mrs or miss prefixes for living persons before full names on first reference but it continues to use them before surnames on subsequent references the more formal style is now confined to the court and social page though ms is now acceptable in that section as well as before surnames in news sections in november 2003 news international began producing the newspaper in both broadsheet and tabloid

green of castle morris pembrokeshire has had more letters published on the main letters page than any other known contributor – 158 by 31 january 2008 according to its leading article from our own correspondents the reason for removal of full postal addresses was to fit more letters onto the page in a 2007 meeting with the house of lords select committee on communications which was investigating media ownership and the news murdoch stated that the law and the independent board prevented him from exercising editorial control34 in may 2008 printing of the times switched from wapping to new plants at waltham cross in hertfordshire and merseyside and glasgow enabling the paper to be produced with full colour on every page for the first time on 26 july 2012 to coincide with

made by miller and co later miller richards in edinburgh around 1813 generally referred to as modern when the times began using monotype and other hotmetal machines in 1908 this design was remade by monotype for its equipment as near as i can tell it looks like monotype series no 1 — modern which was based on a miller richards typeface — was what was used up until 1932 — dan rhatigan type director49 an example of the times new roman typeface in 1908 the times started using the monotype modern typeface50 the times commissioned the serif typeface times new roman created by victor lardent at the english branch of monotype in 193151 it was commissioned after stanley morison had written an article criticizing the times for being badly printed and typographically antiquated52 the font was supervised by morison and drawn by victor lardent an artist from the advertising department of the times morison used an older font named plantin as the basis for his design but made revisions for legibility and economy of space times new roman made its debut in the issue of 3 october 193253 after one year the design was released for commercial sale the times stayed with times new roman for 40 years but new production techniques and the format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 2004 have caused the newspaper to switch font five times since 1972 however all the new fonts have been variants

designer neville brody56 political allegianceedit historically the paper was not overtly protory or whig but has been a long time bastion of the english establishment and empire the times adopted a stance described as peculiarly detached at the 1945 general election although it was increasingly critical of the conservative partys campaign it did not advocate a vote for any one party57 however the newspaper reverted to the tories for the next election five years later it supported the conservatives for the subsequent three elections followed by support for both the conservatives and the liberal party for the next five elections expressly supporting a conlib coalition in 1974 the paper then backed the conservatives solidly until 1997 when it declined to make any party endorsement but supported individual primarily eurosceptic candidates58 for the 2001 general election the times declared its support for tony blairs labour government which was reelected by a landslide although not as large as in 1997 it supported labour again in 2005 when labour achieved a third successive win though with a reduced majority59 in 2004 according to mori the voting intentions of its readership were 40 for the conservative party 29 for the liberal democrats and 26 for labour60 for the 2010 general election the newspaper declared its support for the conservatives once again the election ended in the tories taking the most votes and seats but having to form a coalition with the liberal democrats in order to form a government as they had failed to gain an overall majority61 this makes it the most varied newspaper in terms of political support in british history62 some columnists in the times are connected to the conservative party such as daniel finkelstein tim montgomerie matthew parris and matt ridley but there are also columnists connected to the labour party such as david aaronovitch philip collins and jenni russell the times occasionally makes endorsements for foreign elections
