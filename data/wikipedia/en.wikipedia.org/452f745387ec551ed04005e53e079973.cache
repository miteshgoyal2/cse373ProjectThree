facebooks of nine houses placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the “hotter” person15 facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22000 photoviews in its first four hours online16

the downside of having someone unfriend or reject another person404 whitbourne refers to unfriended persons on facebook as victims of estrangement404 unfriending someone is seldom a mutual decision

entertaining happens in real life people feel the need to share it it might seem harmless however at some point people begin to substitute one reality with another as a result people start to change their behavior and even their assumptions about life love and friendships based on the facebook reality this leads to cognitive dissonance such a discrepancy between perceptions and beliefs can damage
