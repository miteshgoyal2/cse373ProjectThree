with indymedia18 a coop started in 1999 that has since spread to many cities around the world in the decade since the founding of indymedia all of the citys mainstream media outlets have established or augmented their online presence and numerous blogs have sprung up to supplement traditional media the city hit another first when the seattle postintelligencer became the first onlineonly newspaper in the nation and as seattlepicom that outlet has experimented with its growth by adding reader blogs and neighborhoodfocused blogs the pi first began experimenting with blogdriven community engagement with the big blog a local news blog whose founding reporter used to hold regular public meetups with seattle residents a practice now embraced by other local bloggers as well4 across the

by a number of online media outlets the city of seattle information technology department identified 260 websites focused on seattles local neighborhoods and communities including nontraditional linked news and information outlets4 much of this online activity is driven by the rich hyperlocal news scene in the city which has seen an exponential growth this past decade this has been led in the area by sites such as westseattleblogcom24 and myballardcom25 but also old media companies such as komo26 theres a pair of articles here27 and here28 covering the ad scene for hyperlocal in january 2010 seattles online hyperlocal media vary greatly in terms of web traffic scope and resources some sites are run by journalists first trained in traditional media such as next door media a network of 10 neighborhood blogs that nets a combined 1 million page views per month by comparison seattletimescom and seattlepicom average 45 million and 40 million monthly page views respectively jcapitol hill seattle another popular hyperlocal blog commands 200000 monthly page views and west seattle blog 900000 despite varied audiences a content analysis conducted by the new america foundation found that online media are filling gaps in news coverage left by traditional media the study looked at capitol hill seattle west seattle blog my ballard wallyhood seattlepicom and seattletimescom and found that the first four sources all hyperlocal blogs devoted a greater percentage of their news coverage to issues specific to seattles neighborhoods seattletimescom and seattlepicom on the other hand covered more metro national and international news the blogs devoted a greater percentage of their coverage to the combined subjects of politics health education employment social services and arts and entertainment4 the background to seattles extensive coverage on the internet is the citys history of flourishing alternative media ranging from small presses to low power fm radio broadcasting the independent volunteerrun krabfm radio a high powered station that operated on 1077 mhz in the regular broadcast band influenced a generation of listeners during the 1960s and 1970s later before internet radio became practical a number of very low power microradio fm stations broadcast on the few fm frequencies not allocated to high power stations currently fcc deliberations and rulings about internet radio are followed not only by internet entrepreneurs but also by those seattleites who produced and listened to local radio as well as by those who produce and read the numerous local print

northwest film forum analysisedit friedland 2014 and others have lauded seattle as a model for the nation and perhaps the world in its robust civic communication ecology that attempts to provide high speed internet access and computer and media training to all including those with low incomes that has allegedly contributed to a higher rate of democratic participation than elsewhere friedland identified three key features of this a robust healthy local newspaper the seattle times with a strong online presence that will be a hub of connection rather than the single authoritative fount of knowledge a civic communications network that is equally accessible to everyone subsidized at least initially by municipal investment in neighborhood centers that provide free or lowcost training in computer and media literacy a larger civic communication ecology resting on the foundation of a robust microecology among individuals niches groups and neighborhoods that generates information from below in this system news percolates up as well as down with news writing and research being shared between levels in an open and conscious way this system has been created out of a combination of the hightech base of the metro area with higher than average education level and incomes but with modest grants typically a few thousand dollars for a variety of projects funded by government jlab and the john s and james l knight foundation29 referencesedit list of newspapers in the united states by circulation a b market ranks and schedule 150 2009 arbitroncom nielsen media research local universe
