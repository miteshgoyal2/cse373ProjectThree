all over the world to play basketball with the globetrotters and other teams6 realizing that his collection had grown to a size worthy of a museum he wanted to share or donate some of his collection to an officially recognized location however he was unable to locate a place that exclusively displayed celebrated and collected information about the great accomplishments of rb artists besides the rock and roll hall of fame in his hometown cleveland while donating some items to the rock hall he realized that a lot of well deserving rb artists will never be given the type of recognition or honor that they deserve he then decided to pursue creating such a place acquiring the support of friends some of which are rhythm blues and jazz musicians after many years of planning a mobile museum
