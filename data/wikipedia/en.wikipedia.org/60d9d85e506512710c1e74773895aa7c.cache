landis was born into a jewish family in chicago illinois the son of shirley levine née magaziner and marshall landis an interior designer and decorator4 landis and his parents relocated to los angeles when he was four months old though spending his childhood in california landis still refers to chicago as his hometown and is a big fan of the chicago white sox baseball team when landis was a young boy he watched the 7th voyage of sinbad which inspired him to become a director5 i had complete suspension of disbelief—really i was eight years old and it transported me i was on that beach running from that dragon fighting that cyclops it just really dazzled me and i bought it completely and so i actually sat through it twice and when i got home i asked my mom “who does that who makes the movie”6 careeredit earlyedit landis began his film career working as a mailboy at 20th century fox he worked as a gofer and then as an assistant director during filming mgms kellys heroes in yugoslavia in 1969 he replaced the films original assistant director who became ill and was sent home7 during that time landis became acquainted with actors don rickles and donald sutherland both of whom would later work in his films following kellys heroes landis worked on several films that were shot in europe especially in italy and england including once upon a time in the west el condor and a town called bastard aka a town called hell7 landis also worked as a stunt double i worked on some pirates movies all kind of movies french foreign movies i worked on a movie called red sun where toshiro mifune kills me puts a sword through me i worked as a stunt guy i worked as a dialogue coach i worked as an actor i worked as a production assistant7 landis made his feature debut in 1971 as a director in the us with schlock he was 21 years old the film which he also wrote and appeared in is a tribute to monster movies7 the gorilla suit for the film was made by rick baker—the beginning of a longterm collaboration between landis and baker schlock was a failure and landis was not offered another directing job for some timecitation needed in 1977 landis directed kentucky fried movie the film was inspired by the satirical sketch comedy of shows like monty python free the army the national lampoon radio hour and saturday night live7 1978–1981edit in 1978 landis directed his first film for universal studios national lampoons animal house which was financially successful earning over 120 million domestically at the box office8 in 1980 he cowrote and directed the blues brothers a comedy starring john belushi and dan aykroyd it featured musical numbers by rb and soul legends james brown cab calloway aretha franklin ray charles and john lee hooker it was at the time one of the most expensive films ever made costing almost 30 million for comparison steven spielbergs contemporary film 1941 cost 35 million it is speculated that spielberg and landis engaged in a rivalry the goal of which was to make the more expensive movie7 the rivalry might have been a friendly one as spielberg makes a cameo appearance in blues brothers as the unnamed desk clerk near the end and landis had made a cameo in 1941 as a messenger in 1981 landis wrote and directed another cultstatus movie the comedyhorror an american werewolf in london it was perhaps landiss most personal project he had been planning to make it since 1969 while in yugoslavia twilight zone deathsedit main article twilight zone accident on july 23 1982 during the filming of twilight zone actor vic morrow and child extras myca dinh le age 7 and renee shinyi chen age 6 were killed in an accident involving an outofcontrol helicopter the three were caught under the aircraft when it crashed9 the national transportation safety board reported in october 1984 the probable cause of the accident was the detonation of debrisladen high temperature special effects explosions too near a lowflying helicopter leading to foreign object damage to one rotor blade and delamination due to heat to the other rotor blade the separation of the helicopters tail rotor assembly and the uncontrolled descent of the helicopter the proximity of the helicopter to the special effects explosions was due to the failure to establish direct communications and coordination between the pilot who was in command of the helicopter operation and the film director who was in charge of the filming operation10 landis and four other crew members were charged with involuntary manslaughter the prosecutors attempted to show that landis was reckless and had not told the parents and others of the childrens proximity to explosives and helicopters and of limitations on their working hours9 he admitted that he had violated the california law regulating employment of children by using the children after hours and conceded that that was wrong but he denied culpability9 numerous members of the film crew testified that the director was warned but ignored these dangers after a ninemonth jury trial during 1986 and 1987 landis represented by criminal defense attorney harland braun and the other crew members were acquitted of the charges11 landis was later reprimanded for circumventing the state of californias child labor laws in hiring the two children this tragedy resulted in stricter safety measures and enforcement of child labor laws in california11 the parents of the children sued and eventually settled out of court with the studio for 2 million per family morrows children one of them being actress jennifer jason leigh who was 20 at the time also settled out of court for an undisclosed sum during an interview with giulia dagnolo vallan landis said when you read about the accident they say we were blowing up huts—which we werent—and that debris hit the tail rotor of the helicopter—which it didnt the fbi crime lab who was working for the prosecution finally figured out that tail rotor delaminated which is why the pilot lost control the special effects man who made the mistake by setting off a fireball at the wrong time was never charged7 subsequent film careeredit trading places a prince and the
