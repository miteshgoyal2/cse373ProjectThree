formerly the bureau of investigation boi is the domestic intelligence and security service of the united states and its principal federal law enforcement agency operating under the jurisdiction of the us department of justice the fbi is also a member of the us intelligence community and reports to both the attorney general and the director of national intelligence3 a leading us counterterrorism counterintelligence and criminal investigative organization the fbi has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes45 although many of the fbis functions are unique its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the british mi5 and the russian fsb unlike the central intelligence agency cia which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection overseas the fbi is primarily a domestic agency maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the united states and more than 400 resident agencies in lesser cities and areas across the nation at an fbi field office a seniorlevel fbi officer concurrently serves as the representative of the director of national intelligence67 despite its domestic focus the fbi also maintains a significant international footprint operating 60 legal attache legat offices and 15 suboffices in us embassies and consulates across the globe these overseas offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries8 the fbi can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas9 just as the cia has a limited domestic function these activities generally require coordination across government agencies the fbi was established in 1908 as the bureau of investigation the boi or bi for short its name was changed to the federal bureau of investigation fbi in 1935 the fbi headquarters is the j edgar hoover building located in washington dc contents 1

the united states and to provide leadership and criminal justice services to federal state municipal and international agencies and partners5 currently the fbis top priorities are10 protect the united states from terrorist attacks protect the united states against foreign intelligence operations and espionage protect the united states against cyberbased attacks and hightechnology crimes combat public corruption at all levels protect civil rights combat transnationalnational criminal organizations and enterprises combat major whitecollar crime combat significant violent crime support federal state local and international partners and upgrade technology to enable and further the successful performances of its missions as stated above history background in 1896 the national bureau of criminal identification was founded which provided agencies across the country with information to identify known criminals the 1901 assassination of president william mckinley created a perception that america was under threat from anarchists the departments of justice and labor had been keeping records on anarchists for years but president theodore roosevelt wanted more power to monitor them11 the justice department had been tasked with the regulation of interstate commerce since 1887 though it lacked the staff to do so it had made little effort to relieve its staff shortage until the oregon land fraud scandal at the turn of the 20th century president roosevelt instructed attorney general charles bonaparte to organize an autonomous investigative service that would report only to the attorney general12 bonaparte reached out to other agencies including the us secret service for personnel investigators in particular on may 27 1908 the congress forbade this use of treasury employees by the justice department citing fears that the new agency would serve as a secret police department13 again at roosevelts urging bonaparte moved to organize a formal bureau of investigation which would then have its own staff of special agents11 creation the bureau of investigation boi was created on july 26 1908 after the congress had adjourned for the summer11 attorney general bonaparte using department of justice expense funds11 hired thirtyfour people including some veterans of the secret service1415 to work for a new investigative agency its first chief the title is now known as director was stanley finch bonaparte notified the congress of these actions in december 190811 the bureaus first official task was visiting and making surveys of the houses of prostitution in preparation for enforcing the white slave traffic act or mann act passed on june 25 1910 in 1932 the bureau was renamed the united states bureau of investigation the following year it was linked to the bureau of prohibition and rechristened the division of investigation doi before finally becoming an independent service within the department of justice in 193514 in the same year its name was officially changed from the division of investigation to the presentday federal bureau of investigation or fbi j edgar hoover as fbi director j edgar hoover fbi director from 1924 to 1972 j edgar hoover served as fbi director from 1924 to 1972 a combined 48 years with the boi doi and fbi he was chiefly responsible for creating the scientific crime detection laboratory or the fbi laboratory which officially opened in 1932 as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the fbi handled during his tenure but as detailed below his proved to be a highly controversial tenure as bureau director especially in its later years after hoovers death the congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future fbi directors to ten years early homicide investigations of the new agency included the osage indian murders during the war on crime of the 1930s fbi agents apprehended or killed a number of notorious criminals who carried out kidnappings robberies and murders throughout the nation including john dillinger baby face nelson kate ma barker alvin creepy karpis and george machine gun kelly other activities of its early decades included a decisive role in reducing the scope and influence of the ku klux klan additionally through the work of edwin atherton the boi claimed success in apprehending an entire army of mexican neorevolutionaries under the leadership of general enrique estrada in the mid1920s east of san diego california hoover began using wiretapping in the 1920s during prohibition to arrest bootleggers16 in the 1927 case olmstead v united states in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping the united states supreme court ruled that fbi wiretaps did not violate the fourth amendment as unlawful search and seizure as long as the fbi did not break into a persons home to complete the tapping16 after prohibitions repeal congress passed the communications act of 1934 which outlawed nonconsensual phone tapping but did allow bugging16 in the 1939 case nardone v united states the court ruled that due to the 1934 law evidence the fbi obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court16 after the 1967 case katz v united states overturned the 1927 case that had allowed bugging congress passed the omnibus crime control act allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations as long as they obtained warrants beforehand16 national security beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s the bureau investigated cases of espionage against the united states and its allies eight nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against american targets were arrested and six were executed ex parte quirin under their sentences also during this time a joint usuk codebreaking effort called the venona project—with which the fbi was heavily involved—broke soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes allowing the us and british governments to read soviet communications this effort confirmed the existence of americans working in the united states for soviet intelligence17 hoover was administering this project but he failed to notify the central intelligence agency cia of it until 1952 another notable case was the arrest of soviet spy rudolf abel in 195718 the discovery of soviet spies operating in the us allowed hoover to pursue his longstanding obsession with the threat he perceived from the american left ranging from communist party of the united states of america cpusa union organizers to american liberals japanese american internment in 1939 the bureau began compiling a custodial detention list with the names of those who would be taken into custody in the event of war with axis nations the majority of the names on the list belonged to issei community leaders as the fbi investigation built on an existing naval intelligence index that had focused on japanese americans in hawaii and the west coast but many german and italian nationals also found their way onto the secret list19 robert shivers head of the honolulu office obtained permission from hoover to start detaining those on the list on december 7 1941 while bombs were still falling over pearl harbor20 mass arrests and searches of homes in most cases conducted without warrants began a few hours after the attack and over the next several weeks more than 5500 issei men were taken into fbi custody21 on february 19 1942 president franklin roosevelt issued executive order 9066 authorizing the removal of japanese americans from the west coast fbi director hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of japanese americans authorized under executive order 9066 but roosevelt prevailed22 the vast majority went along with the subsequent exclusion orders but in a handful of cases where japanese americans refused to obey the new military regulations fbi agents handled their arrests20 the bureau continued surveillance on japanese americans throughout the war conducting background checks on applicants for resettlement outside camp and entering the camps usually without the permission of war relocation authority officials and grooming informants to monitor dissidents and troublemakers after the war the fbi was assigned to protect returning japanese americans from attacks by hostile white communities20 civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s fbi officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders whom they believed either had communist ties or were unduly influenced by communists or fellow travelers in 1956 for example hoover sent an open letter denouncing dr trm howard a civil rights leader surgeon and wealthy entrepreneur in mississippi who had criticized fbi inaction in solving recent murders of george w lee emmett till and other blacks in the south23 the fbi carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the cointelpro a portmanteau derived from counterintelligence program24 it was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the united states including both militant and nonviolent organizations among its targets was the southern christian leadership conference a leading civil rights organization whose clergy leadership included the rev dr martin luther king jr who is addressed in more detail below25 the fbi frequently investigated martin luther king jr in the mid1960s king began publicly criticizing the bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of terrorism by white supremacists hoover responded by publicly calling king the most notorious liar in the united states26 in his 1991 memoir washington post journalist carl rowan asserted that the fbi had sent at least one anonymous letter to king encouraging him to commit suicide27 historian taylor branch documents an anonymous november 1964 suicide package sent by the bureau that combined a letter to the civil rights leader telling him you are done there is only one way out for you with audio recordings of kings sexual indiscretions28 in march 1971 the residential office of an fbi agent in media pennsylvania was burgled by a group calling itself the citizens commission to investigate the fbi numerous files were taken and distributed to a range of newspapers including the harvard crimson29 the files detailed the fbis extensive cointelpro program which included investigations into lives of ordinary citizens—including a black student group at a pennsylvania military college and the daughter of congressman henry reuss of wisconsin29 the country was jolted by the revelations which included assassinations of political activists and the actions were denounced by members of the congress including house majority leader hale boggs29 the phones of some members of the congress including boggs had allegedly been tapped29 kennedys assassination when president john f kennedy was shot and killed the jurisdiction fell to the local police departments until president lyndon b johnson directed the fbi to take over the investigation30 to ensure clarity about the responsibility for investigation of homicides of federal officials the congress passed a law that included investigations of such deaths of federal officials especially by homicide within fbi jurisdiction this new law was passed in 1965313233 organized crime an fbi surveillance photograph of joseph d pistone aka donnie brasco benjamin lefty ruggiero and edgar robb aka tony rossi 1980s in response to organized crime on august 25 1953 the fbi created the top hoodlum program the national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers34 after the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico act took effect the fbi began investigating the former prohibitionorganized groups which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns all of the fbi work was done undercover and from within these organizations using the provisions provided in the rico act gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups although hoover initially denied the existence of a national crime syndicate in the united states the bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families including those headed by sam giancana and john gotti the rico act is still used today for all organized crime and any individuals who may fall under the acts provisions in 2003 a congressional committee called the fbis organized crime informant program one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement35 the fbi allowed four innocent men to be convicted of the march 1965 gangland murder of edward teddy deegan in order to protect vincent flemmi an fbi informant three of the men were sentenced to death which was later reduced to life in prison and the fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison35 two of the four men died in prison after serving almost 30 years and two others were released after serving 32 and 36 years in july 2007 us district judge nancy gertner in boston found that the bureau had helped convict the four men using false witness accounts given by mobster joseph barboza the us government was ordered to pay 100 million in damages to the four defendants36 special fbi teams fbi swat agents in a training exercise in 1982 the fbi formed an elite unit37 to help with problems that might arise at the 1984 summer olympics to be held in los angeles particularly terrorism and majorcrime this was a result of the 1972 summer olympics in munich germany when terrorists murdered the israeli athletes named the hostage rescue team or hrt it acts as the fbi lead for a national swat team in related procedures and all counterterrorism cases also formed in 1984 was the computer analysis and response team or cart38 from the end of the 1980s to the early 1990s the fbi reassigned more than 300 agents from foreign counterintelligence duties to violent crime and made violent crime the sixth national priority with reduced cuts to other wellestablished departments and because terrorism was no longer considered a threat after the end of the cold war38 the fbi assisted local and state police forces in tracking fugitives who had crossed state lines which is a federal offense the fbi laboratory helped develop dna testing continuing its pioneering role in identification that began with its fingerprinting system in 1924 notable efforts in the 1990s an fbi agent tags the cockpit voice recorder from egyptair flight 990 on the deck of the uss grapple ars 53 at the crash site on november 13 1999 between 1993 and 1996 the fbi increased its counterterrorism role in the wake of the first 1993 world trade center bombing in new york city new york the 1995 oklahoma city bombing in oklahoma city oklahoma and the arrest of the unabomber in 1996 technological innovation and the skills of fbi laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted39 but justice department investigations into the fbis roles in the ruby ridge and waco incidents were found to have been obstructed by agents within the bureau during the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta georgia the fbi was criticized for its investigation of the centennial olympic park bombing it has settled a dispute with richard jewell who was a private security guard at the venue along with some media organizations40 in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation this had briefly led to his being wrongly suspected of the bombing after congress passed the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea 1994 the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa 1996 and the economic espionage act eea 1996 the fbi followed suit and underwent a technological upgrade in 1998 just as it did with its cart team in 1991 computer investigations and infrastructure threat assessment center citac and the national infrastructure protection center nipc were created to deal with the increase in internetrelated problems such as computer viruses worms and other malicious programs that threatened us operations with these developments the fbi increased its electronic surveillance in public safety and national security investigations adapting to the telecommunications advancements that changed the nature of such problems september 11 attacks september 11 attacks at the pentagon during the september 11 2001 attacks on the world trade center fbi agent leonard w hatton jr was killed during the rescue effort while helping the rescue personnel evacuate the occupants of the south tower and he stayed when it collapsed within months after the attacks fbi director robert mueller who had been sworn in a week before the attacks called for a reengineering of fbi structure and operations he made countering every federal crime a top priority including the prevention of terrorism countering foreign intelligence operations addressing cyber security threats other hightech crimes protecting civil rights combating public corruption organized crime whitecollar crime and major acts of violent crime41 in february 2001 robert hanssen was caught selling information to the russian government it was later learned that hanssen who had reached a high position within the fbi had been selling intelligence since as early as 1979 he pleaded guilty to treason and received a life sentence in 2002 but the incident led many to question the security practices employed by the fbi there was also a claim that hanssen might have contributed information that led to the september 11 2001 attacks42 the 911 commissions final report on july 22 2004 stated that the fbi and central intelligence agency cia were both partially to blame for not pursuing intelligence reports that could have prevented the september 11 2001 attacks in its most damning assessment the report concluded that the country had not been well served by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the fbi43 while the fbi did accede to most of the recommendations including oversight by the new director of national intelligence some former members of the 911 commission publicly criticized the fbi in october 2005 claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes44 on july 8 2007 the washington post published excerpts from ucla professor amy zegarts book spying blind the cia the fbi and the origins of 91145 the post reported from zegarts book that government documents showed that both the cia and the fbi had missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the primary reasons for the failures included agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas inappropriate incentives for promotion and a lack of cooperation between the fbi cia and the rest of the united states intelligence community the book blamed the fbis decentralized structure which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different fbi offices the book suggested that the fbi had not evolved into an effective counterterrorism or counterintelligence agency due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change for example fbi personnel practices continued to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff classifying intelligence analysts alongside the fbis auto mechanics and janitors46 faulty bullet analysis for over 40 years the fbi crime lab in quantico had believed that lead alloys used in bullets had unique chemical signatures it was analyzing the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory but also to a single box of bullets the national academy of sciences conducted an 18month independent review of comparative bulletlead analysis in 2003 its national research council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of fbi testimony it found the analytic model used by the fbi for interpreting results was deeply flawed and the conclusion that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence one year later the fbi decided to stop conducting bullet lead analyses47 after a 60 minuteswashington post investigation in november 2007 two years later the bureau agreed to identify review and release all pertinent cases and notify prosecutors about cases in which faulty testimony was given48 organization organizational structure fbi

investigating violations of the act in addition to prosecuting such violations with the united states department of justice doj the fbi also shares concurrent jurisdiction with the drug enforcement administration dea in the enforcement of the controlled substances act of 1970 the usa patriot act increased the powers allotted to the fbi especially in wiretapping and monitoring of internet activity one of the most controversial provisions of the act is the socalled sneak and peek provision granting the fbi powers to search a house while the residents are away and not requiring them to notify the residents for several weeks afterwards under the patriot acts provisions the fbi also resumed inquiring into the library records51 of those who are suspected of terrorism something it had supposedly not done since the 1970s in the early 1980s senate hearings were held to examine fbi undercover operations in the wake of the abscam controversy which had allegations of entrapment of elected officials as a result in following years a number of guidelines were issued to constrain fbi activities a march 2007 report by the inspector general of the justice department described the fbis widespread and serious misuse of national security letters a form of administrative subpoena used to demand records and data pertaining to individuals the report said that between 2003 and 2005 the fbi had issued more than 140000 national security letters many involving people with no obvious connections to terrorism52 information obtained through an fbi investigation is presented to the appropriate us attorney or department of justice official who decides if prosecution or other action is warranted the fbi often works in conjunction with other federal agencies including the us coast guard uscg and us customs and border protection cbp in seaport and airport security53 and the national transportation safety board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents

380 million ended up over budget and behind schedule66 efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful but attempts to develop new investigation software outsourced to science applications international corporation saic were not virtual case file or vcf as the software was known was plagued by poorly defined goals and repeated changes in management67 in january 2005 more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion the fbi officially abandoned the project at least 100 million and much more by some estimates was spent on the project which never became operational the fbi has been forced to continue using its decadeold automated case support system which it experts consider woefully inadequate in march 2005 the fbi announced it was beginning a new more ambitious software project codenamed sentinel which they expected to complete by 200968 the fbi field office in chelsea massachusetts carnivore was an electronic eavesdropping software system implemented by the fbi during the clinton administration it was designed to monitor email and electronic communications after prolonged negative coverage in the press the

to state and local law enforcement personnel first published in 1932 as fugitives wanted by police90 the fbi law bulletin covers topics including law enforcement technology and issues such as crime mapping and use of force as well as recent criminal justice research and vicap alerts on wanted suspects and key cases the fbi also publishes some reports for both law enforcement personnel as well as regular citizens covering topics including law enforcement terrorism cybercrime whitecollar crime violent crime and statistics91 however the vast majority of federal government publications covering these topics are published by the office of justice programs agencies of the united states department of justice and disseminated through the national criminal justice reference service crime statistics in the 1920s the fbi began issuing crime reports by gathering numbers from local police departments92 due to limitations of this system found during the 1960s and 1970s—victims often simply did not report crimes to the police in the first place—the department of justice developed an alternate method of tallying crime the victimization survey92 uniform crime reports main article uniform crime reports the uniform crime reports ucr compile data from over 17000 law enforcement agencies across the country they provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest clearance or closing a case and law enforcement officer information the ucr focuses its data collection on violent crimes hate crimes and property crimes91 created in the 1920s the ucr system has not proven to be as uniform as its name implies the ucr data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape since about 93 of the data submitted to the fbi is in this format the ucr stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data preliminary annual uniform crime report for 2006 was released on june 4 2006 the report shows violent crime offenses rose 13 but the number of property crime offenses decreased 29 compared to 200593 national incidentbased reporting system main article national incidentbased reporting system the national incidentbased reporting system nibrs crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in ucr data the system is used by law enforcement agencies in the united states for collecting and reporting data on crimes local state and federal agencies generate nibrs data from their records management systems data is collected on every incident and arrest in the group a offense category the group a offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the nibrs system in addition to the group a offenses eleven group b offenses are reported with only the arrest information the nibrs system is in greater detail than the summarybased ucr system as of 2004 5271 law enforcement agencies submitted nibrs data that amount represents 20 of the united states population and 16 of the crime statistics data collected by the fbi eguardian eguardian is the name of an fbi system launched in january 2009 to share tips about possible terror threats with local police agencies the program aims to get law enforcement at all levels sharing data quickly about suspicious activity and people94 eguardian enables near realtime sharing and tracking of terror information and suspicious activities with local state tribal and federal agencies the eguardian system is a spinoff of a similar but classified tool called guardian that has been used inside the fbi and shared with vetted partners since 200595 controversies throughout its history the bureau has been the subject of a number of controversial cases both at home and abroad files on us citizens the fbi has maintained files on numerous people including celebrities such as elvis presley frank sinatra john denver john lennon jane fonda groucho marx charlie chaplin the band mc5 lou costello sonny bono bob dylan michael jackson and mickey mantle the files were collected for various reasons some of the subjects were investigated for alleged ties to the communist party charlie chaplin and groucho marx or in connection with antiwar activities during the vietnam war john denver john lennon and jane fonda numerous celebrity files concern threats or extortion attempts against them sonny bono john denver john lennon elvis presley michael jackson mickey mantle groucho marx and frank sinatra96 covert operations on political groups image from the fbi monograph of the nation of islam 1965 elijah muhammad cointelpro tactics have been alleged to include discrediting targets through psychological warfare smearing individuals and groups using forged documents and by planting false reports in the media harassment wrongful imprisonment and illegal violence9798 the fbis stated motivation was protecting national security preventing violence and maintaining the existing social and political order99 fbi records show that 85 of cointelpro resources targeted groups and individuals that the fbi deemed subversive100 including communist and socialist organizations organizations and individuals associated with the civil rights movement including martin luther king jr and others associated with the southern christian leadership conference the national association for the advancement of colored people and the congress of racial equality and other civil rights organizations black nationalist groups eg nation of islam and the black panther party the american indian movement a broad range of organizations labeled new left including students for a democratic society and the weathermen almost all groups protesting the vietnam war as well as individual student demonstrators with no group affiliation the national lawyers guild organizations and individuals associated with the womens rights movement nationalist groups such as those seeking independence for puerto rico united ireland and cuban exile movements including orlando boschs cuban power and the cuban nationalist movement the remaining 15 of cointelpro resources were expended to marginalize and subvert white hate groups including the ku klux klan and the national states rights party101102103104105106107108109110111 files on puerto rican independence advocates the fbi also spied upon and collected information on puerto rican independence leader pedro albizu campos and his nationalist political party in the 1930s abizu

after an armed assault on the us house of representatives while in session although not present abizu campos was considered the mastermind112 the fbi operation was covert and did not become known until us congressman luis gutierrez had it made public via the freedom of information act in the 1980s113 in the 2000s researchers obtained files released by the fbi under the freedom of information act revealing that the san juan fbi office had coordinated with fbi offices in new york chicago and other cities in a decadeslong surveillance of albizu campos and puerto ricans who had contact or communication with him the documents available are as recent as 1965114115 activities in latin america from the 1950s to the 1980s the governments of many latin american and caribbean countries were infiltrated by the fbi116 internal investigations of shootings during the period from 1993 to 2011 fbi agents fired their weapons on 289 occasions fbi internal reviews found the shots justified in all but 5 cases in none of the 5 cases were people wounded samuel walker a professor of criminal justice at the university of nebraska omaha said the number of shots found to be unjustified was suspiciously low in the same time period the fbi wounded 150 people 70 of whom died the fbi found all 150 shootings to be justified likewise during the period from 2011 to the present all shootings by fbi agents have been found to be justified by internal investigation in a 2002 case in maryland an innocent man was shot and later paid 13 million by the fbi after agents mistook him for a bank robber the internal investigation found that the shooting was justified based on the mans actions117 the whitey bulger case the fbi has been criticized for its handling of boston organized crime figure whitey bulger118119120 beginning in 1975 bulger served as an informant for the fbi121 as a result the bureau largely ignored his organization in exchange for information about the inner workings of the italian american patriarca crime family122123124 in december 1994 after being tipped off by his former fbi handler about a pending indictment under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act bulger fled boston and went into hiding for 16 years he remained at large for 12 of those years bulger was prominently listed on the fbi ten most wanted fugitives list125 beginning in 1997 the new england media exposed criminal actions by federal state and local law enforcement officials tied to bulger the revelation caused great embarrassment to the fbi126127128 in 2002 special agent john j connolly was convicted of federal racketeering charges for helping bulger avoid arrest in 2008 special agent connolly completed his term on the federal charges and was transferred to florida where he was convicted of helping plan the murder of john b callahan a bulger rival in 2014 that conviction was overturned on a technicality connolly was the agent leading the investigation of

pleaded guilty to 15 counts of espionage in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia140141 his spying activities have been described by the us department of justices commission for the review of fbi security programs as possibly the worst intelligence disaster in us history142 death of filiberto ojeda rios puerto rican nationalist leader filiberto ojeda ríos died in a gun battle with fbi agents in 2005 in 2005 fugitive puerto rican nationalist leader filiberto ojeda ríos died in a gun battle with fbi agents that some charged was an assassinationcitation needed

demanding information crucial to the commonwealths own investigation of the incident the case was dismissed by the us supreme court144 ojeda rios funeral was attended by a long list of dignitaries including the highest authority of the roman catholic church in puerto rico archbishop roberto octavio gonzález nieves exgovernor rafael hernández colón and numerous other personalities145 in the

graduate student created wikiscanner a searchable database that linked changes made by anonymous wikipedia editors to companies and organizations from which the changes were made the database crossreferenced logs of wikipedia edits with publicly available records pertaining to the internet ip addresses edits were made from147 griffith was motivated by the edits from the united states congress148149150151 and wanted to see if others were similarly promoting themselves the tool was designed to detect conflict of interest edits152 among his findings were that fbi computers were used to edit the fbi article on wikipedia153 although the edits correlated with known fbi ip addresses there was no proof that the changes actually came from a member or employee of the fbi only that someone who had access to their network had edited the fbi article on wikipedia149 wikipedia spokespersons received griffiths wikiscanner positively noting that it helped prevent conflicts of interest from influencing articles153 as well as increasing transparency149154 and mitigating attempts to remove or distort relevant facts155 hillary clinton email investigation main article hillary clinton

their importance to our investigation159 at the time comey sent his letter to congress the fbi had still not obtained a warrant to review any of the emails in question and was not aware of the content of any of the emails in question160 comeys announcement was inconsistent with justice department policy and he was warned by lawyers at the department of justice against proceeding with his letter to congress both republican and democrat lawmakers as well as both the clinton and trump campaigns have called on comey to provide additional details161 after comeys letter to congress commentator paul callan of cnn and niall odowd of irish central compared comey to j edgar hoover in attempting to influence and manipulate elections162163 on october 30 2016 richard painter chief white house ethics

campaign was briefed by the fbi days before comeys letter was sent to congress164165 on november 6 2016 in the face of constant pressure from both republicans and democrats comey conceded in a second letter to congress that through the fbis review of the new emails there was no wrongdoing by clinton comey conceded based on our review we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july

director comey main article dismissal of james comey on may 9 2017 president trump dismissed fbi director comey after comey had misstated several key findings of the email investigation in his testimony to the senate judiciary committee173 somewho question whether the dismissal was in response to comeys request for more resources to expand the probe into russian interference into the presidential election174 following comeys dismissal deputy director andrew g mccabe became acting director175 on august 1 2017 president trumps nominee for fbi director christopher a wray was officially confirmed by the senate in a 92–5 vote and was sworn in as director the next day176 media portrayal main article fbi portrayal in media the popular 1993–2002 tv series the xfiles depicted
