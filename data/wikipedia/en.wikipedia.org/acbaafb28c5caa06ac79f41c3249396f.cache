c 1786 – june 7 1866 was a suquamish tribe suquamish and dkhwduwabsh duwamish chief2 a prominent figure among his people he pursued a path of accommodation to white settlers forming a personal relationship with doc maynard the city of seattle in the us state of washington was named after him a widely publicized speech arguing in favor of ecological responsibility and respect of native americans land rights had been attributed to him however what he actually said has been lost through translation and rewriting the name seattle is an anglicization of the modern duwamish conventional spelling siahl equivalent to the modern lushootseed spelling siʔaɫ ipa ˈsiʔaːɬ he is also known as sealth seathle seathl or seeahth contents 1 biography 2 the speech or ‘letter’ 21 the oldest version

dkhwduwabsh duwamish and his father shweabe was chief of the dkhwsuqwabsh the suquamish tribe2 seattle was born some time between 1780 and 1786 on or near blake island washington one source cites his mothers name as woodsholitsa3 the duwamish tradition is that seattle was born at his mothers village of stukw on the black river in what is now the city of kent washington and that seattle grew up speaking both the duwamish and suquamish dialects of lushootseed because native descent among the salish peoples was not solely patrilineal seattle inherited his position as chief of the duwamish tribe from his maternal uncle2 seattle earned his reputation at a young age as a leader and a warrior ambushing and defeating groups of tribal enemy raiders coming up the green river from the cascade foothills in 1847 he helped lead a suquamish attack upon the chimakum people near port townsend which effectively wiped out the chimakum45 like many of his contemporaries he owned slaves captured during his raids he was tall and broad for a puget sound native standing nearly six feet tall hudsons bay company traders gave him the nickname le gros the big guy he was also known as an orator and when he addressed an audience his voice is said to have carried from his camp to the stevens hotel at first and marion a distance of 3⁄4 mile 12 km3 chief seattle took wives from the village of tolaltu just southeast of duwamish head on elliott bay now part of west seattle his first wife ladalia died after bearing a daughter he had three sons and four daughters with his second wife olahl3 the most famous of his children was his first kikisoblu or princess angeline seattle was converted to christianity by french missionaries and was baptized in the roman catholic church with the baptismal name noah probably in 1848 near olympia washington4 for all his skill seattle was gradually losing ground to the more powerful patkanim of the snohomish when white settlers started showing up in force around 1850 in later years seattle claimed to have seen the ships of the vancouver expedition as they explored puget sound in 1792 when his people were driven from their traditional clamming grounds seattle met doc maynard in olympia they formed a friendly relationship useful to both persuading the settlers at the white settlement of duwamps to rename their town seattle maynard established their support for chief seattles people and negotiated relatively peaceful relations with the tribes seattle kept his people out of the battle of seattle in 1856 afterwards he was unwilling to lead his tribe to the reservation established since mixing duwamish and snohomish was likely to lead to bloodshed maynard persuaded the government of the necessity of allowing seattle to remove to his fathers longhouse on agate passage old man house or tsusuccub seattle frequented the town named after him and had his photograph taken by e m sammis in 18653 he died june 7 1866 on the suquamish reservation at port madison washington6 the speech or ‘letter’edit wikisource has original text related to this article chief seattles speech the speech or letter attributed to chief seattle has been widely cited as a powerful bittersweet plea for respect of native american rights and environmental values7 but this document which has achieved widespread fame thanks to its promotion in the environmental movement is of doubtful authenticity the evolution of the text of chief seattles speech from a flowery victorian paean to peace and territorial integrity into a much briefer environmentalist credo has been chronicled by several historians the first attempt to reconstruct this history was a 1985 essay in the us national archives prologue magazine8 a more scholarly essay by a german anthropologist followed in 19879 in 1989 a radio documentary by daniel and patricia miller resulted in the uncovering of no fewer than 86 versions of chief seattles speech this then prompted a new discussion first in the seattle weekly and then in newsweek1011 the historian albert furtwangler then undertook to analyze the evolution of chief seattles speech in a fulllength book answering chief seattle 199712 more recently eli gifford has written another fulllength book the many speeches of chief seattle 2015 which assembles further elements of the story gives accurate transcriptions of 11 versions of the speech and explores possible motivations for manipulating the words in each case6 the oldest version 1887edit the oldest extant record of this document is a transcript published in the seattle sunday star in 1887 in a column by henry a smith a poet doctor and early white settler of the seattle area13 smith provides a transcript of a speech made by chief seattle 30 years earlier which smith had attended and taken notes from the occasion of the speech was a visit by the newly appointed governor isaac stevens the governors visit to a council of local tribal chiefs that year is corroborated by the historical record14 chief seattle was the most influential chief in the area so it is likely he would have been in attendance however the date the location and the actual words of chief seattles speech are disputed for instance smiths article in the seattle sunday star claims that the purpose of governor stevenss meeting was to discuss the surrender or sale of the indians land to white settlers — but there is no record to support that this was the purpose of stevenss visit in fact the purpose of the visit seems to have been to investigate lands already considered to belong to the united states15 moreover contemporary witnesses do not place smith at the 1854 meeting there is a written record of a later meeting between governor stevens and chief seattle taken by government interpreters at the point elliott treaty signing on january 22 1855 but the proceedings of this meeting bear no resemblance to the reminiscence that dr smith recorded in 188768 according to smiths recollection doc maynard introduced governor stevens who then briefly explained his mission which was already well understood by all present chief seattle then rose to speak he rested his hand upon the head of the much smaller stevens and declaimed with great dignity for an extended period and smith then presents a detailed translation of the speech but recent scholarship questions the authenticity of smiths version of the speech chief seattle most probably spoke in the lushootseed language and someone then translated his words into chinook jargon a limited trading language which a third person then translated that into english but smiths english version is in a flowery victorian prose and smith noted that he had recorded but a fragment of his seattles speech moreover smiths version of the speech does not square with the recollections of other witnesses and as we have seen smith himself may not have been present as a witness as a result of such discrepancies staff of the national archives in washington dc concluded that the speech is most likely fiction816 however a spokesperson for the suquamish nation has said that according to their traditions dr smith consulted the tribal elders numerous times before publishing his transcript of the speech in 1887 the elders apparently saw the notes dr smith took while listening to the speechcitation needed the elders approval of smiths transcript if real would give that version the status of an authentic version smiths notes are no longer extant they may have been lost in the great seattle fire when smiths office burned down why however did smith wait thirty years to publish his transcript of the speech it seems most likely that smiths reason for publishing the speech was political newly arrived immigrants were starting to overpower the original pioneers who had dominated local politics there was a bitterly contested election with one newspaper claiming these new immigrants wanted the overthrow of our institutions  rob you  of home of country and of religion when smith had chief seattle waxing rhetorical about the demise of the native peoples was he also talking about the demise of the original pioneers who found themselves denounced as obstacles in the way of progress as old mossbacks with some even calling for their hanging6 later versionsedit the first few subsequent versions can be briefly enumerated in 1891 frederick james grants history of seattle washington reprinted smiths version in 1929 clarence b bagleys history of king county washington reprinted grants version with some additions in 1931 roberta frye watt reprinted bagleys version in her memoir four wagons west that same year john m rich used the bagley text in a popular pamphlet chief seattles unanswered challenge in the late 1960s a new era dawned in the fame of the speech and in its further modification this began with a series of articles by william arrowsmith a professor at the university of texas which revived interest in seattles speech arrowsmith had come across the speech in a collection of essays by the president of washington state university at the end of one of the essays there were some quotes from smiths version of chief seattles speech arrowsmith said it read like prose from the greek poet pindar with interest aroused he found the original source after reading it he decided to try improving smiths version of the speech by removing victorian influences arrowsmith attempted to get a sense of how chief seattle might have spoken and to establish some likely perimeters of the language6 but the massive fame of chief seattles speech is probably due to a poster printed in 1972 which shows a picture of chief seattle overlaid with words from his letter to the president in washington the words are in fact taken from arrowsmiths version of the speech but with further modifications such as the image of shooting buffalo from trains and the line the earth does not belong to man man belongs to the earth the poster was made to promote a movie called home an environmentalist movie produced for the southern baptist radio and television commission11 the movies producer wanted to show a distinguished american indian chief delivering a statement of concern for the environment so the script writer ted perry wove together environmentalist rhetoric with pieces of chief seattles speech in the arrowsmith version but perry was not credited with this because according to perry the producer thought the movie would seem more authentic if the text was attributed directly to chief seattle himself and not to a screenwriter perry himself explained what happened i first heard a version of the text read by william arrowsmith at the first environmental day celebration in 1970 i was there and heard him he was a close friend arrowsmiths version hinted at how difficult it was for seattle to understand the white mans attitude toward land water air and animals for the soundtrack for a documentary i had already proposed about the environment i decided to write a new version elaborating on and heightening what was hinted at in arrowsmiths text  while it would be easy to hide behind the producers decision without my permission to delete my written by credit when the film was finished and aired on television the real problem is that i should not have used the name of an actual human being chief seattle that i could put words into the mouth of someone i did not know particularly a native american is pure hubris if not racist while there has been some progress in our knowledge of native americans we really know very little what we think we know is mediated by films chance encounters words images and other stereotypes they serve our worldview but they are not true6 it turns out that the producer john stevens had added a lot of elements to make the speech compatible with baptist theology including the words i am a savage and do not understand stevens said i edited the speech to fit our needs baptists more closely there was no apple pie and motherhood and so i added the references to god and i am a savage to make the radio and television commission happy  i had edited scripts that did not have the baptists line dozens of times this needed to be done so they could justify spending thousands of dollars on a film  i eventually quit my job as a producer because i got tired of shoehorning those interests into scripts6 the version of chief seattles speech edited by stevens was then made into a poster and 18000 copies were sent out as a promotion for the movie the movie itself sank without a trace but this newest and most fictional version of chief seattles speech became the most widely known as it became disseminated within the environmentalist movement of the 1970s — now in the form of a letter to the president see below8 in 1993 nancy zussy a librarian at washington state university analyzed the versions of chief seattles speech or letter which were then in circulation17 she identified four major textual variants which she ascribed to four authors as follows version 1 the smith version version 2 the arrowsmith version version 3 the perrystevens version version 4 a shortened version of the perrystevens version — no known author the letteredit a similar controversy surrounds a purported 1855 letter from seattle to president franklin pierce which has never been located and based on internal evidence is described by historian jerry l clark as an unhistorical artifact of someones fertile literary imagination8 it seems that the letter surfaced within environmentalist literature in the 1970s as a slightly altered form of the perrystevens version the first environmental version was published in the november 11 1972 issue of environmental action magazine by this time it was no longer billed as a speech but as a letter from chief seattle to president pierce the editor of environmental action had picked it up from dale jones who was the northwest representative of the group friends of the earth jones himself has since said that he first saw the letter in september 1972 in a now out of business native american tabloid newspaper here all leads end but it is safe to assume the original source was the movie poster6 there is no record of a letter from chief seattle in either the private papers of president pierce in the new hampshire historical society or in the presidential papers of pierce in the library of congress18 the staff at the national archives has been unable to locate any such letter among the records of the bureau of indian affairs in the national archives and concluded that the letter  is probably spurious19 it would be quite improbable if not impossible for a letter from the chief of an indian tribe to the president of the united states not to have been recorded in at least one of the governmental offices through which it passed for the letter to have made it to the desk of the president it would have passed through at least six departments the local indian agent colonel simmons to the superintendent of indian affairs gov stevens to the commissioner of indian affairs to the office of the secretary of the interior and finally to the presidents desk—quite a paper trail for the letter to have left not a trace it can be concluded that no letter was written by or for seattle and sent to president pierce or to any other president seattle was illiterate and moreover did not speak english so he obviously could not write english6 legacyedit statue erected 1908 of chief seattle tilikum place seattle washington the statue is on the national register of historic places seattles grave site is at the suquamish
