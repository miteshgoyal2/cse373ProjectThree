studied anthropology sociology and literature amongst other subjects7 he also began shooting with an 8 mm camera including filming car races7 at this time lucas and his friend john plummer became interested in canyon cinema screenings of underground avantgarde 16 mm filmmakers like jordan belson stan brakhage and bruce conner9 lucas and plummer also saw classic european films of the time including jeanluc godards breathless françois truffauts jules et jim and federico fellinis 8½9 thats when george really started exploring plummer said9 through his interest in autocross racing lucas

visually he recalled9 lucas then transferred to the university of southern california usc school of cinematic arts usc was one of the earliest universities to have a school devoted to motion picture film during the years at usc lucas shared a dorm room with randal kleiser along with classmates such as walter murch hal barwood and john milius they became a clique of film students known as the dirty dozen he also became good friends with fellow acclaimed student filmmaker and future indiana jones collaborator steven spielberg lucas was deeply influenced by the filmic expression course taught at the school by filmmaker lester novros which concentrated on the nonnarrative elements of film form like color light movement space and time another inspiration was the serbian montagist and dean of the usc film department slavko vorkapić a film theoretician who made stunning montage sequences for hollywood studio features at mgm rko and paramount vorkapich taught the autonomous nature of the cinematic art form emphasizing the unique dynamic quality of movement and kinetic energy inherent in motion pictures film career 1965–69 early career lucas saw many inspiring films in class particularly the visual films coming out of the national film board of canada like arthur lipsetts 2187 the frenchcanadian cameraman jeanclaude labrecques cinéma vérité 60 cycles the work of norman mclaren and the documentaries of claude jutra lucas fell madly in love with pure cinema and quickly became prolific at making 16 mm nonstory noncharacter visual tone poems and cinéma vérité with such titles as look at life herbie 14208 the emperor anyone lived in a pretty how town filmmaker and 61867 he was passionate and interested in camerawork and editing defining himself as a filmmaker as opposed to being a director and he loved making abstract visual films that created emotions purely through cinema9 after graduating with a bachelor of fine arts in film in 1967 he tried joining the united states air force as an officer but he was immediately turned down because of his numerous speeding tickets he was later drafted by the army for military service in vietnam but he was exempted from service after medical tests showed he had diabetes the disease that killed his paternal grandfather in 1967 lucas reenrolled as a usc graduate student in film production10 working as a teaching instructor for a class of us navy students who were being taught documentary cinematography lucas directed the short film electronic labyrinth thx 1138 4eb which won first prize at the 1967–68 national student film festival and was later adapted into his first fulllength feature film thx 1138 lucas was awarded a student scholarship by warner bros to observe and work on the making of a film of his choosing the film he chose was finians rainbow 1968 which was being directed by francis ford coppola who was revered among film school students of the time as a cinema graduate who had made it in hollywood in 1969 lucas was one of the camera operators on the classic rolling stones concert film gimme shelter 1969–77 thx 1138 american graffiti and star wars in 1969 lucas cofounded the studio american zoetrope with coppola—whom he met during his internship at warner bros—hoping to create a liberating environment for filmmakers to direct outside the perceived oppressive control of the hollywood studio system11 his first fulllength feature film produced by the studio thx 1138 was not a success lucas then created his own company lucasfilm ltd and directed the successful american graffiti 1973 lucas then set his sights on adapting flash gordon an adventure serial from his childhood that he fondly remembered when he was unable to obtain the rights he set out to write an original space adventure that would eventually become star wars despite his success with his previous film all but one studio turned star wars down it was only because alan ladd jr at 20th century fox liked american graffiti that he forced through a production and distribution deal for the film which ended up restoring fox to financial stability after a number of flops12 star wars was significantly influenced by samurai films of akira kurosawa spaghetti westerns as well as classic swords sorcery fantasy stories star wars quickly became the highestgrossing film of alltime displaced five years later by spielbergs et the extraterrestrial after the success of american graffiti and prior to the beginning of filming on star wars lucas was encouraged to renegotiate for a higher fee for writing and directing star wars than the 150000 agreed7 he declined to do so instead negotiating for advantage in some of the asyetunspecified parts of his contract with fox in particular ownership of licensing and merchandising rights for novelizations tshirts toys etc and contractual arrangements for sequels7 the studio was unconcerned to relinquish these rights as its last major attempt in the field with the film doctor dolittle 1967 had proved a discouraging failure13 lucas exploited merchandising rights wisely and lucasfilm has earned hundreds of millions of dollars from licensed games toys and collectibles created for the franchise7 1977–93 hiatus from directing indiana jones director jim henson left and lucas working on labyrinth in 1986 following the release of the first star wars film lucas worked extensively as a writer and producer including on the many star wars spinoffs made for film television and other media lucas acted as executive producer for the next two star

effects in films such as star trek ii the wrath of khan16 and young sherlock holmes16 and the group was purchased in 1986 by steve jobs shortly after he left apple computer jobs paid lucas us5 million and put us5 million as capital into the company the sale reflected lucas desire to stop the cash flow losses from his 7year research projects associated with new entertainment technology tools as well as his companys new focus on creating entertainment products rather than tools a contributing factor was cashflow difficulties following lucas 1983 divorce concurrent with the sudden dropoff in revenues from star wars licenses following the release of return of the jedi the soundequipped system thx ltd was founded by lucas and tomlinson holman17 the company was formerly owned by lucasfilm and contains equipment for stereo digital and theatrical sound for films and music skywalker sound and industrial light magic are the sound and visual effects subdivisions of lucasfilm while lucasfilm

settlement in 1987 lucas had no desire to return to star wars and had unofficially canceled his sequel trilogy by the time of return of the jedi18 nevertheless the prequels which were still only a series of basic ideas partially pulled from his original drafts of the star wars continued to tantalize him with technical possibilities that would make it worthwhile to revisit his older material

with the explosion of cgi technology he was now considering returning to directing19 by 1993 it was announced in variety among other sources that lucas would be making the prequels he began penning more to the story indicating that the series would be a tragic one examining anakin skywalkers fall to the dark side lucas also began to change the prequels status relative to the originals at first

death this was the final step towards turning the film series into a saga20 in 1994 lucas began work on the screenplay of the first prequel tentatively titled episode i the beginning in 1997 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of star wars lucas returned to the original trilogy and made numerous modifications using newly available digital technology releasing them in theaters as the star wars
