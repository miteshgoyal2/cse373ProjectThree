michael jacksons this is it this is it was written by recording artists paul anka and michael jackson12 and a demo version of the song was recorded by anka and jackson in 1983 at ankas california recording studio3 the song was intended to be added as an album track on ankas 1983 duets album walk a fine line that he was in the process of recording at the time12 anka claimed in 2009 that

recordings were not returned15 jacksons version of this is it was reportedly found in a box of tapes with only jacksons voice and a piano accompaniment the song was described as having been a barebone

anka allowed the puerto rican rb recording artist safire to record this is it2 which she did under the original title i never heard on her second studio album i wasnt born yesterday in 1991 releaseedit on september 13 2009 it was reported that a secret michael jackson single was being produced to promote the film michael jacksons this is it so that the songs release would coincide with the release of the film it was reported that jackson had planned to release the song for his planned concerts but after his death it was shelved until producers in los angeles california decided to remix the vocals with an orchestral accompaniment6 on september 23 sony music entertainment announced they were planning on releasing a song entitled this is it as a single7 the song was to feature backing vocals by several of jacksons brothers and would be included in a twodisc album this is it78 it was also confirmed that the song would be featured during the end credits of the movie production58 sony said in response to the reports that it was a coincidence that his upcoming concert series was also titled this is it explaining they had no evidence that he had planned to release the song9 however john mcclain and john branca two representatives of jacksons estate said in a prepared statement that this is it was picked because the lyrics were appropriate because of the name michael jackson gave his tour and that they were thrilled to present the song210 although sony did not release the track as a single it was confirmed that this is it would be released to radio stations for airplay but that it would not be downloadable sony chose to release the song as an albumonly track as part of a strategy to encourage fans to buy the entire album11 mcclain also a coproducer of the this is it album said this song only defines once again what the world already knows that michael jackson is one of gods greatest gifts47 this is it premiered as scheduled on jacksons official website michaeljacksoncom on october 12 at midnight1213 within the day of the songs release via world wide web listeners unaware of the songs background drew comparisons of the song to safires i never heard1415 soon after media outlets the new york times and tmzcom informed anka of the similarities between the songs2 in response anka told the new york times that this is it was exactly the same song as i never heard and only the titles were different16 he also stated that he was planning on taking legal action against jacksons estate soon afterwards jacksons estate acknowledged that anka was a cowriter on the song and agreed that anka would receive 50 percent of the publishing rights from it21416 anka said the estate did the right thing and that he felt that he did not think that anybody tried to do the wrong thing and it was an honest mistake216 anka further stated they realize its a mistake they realize its my song they realize its my production of his vocal in my studio and i am getting 50 percent of the whole project actually which is fair4 rob stringer the chairman of the epic label group stated that at the time of the songs release he did not know when jackson’s original tape had been recorded or of its similarity to safires version until it was discussed online over the weekend by jacksons fans15 prior to the estate and anka reaching an agreement safire’s manager sal abbatiello stated that he was contemplating filing a lawsuit on behalf of his client commenting this is a terrible mistake i’m pretty sure paul anka has a big case i don’t know if safire has any legal right as the artist i’ll have to contact my lawyers but hopefully they’re advertising this movie everywhere16 abbatiello also criticized sony for not researching the possibility that the song might have had been previously released before releasing it15 compositionedit this is it is a pop ballad17 with a simple midtempo keyboard1819 that lasts three minutes and thirtysix seconds20 the song begins with jackson singing “this is it here i stand i’m the light of the world i feel grand got this love i can feel and i know yes for sure it is real” and then he tenderly hits his signature high notes about a new lover he feels he’s known since 1000 years17 jacksons brothers jackie tito jermaine and marlon credited as the jacksons7 are featured as background vocals throughout the song17 background music includes fingersnaps a soaring chorus bigbuild strings18 and bubbly guitars19 the song is played in the key of bb major21 throughout the song jacksons vocal range spans from f4 to c621 the songs tempo is moderate and its metronome speed is 96 beats per minute21 according to the music published on musicnotescom by alfred music publishing and the winnipeg sun the song is written in common time1921 the lyrics toggle between grandiosity this is it here i stand im the light of the world i feel grand and shy romantic yearning i never heard a single word about you falling in love wasnt my plan19 darrly sterdan of the winnipeg sun felt that jacksons voice and the background music sounded like a demo thats been fleshed out with overdubs and doowoppy backup vocals from his brothers19 anthony mccartney of the associated press felt that the fingersnap percussion echoes that present in jacksons 1982 song the girl is mine with paul mccartney9 critical receptionedit the track gained averagetopositive reviews and a nomination for best male pop vocal performance at the 2011 53rd grammy awards22 gary trust of billboard reported that response among radio programmers to the song has been almost universally positive23 among these were jay lustig of the starledger who felt it was a sweet midtempo love song that with orchestral strings and creamy backing vocals by jacksons brothers gave it a crisp beat24 in contrast darryl sterdan of the winnipeg sun gave it a 3 out of 5 rating saying this may be something but its not it on the whole its a sweet little number but it doesnt live up to its authoritative title19 todd martens of the los angeles timess pop hiss music blog called this is it a trifle and while the track certainly wont embarrass jacksons legacy or break the hearts of fans eager to hear jacksons voice again it does bring the fallen pop icon a little back down to earth25 jessica robertson an aol music editor said its a safe midtempo pop ballad that features what his fans love his trademark breathy vocals and confident delivery i dont think it will set the world on fire because its missing what fans and critics love most about his songs which is a strong and powerful groove to carry it25 many reviewers noted similarities in the song to earlier jackson songs caryn ganz of rolling stone felt musically this is it sounded similar to jacksons 1987 song i just cant stop loving you17 and leah greenbatt of entertainment weekly thought some listeners may pick up shades of jacksons 1993 single will you be there18 cori murray an entertainment director at essence magazine described the track as not bad and felt that it sounded like something jackson could have put on an album25 dan aquilante of the new york post who described the song as an optimistic rb ballad with an upbeat percolating rhythm that has all the bombast and power of the new jack swing period of the early 90s25 james montgomery of mtv news felt that the song was the perfect mj tune and that jackson was a hell of a singer26 he also stated that he felt that jackson had a wonderous voice and the song a prime showcase for jacksons prodigious pipes26 montgomery went on to say that when he ignored the negative elements surrounding the song and focused that he felt it was wonderful ignore the trilling strings and the softjazzlightfunk backing track which sort of makes the song sound like off the walls i cant help it block out the hype surrounding the songs release and the drama surrounding jacksons death focus on those vocals — the way jackson counts it in with a boyish one two three four the way he glides from verse to verse with breathless effortless phrasing the leanyetheavy falsetto the hint of gravel and gravitas is the verses the soaring choruses — its all there untarnished by time or tabloids and its all wonderful26 chart performanceedit this is it gave jackson his first song to chart on billboards hot adult contemporary tracks in over 17 years despite being a nondownloadable album track the song appeared on many charts due to radio play alone27 gary trust of billboard acknowledged that without this is it having a digital distribution component its chances on making an impact on the billboard hot 100 would not be likely27 during the week ending october 21 2009 this is it debuted at number 19 on

run on the list dated march 16 199628 this song is also jacksons 26th charted adult contemporary title making him the seventh male artist to score a top 20 adult contemporary single in each decade since the 1970s28 eventually the track peaked at number 18 on the adult contemporary chart29 also in this is its first week of release the song debuted on billboards hot rbhiphop songs chart at number

knowless brokenhearted girl superseded it on november 2136 however the track bounced back to the top position of the chart on november 2837 music videoedit on december 27 2009 the songs official music video was released38 it was directed by academy awardnominee spike lee39 who had previously worked with jackson directing the video for the musicians song entitled they dont care about us for his history past present and future book i 1995 album4041 the video for this is it premiered on the webpage of lees production company 40 acres a mule filmworks39 the video almost fiveminutes long features various scenes of jacksons hometown and former residence in gary indiana along with photos and videos of him and tributes from his fans around the world38 this sign pictured was shown several times throughout the video a reference to the publics negativity towards jackson because of the controversies during his life the video opens with a clip of a poster in gary pointing fans toward jacksons childhood home at the corner of 2300 jackson street and jackson family boulevard and the sound of a vintage recording of one of jacksons siblings yelling michael repeatedly38 an image that is shown several times during the video shows a oneway traffic sign near jacksons old house that is covered in graffiti honoring jackson including we luv yuh michael38 images shown as a slideshow of jackson performing as a child are mixed in with shots of play sets baseball bats and garys gritty industrial skyline38 a central image captured by lee is a plea for tolerance etched onto a stop sign in gary where someone had written the message this is it above the word stop under which theyve added hatin38 interspersed is archival footage of jackson throughout his career and of him greeting his fans in various parts of the world there are also shots of the musicians fans paying tribute in their own jackson memorabilia to him following his death at one point in the video one of the lyrics from the song i never heard a single word about you floats up out of the concrete fading into two more shots of fan tributes from around the world and multiple flowers and messages laid at the gates of jacksons neverland ranch the video several times shows a single red balloon floating in the air and empty swings swaying in the breeze38 towards the end of the video there is footage of jackson doing one of his signature dance moves the moonwalk it ends with footage of a black stool with jacksons trademark black fedora and silver glove on top of it under a spotlight in front of his familys gary residence at night3841 george merchan of joblocom felt that the video was clearly a loving patchwork of documentary footage graphics and original location shoots42 simon vozicklevinson of entertainment weekly described the video as being a heart felt tribute and said that due to the circumstances of lee having no footage of jackson performing the song to work with felt the director did a very nice job with it41 a negative review came from jim farber the music critic for the new york daily news he felt the video was a mini retrospective of jacksons life and criticized the stop hatin stop sign feeling that it was promoting press censorship and discussion about the darker aspects of jacksons life43 track listingedit promo cd single44 this is it album version – 337 this is it
