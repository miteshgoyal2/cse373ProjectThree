cowritten dions previous 1 hit runaround sue but originally intended the wanderer to be recorded by another group nino and the ebb tides they passed on it in favor of another maresca song so dion was given it as the bside of his followup single the majestic a song which his record company had chosen for him the record was turned over by radio djs who preferred the wanderer which duly entered the us charts in december 1961 and rose to 2 in early 1962 behind duke of earl by gene chandler it also reached 10 in the uk and 1 in australia the song was recorded with an uncredited background vocal group the delsatins in a rockier style than dions earlier hits with the belmonts the delsatins were an established doowop group led by stan ziska later known as stan sommers who at the time were also contracted to laurie records and who later formed the core of johnny maestro the brooklyn bridge musicians on the original recording included bobby gregg bucky pizarelli and johnny falbo on guitars jerome richardson on alto sax buddy lucas on tenor sax and panama francis and sticks evans on drumscitation needed dion said of the wanderer2 at its roots its more than meets the eye the wanderer is black music filtered through an italian neighborhood that comes out with an attitude its my perception of a lot of songs like im a man by bo diddley or hoochie coochie man by muddy waters but you know the wanderer is really a sad song a lot of guys dont understand that bruce springsteen was the only guy who accurately expressed what that song was about its i roam from town to town and go through life without a care im as happy as a clown with my two fists of iron but im going nowhere in the fifties you didnt get that dark it sounds like a lot of fun but its about going nowhere however on marescas original demo of the song the lyrics were with my two fists of iron and my bottle of beer and the change to with my two fists of iron but im going nowhere in fact seems to have been at the record companys insistence3 the song has been categorized as rock and roll rhythm and blues and pop456 cover versionsedit the wanderer single by eddie rabbitt from the album i wanna dance with you
