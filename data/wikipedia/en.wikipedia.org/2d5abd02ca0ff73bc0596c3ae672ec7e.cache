messages the at sign a part of every smtp email address1 electronic mail email or email is a method of exchanging messages between people using electronics email first entered substantial use in the 1960s and by the mid1970s had taken the form now recognized as email email operates across computer networks which today is primarily the internet some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time in common with instant messaging todays email systems are based on a storeandforward model email servers accept forward deliver and store messages neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously they need to connect only briefly typically to a mail server or a webmail interface for as long as it takes to send or receive messages originally an ascii textonly communications medium internet email was extended by multipurpose internet mail extensions mime to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments international email with internationalized email addresses using utf8 has been standardized but as of 2017 it has not been widely adopted2 the history of modern internet email services reaches back to the early arpanet with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 rfc 561 an email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today

electronic document transmission for example several writers in the early 1970s used the term to describe fax document transmission45 as a result it is difficult to find the first citation for the use of the term with the more specific meaning it has today electronic mail has been most commonly called email or email since around 19936 but variations of the spelling have been used email is the most common form used online and is required by ietf requests for comments rfc and working groups7 and increasingly by style guides89 this spelling also appears in most dictionaries10111213141516 email is the format that sometimes appears in edited published american english and british english writing as reflected in the corpus of contemporary american english data17 but is falling out of favor in style guides918 mail was the form used in the original protocol standard rfc 52419 the service is referred to as mail and a single piece of electronic mail is called a message2021 email is a traditional form that has been used in rfcs for the authors address2021 and is expressly required for historical reasons22 email is sometimes used capitalizing the initial e as in similar abbreviations like epiano eguitar abomb and hbomb23 an internet email consists24 of an envelope and content the content in turn consists25 of a header and a body originedit main article history of email computerbased mail and messaging became possible with the advent of timesharing computers in the early 1960s and informal methods of using shared files to pass messages were soon expanded into the first mail systems most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar but generally incompatible mail applications over time a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them many us universities were part of the arpanet created in the late1960s which aimed at software portability between its systems that portability helped make the simple mail transfer protocol smtp increasingly influential for a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the x400 email system part of the government open systems interconnection profile gosip would predominate however once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the internet ended in 19952627 a combination of factors made the current internet suite of smtp pop3 and imap email protocols the standard operationedit the diagram to the right shows a typical sequence of events28 that takes place when sender alice transmits a message using a mail user agent mua addressed to the email address of the recipient email operation the mua formats the message in email format and uses the submission protocol a profile of the simple mail transfer protocol smtp to send the message content to the local mail submission agent msa in this case smtpaorg the msa determines the destination address provided in the smtp protocol not from the message header in this case bobborg the part before the sign is the local part of the address often the username of the recipient and the part after the sign is a domain name the msa resolves a domain name to determine the fully qualified domain name of the mail server in the domain name system dns the dns server for the domain borg nsborg responds with any mx records listing the mail exchange servers for that domain in this case mxborg a message transfer agent mta server run by the recipients isp29 smtpaorg sends the message to mxborg using smtp this server may need to forward the message to other mtas before the message reaches the final message delivery agent mda the mda delivers it to the mailbox of user bob bobs mua picks up the message using either the post office protocol pop3 or the internet message access protocol imap in addition to this example alternatives and complications exist in the email system alice or bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system such as ibm lotus notes or microsoft exchange these systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendorspecific proprietary protocol the server sends or receives email via the internet through the products internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting if alice and bob work for the same company the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system alice may not have a mua on her computer but instead may connect to a webmail service alices computer may run its own mta so avoiding the transfer at step 1 bob may pick up his email in many ways for example logging into mxborg and reading it directly or by using a webmail service domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available many mtas used to accept messages for any recipient on the internet and do their best to deliver them such mtas are called open mail relays this was very important in the early days of the internet when network connections were unreliablecitation needed however this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare30 and many mtas do not accept messages from open mail relays message format edit the internet email message format is now defined by rfc 5322 with encoding of nonascii data and multimedia content attachments being defined in rfc 2045 through rfc 2049 collectively called multipurpose internet mail extensions or mime rfc 5322 replaced the earlier rfc 2822 in 2008 and in turn rfc 2822 in 2001 replaced rfc 822 – which had been the standard for internet email for nearly 20 years published in 1982 rfc 822 was based on the earlier rfc 733 for the arpanet31 internet email messages consist of two major sections the message header and the message body collectively known as content the header is structured into fields such as from to cc subject date and other information about the email in the process of transporting email messages between systems smtp communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields the body contains the message as unstructured text sometimes containing a signature block at the end the header is separated from the body by a blank line message headeredit each message has exactly one header which is structured into fields each field has a name and a value rfc 5322 specifies the precise syntax informally each line of text in the header that begins with a printable character begins a separate field the field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the separator character the separator is then followed by the field value the body of the field the value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character field names and values are restricted to 7bit ascii characters some nonascii values may be represented using mime encoded words header fieldsedit email header fields can be multiline and each line should be at most 78 characters long and in no event more than 998 characters long32 header fields defined by rfc 5322 can only contain usascii characters for encoding characters in other sets a syntax specified in rfc 2047 can be used33 recently the ietf eai working group has defined some standards track extensions3435 replacing previous experimental extensions to allow utf8 encoded unicode characters to be used within the header in particular this allows email addresses to use nonascii characters such addresses are supported by google and microsoft products and promoted by some governments36 the message header must include at least the following fields3738 from the email address and optionally the name of the authors in many email clients not changeable except through changing account settings date the local time and date when the message was written like the from field many email clients fill this in automatically when sending the recipients client may then display the time in the format and time zone local to himher rfc 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the iana it provides for permanent and provisional field names including also fields defined for mime netnews and http and referencing relevant rfcs common header fields for email include39 to the email addresses and optionally names of the messages recipients indicates primary recipients multiple allowed for secondary recipients see cc and bcc below subject a brief summary of the topic of the message certain abbreviations are commonly used in the subject including re and fw cc carbon copy many email clients will mark email in ones inbox differently depending on whether they are in the to or cc list bcc blind carbon copy addresses are usually only specified during smtp delivery and not usually listed in the message header contenttype information about how the message is to be displayed usually a mime type precedence commonly with values bulk junk or list used to indicate that automated vacation or out of office responses should not be returned for this mail eg to prevent vacation notices from being sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list sendmail uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email with precedence specialdelivery messages delivered sooner with modern highbandwidth networks delivery priority is less of an issue than it once was microsoft exchange respects a finegrained automatic response suppression mechanism the xautoresponsesuppress field40 messageid also an automatically generated field used to prevent multiple delivery and for reference in inreplyto see below inreplyto messageid of the message that this is a reply to used to link related messages together this field only applies for reply messages references messageid of the message that this is a reply to and the messageid of the message the previous reply was a reply to etc replyto address that should be used to reply to the message sender address of the actual sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the from field secretary list manager etc archivedat a direct link to the archived form of an individual email message note that the to field is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered the actual delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol smtp which may or may not originally have been extracted from the header content the to field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope in the same way the from field does not have to be the real sender of the email message some mail servers apply email authentication systems to messages being relayed data pertaining to servers activity is also part of the header as defined below smtp defines the trace information of a message which is also saved in the header using the following two fields41 received when an smtp server accepts a message it inserts this trace record at the top of the header last to first returnpath when the delivery smtp server makes the final delivery of a message it inserts this field at the top of the header other fields that are added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called trace fields in a broader sense42 authenticationresults when a server carries out authentication checks it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents43 receivedspf stores results of spf checks in more detail than authenticationresults44 autosubmitted is used to mark automatically generated messages45 vbrinfo claims vbr whitelisting46 message bodyedit content encodingedit internet email was originally designed for 7bit ascii47 most email software is 8bit clean but must assume it will communicate with 7bit servers and mail readers the mime standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of nonascii data quoted printable for mostly 7bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data the 8bitmime and binary extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings but many mail transport agents still do not support them fully in some countries several encoding schemes coexist as the result by default the message in a nonlatin alphabet language appears in nonreadable form the only exception is coincidence when the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme therefore for international character sets unicode is growing in popularitycitation needed plain text and htmledit most modern graphic email clients allow the use of either plain text or html for the message body at the option of the user html email messages often include an automatically generated plain text copy as well for compatibility reasons advantages of html include the ability to include inline links and images set apart previous messages in block quotes wrap naturally on any display use emphasis such as underlines and italics and change font styles disadvantages include the increased size of the email privacy concerns about web bugs abuse of html email as a vector for phishing attacks and the spread of malicious software48 some webbased mailing lists recommend that all posts be made in plaintext with 72 or 80 characters per line4950 for all the above reasons but also because they have a significant number of readers using textbased email clients such as mutt some microsoft email clients allow rich formatting using their proprietary rich text format rtf but this should be avoided unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible email client51 servers and client applicationsedit the interface of an email client thunderbird messages are exchanged between hosts using the simple mail transfer protocol with software programs called mail transfer agents mtas and delivered to a mail store by programs called mail delivery agents mdas also sometimes called local delivery agents ldas accepting a message obliges an mta to deliver it52 and when a message cannot be delivered that mta must send a bounce message back to the sender indicating the problem users can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as pop or imap or as is more likely in a large corporate environment with a proprietary protocol specific to novell groupwise lotus notes or microsoft exchange servers programs used by users for retrieving reading and managing email are called mail user agents muas mail can be stored on the client on the server side or in both places standard formats for mailboxes include maildir and mbox several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them serverside storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as imap moving email from one server to another can be done with any mua supporting the protocol many current email users do not run mta mda or mua programs themselves but use a webbased email platform such as gmail hotmail or yahoo mail that performs the same tasks53 such webmail interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard web browser from any computer rather than relying on an email client filename extensionsedit upon reception of email messages email client applications save messages in operating system files in the file system some clients save individual messages as separate files while others use various database formats often proprietary for collective storage a historical standard of storage is the mbox format the specific format used is often indicated by special filename extensions eml used by many email clients including novell groupwise microsoft outlook express lotus notes windows mail mozilla thunderbird and postbox the files contain the email contents as plain text in mime format containing the email header and body including attachments in one or more of several formats emlx used by apple mail msg used by microsoft office outlook and officelogic groupware mbx used by opera mail kmail and apple mail based on the mbox format some applications like apple mail leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory

business and organizational useedit email has been widely accepted by business governments and nongovernmental organizations in the developed world and it is one of the key parts of an erevolution in workplace communication with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed internet a sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83 of us knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work56 it has some key benefits to business and other organizations including facilitating logistics much of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building area or even country setting up and attending an inperson meeting telephone call or conference call can be inconvenient timeconsuming and costly email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no setup costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call helping with synchronisation with real time communication by meetings or phone calls participants must work on the same schedule and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call email allows asynchrony each participant may control their schedule independently reducing cost sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail or long distance telephone calls telex or telegrams increasing speed much faster than most of the alternatives creating a written record unlike a telephone or inperson conversation email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication the identity of the senders and recipients and the date and time the message was sent in the event of a contract or legal dispute saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues as each email has the date and time recorded on it email marketingedit email marketing via optin is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information57 depending on the recipients culture58 email sent without permission—such as an optin—is likely to be viewed as unwelcome email spam personal useedit personal computeredit many users access their personal email from friends and family members using a personal computer in their house or apartment mobileedit email has become used on smartphones and on all types of computers mobile apps for email increase accessibility to the medium for users who are out of their home while in the earliest years of email users could only access email on desktop computers in the 2010s it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home whether they are across town or across the world alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other device to notify them immediately of new messages this has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day today there are an estimated 14 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion nonspam emails that are sent daily individuals often check email on smartphones for both personal and workrelated messages it was found that us adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their facebook accounts making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones 78 of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone59 it was also found that 30 of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email and 91 were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone however the percentage of consumers using email on smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries for example in comparison to 75 of those consumers in the us who used it only 17 in india did60 issuesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources

one or more attachments which are additional files that are appended to the email typical attachments include microsoft word documents pdf documents and scanned images of paper documents in principle there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments but in practice email clients servers and internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files or complete email typically to 25mb or less616263 furthermore due to technical reasons attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ to what the user sees64 which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email where larger files need to be shared file hosting services of various sorts are available and generally suggested6566 some large files such as digital photos color presentations and video or music files are too large for some email systems67 information overloadedit the ubiquity of email for knowledge workers and white collar employees has led to concerns that recipients face an information overload in dealing with increasing volumes of email6869 with the growth in mobile devices by default employees may also receive workrelated emails outside of their working day this can lead to increased stress decreased satisfaction with work and some observers even argue it could have a significant negative economic effect70 as efforts to read the many emails could reduce productivity spamedit main article email spam email spam is the term used to describe unsolicited bulk email the low cost of sending such email meant that by 2003 up to 30 of total email traffic was already spam717273 and was threatening the usefulness of email as a practical tool the us canspam act of 2003 and similar laws elsewhere74 had some impact and a number of effective antispam techniques now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users75 but the volume sent is still very high—and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products but malicious content or links76 malwareedit a range of malicious email types exist these range from various types of email scams including social engineering scams such as advancefee scam nigerian letters to phishing email bombardment and email worms email spoofingedit main article email spoofing email spoofing occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin email spoofing may be done as a prank or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization an example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email which appears to be an invoice from a major company and then sends it to one or more recipients in some cases these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate email bombingedit main article email bomb email bombing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address the overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash privacy concernsedit main article internet privacy today it can be important to distinguish between internet and internal email systems internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the senders or the recipients control during the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content internal mail systems in which the information never leaves the organizational network may be more secure although information technology personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees email privacy without some security precautions can be compromised because email messages are generally not encrypted email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages many internet service providers isp store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered the backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server despite deletion from the mailbox the receivedfields and other information in the email can often identify the sender preventing anonymous communication web bugs invisibly embedded in email content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is read or reread and from which ip address it can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a pc or apple mac device via the user agent string there are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above for example virtual private networks or the tor anonymity network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while gpg pgp smemail77 or smime can be used for endtoend message encryption and smtp starttls or smtp over transport layer securitysecure sockets layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the smtp client and the smtp server additionally many mail user agents do not protect logins and passwords making them easy to intercept by an attacker encrypted authentication schemes such as sasl prevent this finally attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in peertopeer filesharing attached files may contain trojans or viruses flamingedit flaming occurs when a person sends a message or many messages with angry or antagonistic content the term is derived from the use of the word incendiary to describe particularly heated email discussions the ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the social norms that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten78 email bankruptcyedit main article email bankruptcy also known as email fatigue email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them the reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all as a solution people occasionally send a boilerplate message explaining that their email inbox is full and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages harvard university law professor lawrence lessig is credited with coining this term but he may only have popularized it79 internationalizationedit originally internet email was completely ascii textbased mime now allows body content text and some header content text in international character sets but other headers and email addresses using utf8 while standardized80 have yet to be widely adopted281 further information international email and email address § internationalization tracking of sent mailedit the original smtp mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read it requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice bounce message but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost to remedy this the ietf introduced delivery status notifications delivery receipts and message disposition notifications return receipts however these are not universally deployed in production a complete message tracking mechanism was also defined but it never gained traction see rfcs 388582 through 388883 many isps now deliberately disable nondelivery reports ndrs and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers delivery reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed if the spammer uses a forged sender email address email spoofing then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with ndrs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail these ndrs then constitute spam from the isp to the innocent user in the absence of standard methods a range of system based around the use of web bugs have been developed however these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns848586 and only work with email clients that support rendering of html many mail clients now default to not showing web content87 webmail providers can also disrupt web bugs by precaching
