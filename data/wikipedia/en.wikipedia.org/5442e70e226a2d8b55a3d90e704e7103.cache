west or simply the midwest is one of four geographic regions defined by the united states census bureau it occupies the northern central part of the united states of america2 it was officially named the north central region by the census bureau until 19843 it is located between the northeastern us and the western us with canada to its north and the southern us to its south the census bureaus definition consists of 12 states in the north central united states illinois indiana iowa kansas michigan minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota ohio south dakota and wisconsin the region generally lies on the broad interior plain between the states occupying the appalachian mountain range and the states occupying the rocky mountain range major rivers in the region include from east to west the ohio river the upper mississippi river and the missouri river4 a 2012 report from the united states census put the population of the midwest at 65377684 the midwest is divided by the census bureau into two divisions the east north central division includes illinois indiana michigan ohio and wisconsin all of which are also part of the great lakes region the west north central division includes iowa kansas minnesota missouri north dakota nebraska and south dakota several of which are located at least partly within the great plains region chicago is the most populated city in the american

19th century and remains relatively common67 another term sometimes applied to the same general region is the heartland8 other designations for the region have fallen out of use such as the northwest or old northwest from northwest territory and midamerica the northwest territory 1787 was one of the earliest territories of the united states stretching northwest from the ohio river to northern minnesota and the uppermississippi the uppermississippi watershed including the missouri and illinois rivers was the setting for the earlier french settlements of the illinois country9 economically the region is balanced between heavy industry and agriculture large sections of this land area make up the united states corn belt with finance and services such as medicine and education becoming increasingly important its central location makes it a transportation crossroads for river boats railroads autos trucks and airplanes politically the region swings back and forth between the parties and thus is heavily contested and often decisive in elections1011 after the sociological study middletown 1929 which was based on muncie indiana12 commentators used midwestern cities and the midwest

theodore roosevelt national park north dakota prairie in effigy mounds national monument iowa the vast central area of the us into canada is a landscape of low flat to rolling terrain in the interior plains most of its eastern twothirds form the interior lowlands the lowlands gradually rise westward from a line passing through eastern kansas up to over 5000 feet 1500 m in the unit known as the great plains most of the great plains area is now farmed16 while these states are for the most part relatively flat consisting either of plains or of rolling and small hills there is a measure of geographical variation in particular the following areas exhibit a high degree of topographical variety the eastern midwest near the foothills of the appalachian mountains the great lakes basin the ozark mountains of southern missouri the rugged topography of southern indiana and far southern illinois and the driftless area of northwestern illinois southwestern wisconsin southeastern minnesota and northeastern iowacitation needed proceeding westward the appalachian plateau topography gradually gives way to gently rolling hills and then in central ohio to flat lands converted principally to farms and urban areas this is the beginning of the vast interior plains of north america as a result prairies cover most of the great plains states iowa and much of illinois lie within an area called the prairie peninsula an eastward extension of prairies that borders conifer and mixed forests to the north and hardwood deciduous forests to the east and southcitation needed geographers subdivide the interior plains into the interior lowlands and the great plains on the basis of elevation the lowlands are mostly below 1500 feet 460 m above sea level whereas the great plains to the west are higher rising in colorado to around 5000 feet 1500 m the lowlands then are confined to parts of minnesota iowa michigan ohio indiana tennessee and kentucky missouri and arkansas have regions of lowlands elevations but in the ozarks within the interior highlands are higher those familiar with the topography of eastern ohio may be confused by this that region is hilly but its rocks are horizontal and are an extension of the appalachian plateaucitation needed the interior plains are largely coincident with the vast mississippi river drainage system other major components are the missouri and ohio rivers these rivers have for tens of millions of years been eroding downward into the mostly horizontal sedimentary rocks of paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic ages the modern mississippi river system has developed during the pleistocene epoch of the cenozoiccitation needed rainfall decreases from east to west resulting in different types of prairies with the tallgrass prairie in the wetter eastern region mixedgrass prairie in the central great plains and shortgrass prairie towards the rain shadow of the rockies today these three prairie types largely correspond to the cornsoybean area the wheat belt and the western rangelands respectivelycitation needed although hardwood forests in the northern midwest were clearcut in the late 19th century they were replaced by new growth ohio and michigans forests are still growing the majority of the midwest can now be categorized as urbanized areas or pastoral agricultural areascitation needed prehistoryedit main

period is the archaic period 8000 bce to 1000 bce the woodland tradition 1000 bce to 100 ce and the mississippian period 900 to 1500 ce archaeological evidence indicates that mississippian culture traits probably began in the st louis missouri area and spread northwest along the mississippi and illinois rivers and entered the state along the kankakee river system it also spread northward into indiana along the wabash tippecanoe and white rivers17 mississippian peoples in the midwest were mostly farmers who followed the rich flat floodplains of midwestern rivers they brought with them a welldeveloped agricultural complex based on three major crops—maize beans and squash maize or corn was the primary crop of mississippian farmers they gathered a wide variety of seeds nuts and berries and fished and hunted for fowl to supplement their diets with such an intensive form of agriculture this culture supported large populationscitation needed the mississippi period was characterized by a moundbuilding culture the mississippians suffered a tremendous population decline about 1400 coinciding with the global climate change of the little ice age their culture effectively ended before

projectiles and tools of stone bone and wood to hunt and farm they made canoes for fishing most of them lived in oval or conical wigwams that could be easily moved away various tribes had different ways of living the ojibwas were primarily hunters and fishing was also important in the ojibwas economy other tribes such as sac fox and miami both hunted and farmedcitation needed they were oriented toward the open prairies where they engaged in communal hunts for buffalo bison in the northern forests the ottawas and potawatomis separated into small family groups for hunting the winnebagos and menominees used both hunting methods interchangeably and built up widespread trade networks extending as far west as the rockies north to the great lakes south to the gulf of mexico and east to the atlantic oceancitation needed the hurons reckoned descent through the female line while the others favored the patrilineal method all tribes were governed under chiefdoms or complex chiefdoms for example hurons were divided into matrilineal clans each represented by a chief in the town council where they met with a town chief on civic matters but chippewa peoples social and political life was simpler than that of settled tribescitation needed the religious beliefs varied among tribes hurons believed in yoscaha a supernatural being who lived in the sky and was believed to have created the world and the huron people at death hurons thought the soul left the body to live in a village in the sky chippewas were a deeply religious people who believed in the great spirit they worshiped the

mandan missouria nez perce omaha osage otoe pawnee ponca quapaw santee wichita and yanktoncitation needed the nomadic tribes of the great plains survived on hunting some of their major hunts centered on deer and buffalo some tribes are described as part of the buffalo culture sometimes called for the american bison although the plains indians hunted other animals such as elk or antelope bison was their primary game food source bison flesh hide and bones from bison hunting provided the chief source of raw materials for items that plains indians made including food cups decorations crafting tools knives and clothingcitation needed the tribes followed the bisons seasonal grazing and migration the plains indians lived in teepees because they were easily disassembled and allowed the nomadic life of following game when spanish horses were obtained the plains tribes rapidly integrated them into their daily lives by the early 18th century many tribes had fully adopted a horse culture before their adoption of guns the plains indians hunted with spears bows and bows and arrows and various forms of clubs the use of horses by the plains indians made hunting and warfare much easier21 among the most powerful and dominant tribes were the dakota or sioux who occupied large amounts of territory in the great plains of the midwest the area of the great sioux nation spread throughout the south and midwest up into the areas of minnesota and stretching out west into the rocky mountains at the same time they occupied the heart of prime buffalo range and also an excellent region for furs they could sell to french and american traders for goods such as guns the sioux dakota became the most powerful of the plains tribes and the greatest threat to american expansion2223 the sioux comprise

landed at presentday green bay wisconsin they entered the mississippi river on june 17 167327 marquette and jolliet soon realized that the mississippi could not possibly be the northwest passage because it flowed south nevertheless the journey continued they recorded much of the wildlife they encountered they turned around at the junction of the mississippi river and arkansas river and headed backcitation needed marquette and jolliet were the first to map the northern portion of the mississippi river they confirmed that it was easy to travel from the st lawrence river through the great lakes all the way to the gulf of mexico by water that the native peoples who lived along the route were generally friendly and that the natural resources of the lands in between were extraordinary new

small villages along the mississippi river and its tributaries remained and were not disturbed by the new british government by the terms of the treaty of paris spain was given louisiana the area west of the mississippi st louis and ste genevieve in missouri were the main towns but there was little new settlement france regained louisiana from spain in exchange for tuscany by the terms of the treaty of san ildefonso in 1800 napoleon had lost interest in reestablishing a french colonial empire in north america following the haitian revolution and together with the fact that france could not effectively defend louisiana from great britain he sold the territory to the united states in the louisiana purchase of 1803 meanwhile the british maintained forts and trading posts in us territory not giving them up until the mid1790s by the jay treatycitation needed american settlement began either via routes over the appalachian mountains or through the waterways of the great lakes fort pitt now pittsburgh at the source of the ohio river became the main base for settlers moving into the midwest marietta ohio in 1787 became the first settlement in ohio but not until the defeat of indian tribes at the battle of fallen timbers in 1794 was largescale settlement possible large numbers also came north from kentucky into southern ohio indiana and illinois29 the regions fertile soil produced corn and vegetables most farmers were selfsufficient they cut trees and claimed the land then sold it to newcomers and then moved further west to repeat the processcitation needed lewis and clarkedit main article lewis and clark expedition in 1803 president thomas jefferson commissioned the lewis and clark expedition that took place between may 1804 and september 1806 the goal was to explore the louisiana purchase and establish trade and us sovereignty over the native peoples along the missouri river the lewis and clark expedition established relations with more than two dozen indigenous nations west of the missouri river30 the expedition returned east to st louis in the spring of 1806 indian warsedit in 1791 general arthur st clair became commander of the united states army and led a punitive expedition with two regular army regiments and some militia near modernday fort recovery his force advanced to the location of indian settlements near the headwaters of the wabash river but on november 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by miami chief little turtle and shawnee chief blue jacket more than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle which has since borne the name st clairs defeat it remains the greatest defeat of a us army by native americans313233 the british had a longstanding goal of building a neutral but probritish indian buffer state in the american midwest3435 they demanded a neutral indian state at the peace conference that ended the war of 1812 but failed to gain any of it because they had lost control of the region in the battle of lake erie and the battle of the thames in 1813 where tecumseh was killed the british then abandoned the indians south of the lakes the indians were major losers in the war of 1812 apart from the short black hawk war of 1832 the days of indian warfare east of the mississippi river had endedcitation needed yankees and ethnocultural politicsedit yankee settlers from new england started arriving in ohio before 1800 and spread throughout the northern half of the midwest most of them started as farmers but later the larger proportion moved to towns and cities as entrepreneurs businessmen and urban professionals since its beginnings in the 1830s chicago has grown to dominate the midwestern metropolis landscape for over a century36 historian john bunker has examined the worldview of the yankee settlers in the midwest because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission yankees were able to transplant new england institutions values and mores altered only by the conditions of frontier life they established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic the sanctity of private property individual responsibility faith in residential and social mobility practicality piety public order and decorum reverence for public education activists honest and frugal government town meeting democracy and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stick ambitions regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin air and corruption they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behaviorthis pietistic worldview was substantially shared by british scandinavian swiss englishcanadian and dutch reformed immigrants as well as by german protestants and many of the fortyeighters37 midwestern politics pitted yankees against the german catholics and lutherans who were often led by the irish catholics these large groups buenker argues generally subscribed to the work ethic a strong sense of community and activist government but were less committed to economic individualism and privatism and ferociously opposed to government supervision of the personal habits southern and eastern european immigrants generally leaned more toward the germanic view of things while modernization industrialization and urbanization modified nearly everyones sense of individual economic responsibility and put a premium on organization political involvement and education3839 development of transportationedit waterwaysedit lake michigan is shared by four midwestern states michigan indiana illinois and wisconsin three waterways have been important to the development of the midwest the first and foremost was the ohio river which flowed into the mississippi river development of the region was halted until 1795 due to spains control of the southern part of the mississippi and its refusal to allow the shipment of american crops down the river and into the atlantic oceancitation needed the second waterway is the network of routes within the great lakes the opening of the erie canal in 1825 completed an allwater shipping route more direct than the mississippi to new york and the seaport of new york city in 1848 the illinois and michigan canal breached the continental divide spanning the chicago portage and linking the waters of the great lakes with those of the mississippi valley and the gulf of mexico lakeport and river cities grew up to handle these new shipping routes during the industrial revolution the lakes became a conduit for iron ore from the mesabi range of minnesota to steel mills in the midatlantic states the saint lawrence seaway 1862 widened 1959 opened the midwest to the atlantic oceancitation needed the third waterway the missouri river extended water travel from the mississippi almost to the rocky mountainscitation needed the upper mississippi river near harpers ferry iowa in the 1870s and 1880s the mississippi river inspired two classic books—life on the mississippi and adventures of huckleberry finn—written by native missourian samuel clemens who used the pseudonym mark twain his stories became staples of midwestern lore twains hometown of hannibal missouri is a tourist attraction offering a glimpse into the midwest of his timecitation needed inland canals in ohio and indiana constituted another important waterway which connected with great lakes and ohio river traffic the commodities that the midwest funneled into the erie canal down the ohio river contributed to the wealth of new york city which overtook boston and philadelphiacitation needed railroads and the automobileedit during the mid19th century the region got its first railroads and the railroad junction in chicago became the worlds largest during the century chicago became the nations railroad center by 1910 over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals even today a century after henry ford six class i railroads meet in chicago4041 in the period from 1890 to 1930 many midwestern cities were connected by electric interurban railroads similar to streetcars the midwest had more interurbans than any other region in 1916 ohio led all states with 2798 miles 4503 km indiana followed with 1825 miles 2937 km these two states alone had almost a third of the countrys interurban trackage42 the nations largest interurban junction was in indianapolis during the 1900s decade the citys 38 percent growth in population was attributed largely to the interurban43 competition with automobiles and buses undermined the interurban and other railroad passenger business by 1900 detroit was the world center of the auto industry and soon practically every city within 200 miles was producing auto parts that fed into its giant factories44 in 1903 henry ford founded the ford motor company fords manufacturing—and those of automotive pioneers william c durant the dodge brothers packard and walter chrysler—established detroits status in the early 20th century as the worlds automotive capital the proliferation of businesses created a synergy that also encouraged truck manufacturers such as rapid and grabowsky45 the growth of the auto industry was reflected by changes in businesses throughout the midwest and nation with the development of garages to service vehicles and gas stations as well as factories for parts and tires today greater detroit remains home to general motors chrysler and the ford motor companycitation needed american civil waredit main article american civil war slavery prohibition and the underground railroadedit a map of various underground railroad routes the northwest ordinance region comprising the heart of the midwest was the first large region of the united states that prohibited slavery the northeastern united states emancipated slaves in the 1830s the regional southern boundary was the ohio river the border of freedom and slavery in american history and literature see uncle toms cabin by harriet beecher stowe and beloved by toni morrison the midwest particularly ohio provided the primary routes for the underground railroad whereby midwesterners assisted slaves to freedom from their crossing of the ohio river through their departure on lake erie to canada created in the early 19th century the underground railroad was at its height between 1850 and 1860 one estimate suggests that by 1850 100000 slaves had escaped via the underground railroad46 the underground railroad consisted of meeting points secret routes transportation and safe houses and assistance provided by abolitionist sympathizers individuals were often organized in small independent groups this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting stations along the route but knew few details of their immediate area escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next although the fugitives sometimes traveled on boat or train they usually traveled on foot or by wagon47 the region was shaped by the relative absence of slavery except for missouri pioneer settlement education in oneroom free public schools democratic notions brought by american revolutionary war veterans protestant faiths and experimentation and agricultural wealth transported on the ohio river riverboats flatboats canal boats and railroadscitation needed bleeding kansasedit main article bleeding kansas the first violent conflicts leading up to the civil war occurred between two neighboring midwestern states kansas and missouri involving antislavery freestaters and proslavery border ruffian elements that took place in the kansas territory and the western frontier towns of missouri roughly between 1854 and 1858 at the heart of the conflict was the question of whether kansas would enter the union as a free state or slave state as such bleeding kansas was a proxy war between northerners and southerners over the issue of slavery the term bleeding kansas was coined by horace greeley of the new york tribune the events it encompasses directly presaged the civil warcitation needed 1855 freestate poster setting in motion the events later known as bleeding kansas was the kansasnebraska act the act created the territories of kansas and nebraska opened new lands that would help settlement in them repealed the missouri compromise and allowed settlers in those territories to determine through popular sovereignty whether to allow slavery within their boundaries it was hoped the act would ease relations between the north and the south because the south could expand slavery to new territories but the north still had the right to abolish slavery in its states instead opponents denounced the law as a concession to the slave power of the southcitation needed the new republican party born in the midwest ripon wisconsin 1854 and created in opposition to the act aimed to stop the expansion of slavery and soon emerged as the dominant force throughout the north48 an ostensibly democratic idea popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or slave state however this resulted in immigration en masse to kansas by activists from both sides at one point kansas had two separate governments each with its own constitution although only one was federally recognized on january 29 1861 kansas was admitted to the union as a free state less than three months before the battle of fort sumter officially began the civil war49 the calm in kansas was shattered in may 1856 by two events that are often regarded as the opening shots of the civil war on may 21 the free soil town of lawrence kansas was sacked by an armed pro‐slavery force from missouri a few days later the sacking of lawrence led abolitionist john brown and six of his followers to execute five men along the pottawatomie creek in franklin county kansas in retaliation50 the socalled border war lasted for another four months from may through october between armed bands of pro‐slavery and free soil men the us army had two garrisons in kansas the first cavalry regiment at fort leavenworth and the second dragoons and sixth infantry at fort riley51 the skirmishes endured until a new governor john w geary managed to prevail upon the missourians to return home in late 1856 a fragile peace followed but violent outbreaks continued intermittently for several more yearscitation needed national reaction to the events in kansas demonstrated how deeply divided the country had become the border ruffians were widely applauded in the south even though their actions had cost the lives of numerous people in the north the murders committed by brown and his followers were ignored by most and lauded by a few52 the civil conflict in kansas was a product of the political fight over slavery federal troops were not used to decide a political question but they were used by successive territorial governors to pacify the territory so that the political question of slavery in kansas could finally be decided by peaceful legal and political meanscitation needed an animation depicting when united states territories and states forbade or allowed slavery 1789–1861 the election of abraham lincoln in november 1860 was the final trigger for secession by the southern states53 efforts at compromise including the corwin amendment and the crittenden compromise failed southern leaders feared that lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinctioncitation needed the us federal government was supported by 20 mostlynorthern free states in which slavery already had been abolished and by five slave states that became known as the border states all of the midwestern states but one missouri banned slavery though most battles were fought in the south skirmishes between kansas and missouri continued until culmination with the lawrence massacre on august 21 1863 also known as quantrills raid the massacre was a rebel guerrilla attack by quantrills raiders led by william clarke quantrill on prounion lawrence kansas quantrills band of 448 missouri guerrillas raided and plundered lawrence killing more than 150 and burning all the business buildings and most of the dwellings pursued by federal troops the band escaped to missouri54 lawrence was targeted due to the towns long support of abolition and its reputation as a center for redlegs and jayhawkers which were freestate militia and vigilante groups known for attacking and families in missouris proslavery western countiescitation needed immigration and industrializationedit main articles
