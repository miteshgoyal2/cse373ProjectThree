had hosted a major event since the september 11 attacks51 as a result the department of homeland security dhs designated the state funeral a national special security event nsse52 special precautions were taken because many of the events were open to the public and there were multiple protectees52 as means of assisting the motorcade many streets were temporarily blocked off by law enforcement52 attorney general john ashcroft told a senate hearing before the funeral it is a sad commentary when the observation of a memorial service for a former president of the united states must be labeled a national special security event such is the fact of modern life in washington and such is the nature of the war against alqaeda53 mpdc chief charles h ramsey agreed saying in a post911 world we have to be very concernedand aware of the potential that something could happen not that weve received any information at all54 however dhs was handling another nsse at the same time the g8 summit in sea island georgia55 during the services the news media made note that the security measures also made evident that the era of terrorism that the world was experiencing had its roots during the reagan years56 the worst act of terrorism against the united states prior to 911 the bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland which killed 189 americans happened during the reagan years565758 public and media commentsedit the majority of those commemorating reagan were supporters of his although not all held the 40th president in high regard in one noted example paul mays a retired engineer who never thought much of reagans politics witnessed the motorcade leave the tarmac at andrews air force base he commented this is history59 frank dubois an american university professor also was there for the motorcade though of the laudatory praise he remarked reagan hurt the environment there was doubledigit inflation i just dont get it59 the majority of media coverage of the event was deferential most major news organizations broadcast the various events live multiple times during the week the cable channel cspan broadcast uninterrupted coverage of the funeral ceremonies a few complained however that the television coverage was excessive and preempted coverage of other events cbs news anchor dan rather was quoted as saying even though everybody is respectful and wants to pay homage to the president life does go on there is other news like the reality of iraq it got very short shrift this weekend60 throughout the week media experts reported that the national mourning televised nearly nonstop on many television networks provided americans welcome respite from unhappy reports that american troops were being killed in iraq and afghanistan giving them a sense of good news they had been desperate for since the september 11 attacks6162 reagans obituaries also included a few criticisms richard goldstein of the village voice criticized the funeral for its careful orchestration writing because the networks had so long to plan for this production this was the most precisely mounted news event in modern times each gesture was minutely choreographed every tear strategically placed63 additionally some media outlets were criticized for lionizing reagan without paying equal attention to more controversial decisions made during his administration thomas kunkel dean of the university of maryland college parks journalism college wrote in a magazine that the coverage would have you believe that reagan was a cross between abe lincoln and mother teresa with an overlay of mister rogers64 howard kurtz the washington posts media columnist said reagan was a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest65
