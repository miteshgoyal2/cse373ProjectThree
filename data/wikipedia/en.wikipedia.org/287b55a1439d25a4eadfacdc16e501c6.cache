is best known for the left behind series of apocalyptic fiction that depicts the earth after the pretribulation rapture which premillennial dispensationalists believe the bible states multiple times will occur the books were lahayes brainchild though jerry b jenkins a former sportswriter with numerous other works of fiction to his name did the actual writing of the books from lahayes notes17 jenkins has said i write the best i can i know im never going to be revered as some classic writer i dont claim to be c s lewis the literarytype writers i admire them i wish i was smart enough to write a book thats hard to read you know18 the series which started in 1995 with the first novel includes 12 titles in the adult series as well as juvenile novels audio books devotionals and graphic novels the books have been very popular with total sales surpassing 65 million copies as of july 20164 seven titles in the adult series have reached no 1 on the bestseller lists for the new york times usa today and publishers weekly19 jerry falwell said about the first book in the series in terms of its impact on christianity its probably greater than that of any other book in modern times outside the bible20 the bestselling series has been compared to the equally popular works of tom clancy and stephen king the plotting is brisk and the characterizations manichean people disappear and things blow up9 lahaye indicates that the idea for the series came to him one day circa 1994 while he was sitting on an airplane and observed a married pilot flirting with a flight attendant he wondered what would befall the pilot if the rapture happened at that moment3 the first book in the series opens with a similar scene he sold the movie rights for the left behind series and later stated he regretted that decision because the films turned out to be churchbasement videos rather than a bigbudget blockbuster that he had hoped for6 later activitiesedit in 2001 lahaye cohosted with dave breese the

believed that the illuminati is secretly engineering world affairscitation needed in rapture under attack he wrote i myself have been a fortyfive year student of the satanicallyinspired centuriesold conspiracy to use government education and media to destroy every vestige of christianity within our society and establish a new world order having read at least fifty books on the illuminati i am convinced that it exists and can be blamed for many of mans inhumane actions against his fellow man during the past two hundred years the illuminati is just one of many groups that he believed are working to turn america into an amoral humanist country ripe for merger into a oneworld socialist state other secret societies and liberal groups working to destroy every vestige of christianity

parenthood the major tv networks highprofile newspapers and newsmagazines the state department major foundations rockefeller carnegie ford the united nations the left wing of the democratic party harvard yale and 2000 other colleges and universities3 criticismedit eschatology and left behindedit lahaye has been criticized for his apocalyptic beliefs in which he asserts the end of the world is near other believers in dispensational premillennialism who believe that the return of jesus is imminent criticize various aspects of his theology saying he has some real problems with his prophetical teachings in the left behind series it is noted that in books 8 9 lahaye and jenkins teach that nonwilling recipients of the mark of the beast can still be saved however in the mark the chang scenario is developed whereby a character receives both the mark of the beast and the sealing of the lord in desecration his dualmarking was justified in the storyline this has led some readers to wonder how a christian can have the mark of the beast and still be saved and has been asked many times by perplexed readers on the left behind messageboard attempts to address this question have appeared on the faq page at leftbehindcom1132 many mainstream christians and certain other evangelicals had broader disagreements with the series as a whole pointing out that most biblical scholars largely reject the eschatological assumptions of this kind of pop endtimes literature33 others say that lahaye portrays the book of revelation with a selective literalism choosing to take some things literally such as the violence and others as metaphor the beast as it suits his point of view34 in the rapture exposed by barbara rossing a number of criticisms are raised regarding the series particularly its focus on violence3335 robert m price a professor of biblical criticism for the council for secular humanisms center for inquiry institute and a proponent of the christ myth theory wrote a critique of tim lahaye and jerry jenkinss left behind novels called the paperback apocalypse how the christian church was left behind the paperback apocalypse examines the theological framework of popular eschatology comparing it with the texts to which it erroneously appealscitation needed anticatholic sentimentsedit lahaye was a harsh critic of roman catholicism which he called a false religion4 in his 1973 book revelation illustrated and made plain he stated that the catholic church is more dangerous than no religion because she substitutes religion for truth and is also dangerous because some of her doctrines are pseudochristian elsewhere the same book compared catholic ceremonies to pagan rituals4 it was these statements that were largely responsible for lahayes dismissal from jack kemps presidential campaign it was later revealed that the san diego church that lahaye had pastored throughout the 1970s had sponsored an anticatholic group called mission to catholics one of their pamphlets asserted that pope paul vi was the archpriest of satan a deceiver and an antichrist who has like judas gone to his own place the issue of anticatholicism also comes up in regard to the left behind series while the fictional pope john xxiv was raptured he is described as having stirred up controversy in the church with a new doctrine that seemed to coincide more with the heresy of martin luther than with the historic orthodoxy they were used to and this is implied as the reason he was raptured his successor pope peter ii becomes pontifex maximus of enigma babylon one world faith an amalgamation of all remaining world faiths and religions36 in book 9 of the series the desecration carpathia the villain specifically refutes all happenings at jesus crucifixion that are part of the catholic stations of the cross but not in the canonical gospels further undercutting the catholic traditions37 other catholic writers have said that while the books arent anticatholic per se they reflect lahayes other writings on the subject38 despite his anticatholic views he praised traditionalist catholic director mel gibsons 2004 film the passion of the christ saying that everyone should see this movie it could be hollywoods finest achievement to date39 he also endorsed catholic convert newt gingrich for president in 201240 sun myung moonedit in the 1980s he was criticized by the evangelical community for accepting money from bo hi pak a longtime sun myung moon operative41 he was additionally criticized for joining moons council for religious freedom which was founded to protest moons 1984 imprisonment41 in 1996 lahayes wife spoke at an event sponsored by moon41 tributesedit time magazine named lahaye one of the 25 most influential evangelicals in america and in the
