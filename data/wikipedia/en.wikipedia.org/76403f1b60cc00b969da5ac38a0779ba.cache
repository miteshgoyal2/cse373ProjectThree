street newspaper from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about homeless newspapers for other alternative newspapers see street press a street newspaper vendor selling street sheet in san francisco street newspapers or street papers are newspapers or magazines sold by homeless or poor individuals and produced mainly to support these populations most such newspapers primarily provide coverage about homelessness and povertyrelated issues and seek to strengthen social networks within homeless communities street papers aim to give these individuals both employment opportunities and a voice in their community in addition to being sold by homeless individuals many of these papers are partially produced and written by them in the late 19th and early 20th centuries several publications by charity religious and labor organizations tried to draw attention to the homeless but street newspapers only became common after the founding of new york citys street news in 1989 similar papers are now published in over 30 countries with most located in the united states and western europe they are supported by governments charities and coalitions such as the international network of street papers and the north american street newspaper association although street newspapers have multiplied many still face challenges including funding shortages unreliable staff and difficulty in generating interest and maintaining an audience street newspapers are sold mainly by homeless individuals but the newspapers vary in how much content is submitted by them and how much of the coverage pertains to them while some papers are written and published mainly by homeless contributors others have a professional staff and attempt to emulate mainstream publications these differences have caused controversy among street newspaper publishers over what type of material should be covered and to what extent the homeless should participate in writing and production one popular street newspaper the big issue has been a focus of this controversy because it concentrates on attracting a large readership through coverage of mainstream issues and popular culture whereas other newspapers emphasize homeless advocacy and social issues and earn less of a profit contents 1 history 11 historical foundations 12 modern street newspapers 2 description 21

an early hobo news front page historical foundationsedit although the modern street newspaper began with the 1989 publication of street news in new york city12 and the street sheet in san francisco 1989 newspapers sold by the poor and homeless to generate income and to bring attention to social problems date back to the late 19th century journalism scholar norma fay green has cited the war cry created by the salvation army in london in 1879 as an early form of dissident underground alternative publication3 the war cry was sold by salvation army officers and the working poor to draw peoples attention to the poor living conditions of these individuals another precursor to the modern street newspaper was cincinnatis45 hobo news which ran from 1915 to 1930note 1 and featured writing from prominent labor and social activists as well as industrial workers of the world members alongside contributions of oral history creative writing and artwork from hoboes or itinerant beggars6 most street papers published before 1970 such as the catholic worker founded in 19337 were affiliated with religious organizations8 like workers papers and other forms of alternative media in the late 19th and early 20th centuries early street newspapers were often created because the founders believed mainstream news did not cover issues that were relevant to ordinary people5 modern street newspapersedit modern street newspapers began to emerge in the united states in the late 1980s in response to increasing levels of homelessness and homeless advocates dissatisfaction with the mainstream medias portrayals of the homeless910 at the time many media outlets portrayed homeless people as being all criminals and drug addicts and suggested that homelessness was a result of laziness rather than societal or political factors7 thus one motivation for the creation of the first street newspapers was to counter the negative coverage of homeless people that was coming from existing media street news founded in late 1989 in new york city is frequently cited as the first modern street newspaper1112 street sheet in san francisco started organically around the same time without the knowledge of street news existence and is considered the longestrunning continuously published street newspaper while some small papers were already being published when it was founded street news attracted the most attention and became the catalyst for many other papers13 many more street papers were launched in the early 1990s21415 crediting the highprofile new york paper as their inspiration such as spare change news in boston founded in 1992 during this period an average of five new papers were created every year18 this growth has been attributed both to changing attitudes and policies towards homeless individuals and to the ease of publishing provided by desktop computers1816 after 1989 at least 100 papers17 sprung up in over 30 countries18 by 2008 an estimated 32 million people worldwide read street newspapers and 250000 poor disadvantaged or homeless individuals sold or contributed to them16 a vendor for straatnieuws in zoetermeer the netherlands street papers have been started in many major cities worldwide19 mainly in the united states and western europe2021 they have especially proliferated in germany which in 1999 had more street newspapers than the rest of europe combined21 and in sweden where the street papers aluma situation sthlm and faktum won the 2006 grand prize award for journalism of the swedish publicists association2223 street papers have been established in some cities in canada africa south america and asia216 even within the united states some street newspapers such as chicagos bilingual hasta cuando are published in languages other than english24 in the mid1990s coalitions were established to strengthen the street newspaper movement the international network of street papers insp founded in 1994 and the north american street newspaper association nasna founded in 1997 aim to provide support for street papers and to uphold ethical standards25 in particular the insp was established to help groups that were starting new street newspapers to bring more mainstream media attention to the street newspaper movement during the 1990s and to support interaction and crosstalk between street paper publishers and staff from different countries26 the insp and the nasna voted to combine their resources in 200627 they have collaborated to found the street news service a project which collects articles from member papers and archives them on the internet25 national street paper coalitions have also been formed in europe there is a national coalition in italy and the netherlands has the straatmedia groep nederland21 descriptionedit a vendor for streetwise in chicago most street newspapers have three main purposes728 to provide income and job skills to the homeless and other marginalized individuals who act as vendors of and often contributors to the newspapers to provide coverage of and to educate the general public about issues pertaining to homelessness and poverty to establish social networks within homeless communities and between homeless individuals and service providers the defining characteristic of a street newspaper is that it is sold by homeless or marginalized vendors29 while many street newspapers aim to provide coverage of social issues and educate the public about homelessness this goal is often secondary many people who buy street newspapers do so to support and express solidarity with the homeless vendor rather than to read the paper30 the precise demographics of the readership of street newspapers is unclear a pair of 1993 surveys conducted by chicagos streetwise suggested that the papers readers at the time tended to be collegeeducated with slightly over half being female and slightly over half unmarried31 operations and businessedit most street newspapers operate by selling the papers to homeless vendors for a fraction of the retail price usually between 10 and 50 after which the vendors sell the papers for the retail price and retain all the proceeds from street sales1820note 2 the income vendors earn from sales is intended to help them get back on their feet8 the purpose of requiring vendors to purchase papers up front and earn back the money by selling them is to help them develop skills in financial management32 vendors for most newspapers are identifiable by badges3334 or messenger bags33 many newspapers require that vendors sign a code of conduct35 or otherwise clean up their act1 most street newspaper vendors in the united states and united kingdom are homeless individuals although in several other countries especially in europe papers are mainly sold by refugees36 nevertheless not all vendors are homeless some have stable housing situations but are unable to hold other jobs while others started out homeless but were eventually able to use their income from sales to find housing in general the major american street newspapers do not require prospective vendors to show proof of homelessness or poverty and they do not require vendors to retire once they find stable housing37 in the united states since 2008 there have been a growing number of vendors who are newly needy—only recently homeless or with only temporary financial difficulty—as opposed to the chronically homeless who have traditionally made up the majority of the vendor force these vendors are often welleducated and have extensive work experience but lost their jobs in the 2008 financial crisis38 street papers start in a variety of ways some such as street sense17 are begun by homeless or formerly homeless individuals whereas others are more professional ventures20 many particularly in the united states receive aid from local government and charities2039 and coalitions such as the international network of street papers and the north american street newspaper association provide workshops and support for new street papers25 many develop in a bottomup fashion starting up through volunteer work and newcomers to the media business and gradually expanding to include professionals2040 for most papers the majority of revenue comes from sales donations and government grants while some receive advertising revenue from local businesses202441 there has been some disagreement among street newspaper publishers and supporters over whether papers should accept advertising with some arguing that advertising is practical and helps support the paper and others claiming that many kinds of advertisements are inappropriate in a paper that is mainly geared towards the poor42 specific business models for street newspapers vary widely ranging from vendormanaged papers that place the highest value upon homeless empowerment and involvement to highly professionalized and commercialized weeklies2 some papers especially in europe operate as autonomous businesses while others operate as parts of existing organizations or projects43 there are papers that are very successful such as the ukbased the big issue which in 2001 sold nearly 300000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of 1 million44usd in profits but many papers sell as few as 3000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers2 coverageedit most street newspapers report on issues regarding homelessness and poverty2 sometimes functioning as a main source of information on policy changes and other practical issues that are relevant to the homeless but may go unreported in mainstream media45 many feature contributions from the homeless and the poor in addition to articles by activists and community organizers68 including profiles of individual street newspaper vendors244246 for example the first edition of washington dcs street sense included a description of a prominent homeless community an interview with a congresswoman an editorial about the costs and benefits of taking a job several poems about homelessness a howto column and a section for recipes1 a 2009 issue of the lawrence kansasbased change of heart included a story on the recent bulldozing of a homeless camp a review of a book on homelessness a description of the family promise organization for homeless support and a list of community resources47 much of this content was submitted by the homeless33 the writing style is often simple and clear social scientist kevin howley describes street newspapers as having a native eloquence48 according to howley street newspapers are similar to citizen journalism in that both are a response to the perceived shortcomings of the mainstream media and both encourage involvement by nonprofessionals a major difference between the two however is that the citizen journalism movement does not necessarily advocate a particular position whereas street newspapers openly advocate for the homeless and poor49 unlike most street newspapers the ukbased the big issue focuses mostly on celebrity news and interviews rather than coverage of homelessness and poverty1 it is still sold by homeless vendors and uses the bulk of its proceeds to support homeless individuals and advocacy organizations for the homeless but the papers content is mostly written by professional staff and geared towards a broad audience11 because of its professional nature and high production values it has been a frequent target of criticism in an ongoing debate between adherents of professional and grassroots ideals of how street newspapers should work2050 social benefitsedit in addition to providing some individuals with income and employment street newspapers are intended to give homeless participants responsibility and independence and to create a tightknit homeless community151 many offer additional programs to vendors such as job training housing placement assistance and referral to other direct services others operate as a program of a larger social services organization—for instance chicagos streetwise can refer vendors to providers of drug and alcohol treatment high school equivalency classes career counseling and permanent housing1 most are engaged in some form of organizing and advocacy regarding homelessness and poverty and many function as watchdogs for the local homeless communities2 howley has described street newspapers as a means of mobilizing the networks of formal and informal relationships that exist between the homeless the unemployed and the working poor and shelter managers healthcare workers community organizers and others who work on their behalf6 challenges and criticismsedit in 2005 seattles real change redesigned its format and began to be published weekly in attempt to avoid being seen as a charity buy52 in the early days of street newspapers people were often reluctant to buy from homeless vendors for fear that they were being scammed53 furthermore many of the more activist papers fail to sell well because their writing and production are perceived to be unprofessional and lackluster topics covered are sometimes seen as lacking newsworthy content and of little relevance or interest to the general public or the homeless community1154 organizations in montreal11 and san francisco54 have responded to these criticisms by offering workshops in writing and journalism for homeless contributors papers such as streetwise have in the past been criticized as grim and for having vendors that are too loud and intrusive55 some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read as many people will donate to vendors without buying or buy the newspaper and then throw it away305256 howley has described readers hesitance or unwillingness to read the papers as compassion fatigue57 on the other hand those papers that do sell well and are widely read such as the big issue are often targets of criticism for being too mainstream or commercial1158 other difficulties street newspapers face include high turnover of transient or unreliable staff115759 lack of adequate funding112441 lack of journalistic freedom for papers that are funded by local government and among some demographics lack of interest in homeless issues for example journalism professor jim cunningham has attributed the difficulties in selling calgarys calgary street talk to the fact that the mostly middleclass conservative population has not enough sensitivity to the causes of homelessness11 finally antihomeless legislation often targets street newspapers and vendors for example in new york city and cleveland laws have prevented vendors from selling papers on public transit or other hightraffic areas making it difficult for the papers street news and homeless grapevine to earn revenue24 differing approachesedit in part because of its flashy design and high production values the big issue has been a source of controversy among street newspapers among proponents and publishers of street newspapers there is disagreement over how street newspapers should be run and what their goals should be reflecting a clash between two philosophies for advocating social change50 on one side of the debate are papers that seek to function like a business and generate a profit and a wide readership in order to benefit the homeless in a practical way on the other are papers that seek to provide a voice to the homeless and poor without watering down their message for a broad readership50 timothy harris the director of real change has described the two camps as liberal entrepreneurial and radical grassroots activist13 controversy surrounding the big issue the worlds most widely circulated street newspaper1112 is a good example of these two schools of thoughtnote 3 the big issue is mostly a tabloid covering celebrity news while it is sold by the homeless and generates a profit that is used to benefit the homeless the content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues that are relevant to them1 in the late 1990s when the londonbased paper began making plans to enter markets in the united states many american street newspaper publishers reacted defensively saying they could not compete with the production values and mainstream appeal of the professionally produced the big issue250 or that the big issue did not do enough to provide a voice to the homeless60 the reaction to the big issue raised what is now an ongoing conflict between commercialized professional papers and more grassrootsstyle ones1220 with papers such as the big issue emulating mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues and others focusing on political and social issues rather than on content that will generate money2 some street newspaper proponents believe that the primary aim of the papers should be to give homeless individuals a voice and to fill the void10 in mainstream media coverage whereas others believe it should be to provide homeless individuals with jobs and an income50 other frequent areas of disagreement include the extent that the homeless should participate in the writing and printing of street newspapers11 and whether street newspapers should accept advertising to generate revenue42 kevin howley sums up the division between different street newspaper models when he questions if it is possible or desirable for that matter to publish a dissident newspaper—that is a publication committed to progressive social change—and still attract a wide audience50 list of street newspapersedit main article list of street newspapers notesedit another author claims the paper had a shorter lifespan running from the late 1910s to the early 1920s heinz 2004 p 534 some street newspapers however work differently having vendors pay back a portion of the proceeds after selling the paper corporal 2008 although the big issue has attracted attention and controversy because of its stature it is not the only street newspaper that follows a businessoriented model numerous street newspapers work in a similar way with the big issue being the most
