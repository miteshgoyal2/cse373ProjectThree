relationships in new york with prominent diplomats1 as the watergate scandal heated up in 1973 nixon asked bush to become chairman of the republican national committee barbara advised her husband to reject the offer because of the harsh political climate1 but he accepted anyway nixons successor gerald r ford appointed bush head of the us liaison office in the peoples republic of china in 1974 and thus the bushes moved internationally barbara enjoyed her time spent in china and often rode bicycles with her husband to explore the cities and regions that few americans had traveled to1 just three years later bush was recalled to the us to serve as director of central intelligence during a crucial time of legal uncertainty for the agency her husband was not allowed to share pertinent aspects of his job with barbara as they were classified the ensuing sense of isolation coupled with her perception that she was not achieving her goals while other women of her time were plunged her into a depression14 she did not seek professional help and instead began delivering speeches and presentations about her time spent in the closedoff china and began volunteering at a hospice1 barbara bush defended her husbands experience and personal qualities when he announced his candidacy for president of the united states in 1980 she caused a stir when she said that she supported ratification of the equal rights amendment and was prochoice on abortion1 this placed her at odds with the conservativewing of the republican party led by california governor ronald reagan reagan would receive the presidential nomination over her husband reagan however chose bush to be his running mate and the team was elected in 1980 second lady of the united states barbara bushs eight years as second lady

later apologized to ferraro in 1988 vice president bush announced his candidacy for president to succeed reagan by this time barbara had experienced two presidential campaigns but broke new ground by becoming the second candidates spouse to speak at the national party convention that nominated her husband after eleanor roosevelt in 19401 she promised voters that she would be a traditional first lady and campaigned actively for her husband5 the campaign at times focused on the large bush family and contrasted her with the first lady nancy reagan by highlighting her interest in domestic staples such as church gardening and time spent with family while placing less emphasis on style sense and fashion she drew attention to both her famous white hair and disinterest in wearing designer clothes1 she generally avoided discussion of political issues during the campaign particularly those on which she and her husband differed and those closely involved with the campaign have reported that she was actively involved in campaign strategy1 bush was elected in november 1988 and sworn in on january 20 1989 – and the nation had a new first lady first lady of the united states the first

how much things had changed for her and her husband since becoming president and first lady as opposed to a limousine bush tried to use a smaller car and travel by train and commercial airplane for outoftown trips however bush was partially opposed in her wishes by the heads of her secret service detail who agreed to the small car but did not approve to the commercial traveling given the number of threats to the first lady being higher than that of the vice president despite their opposition what put bush most off was the fact that her flights would be delayed while agents checked out the planes and luggage the plane bush traveled on was nicknamed bright star in honor of the leukemia foundation her husband and hugh liedtke founded after her daughter robin died11 her wellesley college

develop graves disease within two years of each other15 the bush dog millie came down with graves disease too although there are reports that she had a different autoimmune disease lupus because of the remarkable coincidence of three cases of autoimmune disease in one household the secret service tested the water in the white house at camp david at the vice presidents residence and at walkers point bushs home in maine for lithium and iodine two substances known to cause thyroid problemscitation needed bush was more popular than her immediate predecessor nancy reagan and successor hillary clinton because she carefully avoided controversy and took very few positions publicly on issues16 life after the white house since leaving the white house she and her husband reside in the river oaks
