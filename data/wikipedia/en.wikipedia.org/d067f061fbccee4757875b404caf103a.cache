john tatlock considered dirty diana as a confused lumbering slog of a song thinking that jackson was never convincing in this kind of role a boychild trying to write a song about the kind of woman he never meets in the kind of places hes certainly never been to6 davitt sigerson of rolling stone gave the song a more positive review though calling it a filler she still commented that the song along with speed demon is what makes bad richer sexier better than thrillers forgettables14 sigerson noted that dirty diana was a substantial recording because of its insubstantial melody14 jennifer clay of yahoo music commented that while jacksons edgier image was a little hard to swallow the image musically worked on the songs bad man in the mirror and dirty diana but was not to the degree of
