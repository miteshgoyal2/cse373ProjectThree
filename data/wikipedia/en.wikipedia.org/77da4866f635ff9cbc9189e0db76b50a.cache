with the living dead due to jackson being a jehovahs witness at the time the video begins with a disclaimer that reads due to my strong personal convictions i wish to stress that this film in no way endorses a belief in the occult —michael jackson on a night set in the 1950s a teenaged michael and his unnamed girlfriend ola ray run out of gas while driving in a wooded area they walk into the forest as they leave the car behind and michael asks her to be his girlfriend she accepts and he gives her a ring however he then tells her that he is not like other guys she tells him thats the reason she loves him but michael insists that she doesnt understand what he means as his girlfriend asks what hes talking about a full moon appears and michael begins transforming into a werecat3 growling at her to leave in the process the girl screams in terror and attempts to escape but the werecat chases her knocks her down lunges at her with his claws and attacks her offscreen the scene then cuts to a movie theater where michael and his unnamed girlfriend along with an excitable audience are actually watching the scene unfold in a vincent price horror movie titled thriller afraid michaels girlfriend leaves the theater and michael follows telling her its only a movie some debate follows as to whether or not she was scared by the movie she denies it but michael disagrees they then walk down a foggy road as michael sings verses of the song excluding the chorus they pass a nearby graveyard in which the undead begin to rise out of their graves as vincent prices speech is heard the zombies corner the two main characters threateningly and suddenly michael becomes a zombie himself the zombies then break into an elaborate dance number followed by the main chorus of thriller during which michael reverts to human form frightening his date to the point where she runs for cover michael who has turned back into a zombie and his fellow corpses chase the terrified girl into the room of a nearby abandoned house while being cornered michael then reaches for the girls throat as she lets out a horrifying shriek only to awake and realize it was all a nightmare michael then offers to take her home and she happily accepts as they walk out of the house michael turns to the camera with a sinister grin revealing his yellow werecat eyes from the opening scene as vincent price offers one last spinetingling and echoing laugh as the credits are shown a reprise scene is shown and at the end of the credits the zombies dance back to their graves as a disclaimer appears saying that any similarity to actual events or persons living dead or undead is purely coincidental the same disclaimer that appeared in an american werewolf in london also directed by landis after that a zombie breaks the fourth wall and gives a terrifying grimace to the audience as the screen fades to black creditsedit directed by john landis produced by george folsey jr michael jackson john

productionedit in the summer of 1983 thriller had begun to decline in sales walter yetnikoff and larry stessel answered calls throughout the night from jackson walter the record isn’t no 1 anymore yetnikoff recalls jackson saying what are we going to do about it we’re going to go to sleep and deal with it tomorrow yetnikoff remembered answering jackson manager frank dileo first mentioned the idea of making a third video and pressed jackson to consider the album’s title track it’s simple—all you’ve got to do is dance sing and make it scary dileo recalls telling jackson21 in early august after seeing an american werewolf in london jackson contacted john landis to direct the video at the time commercial motionpicture directors did not direct music videos but landis was intrigued21 the music video was filmed at the palace theatre in downtown los angeles the zombie dance sequence at the junction of union pacific avenue and south calzona street in east los angeles and the final house scene in the angeleno heights neighborhood at 1345 carroll avenue all principal photography was done in midoctober 198322 aftermathedit in an interview that aired december 11 1999 for mtvs 100 greatest videos ever made jackson spoke about the making of the video my idea was to make this short film with conversation in the beginning – i like having a beginning and a middle and an ending which would follow a story im very much involved in complete making and creating of the piece it has to be you know my soul usually you know its an interpretation of the music it was a delicate thing to work on because i remember my original approach was how do you make zombies and monsters dance without it being comical so i said we have to do just the right kind of movement so it doesnt become something that you laugh at but it just has to take it to another level so i got in a room with choreographer michael peters and he and i together kind of imagined how these zombies move by making faces in the mirror i used to come to rehearsal sometimes with monster makeup on and i loved doing that so he and i collaborated and we both choreographed the piece and i thought it should start like that kind of thing and go into this jazzy kind of step you know kind of gruesome things like that not too much ballet or whatever — michael jackson23 themesedit according to kobena mercer the video is strewn with allusions to horror films24 the opening scene is a parody of 1950s b movie horror films with the characters dressed in the fashions of 1950s teenagers the metamorphosis of the polite boy next door into a werecat can be seen as a depiction of male sexuality a sexuality that is depicted as naturally bestial predatory aggressive violent and therefore monstrous24 mercer perceived similarities with the werewolf depiction in the company of wolves 198424 the second metamorphosis of the video has michael becoming a zombie it serves as an introduction to a dance sequence which features dancing ghouls corresponding to a song lyric mentioning a masquerade ball of the dead25 the scene calls attention to the macabre makeup of the ghouls jacksons own makeup casts a ghostly pallor over his skin and emphasizes the outline of his skull the image itself serves as an allusion to the mask from the phantom of the opera 192525 according to peter dendle the zombie invasion sequence of the film is inspired by night of the living dead 1968 the film manages to treat the sequence with enough seriousness to capture the feelings of claustrophobia and helplessness which are essential to the subgenre of zombie films26 making michael jacksons thrilleredit the palace theatre is featured in the music video released in tandem with the video was an hourlong documentary providing candid glimpses behind the scenes of the production called making michael jacksons thriller it too was shown heavily on mtv for a time and was the topselling homevideo release of all time at

songs off the wall and workin day and night mtv paid 250000 for the exclusive rights to show the documentary showtime paid 300000 for paycable rights and vestron music video reportedly put down an additional 500000 to market the cassette in a profit participation27 rick baker expected to have a few weeks to do the special effects make up for the zombies which usually requires impressions to be taken of the actors face to base the prosthetics on only to find out the dancers would not be cast until a few days before shooting began it was decided to do generic make up for the dancers using a combination of precast prosthetics while members of bakers crew in the more elaborate make up for shots that featured more closeups like the zombie coming out of the manhole broadway and litigationedit in 2009 jackson sold the rights of thriller to the nederlander organization to stage a broadway musical based on the video jackson was sued by landis in a dispute over royalties for the video landis claims that he is owed four years worth of royalties2829 ola ray has also complained about difficulties collecting royalties at first ray blamed jackson but then she apologized to him in 1997 however ray did sue jackson on may 6 2009 in a dispute to obtain uncollected royalties30 less than two months before jacksons death on june 25 eventually the jackson family trust settled31 legacyedit participants of the 2008 thrill the world event in austin texas following the success of the thriller video a hollywood production company reportedly began serious work on trying to turn jacksons song billie jean which is also featured on jacksons thriller album into a feature film but no plans were ever completed32 vinny marino of abc news commented that thrillers music video being selected as the greatest video of all time was a nobrainer and remarked that michael jacksons thriller continues to be considered the greatest video ever by just about everyone33 gil kaufman of mtv described the thriller video as being iconic and felt that it was one of jacksons most enduring legacies34 kaufman also noted that the music video was the minimovie that revolutionized music videos and cemented jacksons status as one of the most ambitious innovative pop stars of all time34 steve peake of aboutcom listed thriller as being jacksons eighth best song of the 1980s35 patrick kevin day and todd martens of the los angeles times commented that thrillers phenomenal success led to a breaking down of traditional racial barriers on fm radio at the time new yorks wplj a white station played jacksons beat it because of eddie van halens appearance on it the song caused a wave of protests from some listeners who didnt want black music on their station mtv also had a reputation for favoring white performers at the time and its heavy rotation of jackson videos helped alleviate the criticism32 leaders in michael jacksons religion were not so pleased by contrast in spite of his disclaimer at the beginning of the video jackson made a public apology in the pages of awake a magazine published by the watch tower bible and tract society of pennsylvania i would never do it again says jackson i just intended to do a good fun short film not to purposely bring to the screen something to scare people or to do anything bad i want to do what’s right i would never do anything like that again why not because a lot of people were offended by it explains jackson that makes me feel bad i don’t want them to feel that way i realize now that it wasn’t a good idea i’ll never do a video like that again he continues in fact i have blocked further distribution of the film over which i have control including its release in some other countries there’s all kinds of promotional stuff being proposed on thriller but i tell them ‘no no no i don’t want to do anything on thriller no more thriller’ 36 in december 2009 the music video for thriller was selected for the national film registry by the library of congress thriller is the first music video to ever be inducted37 the registry explained because of the way the recording industry is evolving and changing we thought it would be good to go back to the development of an earlier seismic shift which was the development of the music video34 and described the music video as being the most famous music video of all time38 the coordinator of the national film preservation board who decides upon candidates for inclusion in the national film registry steve legett noted that the music video was considered for induction for
