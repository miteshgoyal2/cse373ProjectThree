moore chuck jackson and king4 robert hilburn wrote about the album in the los angeles times on april 5 1990 the most entertaining thing about this ensemble salute to spicy memphisstyle 50s and 60s rb is the way it lets you surprise your friends play a selection such as knock on wood or bad boy for someone without identifying the singer then watch their eyes bulge when you reveal that its the controversial national chairman of the republican party lee atwater during the 1960s atwater briefly played backup guitar for percy sledge4 in 1973 atwater graduated from newberry college a small private lutheran institution in newberry south carolina where he was a member of the alpha tau omega fraternity5 at newberry atwater served as the governor of the south carolina student legislature he earned a master of arts degree in communications from the university of south carolina in 19772 political careeredit during the 1970s and the 1980 election atwater rose to prominence in the south carolina republican party actively participating in the campaigns of governor carroll campbell and senator strom thurmond during his years in south carolina atwater became wellknown for managing hardedged campaigns based on emotional wedge issuescitation needed 1980 and 1984 electionsedit atwaters aggressive tactics were first demonstrated during the 1980 congressional campaigns he was a campaign consultant to republican incumbent floyd spence in his campaign for congress against democratic nominee tom turnipseed atwaters tactics in that campaign included push polling in the form of fake surveys by socalled independent pollsters to inform white suburbanites that turnipseed was a member of the naacpcitation needed he also sent out lastminute letters from senator thurmond telling voters that turnipseed would disarm the united states and turn it over to liberals and communistscitation needed at a press briefing atwater planted a fake reporter who rose and said we understand that turnipseed has had psychiatric treatment atwater later told reporters off of the record that turnipseed got hooked up to jumper cables referring to electroconvulsive therapy that turnipseed underwent as a teenager6 president ronald reagan during a trip via air force one to alabama with lee atwater and stu spencer on october 15 1984 lee seemed to delight in making fun of a suicidal 16yearold who was treated for depression with electroshock treatments turnipseed recalled in fact my struggle with depression as a student was no secret i had talked about it in a widelycovered news conference as early as 1977 when i was in the south carolina state senate since then i have often shared with appropriate groups the full story of my recovery to responsible adulthood as a professional political and civic leader husband and father teenage depression and suicide are major problems in the united states and i believe that my life story offers hope to young people who are suffering with a constant fear of the future6 after the 1980 election atwater went to washington and became an aide in the ronald reagan administration working under political director ed rollins in 1984 rollins managed reagans reelection campaign and atwater became the campaigns deputy director and political director rollins mentions atwaters work several times in his 1996 book bare knuckles and back rooms7 he states that atwater ran a dirty tricks operation against democratic vicepresidential nominee geraldine ferraro including publicizing the fact that ferraros parents had been indicted on numbers running in the 1940s rollins also described atwater as ruthless ollie north in civilian clothes and someone who just had to drive in one more stake8 atwater became a senior partner at the political consulting firm of black manafort stone and kelly the day after the 1984 presidential election9 during his years in washington atwater became aligned with vice president george h w bush who chose atwater to manage his 1988 presidential campaigncitation needed southern strategyedit as a member of the reagan administration in 1981 atwater gave an anonymous interview to political scientist alexander p lamis part of the interview was printed in lamis book the twoparty south then reprinted in southern politics in the 1990s with atwaters name revealed bob herbert reported on the interview in the october 6 2005 edition of the new york times on november 13 2012 the nation magazine released a 42minute audio recording of the interview10 james carter iv grandson of former president jimmy carter had asked and been granted access to these tapes by lamis widow atwater talked about the republican southern strategy and ronald reagans version of it atwater as to the whole southern strategy that harry s dent sr and others put together in 1968 opposition to the voting rights act would have been a central part of keeping the south now you dont have to do that all that you need to do to keep the south is for reagan to run in place on the issues that hes campaigned on since 1964 and thats fiscal conservatism balancing the budget cut taxes you know the whole cluster questioner but the fact is isnt it that reagan does get to the wallace voter and to the racist side of the wallace voter by doing away with legal services by cutting down on food stamps atwater you start out in 1954 by saying nigger nigger nigger by 1968 you cant say nigger—that hurts you backfires so you say stuff like forced busing states rights and all that stuff youre getting so abstract now that youre talking about cutting taxes and all these things youre talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites and subconsciously maybe that is part of it im not saying that but im saying that if it is getting that abstract and that coded that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other you follow me—because obviously sitting around saying we want to cut this is much more abstract than even the busing thing and a hell of a lot more abstract than nigger nigger1112 atwater also argued that reagan did not need to make racial appeals suggesting that reagans issues transcended the racial prism of the southern strategy atwater but reagan did not have to do a southern strategy for two reasons number one race was not a dominant issue and number two the mainstream issues in this campaign had been quote southern issues since way back in the sixties so reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense the whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism any kind of reference and ill tell you another thing you all need to think about that even surprised me is the lack of interest really the lack of knowledge right now in the south among white voters about the voting rights act13 other aspects of the southern strategy included personal smears as onetime house majority leader richard armey explained on hard ball with chris mathews1 well its pretty standard fare in political discourse you misconstrue what somebody said you isolate a statement you lend your interpretation to it and then feign moral outrage this same method was used against presidential candidate john kerry in 2004 in what has come to be known as swiftboating although kerry was a war veteran he was accused of shooting himself on purpose to win medals to help his future political career 1988 electionedit lee atwater jams with president george hw bush at inaugural festivity 21 january 1989 atwaters most noteworthy campaign was the 1988 presidential election when he served as the campaign manager for republican nominee george h w bush dukakis also supported a felon furlough program originally begun under republican governor francis sargent in 1972 prison furlough programs had been long established in california during the governorship of republican ronald reagan prior to 1980 but never allowed furlough for convicted murderers sentenced to life in prisoncitation needed in 1976 massachusetts passed a law to similarly ban furloughs for firstdegree murderers and dukakis vetoed the bill soon afterward willie horton who was serving a life sentence for firstdegree murder for stabbing a boy to death during a robbery was released on weekend furlough during which he kidnapped a young couple tortured the man and repeatedly raped the woman horton then became the centerpiece of atwaters ad campaign against dukakis the issue of furlough for firstdegree murderers was originally brought up by democratic candidate al gore during a presidential primary debate however gore never referred specifically to horton dukakis had tried to portray himself as a moderate politician from the liberal state of massachusetts the horton ad campaign only reinforced the publics general opinion that dukakis was too liberal which helped bush overcome dukakis 17percent lead in early public opinion polls and win both the electoral and popular vote by landslide marginscitation needed although atwater clearly approved of the use of the willie horton issue the bush campaign never ran any commercial with hortons picture instead they ran a similar but generic ad the original commercial was produced by americans for bush an independent group managed by larry mccarthy and republicans benefited from the coverage it attracted in the national media referring to dukakis atwater declared that he would strip the bark off the little bastard and make willie horton his running mate2 atwaters challenge was to counter the where was george campaign slogan democrats were using as a rallying cry in an effort to create an impression that bush was a relatively inexperienced and unaccomplished candidate furthermore bush had critics in the republican base who remembered his prochoice positions in the 1980 primary and that the harder the campaign pursued dukakiss liberal positions the bigger his base turnout would be during the election a number of allegations were made in the media about dukakis personal life including the unsubstantiated claim that his wife kitty had burned a us flag to protest the vietnam war and that dukakis had been treated for a mental illness in the film boogie man the lee atwater story robert novak reveals for the first time that atwater personally tried but failed to get him to spread these mentalhealth rumors14 the 1988 bush campaign overcame a 17point deficit in midsummer polls to win 40 states during that campaign future president george w bush took an office across the hall from atwaters where his job was to serve as his fathers eyes and ears bush wrote in his autobiography i was an allegiance enforcer and a listening ear15 in her memoir barbara bush said the younger bush whom atwater called junior and atwater became great friends16 rnc chairmanedit after the election atwater was named chairman of the republican national committee shortly after atwater took over the rnc jim wright a democrat was forced to resign as speaker of the house and was succeeded by tom foley on the day that foley officially became speaker the rnc began circulating a memo to republican congresspeople and state party chairpeople called tom foley out of the liberal closet the memo compared foleys voting record with that of openly gay congressman barney frank with a subtle implication that foley was himself gay it had been crafted by rnc communications director mark goodin and by house minority whip newt gingrich in fact gingrich had been attempting to convince several reporters to print it17 the memo was harshly condemned by both political parties republican senate leader bob dole for instance said in a speech in the senate chamber this is not politics this is garbagecitation needed atwater initially defended the memo calling it no big deal and factually accurate however some days later he claimed that he had not approved the memo17 under pressure from bush atwater fired goodin replacing him with b jay coopercitation needed following bushs victory atwater focused on organizing a public relations campaign against arkansas governor bill clinton18 atwater viewed clinton as a serious potential threat to bush in the 1992 presidential election18 at the time of atwaters illness he was supporting the bid of representative tommy robinson for the republican gubernatorial nomination to oppose clinton in the fall robinson lost the primary to former arkla gas ceo sheffield nelsoncitation needed in 1989 atwater became a member of the historically black howard university board of trustees the university gained national attention when students rose up in protest against atwaters appointment student activists disrupted howards 122nd anniversary celebrations and eventually occupied the universitys administration building19 within days both atwater and howard president james e cheek resigned20 musical careeredit in 1988 atwater and several friends founded a restaurant named red hot blue in arlington virginia 21 the restaurant which has since grown into a chain served real memphis bbq and played memphis blues music in the dining room atwater recorded a 1990 album with bb king and others on curb records titled red hot blue4 he also performed with paul shaffer and his band in an episode of late night with david letterman14 personal lifeedit marriage and childrenedit atwater married sally dunbar in 1978 they had three children sara lee ashley page and sally theodosia2 his widow ran for superintendent of education for south carolina in 201422 she was endorsed by former president george hw bush23 illnessedit on march 5 1990 atwater suffered a seizure during a fundraising breakfast for senator phil gramm2 doctors discovered a grade 3 astrocytoma an aggressive form of brain cancer in his right parietal lobe he underwent interstitial implant radiation – then a new treatment – at montefiore medical center in new york city followed by conventional radiation therapy at george washington university hospital in washington dc the treatment left him paralyzed on his left side robbed him of his tone discrimination and swelled his face and body24 conversion to roman catholicism and new outlookedit in the months after the severity of his illness became apparent atwater said he had converted to roman catholicism through the help of father john hardon25 and in an act of repentance atwater issued a number of public and written letters to individuals to whom he had been opposed to during his political career in a june 28 1990 letter to tom turnipseed he stated it is very important to me that i let you know that out of everything that has happened in my career one of the low points remains the socalled jumper cable episode adding my illness has taught me something about the nature of humanity love brotherhood and relationships that i never understood and probably never would have so from that standpoint there is some truth and good in everything6 in a february 1991 article for life magazine atwater wrote my illness helped me to see that what was missing in society is what was missing in me a little heart a lot of brotherhood the 1980s were about acquiring – acquiring wealth power prestige i know i acquired more wealth power and prestige than most but you can acquire all you want and still feel empty what power wouldnt i trade for a little more time with my family what price wouldnt i pay for an evening with friends it took a deadly illness to put me eye to eye with that truth but it is a truth that the country caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay can learn on my dime i dont know who will lead us through the 90s but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of american society this tumor of the soul26 the article was notable for atwaters apology to michael dukakis for the naked cruelty of the 1988 presidential election campaign2627 ed rollins however stated in the 2008 documentary boogie man the lee atwater story that atwater was telling this story about how a living bible was what was giving him faith and i said to mary matalin i really sincerely hope that he found peace she said ed when we were cleaning up his things afterwards the bible was still wrapped in the cellophane and had never been taken out of the package which just told you everything there was he was spinning right to the end14 deathedit atwater died on march 29 1991 from his brain tumor funeral services were held at the trinity cathedral church in atwaters final residence columbia south carolina a memorial service was held at the washington national cathedral on thursday april 4 199128 legacyedit sidney blumenthal has speculated that had atwater lived he would have run a stronger reelection campaign for bush than the presidents unsuccessful 1992 effort against bill clinton and ross perot29 atwaters political career is the subject of the featurelength
