input59 the gannett companys board of directors approved the launch of the national newspaper which would be titled usa today on december 5 1981 with the launch neuharth was appointed president and

first issue gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper eventually reaching an estimated circulation of 362879 copies double the amount of copy sales that gannett projected that usa today would accrue by the end of 1982 the design was unique in its incorporation of colorized graphics and photographs initially only its front news section pages were rendered in fourcolor while the remaining pages were displayed in a spot color format the papers overall content style and elevated use of graphics – the result of the concept developed by neuharth in contribution with staff graphics designers george rorick sam ward suzy parker john sherlock and web bryant – was derided by critics who referred to it as mcpaper or television you can wrap fish in because it opted to incorporate more concise shorterform nuggets of information akin to the style of television news rather than indepth stories in many of its sections like traditional newspapers which many in the newspaper industry considered to be a dumbing down of the news91011 although usa today has been in profit for ten years it has changed the appearance and feel of most newspapers in the united states

layout and formatedit this february 5 2009 issue of usa today shows the old layout and logo of the paper prior to its 2012 redesign usa today is known for synthesizing news down to easytoreadandcomprehend stories in the main edition circulated in the united states and some canadian cities each edition consists of four sections news the oftlabeled front page section money sports and life since march 1998 the friday edition of life has been separated into two distinct sections the regular life focusing on entertainment subtitled weekend section e which features television reviews and listings a dvd column film reviews and trends and a travel supplement called destinations diversions section d the international edition of the paper features two sections news and money in one with sports and life in the other atypical of most daily newspapers the paper does not print on saturdays and sundays the friday edition serves as the weekend edition although usa today has published special saturday and sunday editions in the past the first being published on january 19 1991 when it released a saturday extra edition updating coverage of the gulf war from the previous day the paper published special sevendayaweek editions for the first time on july 19 1996 when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of atlanta and surrounding areas for the twoweek duration of the summer olympics9 usa today prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story the cover story is a longer story that requires a jump readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story usually the next page of that section on certain days the news or sports section will take up two paper sections and there will be a second cover story within the second section each section is denoted by a certain color to differentiate sections beyond lettering and is seen in a box the topleft corner of the first page the principal section colors are blue for news section a green for money section b red for sports section c and purple for life section d in the papers early years the life and money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot color as the presses used at usa today printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections29 orange is used for bonus sections section e or above which are published occasionally such as for business travel trends and the olympics other bonus sections for sports such as for the pga tour preview ncaa basketball tournaments memorial day auto races indianapolis 500 and cocacola 600 nfl opening weekend and the super bowl previously used the orange color but now use the red designated for sports in their bonus sections to increase their ties to usa today gannett incorporated the usa today coloring scheme into an internally created graphics package for news programming that the company began phasing in across its television station group – which were spunoff in july 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company tegna – in late 2012 the package utilizes the color scheme for a rundown graphic used on most stations – outside of those that gannett acquired in 2014 from london broadcasting which began implementing the package in late 2015 – that persists throughout its stations newscasts as well as bumpers for individual story topics gannetts television stations began to a new onair appearance that uses a colorcoding system identical to that of the paper30 original logo used from 1982 to 2012 in many ways usa today is set up to break the typical newspaper layout some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the lefthand quarter of each section as reefers frontpage paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages31 sometimes using sentencelength blurbs to describe stories inside the lead reefer is the cover page feature newsline which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections as a national newspaper usa today cannot focus on the weather for any one city therefore the entire back page of the news section is used for weather maps for the continental united states puerto rico and the united states virgin islands and temperature lists for many cities throughout the us and the world temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one or twoletter code such as t for thunderstorms referencing the expected weather conditions the colorized forecast map originally created by staff designer george rorick who left usa today for a similar position at the detroit news in 1986 was copied by newspapers around the world breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges1132 national precipitation maps for the next three days previously five days until the 2012 redesign and fourday forecasts and air quality indexes for 36 major us cities originally 16 cities prior to 1999 – with individual cities colorcoded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map – are also featured weather data is provided by accuweather which has served as the forecast provider for usa today for most of the papers existence with an exception from january 2002 to september 2012 when the weather channel provided data through a longterm multimedia content agreement with gannett3334353637 in the bottom lefthand corner of the weather page is weather focus a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena on some days the weather focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event on mondays the money section uses its back page for market trends a feature that launched in june 2002 and presents an unusual graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly monthly and weekly movements against the sp 500 on days featuring bonus sections or business holidays the money and life sections are usually combined into one section while combinations of the friday life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks advertising coverage is seen in the monday money section which often includes a review of a current television ad and after super bowl sunday a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the ad track live survey stock tables for individual stock exchanges comprising one subsection for companies traded on the new york stock exchange and another for companies trading on nasdaq and the american stock exchange and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the myriad of electronic ways to check individual stock prices in line with most newspapers book coverage including reviews and a national sales chart the latter of which debuted on october 28 1994 is seen on thursdays in life with the official full ac nielsen television ratings chart printed on wednesdays or thursdays depending on release the paper also publishes the mediabase survey for several genres of music based on radio airplay spins on tuesdays along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on wednesdays because of the same limitations cited for its nationalized forecasts the television page in life – which provides prime time and late night listings running from 800 pm to 1230 am eastern time – incorporates a boilerplate local news or local programming descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major english language broadcast networks abc nbc cbs fox and the cw cede airtime to allow their affiliates to carry syndicated programs or local newscasts the television page has never been accompanied by a weekly listings supplement with broader scheduling information similar to those featured in local newspapers like most national papers usa today does not carry comic strips usa today is headquartered in tysons corner virginia one of the staples of the news section is across the usa a statebystate roundup of headlines the summaries consist of paragraphlength associated press reports highlighting one story of note in each state the district of columbia and one us territory similarly the for the record page of the sports section which features sports scores for both the previous four days of league play and individual nonleague events seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for the current days games also features a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for all participating state lotteries and individual multistate lotteries some traditions have been retained however the lead story still appears on the upperright hand of the front page commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the news section stock and mutual fund data are presented in the money section but usa today is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight even in a mix of other newspapers such as at a newsstand the overall design and layout of usa today has been described as neovictorian38 also in most of the sections front pages on the lower left hand corner are usa today snapshots which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in for example a snapshot in life could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time these snapshots are shown through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter using the example above the graphs bars could be made up of several tv sets or ended by one these are usually loosely based on research by a national institute with the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph the newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called open air which launched on march 7 2008 and appears several times a year various other advertorials appear throughout the year mainly on fridays opinion sectionedit the opinion section prints usa today editorials columns by guest writers and members of the editorial board of contributors39 letters to the editor and editorial cartoons one unique feature of the usa today editorial page is the publication of opposing points of view alongside the editorial boards piece on the days topic runs an opposing view by a guest writer often an expert in the field the opinion pieces featured in each edition are decided by the board of contributors which are separate from the papers news staff40 as of 2010update the editorial page editor was brian gallagher who has worked for the newspaper since its founding

elston letters editor michelle poblete web content editor eileen rivers and editorial writers dan carney george hager and saundra torry41 the newspapers website calls this group demographically and ideologically diverse40 usa today has traditionally maintained a policy not to endorse candidates for the united states presidency or any other state or federal political office which it has refrained from doing since its inception since 1984 its political editorials during the presidential election cycle has focused instead on providing opinion on major issues relevant to the campaign based on the differing concerns of voters the vast amount of information on ongoing presidential campaigns and the board of contributors aim to provide a fair viewpoint through the diverse political ideologies of its members and avoid reader perceptions of bias however the board reevaluates its nonendorsement policy through an independent process during each fouryear election cycle with any decision to circumvent the policy based on a consensus vote in which fewer than two of the editorial boards members dissent or hold differing opinions42 the editorial board broke from this stance for the first time on september 29 2016 when it published an oped piece condemning the candidacy of republican nominee donald trump calling him unfit for the presidency due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric particularly that aimed at military veterans immigrants and various ethnic and religious groups his temperament and lack of financial transparency his checkered business record his use of false and hyperbolic statements the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy and based on comments he has made during his campaign and criticisms by both democrats and republicans on these views the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a trump administration asking voters to resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue43 the board noted that the piece was not a qualified endorsement of democratic nominee hillary clinton for whom the board was unable to reach a consensus for endorsing some editorial board members expressed that clintons public service record would help her serve the nation ably as its president while others had serious reservations about her sense of entitlement lack of candor and extreme carelessness in handling classified information instead advising voters to decide whether to vote for clinton libertarian nominee gary johnson green party nominee jill stein or a writein
