with metrogoldwynmayer studios inc mgm in 19492 she later remarked joining metro was like walking into a dream world25 her combination of attractive appearance—centered on her large eyes—and somewhat distant and understated manner made her hard at first for mgm to cast and publicize26 davis appeared in eleven feature films usually typecast as a loyal housewife27 responsible young mother or the steady woman28 jane powell debbie reynolds leslie caron and janet leigh were among the actresses with whom she competed for roles at mgm26 davis as an actress 1950 davis film career began with small

another reviewer however stated that davis plays her part satisfactorily and does well with what she has to work with39 nancy reagan and ronald reagan aboard a boat 1964 author garry wills believed that davis was generally underrated as an actress because her constrained part in hellcats was her most widely seen performance28 in addition davis downplayed her hollywood goals promotional material

assistance in having her name removed from the list19 ronald reagan informed her that she had been confused with another actress of the same name19 the two began dating and their relationship was the subject of many gossip columns one hollywood press account described their nightclubfree times together as the romance of a couple who have no vices42 ronald reagan was skeptical about marriage

her husband she frequently quarreled with her biological children and her stepchildren her relationship with patti was the most contentious patti flouted american conservatism rebelled against her parents by joining the nuclear freeze movement and authored many antireagan books51 the nearly 20 years of family feuding left patti very much estranged from both her mother and father52 soon after

as saying that the two were in an estrangement right now michael responded that nancy was trying to cover up for the fact she had not met his daughter ashley who had been born nearly a year earlier54

parents46 first lady of californiaedit reagan as the first lady of california nancy reagan was first lady of california during her husbands two terms as governor she disliked living in the state capital of sacramento which lacked the excitement social life and mild climate to which she was accustomed in los angeles55 she first attracted controversy early in 1967 when after four months residence in the california governors mansion in sacramento she moved her family into a wealthy suburb because fire officials had labeled the mansion as a firetrap56 though the reagans leased the new house at their expense55 the move was viewed as snobbish reagan defended her actions as being for the good of her family a judgment with which her husband readily agreed5556 friends of the family later helped support the cost of the leased house while reagan supervised construction of a new ranchstyle governors residence in nearby carmichael57 the new residence was finished just as ronald reagan left office in 1975 but his successor jerry brown refused to live there it was sold in 1982 and california governors lived in improvised arrangements until brown moved into the governors

campaign holding coffees luncheons and talks with senior citizens67 with that she oversaw personnel monitored her husbands schedule and occasionally provided press conferences68 the 1976 campaign included the socalled battle of the queens contrasting nancy with first lady betty ford they both spoke out over the course of the campaign on similar issues but with different approaches69 nancy was particularly upset by the warmonger image that the ford campaign had drawn of her husband67 though he lost the 1976 republican nomination ronald reagan ran again for the presidency in 1980 and succeeded in winning the nomination and election during this second campaign nancy played a very prominent role and her management of staff became more apparent68 she arranged a meeting among feuding campaign managers john sears and michael deaver and her husband which resulted in deaver leaving the campaign and sears being given full control after the reagan camp lost the iowa caucus and fell behind in new hampshire polls nancy organized a second meeting and decided it was time to fire sears and his associates she gave sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal68 her

into a state of disrepair following years of neglect71 white house aide michael deaver described the second and third floor family residence as having cracked plaster walls chipped paint and beaten up floors72 rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate she sought private donations13 in 1981 reagan directed a major renovation of several white house rooms including all of the second and third floors73 and rooms adjacent to the oval office including the press briefing room74 the renovation included repainting walls refinishing floors repairing fireplaces and replacing antique pipes windows and wires72 the closet in the master bedroom was converted into a beauty parlor and dressing room and the west bedroom was made into a small gymnasium75 the first lady secured the

extensive redecoration was paid for by private donations1376 many significant and longlasting changes occurred as a result of the renovation and refurbishment of which reagan said this house belongs to all americans and i want it to be something of which they can be proud76 the renovations received some criticisms for being funded by taxdeductible donations meaning some of it eventually did indirectly come from the taxpaying public79 fashionedit reagans interest in fashion was another one of her trademarks while her husband was still presidentelect press reports speculated about reagans social life and interest in fashion808182 in many press accounts reagans sense of style was favorably compared to that of a previous first lady jacqueline kennedy83 friends and those close to her remarked that while fashionable like kennedy she would be different from other first ladies close friend harriet deutsch was quoted as saying nancy has her own imprint81 reagans wardrobe consisted of dresses gowns and suits made by luxury designers including james galanos bill blass and oscar de la renta her white handbeaded one shoulder galanos 1981 inaugural gown was estimated to cost 1000084

fireengine shade became known as reagan red86 she employed two private hairdressers who would style her hair on a regular basis in the white house87 reagan models for vogue in the red room 1981 fashion designers were pleased with the emphasis reagan placed on clothing85 adolfo said the first lady embodied an elegant affluent wellbred chic american look85 while bill blass commented i dont think theres been anyone in the white house since jacqueline kennedy onassis who has her flair85 william fine president of cosmetic company frances denney noted that she stays in style but she doesnt become trendy85 though her elegant fashions and wardrobe were hailed as a glamorous paragon of chic85 they were also controversial subjects in 1982 she revealed that she had accepted thousands of dollars in clothing jewelry and other gifts but defended her actions by stating that she had borrowed the clothes and that they would either be returned or donated to museums8488 and that she was promoting the american fashion industry89 facing criticism she soon said she would no longer accept such loans89 while often buying her clothes she continued to borrow and sometimes keep designer clothes throughout her time as first lady which came to light in 198890 none of this had been included on financial disclosure forms90 the nonreporting of loans under 10000 in liability was in violation of a voluntary agreement the white house had made in 1982 while not reporting more valuable loans or clothes not returned was a possible violation of the ethics in government act909192 reagan expressed through her press secretary regrets that she failed to heed counsels advice on disclosing them92 despite the controversy many designers who allowed her to borrow clothing noted that the arrangement was good for their businesses90 as well as for the american fashion industry overall93 in 1989 reagan was honored at the annual gala awards dinner of the council of fashion designers of america during which she received the councils lifetime achievement award94 barbara walters said of her she has served every day for eight long years the word style94 elegance and formalityedit approximately a year into her husbands first term nancy explored the idea of ordering new state china service for the white house95 a full china service had not been purchased since the truman administration in the 1940s as only a partial service was ordered in the johnson administration95 she was quoted as saying the white house really badly badly needs china95 working with lenox the primary porcelain manufacturer in america the first lady chose a design scheme of a red with etched gold band bordering the scarlet and cream colored ivory plates with a raised presidential seal etched in gold in the center95 the full service comprised 4370 pieces with 19 pieces per individual set95 the service totaled 20950896 although it was paid for by private donations some from the private jp knapp foundation the purchase generated quite a controversy for it was ordered at a time when the nation was undergoing an economic recession97 furthermore news of the china purchase emerged at the same time that her husbands administration had proposed school lunch regulations that would allow ketchup to be counted as a vegetable98 first lady nancy reagan and former first lady jacqueline kennedy onassis with the president in 1985 nancy and jackie were often compared due to their glamour the new china white house renovations expensive clothing and her attendance at the wedding of charles and diana prince and princess of wales99 gave her an aura of being out of touch with the american people during the recession13 this built upon the reputation she had coming to washington wherein many people concluded that reagan was a vain and shallow woman98 and her taste for splendor inspired the derogatory nickname queen nancy13 while jacqueline kennedy had also faced some press criticism for her spending habits reagans treatment was much more consistent and negative83 in an attempt to deflect the criticism she selfdeprecatingly donned a baglady costume at the 1982 gridiron dinner and sang secondhand clothes mimicking the song secondhand rose100 the skit helped to restore her reputation101 reagan reflected on the criticisms in her 1989 autobiography my turn she described lunching with former democratic national committee chairman robert s strauss wherein strauss said to her when you first came to town nancy i didnt like you at all but after i got to know you i changed my mind and said shes some broad reagan responded bob based on the press reports i read then i wouldnt have liked me either102 vice president george hw bush nancy reagan and raisa gorbachova in washington dc 1987 after the presidency of jimmy carter who dramatically reduced the formality of presidential functions reagan brought a kennedyesque glamour back into the white house84103 she hosted 56 state dinners over eight years104 she remarked that hosting the dinners is the easiest thing in the world you dont have to do anything just have a good time and do a little business and thats the way washington works104 the white house residence staff found reagan demanding to work for during the preparation for the state dinners with the first lady overseeing every aspect of meal presentations and sometimes requesting one dessert after another be prepared before finally settling on one she approved of105 in general the first ladys desire for everything to appear just right in the white house led the residence staff to consider her not easy to work for with tirades following what she perceived as mistakes106 one staffer later recalled i remember hearing her call for her personal maid one day and it scared the dickens out of me—just her tone i never wanted to be on the wrong side of her107 she did show loyalty and respect to a number of the staff108 in particular she came to the public defense of a maid who was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle ammunition to paraguay providing an affidavit to the maids good character even though it was politically inopportune to do so at the time of the iran–contra affair charges were subsequently dropped and the maid returned to work at the white house109110 in 1987 mikhail gorbachev became the first soviet leader to visit washington dc since nikita khrushchev made the trip in 1959 at the height of the cold war nancy was in charge of planning and hosting the important and highly anticipated state dinner with the goal to impress both the soviet leader and especially his wife raisa gorbacheva111112 after the meal she recruited pianist van cliburn to play a rendition of moscow nights for the soviet delegation to which mikhail and raisa broke out into song113 secretary of state george p shultz later commented on the evening saying we felt the ice of the cold war crumbling114 reagan concluded it was a perfect ending for one of the great evenings of my husbands presidency115 just say noedit main article just say no the first lady launched the just say no drug awareness campaign in 1982 which was her primary project and major initiative as first lady13 reagan first became aware of the need to educate young people about drugs during a 1980 campaign stop in daytop village new york116 she remarked in 1981 that understanding what drugs can do to your children understanding peer pressure and understanding why they turn to drugs is the first step in solving the problem116 her campaign focused on drug education and informing the youth of the danger of drug abuse116 reagan gives a speech at a just say no rally in los angeles 1987 in 1982 reagan was asked by a schoolgirl what to do when offered drugs reagan responded just say no117118 the phrase proliferated in the popular culture of the 1980s and was eventually adopted as the name of club organizations and school antidrug programs13 reagan became actively involved by traveling more than 250000 miles 400000 km throughout the united states and several nations visiting drug abuse prevention programs and drug rehabilitation centers she also appeared on television talk shows recorded public service announcements and wrote guest articles13 she appeared in single episodes of the television drama dynasty and the sitcom diffrent strokes to underscore support for the just say no campaign and in a rock music video stop the madness 1985119 in 1985 reagan expanded the campaign to an international level by inviting the first ladies of various nations to the white house for a conference on drug abuse13 on october 27 1986 president reagan signed a drug enforcement bill into law which granted 17 billion in funding to fight the perceived crisis and ensured a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses120 although the bill was criticized reagan considered it a personal victory13 in 1988 she became the first first lady invited to address the united nations general assembly where she spoke on international drug interdiction and trafficking laws13 reagan hosting the first white house ladies conference on drug abuse 1985 critics of reagans efforts questioned their purpose121 labelled reagans approach to promoting drug awareness as simplistic71 and argued that the program did not address many social issues including unemployment poverty and family dissolution121 a number of just say no clubs and organizations remain in operation around the country116 her husbands protectoredit reagan assumed the role of unofficial protector for her husband after the attempted assassination in 1981122 on march 30 of that year president reagan and three others were shot by troubled 25year old john hinckley jr as they left the washington hilton hotel nancy was alerted and arrived at george washington university hospital where the president was hospitalized she recalled having seen emergency rooms before but i had never seen one like this – with my husband in it123 she was escorted into a waiting room and when granted access to see her husband he quipped to her honey i forgot to duck borrowing the defeated boxer jack dempseys jest to his wife124 an early example of the first ladys protective nature occurred when senator strom thurmond entered the presidents hospital room that day in march passing the secret service detail by claiming he was the presidents close friend presumably to acquire media attention125 nancy was outraged and demanded he leave48 while the president recuperated in the hospital the first lady slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by the scent48 when ronald reagan was released from the hospital on april 12 she escorted him back to the white house press accounts framed reagan as her husbands chief protector an extension of their general initial framing of her as a helpmate and a cold war domestic ideal126 as it happened the day after her husband was shot reagan fell off a chair while trying to take down a picture to bring to him in the hospital she suffered several broken ribs but was determined to not reveal it publicly127 influence in the white houseedit the gaze reagan watches as her husband is sworn in for a second term by chief justice warren burger on january 20 1985 donald regans 1988 memoir for the record from wall street to washington exposes his disagreements with reagan for the first time revealing publicly that she had a personal astrologer thenyetunnamed joan quigley with whom she consulted and who helped steer the presidents decisions regan wrote virtually every major move and decision the reagans made during my time as white house chief of staff was cleared in advance with a woman in san francisco quigley who drew up horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise128129 nancy reagan stated in her memoirs i felt panicky every time ronald reagan left the white house130 following the assassination attempt and made it her concern to know her husbands schedule the events he would be attending and with whom13 eventually this protectiveness led to her consulting an astrologer joan quigley who offered insight on which days were good neutral or should be avoided which influenced her husbands white house schedule131 days were colorcoded according to the astrologers advice to discern precisely which days and times would be optimal for the presidents safety and success13 the white house chief of staff donald regan grew frustrated with this regimen which created friction between him and the first lady this escalated with the revelation of the iran–contra affair an administration scandal in which the first lady felt regan was damaging the president132 she thought he should resign and expressed this to her husband although he did not share her view regan wanted president reagan to address the irancontra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference though reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings133 regan became so angry with reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation according to the recollections of abc news correspondent sam donaldson when the president heard of this treatment he demanded—and eventually received—regans resignation134 vice president george h w bush is also reported to have suggested to reagan to have regan fired135 in his 1988 memoirs regan wrote about reagans consultations with the astrologer the first public mention of them which resulted in embarrassment for the first lady136 reagan later wrote astrology was simply one of the ways i coped with the fear i felt after my husband almost died was astrology one of the reasons further attempts did not occur i dont really believe it was but i dont really believe it wasnt137 ronald and nancy reagan together in the oval office 1985 nancy wielded a powerful influence over president reagan138 again stemming from the assassination attempt she strictly controlled access to the president and even occasionally attempted to influence her husbands decision making138139 beginning in 1985 she strongly encouraged her husband to hold summit conferences with soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev and suggested they form a personal relationship
