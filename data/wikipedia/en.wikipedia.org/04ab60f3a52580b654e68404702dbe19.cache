the philippines to the south taiwan is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the united nations the island of taiwan formerly known as formosa was inhabited by taiwanese aborigines before the 17th century when dutch and spanish colonies opened the island to mass han immigration after a brief rule by the kingdom of tungning the island was annexed by the qing dynasty the last dynasty of china the qing ceded taiwan to japan in 1895 after the sinojapanese war while taiwan was under japanese rule the republic of china roc was established on the mainland in 1912 after the fall of the qing dynasty following the japanese surrender to the allies in 1945 the roc took control of taiwan however the resumption of the chinese civil war led to the rocs loss of the mainland to the communists and the flight of the roc government to taiwan in 1949 although the roc continued to claim to be the legitimate government of china its effective jurisdiction has since the loss of hainan in 1950 been limited to taiwan and its surrounding islands with the main island making up 99 of its de facto territory as a founding member of the united nations the roc continued to represent china at the united nations until 1971 when the prc assumed chinas seat causing the roc to lose its un membership in the early 1960s taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization creating a stable industrial economy in the 1980s and early 1990s it changed from a oneparty military dictatorship dominated by the kuomintang to a multiparty democracy with a semipresidential system taiwan is the 22ndlargest economy in the world and its hightech industry plays a key role in the global economy it is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press healthcare15 public education economic freedom and human developmentd1316 the country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree1718 the prc has consistently claimed sovereignty over taiwan and asserted the roc is no longer in legitimate existence under its onechina policy the prc refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the roc today 20 countries maintain official ties with the roc but many other states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates although taiwan is fully selfgoverning most international organizations in which the prc participates either refuse to grant membership to taiwan or allow it to participate only as a nonstate actor internally the major division in politics is between the aspirations of eventual chinese unification or taiwanese independence though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal the prc has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal declaration of independence by taiwan or if prc leaders decide that peaceful unification is no longer possible19 contents 1 etymology 2 history 21 prehistoric taiwan 22 opening in the 17th century 23 qing rule 24 japanese rule

dates from 1542verification needed when portuguese sailors sighted the main island of taiwan and named it ilha formosa which means beautiful island21 the name formosa eventually replaced all others in european literature22 and was in common use in english in the early 20th century23 in the early 17th century the dutch east india company established a commercial post at fort zeelandia modernday anping tainan on a coastal sandbar called tayouan24 after their ethnonym for a nearby taiwanese aboriginal tribe written by the dutch and portuguese variously as taiouwang tayowan teijoan etc25 this name was also adopted into the chinese vernacular in particular hokkien as pe̍hōejī tāioântâioân as the name of the sandbar and nearby area tainan the modern word taiwan is derived from this usage which is seen in various forms 大員 大圓 大灣 臺員 臺圓 and 臺窩灣 in chinese historical records the area of modernday tainan was the first permanent settlement by western colonists and chinese immigrants grew to be the most important trading centre and served as the capital of the island until 1887 use of the current chinese name 臺灣 was formalized as early as 1684 with the establishment of taiwan prefecture through its rapid development the entire formosan mainland eventually became known as taiwan26272829 in his daoyi zhilüe 1349 wang dayuan used liuqiu as a name for the island of taiwan or the part of it near to penghu30 elsewhere the name was used for the ryukyu islands in general or okinawa the largest of them indeed the name ryūkyū is the japanese form of liúqiú the name also appears in the book of sui 636 and other early works but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the ryukyus taiwan or even luzon31 the official name of the state is the republic of china it has also been known under various names throughout its existence shortly after the rocs establishment in 1912 while it was still located on the chinese mainland the government used the short form china zhōngguó 中國 to refer to itself which derives from zhōng central or middle and guó state nationstate e a term which also developed under the zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesnef and the name was then applied to the area around luoyi presentday luoyang during the eastern zhou and then to chinas central plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the qingera 33 during the 1950s and 1960s after the government had fled to taiwan due to losing the chinese civil war it was commonly referred to as nationalist china or free china to differentiate it from communist china or red china35 it was a member of the united nations representing china until 1971 when it lost its seat to the peoples republic of china over subsequent decades the republic of china has become commonly known as taiwan after the island that comprises 99 of the territory under its control in some contexts especially official ones from the roc government the name is written as republic of china taiwan republic of chinataiwan or sometimes taiwan roc36 the republic of china participates in most international forums and organizations under the name chinese taipei due to diplomatic pressure from the peoples republic of china for instance it is the name under which it has competed at the olympic games since 1984 and its name as an observer at the world health organization37

ago have been found on the island as well as later artefacts of a paleolithic culture383940 around 6000 years ago taiwan was settled by farmers most likely from mainland china41 they are believed to be the ancestors of todays taiwanese aborigines whose languages belong to the austronesian language family but show much greater diversity than the rest of the family which spans a huge area from maritime southeast asia west to madagascar and east as far as new zealand hawaii and easter island this has led linguists to propose taiwan as the urheimat of the family from which seafaring peoples dispersed across southeast asia and the pacific and indian oceans4243 han chinese fishermen began settling in the penghu islands in the 13th century44 hostile tribes and a lack of valuable trade products meant that few outsiders visited the main island until the 16th century44 by the 1700s visits to the coast by fishermen from fujian as well as chinese and japanese pirates became more frequent44 opening in the 17th century main articles dutch formosa spanish formosa and kingdom of tungning fort zeelandia the governors residence in dutch formosa the dutch east india company attempted to establish a trading outpost on the penghu islands pescadores in 1622 but were militarily defeated and driven off by the ming authorities45 in 1624 the company established a stronghold called fort zeelandia on the coastal islet of tayouan which is now part of the main island at anping tainan29 david wright a scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the 1650s described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11 chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72 some of these fell under dutch control while others remained independent2946 the company began to import labourers from fujian and penghu pescadores many of whom settled45 in 1626 the spanish empire landed on and occupied northern taiwan at the ports of keelung and tamsui as a base to extend their trading this colonial period lasted 16 years until 1642 when the last spanish fortress fell to dutch forces following the fall of the ming dynasty koxinga zheng chenggong a selfstyled ming loyalist arrived on the island and captured fort zeelandia in 1662 expelling the dutch empire and military from the island koxinga established the kingdom of tungning 1662–1683 with

edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land rights immigrants mostly from southern fujian continued to enter taiwan the border between taxpaying lands and savage lands shifted eastward with some aborigines becoming sinicized while others retreated into the mountains during this time there were a number of conflicts between groups of han chinese from different regions of southern fujian particularly between those from quanzhou and zhangzhou and between southern fujian chinese and aborigines northern taiwan and the penghu islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the sinofrench war august 1884 to april 1885 the french occupied keelung on 1 october 1884 but were repulsed from tamsui a few days later the french won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them and the keelung campaign ended in stalemate the pescadores campaign beginning on 31 march 1885 was a french victory but had no longterm consequences the french evacuated both keelung and the

penghu and liaodong peninsula were ceded in full sovereignty to the empire of japan by the treaty of shimonoseki inhabitants on taiwan and penghu wishing to remain qing subjects were given a twoyear grace period to sell their property and move to mainland china very few taiwanese saw this as feasible48 on 25 may 1895 a group of proqing high officials proclaimed the republic of formosa to resist impending japanese rule japanese forces entered the capital at tainan and quelled this resistance on 21 october 189549 guerrilla fighting continued periodically until about 1902 and ultimately took

unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition to japanese colonial rule japanese colonial rule was instrumental in the industrialization of the island extending the railroads and other transportation networks building an extensive sanitation system and establishing a formal education system51 japanese rule ended the practice of headhunting52 during this period the human and natural resources of taiwan were used to aid the development of japan and the production of cash crops such as rice and sugar greatly increased by 1939 taiwan was the seventh greatest sugar producer in the world53 still the taiwanese and aborigines were classified as second and thirdclass citizens after suppressing chinese guerrillas in the first decade of their rule japanese authorities engaged in a series of bloody

rikichi andō governorgeneral of taiwan and commanderinchief of all japanese forces on the island signed the receipt and handed it over to general chen yi of the roc military to complete the official turnover chen yi proclaimed that day to be taiwan retrocession day but the allies considered taiwan and the penghu islands to be under military occupation and still under japanese sovereignty until 1952 when the treaty of san francisco took effect6768 although the 1943 cairo declaration had envisaged returning these territories to china in the treaty of san francisco and treaty of taipei japan has renounced all claim to them without specifying to what country they were to be surrendered this introduced the problem of the legal status of taiwan the roc administration of taiwan under chen yi was strained by increasing tensions between taiwaneseborn people and newly arrived mainlanders which were compounded by economic woes such as hyperinflation furthermore cultural and linguistic conflicts between the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government while the mass movement led by the working committee of the communist party also aimed to bring down the kuomintang government6970 the shooting of a civilian on 28 february 1947 triggered islandwide unrest which was suppressed with military force in what is now called the february 28 incident mainstream estimates of the number killed range from 18000 to 30000 those killed were mainly members of the taiwanese elite7172 the nationalists retreat to taipei after the nationalists lost nanjing

between the chinese nationalists kuomintang led by chiang kaishek and the communist party of china led by mao zedong throughout the months of 1949 a series of chinese communist offensives led to the capture of its capital nanjing on 23 april and the subsequent defeat of the nationalist army on the mainland and the communists founded the peoples republic of china on 1 october73 on 7 december 1949 after the loss of four capitals chiang evacuated his nationalist government to taiwan and made taipei the temporary capital of the roc also called the wartime capital by chiang kaishek74 some 2 million people consisting mainly of soldiers members of the ruling kuomintang and intellectual and business elites were evacuated from mainland china to taiwan at that time adding to the earlier population of approximately six million in addition the roc government took to taipei many national treasures and much of chinas gold reserves and foreign currency reserves757677 after losing most of the mainland the kuomintang held remaining control of tibet the portions of qinghai xinjiang and yunnan provinces along with the hainan island until 1951 before the communists subsequently captured both territories from this point onwards the kuomintangs territory was reduced to taiwan penghu the portions of the fujian province kinmen and matsu islands and two major islands of dongsha islands and nansha islands the kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all china which it defined to include mainland china taiwan outer mongolia and other areas on mainland china the victorious communists claimed they ruled the sole and only china which they claimed included taiwan and that the republic of china no longer existed78 chiang kaishek leader of the kuomintang from 1925 until his death in 1975 chinese nationalist oneparty rule martial law declared on taiwan in may 194979 continued to be in effect after the central government relocated to taiwan it was not repealed until 198779 and was used as a way to suppress the political opposition in the intervening years80 during the white terror as the period is known 140000 people were imprisoned or executed for being perceived as antikmt or procommunist81 many citizens were arrested tortured imprisoned and executed for their real or perceived link to the communists since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite an entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated in 1998 law was passed to create the compensation foundation for improper verdicts which oversaw compensation to white terror victims and families president ma yingjeou made an official apology in 2008 expressing hope that there will never be a tragedy similar to white terror82 initially the united states abandoned the kmt and expected that taiwan would fall to the communists however in 1950 the conflict between north korea and south korea which had been ongoing since the japanese withdrawal in 1945 escalated into fullblown war and in the context of the cold war us president harry s truman intervened again and dispatched the us navys 7th fleet into the taiwan strait to prevent hostilities between taiwan and mainland china83 in the treaty of san francisco and the treaty of taipei which came into force respectively on 28 april 1952 and 5 august 1952 japan formally renounced all right claim and title to taiwan and penghu and renounced all treaties signed with china before 1942 neither treaty specified to whom sovereignty over the islands should be transferred because the united states and the united kingdom disagreed on whether the roc or the prc was the legitimate government of china84 continuing conflict of the chinese civil war through the 1950s and intervention by the united states notably resulted in legislation such as the sinoamerican mutual defense treaty and the formosa resolution of 1955 with president chiang kaishek the us president dwight d eisenhower waved to crowds during his visit to taipei in june 1960 as the chinese civil war continued without truce the government built up military fortifications throughout taiwan within this effort kmt veterans built the now famous central crossisland highway through the taroko gorge in the 1950s the two sides would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized details well into the 1960s on the china

1970s the roc maintained an authoritarian singleparty government while its economy became industrialized and technology oriented this rapid economic growth known as the taiwan miracle was the result of a fiscal regime independent from mainland china and backed up among others by the support of us funds and demand for taiwanese products8586 in the 1970s taiwan was economically the second fastest growing state in asia after japan87 taiwan along with hong kong south korea and singapore became known as one of the four asian tigers because of the cold war most western nations and the united nations regarded the roc as the sole legitimate government of china until the 1970s later especially after the termination of the sinoamerican mutual defense treaty most nations switched diplomatic recognition to the prc see united nations general assembly resolution 2758 up until the 1970s the government was regarded by western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media the kmt did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did not seriously compete with the kmt thus competitive democratic elections did not exist8889909192 from the late 1970s to the 1990s however taiwan went through reforms and social changes that transformed it from an authoritarian state to a democracy in 1979 a prodemocracy protest known as the kaohsiung incident took place in kaohsiung to celebrate human rights day although the protest was rapidly crushed by the authorities it is today considered as

philippine sea to the east the bashi channel of the luzon strait directly to the south and the south china sea to the southwest its shape is similar to a sweet potato giving rise to the name sweet potato used by taiwanese hokkien speakers for people of taiwanese descent105 the island is characterized by the contrast between the eastern twothirds consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from the northern to the southern tip of the island and the flat to gently rolling chianan plains in the west that are also home to most of taiwans population taiwans highest point is yu

experiences hot humid weather from june through september typhoons are most common in july august and september108 during the winter november to march the northeast experiences steady rain while the central and southern parts of the island are mostly sunny geology main article geology of taiwan dabajian mountain the island of taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the yangtze plate to the west and north the okinawa plate on the northeast and the philippine mobile belt on the east and south the upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of terranes mostly old island arcs which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the eurasian plate and the philippine sea plate these have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the eurasian plate as it was subducted beneath remnants of the philippine sea plate a process which left the crust under taiwan more buoyant109 the east and south of taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by and part of the zone of active collision between the north luzon trough portion of the luzon volcanic arc and south china where accreted portions of the luzon arc and luzon forearc form the eastern coastal range and parallel inland longitudinal valley of taiwan respectively110 the major seismic faults in taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various terranes these have produced major quakes throughout the history of the island on 21 september 1999 a 73 quake known as the 921 earthquake killed more than 2400 people the seismic hazard map for

elected president and armed forces it has not formally renounced its claim to the mainland but roc government publications have increasingly downplayed it114 internationally there is controversy on whether the roc still exists as a state or a defunct state per international law due to the lack of wide diplomatic recognition in a poll of taiwanese aged 20 and older taken by tvbs in march 2009 a

of the onechina policy which states that taiwan and mainland china are both part of china and that the prc is the only legitimate government of china it uses this policy to prevent the international recognition of the roc as an independent sovereign state meaning that taiwan participates in international forums under the name chinese taipei with the emergence of the taiwanese independence movement the name taiwan has been employed increasingly often on the island125 foreign relations main article foreign relations of taiwan countries maintaining relations with the roc   diplomatic

centres of power all claimed legitimacy this situation changed after the defeat of the peiyang government by the kuomintang which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the republic of china126 after the kmts retreat to taiwan most countries notably the countries in the western bloc continued to maintain relations with the roc due to diplomatic pressure recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition to the prc in the 1970s un resolution 2758 25 october 1971 recognized the peoples republic of china as chinas sole representative in the united nations127 the prc refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes the roc and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to taiwan128 as a result only 19 un member states and the holy see maintain official diplomatic relations with the republic of china the roc maintains unofficial relations with most countries via de facto embassies and consulates called taipei economic and cultural representative offices tecro with branch offices called taipei economic and cultural offices teco both tecro and teco are unofficial commercial entities of the roc in charge of maintaining diplomatic relations providing consular services ie visa applications and serving the national interests of the roc in other countries129 the united states remains one of the main allies of the country and through the taiwan relations act passed in 1979 has continued selling arms and providing military training to the armed forces130 this situation continues to be an issue for the peoples republic of china which considers us involvement disruptive to the stability of the region in january 2010 the obama administration announced its intention to sell 64 billion worth of military hardware to taiwan as a consequence the prc threatened the us with economic sanctions and warned that their cooperation on international and regional issues could suffer131 the official position of the united states is that the prc is expected to use no force or threaten to use force against taiwan and the roc is to exercise prudence in managing all aspects of crossstrait relations both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements that would unilaterally alter taiwans status132 on 16 december 2015 the obama administration announced a deal to sell 183 billion worth of arms to the armed forces of the roc133134 chinas foreign ministry had expressed its disapproval for the sales and issued the us a stern warning saying it would hurt

the roc has petitioned the un for entry but its applications have not made it past committee136 the flag used by taiwan at the olympic games where it competes as chinese taipei 中華台北 due to its limited international recognition the republic of china is a member of the unrepresented nations and peoples organization represented by a governmentfunded organization the taiwan foundation for democracy tfd under the name taiwan137138 also due to its one china policy the prc only participates in international organizations where the roc is not recognized as a sovereign country most member states including the united states do not wish to discuss the issue of the rocs political status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the prc139 however both the us and japan publicly support the rocs bid for membership in the world health organization as an observer140 however though the roc sought to participate in the who since 1997141142 their efforts were blocked by the prc until 2010 when they were invited as observers to attend the world health assembly under the name chinese taipei143 due to prc pressure the roc is forced to use the name chinese taipei in international events such as the olympic games where the prc is also a party144 the roc is typically barred from using its national anthem and national flag in international events due to prc pressure roc spectators attending events such as the olympics are often barred from bringing roc flags into venues145 taiwan also participates in the asiapacific economic cooperation forum since 1991 and the world trade organization since 2002 under the name chinese taipei the roc is able to participate as china in organizations that the prc does not participate in such as the world organization of the scout movement opinions within taiwan see also taiwan independence and chinese unification within taiwan opinions are polarized between those supporting unification represented by the panblue coalition of parties and those supporting independence represented by the pangreen coalition the kmt the largest panblue party supports the status quo for the indefinite future with a stated ultimate goal of unification however it does not support unification in the short term with the prc as such a prospect would be unacceptable to most of its members and the public146 ma yingjeou chairman of the kmt and former president of the roc has set out democracy economic development to a level near that of taiwan and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions that the prc must fulfill for reunification to occur147 the democratic progressive party the largest pangreen party officially seeks independence but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public would not accept the risk of provoking the prc148149 on 2 september 2008 mexican newspaper el sol de méxico asked president ma about his views on the subject of two chinas and if there was a solution for the sovereignty issues between the two the president replied that the relations are neither between two chinas nor two states it is a special relationship further he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved at present but he quoted the 1992 consensus currently accepted by both the kuomintang and the communist party of china as a temporary measure until a solution becomes available150 on 27 september 2017 taiwanese premier william lai said that he was a “political worker who advocates taiwan independence” but that as taiwan was an independent country called the republic of china it had no need to declare independence151 the relationship with the prc and the related issues of taiwanese independence and chinese unification continue to dominate politics152 government and politics main articles government of the republic of china and politics of the republic of china see also elections in taiwan and human rights in taiwan tsai ingwen president william lai premier the presidential building in taipei has housed the office of the president of the republic of china since 1950 the government of the republic of china was founded on the constitution of the roc and its three principles of the people which states that the roc shall be a democratic republic of the people to be governed by the people and for the people153 the government is divided into five branches yuan the executive yuan cabinet the legislative yuan congress or parliament the judicial yuan the control yuan audit agency and the examination yuan civil service examination agency the constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland china to the communist party of china it was created by the kmt for the purpose of all of its claimed territory including taiwan even though the communist party boycotted the drafting of the constitution the constitution went into effect on 25 december 1947154 the roc remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of the constitution was not in effect political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed into a multiparty democracy since the lifting of martial law the republic of china has democratized and reformed suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of china this process of amendment continues in 2000 the democratic progressive party dpp won the presidency ending kmts continuous control of the government in may 2005 a new national assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms these reforms have been passed the national assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot155 the head of state and commanderinchief of the armed forces is the president who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 fouryear terms on the same ticket as the vicepresident the president has authority over the yuan the president appoints the members of the executive yuan as his cabinet including a premier who is officially the president of the executive yuan members are responsible for policy and administration153 the main legislative body is the unicameral legislative yuan with 113 seats seventythree are elected by popular vote from singlemember constituencies thirtyfour are elected based on the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate party list ballot and six are elected from two threemember aboriginal constituencies members serve fouryear terms originally the unicameral national assembly as a standing constitutional convention and electoral college held some parliamentary functions but the national assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power of constitutional amendments handed over to the legislative yuan and all eligible voters of the republic via referendums153 the premier is selected by the president without the need for approval from the legislature but the legislature can pass laws without regard for the president as neither he nor the premier wields veto power153 thus there is little incentive for the president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties after the election of the pangreens chen shuibian as president in 2000 legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the legislative yuan which was controlled by a panblue majority156 historically the roc has been dominated by strongman single party politics this legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president rather than the premier even though the constitution does not explicitly state the extent of the presidents executive power157 the judicial yuan is the highest judicial organ it interprets the constitution and other laws and decrees judges administrative suits and disciplines public functionaries the president and vicepresident of the judicial yuan and additional thirteen justices form the council of grand justices158 they are nominated and appointed by the president with the consent of the legislative yuan the highest court the supreme court consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions each of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges all appointed for life in 1993 a separate constitutional court was established to resolve constitutional disputes regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process there is no trial by jury but the right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice many cases are presided over by multiple judges153 tangwai independent taiwaneseborn politician wu sanlien 2l celebrated his landslide victory 655 in taipei citys first mayoral election in january 1951 with supporters capital punishment is still used in taiwan although efforts have been made by the government to reduce the number of executions nevertheless according to a survey in 2006 about 80 of taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penalty159 the control yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors controls the actions of the executive it can be considered a standing commission for administrative inquiry and can be compared to the court of auditors of the european union or the government accountability office of the united states153 the examination yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants it is based on the old imperial examination system used in dynastic china it can be compared to the european personnel selection office of the european union or the office of personnel management of the united states153 major camps emblem of the kuomintang the main panblue coalition party the tension between china and taiwan colours most of the political life and any government move towards taiwan independence is met by threat of military attack from the prc160 the prcs official policy is to reunify taiwan and mainland china under the formula of one country two systems and refuses to renounce the use of military force especially should taiwan seek a declaration of independence161 the political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views on how taiwan should relate to china or the prc referred to as crossstrait relations it is the main political difference between two camps the panblue coalition composed of the prounification kuomintang people first party pfp and new party who believe that the roc is the sole legitimate government of china including taiwan and supports eventual chinese reunification the opposition pangreen coalition is composed of the proindependence dpp and taiwan solidarity union tsu it regards taiwan as an independent sovereign state synonymous with the roc opposes the definition that taiwan is part of china and seeks wide diplomatic recognition and an eventual declaration of formal taiwan independence162 the pangreen camp tends to favour emphasizing the republic of china as being a distinct country from the peoples republic of china thus in september 2007 the then ruling democratic progressive party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from china and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a normal country it called also for general use of taiwan as the countrys name without abolishing its formal name the republic of china163 some members of the coalition such as former president chen shuibian argue that it is unnecessary to proclaim independence because taiwan is already an independent sovereign country and the republic of china is the same as taiwan164 despite being a member of kmt prior to and during his presidency lee tenghui also held a similar view and was a supporter of the taiwanization movement165 panblue members generally support the concept of the onechina policy which states that there is only one china and that its only government is the roc they favour eventual reunification of china166 the more mainstream panblue position is to lift investment restrictions and pursue negotiations with the prc to immediately open direct transportation links regarding independence the mainstream panblue position is to maintain the status quo while refusing immediate reunification146 president ma yingjeou stated that there will be no unification nor declaration of independence during his presidency167168 as of 2009update panblue members usually seek to improve relationships with mainland china with a current focus on improving economic ties169 current political issues the dominant political issue in taiwan is its relationship with the prc for almost 60 years there were no direct transportation links including direct flights between taiwan and mainland china this was a problem for many taiwanese businesses that had opened factories or branches in mainland china the former dpp administration feared that such links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland china and in the 2006 lunar new year speech president chen shuibian called for managed opening of links direct weekend charter flights between taiwan and mainland china began in july 2008 under the current kmt government and the first direct daily charter flights took off in december 2008170 other major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that the united states authorized in 2001171 in 2008 however the united states was reluctant to send over more arms to taiwan out of fear that it would hinder the recent improvement of ties between the prc and the roc172 another major political issue is the establishment of a national communications commission to take over from the government information office whose advertising budget exercised great control over the media173 the politicians and their parties have themselves become major political issues corruption among some dpp administration officials has been exposed in early 2006 president chen shuibian was linked to possible corruption the political effect on president chen shuibian was great causing a divide in the dpp leadership and supporters alike it eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by exdpp leader shih mingteh which believes the president should resign the kmt assets continue to be another major issue as it was once the richest political party in the world174 nearing the end of 2006 kmts chairman ma yingjeou was also hit by corruption controversies although he has since then been cleared of any wrongdoings by the courts175 after completing his second term as president chen shuibian was charged with corruption and money laundering176 following his conviction he is serving a 17year sentence in taipei prison177 national identity main articles taiwanese identity and chinese nationalism roughly 84 of taiwans population descends from han chinese who migrated from qing china between 1661 and 1895 another significant fraction descends from han chinese who immigrated from mainland china in the late 1940s and early 1950s the shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences as well as hostility between the rival roc and prc have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones since democratization and the lifting of martial law a distinct taiwanese identity as opposed to taiwanese identity as a subset of a chinese identity is often at the heart of political debates its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland china and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for de jure taiwan independence178 the pangreen camp supports a distinct taiwanese identity while the panblue camp supports a chinese identity only166 the kmt has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a taiwanese identity as part of a chinese identity179180 according to a survey conducted in march 2009 49 of the respondents consider themselves as taiwanese only and 44 of the respondents consider themselves as taiwanese and chinese 3 consider themselves as only chinese115 another survey conducted in taiwan in july 2009 showed that 828 of respondents consider the roc and the prc as two separate countries with each developing on its own181 a survey conducted in december 2009 showed that 62 of the respondents consider themselves as taiwanese only and 22 of the respondents consider themselves as both taiwanese and chinese 8 consider themselves as only chinese the survey also shows that among 18 to 29yearold respondents 75 consider themselves as taiwanese only182 in the latest survey conducted by national chengchi university in 2014 and published in early 2015 606 of respondents identified themselves exclusively as taiwanese 325 identified themselves as both taiwanese and chinese and 35 identified

revolutionary army which was established by sun yatsen in 1925 in guangdong with a goal of reunifying china under the kuomintang when the peoples liberation army won the chinese civil war much of the national revolutionary army retreated to taiwan along with the government it was later reformed into the republic of china army units which surrendered and remained in mainland china were either disbanded or incorporated into the peoples liberation army today the republic of china maintains a large and technologically advanced military mainly as defence against the constant threat of invasion by the prc under the antisecession law of the peoples republic of china117 from 1949 to the 1970s the primary mission of the military was to retake the mainland through project national glory as this mission has shifted to defence the roc military has begun to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant army to the air force and navy control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of the civilian government186187 as the roc military shares historical roots with the kmt the older generation of highranking officers tends to have panblue sympathies however many have retired and there are many more nonmainlanders enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations so the political leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in taiwan188 the roc began a force reduction program jingshi an translated to streamlining program to scale down its military from a level of 450000 in 1997 to 380000 in 2001189 as of 2009update the armed forces of the roc number

upgrading taiwans air defence and submarine hunting abilities196 the ministry of national defense planned to purchase dieselpowered submarines and patriot antimissile batteries from the united states but its budget has been stalled repeatedly by the oppositionpanblue coalition controlled legislature the defence package was stalled from 2001 to 2007 where it was finally passed through the legislature and the us responded on 3 october 2008 with a 65 billion arms package including pac iii antiair defence systems ah64d apache attack helicopters and other arms and parts197 a significant amount of military hardware has been bought from the united states and as of 2009update continues to be legally guaranteed by the taiwan relations act130 in the past france and the netherlands have also sold military weapons and hardware to the roc but they almost entirely stopped in the 1990s under pressure of the prc198199 the first line of defence against invasion by the prc is the rocs own armed forces current roc military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until the us military responds200 there is however no guarantee in the taiwan relations act or any other treaty that the united states will defend taiwan even in the event of invasion201 the joint declaration on security between the us and japan signed in 1996 may imply that japan would be involved in any response however japan has refused to stipulate whether the area surrounding japan mentioned in the pact includes taiwan and the precise purpose of the pact is unclear202 the australia new zealand

republic of china took over taiwan from japan in 1945 the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland china which mixed with features of the chinese and american educational systems226 taiwan is well known for adhering to the confucian paradigm of valuing education as a means to improve ones socioeconomic position in taiwanese society227 heavy investment and a cultural value for education has catapulted the resource poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings taiwan is one of the topperforming countries in reading literacy maths and sciences in 2015 taiwanese students achieved one of the worlds best results in mathematics science and literacy as tested by the programme for international student assessment pisa a worldwide evaluation of 15yearold

background in mathematics and science to cope with the current labor market demands of the 21st century229 the taiwanese education system has been praised for various reasons including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering taiwans economic development while creating one of the world’s most highly educated workforces230231 the country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006 among the highest

a higher unemployment rate with a large supply of university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath than their expectations233227 taiwan’s universities have also been under criticism for not being able to fully meet the requirements and demands of taiwan’s 21st century fastmoving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large number of selfassessed overeducated university graduates that dont fit the demands of the modern taiwanese labor market234 the taiwanese government has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university graduates232235 as the taiwanese economy is largely science and technology based the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment although current taiwanese law mandates only nine years of schooling 95 of junior high graduates go
