to their own desired outcomes28 slate magazines dahlia lithwick wrote that no serious scholar of the court or the constitution on the ideological left or right is going to waste their time engaging

brand of conservatism3637 ameritopia the unmaking of america was released in 2012 in ameritopia levin discusses the origins and development of both the modern day conservative and liberal political philosophies the latter of which he refers to as statist through the works of some of the leading figures in american history3839 included are commentaries on works by plato sir thomas more thomas hobbes karl marx john locke charles de montesquieu and alexis de tocqueville40 jeffrey lord called it historical xray vision in book form41 pj media praised the book that levin wrote this book now demonstrates not only his passion for the united states but his awareness that he is a statesman defending natural law at a pivotal moment in human history42 on the other hand the atlantics review criticized the books argument that statism is based on utopianism43 and a review by professor carlin romano in the chronicle of higher education called the book disastrously bad from beginning to end44 the 2013 book the liberty amendments restoring the american republic suggests eleven new constitutional amendments the book debuted at 1 on the new york times best seller list45 hans a von spakovsky of national review called the book required reading for conservative bloggers46 ana marie cox writing in the guardian said the book contains some radical notions about a complete overhaul of the us constitution but to debate the specifics of their merits is to ignore the larger insanity of the project while noting the ludicrousness of his specific fixes and the nearimpossibility of achieving them47 in the washington times tenth amendment center executive director michael lotfi criticized levins idea as the bullet to a loaded revolver pointed at the constitution also in the times richard rahn wrote if the liberty amendments can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions including constitutional amendments are needed to increase liberty and prosperity mr levin will have performed a great national service48 hoover institution fellow david davenport wrote in forbes that levins book used weak arguments4950 also in forbes ralph benko credited levin with notably and nobly proposing to change the rules of modern politics and governance51 levin authored plunder and deceit big governments exploitation of young people and the future in 201552 and rediscovering americanism and the tyranny of progressivism in 2017 levin and ted cruz at the 2017 cpac conference views on political issues groups and politicians views on politicians and other individuals

fund paid at least 427000 to simon schuster to purchase copies of one of levin’s books in september and october of 201319 during the same period levin frequently promoted the group which has funded

was being sponsored by americans for prosperity afp which also endorsed hatch levin withdrew his endorsement of hatch when levin was being sponsored by the tea party patriots a group that funded

books196566 levin has dismissed allegations that he engages in paytoplay66 controversial views president obama in 2009 levin described as absolutely right the statement by sarah palin that the patient protection and affordable care act obamacare includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care67 in 2011 a caller to levins show claiming to be a neurosurgeon said that the department of health and human services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments levin said to the caller so sarah palin was right the call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false686970 levin compared supporters of the affordable care act to nazi “brownshirts”71 levin stated in 2013 that the muslim brotherhood has infiltrated our government and called president obama a muslim brotherhood sympathizer7273 in february 2015 levin stated that president obama of “seeking to destroy israel” because obama has an affinity for islam far more than christianity or judaism levin also blamed obama for the ebola crisis saying the political policies of this administration which opens the door wide to people from the poorest parts of the world we dont know who they are we dont know if they have diseases”71 wiretap claim in march 2017 levin alleged that the obama administration had used police state surveillance tactics against the donald trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election the associated press said that levin voiced without evidence the idea that obama had wiretapped trump tower levin protested the ap report vigorously demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included the new york times and other newspapers74 his statement was reprinted by breitbart news and reportedly became the basis of president trumps unfounded trump tower wiretapping allegations5375 in september 2017 reports emerged of a courtordered federal bureau of investigation fbi wiretap on trump campaign chairman paul manafort while certain trump supporters alleged that this surveillance vindicated levin and trumps unsupported assertions david a graham of the atlantic noted this is not true—trump claimed he had been the subject of obamaordered politically motivated surveillance for which there remains no evidence76 deep state levin has claimed that there is angoing coup occurring against the presidency of donald trump waged by obama loyalists77 levins coup claim was referring to investigations of the russian interference in the 2016 united states elections and of alleged obstruction of justice by trump levin responded that i’m not arguing to the trump base i am making the point that what’s taking place here is coup activity and that robert muellers grand jury was trying to destroy the constitutional system it is the use of the law to subvert the election”7879 climate change levin rejects the scientific consensus on climate change8081 wmds in iraq in 2014 levin cited reports of us soldiers in iraq that were wounded by the decayed remnant of saddam husseins chemical weapons arsenal as vindicating the bush administrations original rationale for the iraq war despite the iraq survey group isgs finding that while a small number of old abandoned chemical munitions have been discovered isg judges that iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991 furthermore levin faulted the bush administration for not doing more to publicize these remnants of iraqs former wmd program82 references release mark levin tapped as editorinchief of conservative review conservative review retrieved january 7 2016  haag matthew 20170407 trumps farright
