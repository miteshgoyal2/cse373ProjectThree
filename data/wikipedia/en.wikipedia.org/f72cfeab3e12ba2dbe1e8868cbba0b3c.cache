1edit the building was designed by lusby simpson of abbott merkt co and completed in 1932133 the building had a multipurpose design when it opened in 1932 with the first floor and basement designated as union inland terminal 1 which was to be used to transport goods by truck to and from railroad lines andor shipping piers the second floor was the commerce section designed for exhibitions and the upper floors were designed for manufacturing45 the union inland terminal was built by the port authority to be a warehouseunion station to handle less than carload lcl shipments consolidating the shipping functions of the hudson river piers two blocks west of the building the eight trunk railroads that operated a block west of the building and truck operations an inland terminal by definition is a warehouse that is not immediately next to railroad linespiers but is nearby and is used to relieve congestion at the transfer points45 at its peak in the 1930s the port authority said it was handling more than half of the lcl freight operations south of 59th street in manhattan with more than 8000 tons of goods passing through it each month on one day alone in 1937 it was reported that 650 trucks had used the facility45 the railroads involved were the pennsylvania railroad lehigh valley railroad baltimore ohio erie railroad delaware lackawanna western railroad central railroad of new jersey new york central railroad new york new haven hartford45 the building included four freight elevators that could carry fully loaded 20 ton trucks45 because of the warehouse mission of the building it was able to avoid some of the setback rules that greatly reduced the buildable space available for the skyscrapers that mark the manhattan skyline as a result the 15story building with its football field size floors has more available rentable square footage than the 102story empire state building which has 22 million square feet45 the construction occurred at a time of a massive projects built to deal with what at the time was street level freight railroad traffic on manhattans west side other projects in the neighborhood in the era included construction of the high line and starrettlehigh building port authority buildingedit the initial plan had called for more inland freight operations to be erected in manhattan however the freight transportation changed and freight railroads played a dwindling importance in manhattan by 1947 its initial mission was pretty much abandoned and it became the port authority building which remained the port authoritys headquarters until the opening of the world trade center in 197045 transition to the digital ageedit the massive building served a dwindling warehousebackoffice outpost until 1998 when taconic investment partners acquired it6 taconic began marketing it as a location to be used as a carrier hotel for the new booming internet business this was coupled with the fashionable rise of the chelsea neighborhood that surrounded it5 googleedit the ninth avenue façade featuring the google corporate logo in 2010 google which had previously leased space in the building7 contracted to purchase the entire 2900000squarefoot 270000 m2 building in a deal reported to be worth around 19 billion89 the buildings meetme room in its carrier hotel was once the biggest in the city the other big meetme room is at 60 hudson street10 111 8th avenue is adjacent to trunk dark fiber lines stretching from hudson street and continuing up ninth avenue10 that line at the time was owned by lexent metro connect there was speculation at the time of the acquisition that the google would use its strategic location to launch a google fiber operation in new york city the google fiber plan never came to pass and google has denied it has any plans to bring it to new york city anytime in the near future although in 2013 it did begin offering free wifi to its chelsea neighbors the lexent dark fiber line has been acquired by lightower fiber networks11 in 2013 the first class of the newly created cornell nyc tech school began classes in the building in space donated by google classes will continue in the building until the school moves to its new location on roosevelt island planned in 201712 despite the massive size of the acquisition google has still found itself having to rent space elsewhere because it has been
