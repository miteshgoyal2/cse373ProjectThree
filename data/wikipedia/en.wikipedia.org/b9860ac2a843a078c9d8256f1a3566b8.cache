the site of human habitation since at least 9200 bc the areas earliest known inhabitants lived during the late pleistocene ice age and are linked to the clovis culture around 9200 bc 11200 years ago based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the muchstudied gault site midway between georgetown and fort hood22 when settlers arrived from europe the tonkawa tribe inhabited the area the comanches and lipan apaches were also known to travel through the area23 spanish colonists including the espinosaolivaresaguirre expedition traveled through the area for centuries though few permanent settlements were created for some time24 in 1730 three missions from east texas were combined and reestablished as one mission on the south side of the colorado river in what is now zilker park in austin the mission was in this area for only about seven months and then was moved to san antonio de béxar and split into three missions25 early in the 19th century spanish forts were established in what are now bastrop and san marcos2426 following mexicos independence new settlements were established in central texas but growth in the region was stagnant because of conflicts with the regional native americans262728 in 1835–1836 texans fought and won independence from mexico texas thus became an independent country with its own president congress and monetary system after vice president mirabeau b lamar visited the area during a buffalohunting expedition between 1837 and 1838 he proposed that the republics capital then in houston be relocated to the area situated on the north bank of the colorado river near the presentday congress avenue bridge in 1839 the texas congress formed a commission to seek a site for a new capital to be named for stephen f austin29 mirabeau b lamar second president of the newly formed republic of texas advised the commissioners to investigate the area named waterloo noting the areas hills waterways and pleasant surroundings30 waterloo was selected and the name austin was chosen as the towns new name31 the location was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between santa fe and galveston bay as well as routes between northern mexico and the red river32 an 1873 illustration of edwin wallers layout for austin edwin waller was picked by lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital29 the original site was narrowed to 640 acres 260 ha that fronted the colorado river between two creeks shoal creek and waller creek which was later named in his honor the 14block grid plan was bisected by a broad northsouth thoroughfare congress avenue running up from the river to capital square where the new texas state capitol was to be constructed a temporary onestory capitol was erected on the corner of colorado and 8th streets on august 1 1839 the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held2932 the grid plan waller designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown austin in 1840 a series of conflicts between the texas rangers and the comanches known as the council house fight and the battle of plum creek finally pushed the comanches westward mostly ending conflicts in central texas33 settlement in the area began to expand quickly travis county was established in 1840 and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades28 initially the new capital thrived but lamars political enemy sam houston used two mexican army incursions to san antonio as an excuse to move the government sam houston fought bitterly against lamars decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness the men and women who traveled mainly from houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well by 1840 the population had risen to 856 of whom nearly half fled from austin when congress recessed34 the resident black population listed in january of this same year was 17635 the fear of austins proximity to the indians and mexico which still considered texas a part of their land created an immense motive for sam houston the first and third president of the republic of texas to relocate the capital once again in 1841 upon threats of mexican troops in texas houston raided the land office to transfer all official documents to houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the archive war but the people of austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed the documents stayed but the capital would temporarily move from austin to houston to washingtononthebrazos without the governmental body austins population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s the voting by the fourth president of the republic anson jones and congress who reconvened in austin in 1845 settled the issue to keep austin the seat of government as well as annex the republic of texas into the united states statue of the goddess of liberty on the texas state capitol grounds prior to installation on top of the rotunda in 1860 38 of travis county residents were slaves36 in 1861 with the outbreak of the american civil war voters in austin and other central texas communities voted against secession2629 however as the war progressed and fears of attack by union forces increased austin contributed hundreds of men to the confederate forces the african american population of austin swelled dramatically after the enforcement of the emancipation proclamation in texas by union general gordon granger at galveston in an event commemorated as juneteenth black communities such as wheatville pleasant hill and clarksville were established with clarksville being the oldest surviving freedomtown ‒ the original postcivil war settlements founded by former africanamerican slaves ‒ west of the mississippi river29 in 1870 blacks made up 365 of austins population37 the postwar period saw dramatic population and economic growth the opening of the houston and texas central railway htc in 187138 turned austin into the major trading center for the region with the ability to transport both cotton and cattle the missouri kansas and texas mkt line followed close behind39 austin was also the terminus of the southernmost leg of the chisholm trail and drovers pushed cattle north to the railroad40 cotton was one of the few crops produced locally for export and a cotton gin engine was located downtown near the trains for ginning cotton of its seeds and turning the product into bales for shipment41 however as other new railroads were built through the region in the 1870s austin began to lose its primacy in trade to the surrounding communities29 in addition the areas east of austin took over cattle and cotton production from austin especially in towns like hutto and taylor that sit over the blackland prairie with its deep rich soils for producing cotton and hay4243 in september 1881 austin public schools held their first classes the same year tillotson collegiate and normal institute now part of hustontillotson university opened its doors the university of texas at austin held its first classes in 1883 although classes had been held in the original wooden state capitol for four years before44 during the 1880s austin gained new prominence as the state capitol building was completed in 1888 and claimed as the seventh largest building in the world29 in the late 19th century austin expanded its city limits to more than three times its former area and the first granite dam was built on the colorado river to power a new street car line and the new moon towers29 unfortunately the first dam washed away in a flood on april 7 190045 in the 1920s and 1930s austin launched a series of civic development and beautification projects that created much of the citys infrastructure and many of its parks in addition the state legislature established the lower colorado river authority lcra that along with the city of austin created the system of dams along the colorado river to form the highland lakes these projects were enabled in large part because the public works administration provided austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other texas cities29 bob bullock texas history museum in austin its mission is to tell the story of texas during the early twentieth century a threeway system of social segregation emerged in austin with anglos african americans and mexicans being separated by custom or law in most aspects of life including housing health care and education many of the municipal improvement programs initiated during this period—such as the construction of new roads schools and hospitals—were deliberately designed to institutionalize this system of segregation deed restrictions also played an important role in residential segregation after 1935 most housing deeds prohibited african americans and sometimes other nonwhite groups from using land46 combined with the system of segregated public services racial segregation increased in austin during the first half of the twentieth century with african americans and mexicans experiencing high levels of discrimination and social marginalization47 in 1940 the destroyed granite dam on the colorado river was finally replaced by a hollow concrete dam48 that formed lake mcdonald now called lake austin and which has withstood all floods since in addition the much larger mansfield dam was built by the lcra upstream of austin to form the floodcontrol lake lake travis49 in the early 20th century the texas oil boom took hold creating tremendous economic opportunities in southeast texas and north texas the growth generated by this boom largely passed by austin at first with the city slipping from fourth largest to 10th largest in texas between 1880 and 192029 after the mid20th century austin became established as one of texas major metropolitan centers in 1970 the united states census bureau reported austins population as 145 hispanic 119 black and 734 nonhispanic white37 in the late 20th century austin emerged as an important high tech center for semiconductors and software the university of texas at austin emerged as a major university50 the 1970s saw austins emergence in the national music scene with local artists such as willie nelson asleep at the wheel and stevie ray vaughan and iconic music venues such as the armadillo world headquarters over time the longrunning television program austin city limits its namesake austin city limits festival and the south by southwest music festival

each on the colorado river29 its elevation varies from 425 feet 130 m to approximately 1000 feet 305 m above sea level54 as a result of its straddling the balcones fault much of the eastern part of the city is flat with heavy clay and loam soils whereas the western part and western suburbs consist of rolling hills on the edge of the texas hill country55 because the hills to the west are primarily limestone rock with a thin covering of topsoil portions of the city are frequently subjected to flash floods from the runoff caused by thunderstorms5657 to help control this runoff and to generate hydroelectric power the lower colorado river authority operates a series of dams that form the texas highland lakes the lakes also provide venues for boating swimming and other forms of recreation within several parks on the lake shores58 austin is located at the intersection of four major ecological regions and is consequently a temperatetohot green oasis with a highly variable climate having some characteristics of the desert the tropics and a wetter climate59 the area is very diverse ecologically and biologically and is home to a variety of animals and plants60 notably the

so that the city is sometimes sarcastically called the peoples republic of austin by residents of other parts of texas and conservatives in the texas legislature182183 since redistricting following the 2010 united states census austin has been divided between six congressional districts at the federal level texass 35th texass 25th texass 10th texass 21st texass 17th and texass 31st texass 35th congressional district is represented by democrat lloyd doggett the other five districts are represented by republicans of whom only one michael mccaul of the 10th district lives in travis county as a result of the major party realignment that began in the 1970s central austin became a stronghold of the democratic party while the suburbs tend to vote republican a controversial turning point in the political history of the austin area was the 2003 texas redistricting opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan gerrymandering and the plan was challenged in court by democratic and minority activists of note the supreme court of the united states has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan the plan was subsequently upheld by a threejudge federal panel in late 2003 and on june 28 2006 the matter was largely settled when the supreme court in a 7–2 decision upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a hispanicmajority district in southwest texas this affected austins districting as us rep lloyd doggetts district us congressional district 25 was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced minority influence in the southwest district it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern travis county and several counties to its south and east184 overall the city is a blend of downtown liberalism and suburban conservatism but leans to the political left as a whole the city last went to a republican candidate in 2000 when former texas governor george w bush successfully ran for president in 2004 the democrats rebounded strongly as john kerry enjoyed a 140 margin over bush who once again won texas185 city residents have been supportive of alternative candidates for example ralph nader won 104 of the vote in austin in 2000 in 2003 the city adopted a resolution against the usa patriot act that reaffirmed constitutionally guaranteed rights of austins six state legislative districts three are strongly democratic and three are swing districts two of which are held by democrats and one of which is held by a republican however two of its three congressional districts the 10th and the 21st are presently held by republicans with only the 25th held by a democrat this is largely due to the 2003 redistricting which left downtown austin without an exclusive congressional seat of its own travis county was also the only county in texas to reject texas constitutional amendment proposition 2 that effectively outlawed gay marriage and status equal or similar to it and did so by a wide margin 40 for 60 against186187188 two of the candidates for president in the 2004 race called austin home michael badnarik the libertarian party candidate
