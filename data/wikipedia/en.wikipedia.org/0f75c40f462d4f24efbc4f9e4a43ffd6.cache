an easter egg is an intentional inside joke a hidden message or a secret feature of an interactive work often a computer program video game or dvdbluray disc menu screen the name is used to evoke the idea of a traditional easter egg hunt2 the term was coined to describe a hidden message in the atari video game adventure that led atari to encourage further hidden messages in later games treating them as easter eggs for players to findcitation needed contents 1 origin 2 in video games 3 in computing 31 software 32 hardware 4 comics 5 video 51 home media 52 broadcast media 6 security concerns 7 in popular culture 8 see also 9 references 10 external links originedit see also adventure atari 2600 § easter egg while not the first use of a hidden message in a work the origin of the term easter egg to describe these originated from the 1979 video game adventure for the atari 2600 the game was programmed by atari employee warren robinett at the time atari would not include programmers names in the games credits fearing that competitors would attempt to steal away their employees robinett who had some issues with his supervisor over this and other issues at the time secretly inserted the message created by warren robinett which would only be triggered if the player moved their avatar over a single pixel the gray dot in a certain part of the game robinett had not told anyone at atari about this by the time he left the company shortly after his departure the gray dot and his message was discovered by a player who wrote their discovery in to atari ataris management initially wanted to reprogram and rerelease the game to remove the message but this was a costly effort steve wright the director of software development of the atari consumer division at the time suggested that they keep the message and encourage future games to include such messages describing these as easter eggs for consumers to find and thus coining the term3456 in video gamesedit robinetts addition of his name to adventure 1979 is recognized as the first wellknown easter egg as well as the origin of the term however robinetts easter egg is not the first to be implemented the first text adventure game colossal cave adventure 1976 which adventure was fashioned from included a few secret words including xyzzy that enabled the player to move between two points in the game world quickly7 in 2004 an earlier easter egg was found in video whizball a 1978 game for the fairchild channel f system displaying programmer bradley reidselths surname2 according to research by ed fries the first known easter egg in arcade games came from starship 1 programmed by ron milner and released in 1977 although its existence wasnt published until 2017 by triggering the cabinets controls in the right order the player could get the message hi ron displayed to them on the screen fries described it as the earliest arcade game yet known that clearly meets the definition of an easter egg and suggested that as more than one hundred arcade games predate starship 1 earlier easter eggs may still be undiscovered89 fries noted that some atari arcade cabinets were resold under the kee games label and included easily implemented changes on the hardware that would make the game appear different for kee antiaircraft ii released in 1975 included a means to modify the circuit board to make the airplanes in the game appear as alien ufos which fries surmised would have been for a kee games release but argued if this is a true easter egg since it requires hardware modification9 since adventure there has been a long history of video game developers including easter eggs in their games1019 most easter eggs are intentional with the intent was to communicate with the player or as a way of getting even with management for a slight for example robinetts first egg was included because he wanted credit for programming the game which was not customarily included at the time1017 easter eggs in video games have taken a variety of forms from purely ornamental screens like robinetts to aesthetic enhancements that change some element of the game during play such as the easter egg included in the original age of empires game that changes catapult projectiles from stones to cows1019 more elaborate easter eggs include secret levels and developers rooms fully functional yet hidden areas of the game developers rooms often include inside jokes from the fandom or development team and differ from a debug room in that they are specifically intended for the player to find some games even include hidden subgames as easter eggs in 1993s acclaimed lucasarts video game day of the tentacle the original game maniac mansion from 1987 can be played in its full version by using a home computer in one characters room1112 other easter eggs originated from unintentional means the konami code a type of cheat code is an intentional easter egg in most games but originated from konamis gradius 1985 for the nintendo entertainment system its programmer kazuhisa hashimoto created the code as a means to rapidly debug the game by giving the players avatar additional health and powers to easily traverse the game these types of codes are normally removed from the game before it is shipped but in the case of gradius hashimoto forgot to remove it and it was soon discovered and shared by players its popularity led konami to reuse the code and purposely retain it for many of its future games as an easter egg21113 technical issues may also create unintentional easter eggs travellers taless founder jon burt outlined that many seemingly apparent easter eggs of their sega genesis games were a result of introducing programming tricks to get around some of the difficulty they had in getting segas strict certification for their games catching any exceptions during execution to bring the game back to a usable state as to pass certification for example hitting the side of the sonic 3d blast cartridge while it was slotted in the console would bring the game back to the level select screen which burt explained was the default exception handling for any unidentified processor error which would include when connectivity between the cartridge and the consoles microprocessor was temporarily lost14 in computingedit softwareedit asking google maps for walking directions between fictional locations from lord of the rings produced this easter egg response quoting a characters warning from the story15 in computer software easter eggs are secret responses that occur as a result of an undocumented set of commands the results can vary from a simple printed message or image to a page of programmer credits or a small video game hidden inside an otherwise serious piece of software in the tops10 operating system for the dec pdp10 computer the make command is used to invoke the teco editor to create a file if given the file name argument love so that the command is make love it will pause and respond not war before creating the file16 this same behavior occurred on the rstse operating system where teco will provide this responsecitation needed other unix operating systems respond to why with why not a reference to the prisoner in berkeley unix 1977citation needed some versions of the dec openvms operating system have concealed exit status codes including a reference to the monty python dirty hungarian phrasebook skit exit xb70 returns the message systemwfish my hovercraft is full of eels while exit x34b4 returns a reference to an early internet meme systemfgameover all your base are belong to us17 many personal computers have much more elaborate eggs hidden in rom including lists of the developers names political exhortations snatches of music or images of the entire development team easter eggs in the 1997 version of microsoft office include a hidden flight simulator in microsoft excel and a pinball game in microsoft word1819 as of 2005 microsoft no longer allows undocumented code including easter eggs in their products fearing that unexpected and unknown surprises would erode their clients trust in the safety of the software20unreliable source the debian operating systems package tool aptget has an easter egg involving an ascii cow when variants on aptget moo are typed into the shell2122 an easter egg is found on all microsoft windows operating systems before xp in the 3d text screen saver entering the text volcano will display the names of all the volcanoes in the united states microsoft removed this easter egg in xp but added others23 microsoft excel 95 contained a hidden doomlike action game called the hall of tortured souls24 easter eggs in google android os the google search engine famously contains many easter eggs given to the user in response to certain search queries for example google maps once responded to a request for directions from new york city to tokyo by telling the user to kayak across the pacific ocean25 steve jobs banned easter eggs from apple products upon his return to the company26 the first easter egg to appear after his death was in a 2012 update to the mac app store for os x mountain lion in which downloaded apps were temporarily timestamped as january 24 1984 the date of the sales launch of the original macintosh26 hardwareedit the macintosh se has an easter egg hidden in the roms four images of the engineering team while computerrelated easter eggs are often found in software occasionally they exist in hardware or firmware of certain devices on some home computers the bios rom contains easter eggs notable examples include some errant 1993 ami bios that on november 13 1993 proceeded to play happy birthday via the pc speaker over and over again instead of booting27 and several early apple macintosh models which had pictures of the development team in the rom accessible by pressing the programmers switch and jumping to a specific memory address or other equally obscure means these mac easter eggs were wellpublicized in the macintosh press at the time28 along with the means to access them and later serendipitously recovered by nyc resistor team a hacker collective through elaborate reverse engineering2930 similarly the radio shack color computer 3s rom contains code which displays the likenesses of three microware developers on a ctrlaltreset keypress sequence—a hard reset which discards any information currently in ram31 several oscilloscopes contain easter eggs one example is the hp 54600b known to have a tetris clone and even to save high scores32 whereas the hp 54622d contains an implementation of the asteroids game named rocks33 another is the tektronix 1755a vector and waveform monitor which displays swimming fish when remotesoftware version is selected on the config menu34 in the second and third hardware revision of the minolta dynaxmaxxumalpha 9 slr camera including all ssmadi upgraded cameras an undocumented button sequence which is impossible to press by accident can be utilized to reconfigure the camera to behave like the dynaxmaxxumalpha 9ti and subsequently invoke support for the limited models extra functions also in the black model35unreliable source the commodore amiga 1000 computer includes the signatures of the design and development team embossed on the inside of the case including jay miner and the paw print of his dog mitchy36 the commodore amiga models 500 600 and 1200 each feature easter eggs in the form of titles of songs by the b52s as white printing on the motherboards the 500 says b52rock lobster the 600 says june bug and the 1200 says channel z37 the amiga os software contains hidden messages383940unreliable source many integrated circuit chip designers have included hidden graphic elements termed chip art including images phrases developer initials logos and so on this artwork like the rest of the chip is reproduced in each copy by lithography and etching these are visible only when the chip package is opened and examined under magnification so they are in a sense more of an inside joke than most of the easter eggs included in software41unreliable source the 1984 cvax microchip implementation of the microvax cpu contained in its etchings the russian phrase in the cyrillic alphabet vax when you care enough to steal the very best placed there because knowing that some cvaxs would end up in the ussr the team wanted the russians to know that we were thinking of them42unreliable source comicsedit american comic book artists are known to include hidden messages in their art43 examples include in 2017 comic book artist ardian syaf caused an outcry with the easter eggs he placed into his art for xmen gold 1 in a reprint of classic captain america comics a production artist drew a penis on bucky barnes44 in 2000 al milgrom inserted a message into a universe x spidey 1 that insulted his previous boss marvel editor in chief bob harras following harras termination from marvel comics on page 28 panel 3 the spines of books on a bookshelf in the background read harras ha ha hes gone good riddance to bad rubbish he was a nasty sob the message was spotted after the book was printed but before it went on sale although 4000 preview copies were distributed to retailers as part of a first look scheme and are considered rare the copies that were printed for consumers were destroyed and milgrom was apparently fired and allegedly and quietly rehired several weeks later444546 ethan van sciver hid the word sex into the background of nearly every page of new xmen 118 november 20014447 van sciver subsequently stated that he hid the word throughout the book because he was annoyed with marvel at the time for reasons he cannot remember and he thought it would be fun to engage in some mischief with his work48unreliable source indonesian artist ardian syaf is known to engage in the practice of hiding easter egg references to political figures in the backgrounds of his artwork in batgirl vol 4 9 july 2012 for example syaf included a storefront sign that referenced the president of indonesia joko widodo although the text that accompanies the image of widodo is covered by a caption4449 in 2017 he caused an outcry by placing easter egg references to the november 2016 jakarta protests into the pages of xmen gold 1 which were perceived by readers to be antisemitic and antichristian though syaf acknowledged the political nature of the messages4450 he stated that they were not intended to express any antisemitic nor antichristian sentiment on his part51 in response to these easter eggs marvel terminated their contract with syaf52 videoedit home mediaedit easter eggs are found on film dvds and blurays often as deleted scenes or bonus special features535455 klinger states that their presence is another signifier of artistry in the world of dvd supplements54 according to berardinelli and ebert most dvds do not contain them and most examples are inconsequential but a very few such as one found on the memento dvd release are worth the effort to seek out55 the tv series doctor who has an episode using easter eggs as a major part of the plot the episode in question even has an easter egg on the chapter selection for that episode on the disc release showing the full inepisode easter eggcitation needed broadcast mediaedit unlike dvds and computer games broadcast radio and television programmes contain no executable code easter eggs may still appear in the content itself such as a hidden mickey mouse in a disney film or a real telephone number instead of a 555 fictitious telephone numberoriginal research one 2014 super bowl advertisement was leaked online in which a lady gives a man a real telephone number which the advertiser had hidden as a marketing ploy the first caller to the number received a pair of tickets to the game56 the 1980s animated series shera princess of power featured a character lookee who typically was hidden in a single screenshot within an episode marking his only appearance in that episode after the end of the episode the screenshot would be shown again and the character would challenge viewers to locate him before revealing his hiding place57unreliable source security concernsedit security author michel e kabay discussed security concerns in 2000 saying that software quality assurance requires that all code be tested but it is not known if easter eggs are tested he said that because they tend to be held as programming secrets from the rest of the product testing process a logic bomb could also bypass testing kabay asserts that this undermined the trusted computing base a paradigm of trustworthy hardware and software in place since the 1980s and is of concern wherever personal or confidential information is stored which may then be vulnerable to damage or manipulation58not in citation given microsoft created some of the largest and most elaborate easter eggs such as those in microsoft office59 in 2005 larry osterman of microsoft acknowledged microsoft easter eggs and his involvement in development of one but described them as irresponsible and wrote that the companys operating system division has a no easter eggs policy as part of its trustworthy computing initiative60unreliable source douglas w jones said in 2006 some easter eggs may be intentional tools used to detect illegal copying others are clearly examples of unauthorized functionality that has slipped through the qualitycontrol tests at the vendor while hidden easter eggs themselves are harmless it may be possible for malware to be hidden in similar ways in voting machines or other computers61 netscape navigator contributor jamie zawinski stated in an interview in 1998 that harmless easter eggs impose a negligible burden on shipped software and serve the important purpose of helping productivity by keeping programmers happy6263unreliable source in popular
