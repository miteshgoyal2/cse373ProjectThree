league of nations resolution on 21 september 1921 to elect a commission to study feasibility910 on 18 december 1925 the international bureau of education ibe began work as a nongovernmental organization in the service of international educational development11 however the onset of world war ii largely interrupted the work of these predecessor organizations after the signing of the atlantic charter and the declaration of the united nations the conference of allied ministers of education came began meetings in london which continued between 16 november 1942 to 5 december 1945 on 30 october 1943 the necessity for an international organization was expressed in the moscow declaration agreed upon by china the united kingdom the united states and the ussr this was followed by the dumbarton oaks conference proposals of 9 october 1944 upon the proposal of came and in accordance with the recommendations of the united nations conference on international organization uncio held in san francisco in april–june 1945 a united nations conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization ecoconf was convened in london 1–16 november 1945 with 44 governments represented a prominentclarification needed figure in the initiative for unesco was rab butler the minister of education for the united kingdom12 at the ecoconf the constitution of unesco was introduced and signed by 37 countries and a preparatory commission was established13 the preparatory commission operated between 16 november 1945 and 4 november 1946—the date when unescos constitution came into force with the deposit of the twentieth ratification by a member state14 the first general conference took place between 19 november to 10 december 1946 and elected dr julian huxley to directorgeneral15 the constitution was amended in november 1954 when the general conference resolved that members of the executive board would be representatives of the governments of the states of which they are nationals and would not as before act in their personal capacity16 this change in governance distinguished unesco from its predecessor the cici in how member states would work together in the organizations fields of competence as member states worked together over time to realize unescos mandate political and historical factors have shaped the organizations operations in particular during the cold war the decolonization process and the dissolution of the ussr among the major achievements of the organization is its work against racism for example through influential statements on race starting with a declaration of anthropologists among them was claude lévistrauss and other scientists in 195017 and concluding with the 1978 declaration on race and racial prejudice18 in 1956 the republic of south africa withdrew from unesco claiming that some of the organizations publications amounted to interference in the countrys racial problems19 south africa rejoined the organization in 1994 under the leadership of nelson mandela unescos early work in the field of education included the pilot project on fundamental education in the marbial valley haiti started in 194720 this project was followed by expert missions to other countries including for example a mission to afghanistan in 194921 in 1948 unesco recommended that member states should make free primary education compulsory and universal22 in 1990 the world conference on education for all in jomtien thailand launched a global movement to provide basic education for all children youths and adults23 ten years later the 2000 world education forum held in dakar senegal led member governments to commit to achieving basic education for all by 201524 unescos early activities in culture included for example the nubia campaign launched in 196025 the purpose of the campaign was to move the great temple of abu simbel to keep it from being swamped by the nile after construction of the aswan dam during the 20year campaign 22 monuments and architectural complexes were relocated this was the first and largest in a series of campaigns including mohenjodaro pakistan fes morocco kathmandu nepal borobudur indonesia and the acropolis greece the organizations work on heritage led to the adoption in 1972 of the convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage26 the world heritage committee was established in 1976 and the first sites inscribed on the world heritage list in 197827 since then important legal instruments on cultural heritage and diversity have been adopted by unesco member states in 2003 convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage28 and 2005 convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions29 an

intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development a problem which continues to be addressed in the field of sustainable development the main outcome of the 1968 conference was the creation of unescos man and the biosphere programme32 in the field of communication the free flow of ideas by word and image has been in unescos constitution from its beginnings

concentrated on reconstruction and on the identification of needs for means of mass communication around the world unesco started organizing training and education for journalists in the 1950s34 in response to calls for a new world information and communication order in the late 1970s unesco established the international commission for the study of communication problems35 which produced the 1980 macbride report named after the chair of the commission the nobel peace prize laureate seán macbride36 the same year unesco created the international programme for the development of communication ipdc a multilateral forum designed to promote media development in developing countries3738 in 1991 unescos general conference endorsed the windhoek declaration on media independence and

1990 and 1994 mean that it cannot contribute financially to any un organisation that accepts palestine as a full member42 as a result it withdrew its funding which accounted for about 22 of unescos budget43 israel also reacted to palestines admittance to unesco by freezing israel payments to the unesco and imposing sanctions to the palestinian authority44 claiming that palestines admittance would be detrimental to potential peace talks45 two years after they stopped paying their dues to unesco us and israel lost unesco voting rights in 2013 without losing the right to be elected thus the

attack the west in contrast to accusations made by the ussr in the late 1940s and early 1950s100 in 1984 the united states withheld its contributions and withdrew from the organization in protest followed by the united kingdom in 1985citation needed singapore withdrew also at the end of 1985 citing rising membership fees101 following a change of government in 1997 the uk rejoined the united

committee at jordans insistence censuredclarification needed israels decision to demolish and rebuild the mughrabi gate bridge in jerusalem for safety reasons israel stated that jordan had signed an agreement with israel stipulating that the existing bridge must be dismantled for safety reasons jordan disputed the agreement saying that it was only signed under us pressure israel was also unable to address the unesco committee over objections from egypt109 in january 2014 days before it was scheduled to open unesco directorgeneral irina bokova indefinitely postponed and effectively cancelled an exhibit created by the simon wiesenthal center entitled the people the book the land the 3500year relationship between the jewish people and the land of israel the event was scheduled to run from 21 january through 30 january in paris bokova cancelled the event after representatives of arab states at unesco argued that its display would harm the peace process110 the author of the exhibition professor robert wistrich of the hebrew universitys vidal sassoon international center for the study of antisemitism called the cancellation an appalling act and characterized bokovas decision as an arbitrary act of total cynicism and really contempt for the jewish people and its history unesco amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the year and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success111 occupied palestine resolutionedit main article occupied palestine resolution on 13 october 2016 unesco passed a resolution on east jerusalem that condemned israel for aggressions by israeli police and soldiers and illegal measures against the freedom of worship and muslims access to their holy sites while also recognizing israel as the occupying power palestinian leaders welcomed the decision112 while the text acknowledged the importance of the old city of jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in jerusalems old city only by its muslim name alharam alsharif arabic for noble sanctuary in response israel denounced the unesco resolution for its omission of the words temple mount or har habayit stating that it denies jewish ties to the key holy site112113 after receiving criticism from numerous israeli politicians and diplomats including benjamin netanyahu and ayelet shaked israel froze all ties with the organization114115 the resolution was condemned by ban kimoon and the directorgeneral of unesco irina bokova who said that judaism islam and christianity have clear historical connections to jerusalem and to deny conceal or erase any of the jewish christian or muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site116117 alaqsa mosque is also temple mount whose western wall is the holiest place in judaism118 it was also rejected by the czech parliament which said the resolution reflects a hateful antiisrael sentiment119 and hundreds of italian jews demonstrated in rome over italys abstention119 on 26 october unesco approved a reviewed version of the resolution which also criticized israel for its continuous refusal to let the bodys experts access jerusalems holy sites to determine their conservation status120 despite containing some softening of language following israeli protests over a previous version israel continued to denounce the text121 the resolution refers to the site jews and christians refer to as the temple mount or har habayit in hebrew only by its arab name — a significant semantic decision also adopted by unescos executive board triggering condemnation from israel and its allies us ambassador crystal nix hines stated this item should have been defeated these politicized and onesided resolutions are damaging the credibility of unesco122 in october 2017 the united states and israel announced they would withdraw from the organization citing inpart antiisrael bias123 palestineedit palestinian youth magazine controversyedit in february 2011 an article was published in a palestinian youth magazine in which a teenage girl described one of her four rolemodels as adolf hitler in december 2011 unesco which partly funded the magazine condemned the material and subsequently withdrew support124 islamic university of gaza controversyedit in 2012 unesco decided to establish a chair at the islamic university of gaza in the field of astronomy astrophysics and space sciences125 fueling controversy and criticism israel bombed the school in 2008 claiming they develop and store weapons there a claim israel restated in criticizing unescos move126127 the head kamalain shaath defended unesco stating that the islamic university is a purely academic university that is interested only in education and its development128129130 israeli ambassador to unesco nimrod barkan planned to submit a letter of protest with information about the universitys ties to hamas especially angry that this was the first palestinian university that unesco chose to cooperate with131 the jewish organization bnai brith criticized the move as well132 wikileaksedit on 16 and 17 february 2012 unesco held a conference entitled the media world after wikileaks and news of the world133 despite all six panels being focused on wikileaks no member of wikileaks staff were invited to speak after receiving a complaint from wikileaks spokesman kristinn hrafnsson unesco invited him to attend but did not offer a place on any panels134 the offer also came only a week before the conference which was held in paris france many of the speakers featured including david leigh and heather brooke had spoken out openly against wikileaks and its founder julian assange in the past135136 wikileaks released a press statement on 15 february 2012 denouncing unesco which stated unesco has made itself an international human rights joke to use freedom of expression to censor wikileaks from a conference about wikileaks is an orwellian absurdity beyond words137 che guevaraedit in 2013 unesco announced that the collection the life and works of ernesto che guevara became part of the memory of the world register ileana roslehtinen a us congresswoman condemned this decision saying that the organization acts against its own ideals138 this decision is more than an insult to the families of those cubans who were lined up and summarily executed by che and his merciless cronies it also serves as a direct contradiction to the unesco ideals of encouraging peace and universal respect for human rights un watch also condemned this selection by unesco139 listing nanjing massacre documentsedit in 2015 japan threatened to halt funding for unesco over the organizations decision to include documents relating to the 1937 nanjing massacre in the latest listing for its memory of the world program140 in october 2016 japanese foreign minister fumio kishida confirmed that japans 2016 annual funding of ¥44 billion had been suspended although denied any direct link with the nanjing document controversy141 us withdrawalsedit after withdrawing from unesco in 1984 the united states rejoined in 2002142 former us congressman jim leach stated before a congressional subcommittee143 the reasons for the withdrawal of the united states from unesco in 1984 are wellknown my view is that we overreacted to the calls of some who wanted to radicalize unesco and the calls of others who wanted the united states to lead in emasculating the un system the fact is unesco is one of the least dangerous international institutions ever created while some countries member countries within unesco attempted to push journalistic views antithetical to the values of the west and engage in israel bashing unesco itself never adopted such radical postures the us opted for emptychair diplomacy after winning not losing the battles we engaged in… it was nuts to get out and would be nuttier not to rejoin he concluded that the record showed israel bashing a call for a new world information order money management and arms control policy to be the impetus behind the withdrawal he asserted that before the unesco withdrawal a withdrawal from the iaea144 had been pushed on him the united states rejoined unesco shortly thereafter on 12 october 2017 the united states notified unesco that it will again withdraw from the organization on 31 december 2018 and will seek to establish a permanent observer mission beginning in 2019 the department of state cited mounting arrears at unesco the need for fundamental reform in the organization and continuing antiisrael bias at unesco145 products or servicesedit unesdoc – contains over 146000 unesco documents in full text published since 1945 as well as metadata from the collections of the
