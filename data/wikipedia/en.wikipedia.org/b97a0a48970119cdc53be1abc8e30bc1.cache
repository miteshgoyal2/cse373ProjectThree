southwest asia and eastern europe the goat is a member of the family bovidae and is closely related to the sheep as both are in the goatantelope subfamily caprinae there are over 300 distinct breeds of goat1 goats are one of the oldest domesticated species and have been used for their milk meat hair and skins over much of the world2 in 2011 there were more than 924 million live goats around the globe according to the un food and agriculture organization3 female goats are referred to as does or nannies intact males are called bucks or billies and juveniles of both sexes are called kids

goat females originated in the 18th century and billy goat for males in the 19th history horn cores from the neolithic village of atlit yam goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans5 the most recent genetic analysis6 confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild bezoar ibex of the zagros mountains is the likely original ancestor of probably all domestic goats today5 neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats primarily for easy access to milk and meat as well as to their dung which was used as fuel and their bones hair and sinew for clothing building and tools1 the earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10000 years before present are found in ganj dareh in iran goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in jericho choga mami7 djeitun and çayönü dating the domestication of goats in western asia at between 8000 and 9000 years ago5 studies of dna evidence suggests 10000 years bp as the domestication date6 historically goat hide has been used for water

clarified for visualization of anatomical structures eye with horizontal pupil goats are considered small livestock animals compared to bigger animals such as cattle camels and horses but larger than microlivestock such as poultry rabbits cavies and bees each recognized breed of goats has specific weight ranges which vary from over 140 kg 300 lb for bucks of larger breeds such as the boer to 20 to 27 kg 45 to 60 lb for smaller goat does8 within each breed different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes at the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the african pygmy which stand 41 to 58 cm 16 to 23 in at the shoulder as adults9 most goats naturally have two horns of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed goats have horns unless they are polled meaning genetically hornless or the horns have been removed typically soon after birth10 there have been incidents of polycerate goats having as many as eight horns although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited the horns are most typically removed in commercial dairy goat herds to reduce the injuries to humans and other goats unlike cattle goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring which are typically sterile10 their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins and are used for defense dominance and territoriality11 goats are ruminants they have a fourchambered stomach consisting of the rumen the reticulum the omasum and the abomasum as with other mammal ruminants they are eventoed ungulates the females have an udder consisting of two teats in contrast to cattle which have four teats12 an exception to this is the boer goat which sometimes may have up to eight teats131415 goats have horizontal slitshaped pupils because goats irises are usually pale their contrasting pupils are much more noticeable than in animals such as cattle deer most horses and many sheep whose similarly horizontal pupils blend into a dark iris and sclera both male and female goats have beards and many types of goat most commonly dairy goats dairycross boers and pygmy goats may have wattles one dangling from each side of the neck16 some breeds of sheep and goats look similar but they can usually be told apart because goat tails are short and usually point up whereas sheep tails hang down and are usually longer and bigger – though some like those of northern european shorttailed sheep are short and longer ones are often docked reproduction goat kid a twomonthold goat kid in a field of capeweed goats reach puberty between three and 15 months of age depending on breed and nutritional status many breeders prefer to postpone breeding until the doe has reached 70 of the adult weight however this separation is rarely possible in extensively managed openrange herds17 in temperate climates and among the swiss breeds the breeding season commences as the day length shortens and ends in early spring or before in equatorial regions goats are able to breed at any time of the year successful breeding in these regions depends more on available forage than on day length does of any breed or region come into estrus heat every 21 days for two to 48 hours a doe in heat typically flags vigorously wags her tail often stays near the buck if one is present becomes more vocal and may also show a decrease in appetite and milk production for the duration of the heat a female goat and two kids bucks intact males of swiss and northern breeds come into rut in the fall as with the does heat cycles bucks of equatorial breeds may show seasonal reduced fertility but as with the does are capable of breeding at all times rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite and obsessive interest in the does a buck in rut will display flehmen lip curling and will urinate on his forelegs and face sebaceous scent glands at the base of the horns add to the male goats odor which is important to make him attractive to the female some does will not mate with a buck which has been descented18 in addition to natural traditional mating artificial insemination has gained popularity among goat breeders as it allows easy access to a wide variety of bloodlines gestation length is approximately 150 days twins are the usual result with single and triplet births also common less frequent are litters of quadruplet quintuplet and even sextuplet kids birthing known as kidding generally occurs uneventfully just before kidding the doe will have a sunken area around the tail and hip as well as heavy breathing she may have a worried look become restless and display great affection for her keeper the mother often eats the placenta which gives her muchneeded nutrients helps stanch her bleeding and parallels the behavior of wild herbivores such as deer to reduce the lure of the birth scent for predators1920 freshening coming into milk production occurs at kidding milk production varies with the breed age quality and diet of the doe dairy goats generally produce between 680 and 1810 kg 1500 and 4000 lb of milk per 305day lactation on average a good quality dairy doe will give at least 3 kg 6 lb of milk per day while she is in milk a firsttime milker may produce less or as much as 7 kg 16 lb or more of milk in exceptional cases after the lactation the doe will dry off typically after she has been bred occasionally goats that have not been bred and are continuously milked will continue lactation beyond the typical 305 days21 meat fiber and pet breeds are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kids until weaning male lactation is also known to occur in goats22 diet goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything including tin cans and cardboard boxes while goats will not actually eat inedible material they are browsing animals not grazers like cattle and sheep and coupled with their highly curious nature will chew on and taste just about anything remotely resembling plant matter to decide whether it is good to eat including cardboard clothing and paper such as labels from tin cans23 the unusual smells of leftover food in discarded cans or boxes may further stimulate their curiositycitation needed a domestic goat feeding in a field of capeweed a weed which is toxic to most stock animals aside from sampling many things goats are quite particular in what they actually consume preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees as well as the occasional broadleaved plant however it can fairly be said that their plant diet is extremely varied and includes some species which are otherwise toxic24 they will seldom consume soiled food or contaminated water unless facing starvation this is one reason goatrearing is most often free ranging since stallfed goatrearing involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable goats prefer to browse on vines such as kudzu on shrubbery and on weeds more like deer than sheep preferring them to grasses nightshade is poisonous wilted fruit tree leaves can also kill goats silage fermented corn stalks and haylage fermented grass hay can be used if consumed immediately after opening – goats are particularly sensitive to listeria bacteria that can grow in fermented feeds alfalfa a highprotein plant is widely fed as hay fescue is the least palatable and least nutritious hay mold in a goats feed can make it sick and possibly kill it in various places in china goats are used in the production of tea goats are released onto the tea terraces where they avoid consuming the green tea leaves which contain bitter tasting substances but instead eat the weeds the goats droppings fertilise the tea plants25 the digestive physiology of a very young kid like the young of other ruminants is essentially the same as that of a monogastric animal milk digestion begins in the abomasum the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticuloesophageal groove during suckling at birth the rumen is undeveloped but as the kid begins to consume solid feed the rumen soon increases in size and in its capacity to absorb nutrients the adult size of a particular goat is a product of its breed genetic potential and its diet while growing nutritional potential as with all livestock increased protein diets 10 to 14 and sufficient calories during the prepuberty period yield higher growth rates and larger eventual size than lower protein rates and limited calories26 largeframed goats with a greater skeletal size reach mature weight at a later age 36 to 42 months than smallframed goats 18 to 24 months if both are fed to their full potential largeframed goats need more calories than smallframed goats for maintenance of daily functions27 behavior goats establish a dominance hierarchy in flocks sometimes through head butting play media an example of the goats social behavior within a flock glycerinated goat tongue goats are naturally curious they are also agile and well known for their ability to climb and balance in precarious places this makes them the only ruminant to regularly climb trees due to their agility and inquisitiveness they are notorious for escaping their pens by testing fences and enclosures either intentionally or simply because they are used to climb on if any of the fencing can be overcome goats will almost inevitably escape due to their intelligence once a goat has discovered a weakness in the fence they will exploit it repeatedly and other goats will observe and quickly learn the same methodcitation needed goats explore anything new or unfamiliar in their surroundings primarily with their prehensile upper lip and tongue by nibbling at them occasionally even eating them when handled as a group goats tend to display less herding behavior than sheep when grazing undisturbed they tend to spread across the field or range rather than feed sidebyside as do sheep when nursing young goats will leave their kids separated lying out rather than clumped as do sheep they will generally turn and face an intruder and bucks are more likely to charge or butt at humans than are rams28 a study by queen mary university reports that goats try to communicate with people in the same manner as domesticated animals such as dogs and horses goats were first domesticated as livestock more than 10000 years ago research conducted to test communication skills found that the goats will look to a human for assistance when faced with a challenge that had previously been mastered but was then modified specifically when presented with a box the goat was able to remove the lid and retrieve a treat inside but when the box was turned so the lid could not be removed the goat would turn and gaze at the person and move toward them before looking back toward the box this is the same type of complex communication observed by animals bred as domestic pets such as dogs researchers believe that better understanding of humangoat interaction could offer overall improvement in the animals welfare2930 the field of anthrozoology has established that domesticated animals have the capacity for complex communication with humans when in 2015 a japanese scientist determined that levels of oxytocin did increase in human subjects when dogs were exposed to a dose of the love hormone proving that a humananimal bond does exist this is the same affinity that was proven with the london study above goats are intelligent capable of complex communication and able to form bonds31 despite having the reputation of being slightly rebellious more and more people today are choosing more exotic companion animals like goats goats are herd animals and typically prefer the company of other goats but because of their herd mentality they will follow their owners around just the same goats are well known for being hard to contain with fencing see also goats as pets diseases main article list of infectious sheep and goat diseases while goats are generally considered hardy animals and in many situations receive little medical care they are subject to a number of diseases among the conditions affecting goats are respiratory diseases including pneumonia foot rot internal parasites pregnancy toxosis and feed toxicity feed toxicity can vary based on breed and location certain foreign fruits and vegetables can be toxic to different breeds of goats goats can become infected with various viral and bacterial diseases such as footandmouth disease caprine arthritis encephalitis caseous lymphadenitis pinkeye mastitis and pseudorabies they can transmit a number of zoonotic diseases to people such as tuberculosis brucellosis qfever and rabies32 life expectancy life expectancy for goats is between fifteen and eighteen years33 an instance of a goat reaching the age of 24 has been reported34 several factors can reduce this average expectancy problems during kidding can lower a does expected life span to ten or eleven and stresses of going into rut can lower a bucks expected life span to eight to ten years34 agriculture main article goat farming goat husbandry is common through the norte chico region in chile intensive goat husbrandry in drylands may produce severe erosion and desertification image from upper limarí river a goat is useful to humans when it is living and when it is dead first as a renewable provider of milk manure and fiber and then as meat and hide35 some charities provide goats to impoverished people in poor countries because goats are easier and cheaper to manage than cattle and have multiple uses in addition goats are used for driving and packing purposes the intestine of goats is used to make catgut which is still in use as a material for internal human surgical sutures and strings for musical instruments the horn of the goat which signifies plenty and wellbeing the cornucopia is also used to make spoons36 the boer goat – in this case a buck – is a widely kept meat breed worldwide goat population statistics according to the food and agriculture organization fao the top producers of goat milk in 2008 were india 4 million metric tons bangladesh 216 million metric tons and the sudan 147 million metric tons37 husbandry reared goathusbandry husbandry or animal care and use varies by region and culture the particular housing used for goats depends not only on the intended use of the goat but also on the region of the world where they are raised historically domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents similar to the more widely known shepherd these methods of herding are still used today in some parts of the world especially europe and north america distinct breeds of goats are kept for dairy milk and for meat production excess male kids of dairy breeds are typically slaughtered for meat both does and bucks of meat breeds may be slaughtered for meat as well as older animals of any breed the meat of older bucks more than one year old is generally considered not desirable for meat for human consumption castration at a young age prevents the development of typical buck odor for smallholder farmers in many countries such as this woman from burkina faso goats are important livestock dairy goats are generally pastured in summer and may be stabled during the winter as dairy does are milked daily they are generally kept close to the milking shed their grazing is typically supplemented with hay and concentrates stabled goats may be kept in stalls similar to horses or in larger group pens in the us system does are generally rebred annually in some european commercial dairy systems the does are bred only twice and are milked continuously for several years after the second kidding meat goats are more frequently pastured yearround and may be kept many miles from barns angora and other fiber breeds are also kept on pasture or range rangekept and pastured goats may be supplemented with hay or concentrates most frequently during the winter or dry seasons in india nepal and much of asia goats are kept largely for milk production both in commercial and household settings the goats in this area may be kept closely housed or may be allowed to range for fodder the salem black goat is herded to pasture in fields and along roads during the day but is kept penned at night for safekeeping38 in africa and the mideast goats are typically run in flocks with sheep this maximizes the production per acre as goats and sheep prefer different food plants multiple types of goatraising are found in ethiopia where four main types have been identified pastured in annual crop systems in perennial crop systems with cattle and in arid areas under pastoral nomadic herding systems in all four systems however goats were typically kept in extensive systems with few purchased inputs39 household goats are traditionally kept in nigeria while many goats are allowed to wander the homestead or village others are kept penned and fed in what is called a cutandcarry system this type of husbandry is also used in parts of latin america cutandcarry which refers to the practice of cutting down grasses corn or cane for feed rather than allowing the animal access to the field is particularly suited for types of feed such as corn or cane that are easily destroyed by trampling40 pet goats may be found in many parts of the world when a family keeps one or more animals for emotional reasons rather than as production animals it is becoming more common for goats to be kept exclusively as pets in north america and europe meat main article goat meat see also list of goat dishes the taste of goat kid meat is similar to that of spring lamb meat41 in fact in the englishspeaking islands of the caribbean and in some parts of asia particularly bangladesh pakistan and india the word “mutton” is used to describe both goat and lamb meat however some compare the taste of goat meat to veal or venison depending on the age and condition of the goat its flavor is said to be primarily linked to the presence of 4methyloctanoic and 4methylnonanoic acid42 it can be prepared in a variety of ways including stewing baking grilling barbecuing canning and frying it can be minced curried or made into sausage due to its low fat content the meat can toughen at high temperatures if cooked without additional moisture one of the most popular goats grown for meat is the south african boer introduced into the united states in the early 1990s the new zealand kiko is also considered a meat breed as is the myotonic or fainting goat a breed originating in tennessee milk butter and cheese a goat being machine milked on an organic farm goats produce about 2 of the worlds total annual milk supply43 some goats are bred specifically for milk if the strongsmelling buck is not separated from the does his scent will affect the milk goat milk naturally has small wellemulsified fat globules which means the cream remains suspended in the milk instead of rising to the top as in raw cow milk therefore it does not need to be homogenized indeed if the milk is to be used to make cheese homogenization is not recommended as this changes the structure of the milk affecting the cultures ability to coagulate the milk and the final quality and yield of cheese44 dairy goats in their prime generally around the third or fourth lactation cycle average—27 to 36 kg 6 to 8 lb—of milk production daily—roughly 28 to 38 l 3 to 4 us qt—during a tenmonth lactation producing more just after freshening and gradually dropping in production toward the end of their lactation the milk generally averages 35 butterfat45 goat milk is commonly processed into cheese butter ice

pantothenic acid to meet an infant’s nutritional needs and may cause harm to an infants kidneys and could cause metabolic damage48 the department of health in the united kingdom has repeatedly released statements stating on various occasions that49 goats milk is not suitable for babies and infant formulas and followon formulas based on goats milk protein have not been approved for use in europe and infant milks based on goats milk protein are not suitable as a source of nutrition for infants50 also according to the canadian federal health department – health canada most of the dangers or counterindication of feeding unmodified goat milk to infants are similar to those occurring in the same practice with cows milk namely in the allergic reactions51 however some farming groups promote the practice for example small farm today in 2005 claimed beneficial use in invalid and convalescent diets proposing that glycerol ethers possibly important in nutrition for nursing infants are much higher in does milk than in cows milk52 a 1970 book on animal breeding claimed that does milk differs from cows or humans milk by having higher digestibility distinct alkalinity higher buffering capacity and certain therapeutic values in human medicine and nutrition53 george mateljan suggested doe milk can replace ewe milk or cow milk in diets of those who are allergic to certain

were produced in the upper kashmir and ladakh region the wool came to be known as cashmere land clearing goats have been used by humans to clear unwanted vegetation for centuries they have been described as eating machines and biological control agents5758 there has been a resurgence of this in north america since 1990 when herds were used to clear dry brush from california hillsides thought to be endangered by potential wildfires this form of using goats to clear land is sometimes known as conservation grazing since then numerous public and private agencies have hired private herds to perform similar tasks57 this practice has become popular in the pacific northwest where they are used to remove invasive species not easily removed by humans including thorned blackberry vines and poison oak575960 use for medical training as a goats anatomy and physiology is not too dissimilar from that of human some countries militaries use goats to train combat medics in the united states goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s61 while modern mannequins used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body trainees feel that the goat exercise provides a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide62 as pets main article goats as pets some
