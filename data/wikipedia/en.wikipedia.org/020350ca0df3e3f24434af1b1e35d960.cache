1982 the boeing 727 is a midsized narrowbody threeengined jet aircraft built by boeing commercial airplanes from the early 1960s to 19841 it can carry 149 to 189 passengers and later models can fly up to 2700 nautical miles 5000 km nonstop intended for short and mediumlength flights the 727 can use relatively short runways at smaller airports it has three pratt whitney jt8d engines below the ttail one on each side of the rear fuselage with a center engine that connects through an sduct to an inlet at the base of the fin the 727 is boeings only trijet aircraft2 the 727 followed the 707 a quadjet airliner with which it shares its upper fuselage crosssection and cockpit design the 727100 first flew in february 1963 and entered service with eastern air lines in february 1964 the stretched 727200 flew in july 1967 and entered service with northeast airlines that december the 727 became a mainstay of airlines domestic route networks and was also used on short and mediumrange international routes passenger freighter and convertible versions of the 727 were built the 727 was heavily produced into the 1970s the last 727 was completed in 1984 as of july 2016update a total of 64 boeing 727s 4× 727100s and 60× 200s were in commercial service with 26 airlines3 plus a few more in government and private use airport noise regulations have led to 727s being equipped with hush kits since 1964

had developed requirements for a jet airliner to serve smaller cities with shorter runways and fewer passengers4 united airlines requested a fourengine aircraft for its flights to highaltitude airports especially its hub at stapleton international airport in denver colorado4 american airlines which was operating the fourengined boeing 707 and boeing 720 requested a twinengined aircraft for efficiency eastern airlines wanted a third engine for its overwater flights to the caribbean since at that time twinengine commercial flights were limited by regulations to routes with 60minute maximum flying time to an airport see etops eventually the three airlines agreed on a trijet design for the new aircraft4 production of the 727 in 1959 lord douglas chairman of british european airways bea suggested that boeing and de havilland aircraft company later hawker siddeley work together on their trijet designs the 727 and dh121 trident respectively5 the two designs had a similar layout the 727 being slightly larger at that time boeing intended to use three allison ar963 turbofan engines licensebuilt versions of the rollsroyce rb163 spey used by the trident67 boeing and de havilland each sent engineers to the other companys locations to evaluate each others designs but boeing eventually decided against the joint venture8 de havilland had wanted boeing to licensebuild the dh121 while boeing felt that the aircraft needed to be designed for the american market with sixabreast seating and the ability to use runways as short as 4500 feet 1400 m9 in 1960 pratt whitney was looking for a customer for its new jt8d turbofan design study based on its j52 jt8a turbojet10 while united and eastern were interested in a pratt whitney alternative to the rb163 spey11 once pratt whitney agreed to go ahead with development of the jt8d eddie rickenbacker chairman of the board of eastern told boeing that the airline preferred the jt8d for its 727s boeing had not offered the jt8d as it was about 1000 lb heavier than the rb163 though slightly more powerful the rb163 was also further along in development than the jt8d boeing reluctantly agreed to offer the jt8d as an option on the 727 and it later became the sole powerplant12 with highlift devices13 on its wing the 727 could use shorter runways than most earlier jets eg the 4800ft runway at key west later 727 models were stretched to carry more passengers14 and replaced earlier jet airliners such as the boeing 707 and douglas dc8 as well as aging propeller airliners such as the dc4 dc6 dc7 and the lockheed constellations on short and mediumhaul routes for over a decade more 727s were built per year than any other jet airliner in 1984 production ended with 1832 built1 and 1831 delivered the highest total for any jet airliner until the 737 surpassed it in the early 1990s15 designedit tail section of a pan am boeing 727 the airliners middle engine engine 2 at the very rear of the fuselage gets air from an inlet ahead of the vertical fin through an sshaped duct16 this sduct proved to be troublesome in that flow distortion in the duct induced a surge in the centerline engine on the takeoff of the first flight of the 72710017 this was fixed by the addition of several large vortex generators in the inside of the first bend of the duct the 727 was designed for smaller airports so independence from ground facilities was an important requirement this led to one of the 727s most distinctive features the builtin airstair that opens from the rear underbelly of the fuselage which initially could be opened in flight13 hijacker d b cooper parachuted from the back of a 727 as it was flying over the pacific northwest boeing subsequently modified the design with the cooper vane so that the airstair could not be lowered in flight18 another innovation was the auxiliary power unit apu which allowed electrical and airconditioning systems to run independently of a groundbased power supply and without having to start one of the main engines an unusual design feature is that the apu is mounted in a hole in the keel beam web in the main landing gear bay17 the 727 is equipped with a retractable tail skid that is designed to protect the aircraft in the event of an overrotation on takeoff the 727s fuselage has an outer diameter of 148 inches 38 m this allows sixabreast seating three per side and a single aisle when 18inch 46 cm wide coachclass seats are installed an unusual feature of the fuselage is the 10inch 25 cm difference between the lower lobe forward and aft of the wing as the higher fuselage height of the center section was simply retained towards the rear lloyd aéreo boliviano 727200 at jorge wilstermann airport the rear air stairs are visible at the 727s tail nose wheel brakes were available as an option to reduce braking distance on landing which provided reductions in braking distances of up to 150 m19 the 727 proved to be such a reliable and versatile airliner that it came to form the core of many startup airlines fleets the 727 was successful with airlines worldwide partly because it could use smaller runways while still flying mediumrange routes this allowed airlines to carry passengers from cities with large populations but smaller airports to worldwide tourist destinations one of the features that gave the 727 its ability to land on shorter runways was its clean wing design13 with no wingmounted engines leadingedge devices krueger or hinged flaps on the inner wing and extendable leading edge slats out to the wingtip and trailingedge lift enhancement equipment tripleslotted20 fowler flaps could be used on the entire wing together these highlift devices produced a maximum wing lift coefficient of 30 based on the flapretracted wing area17 the 727 was stable at very low speeds compared to other early jets but some domestic carriers learned after review of various accidents that the 40degree flaps setting could result in a higherthandesired sink rate or a stall on final approach these carriers pilots operation handbooks disallowed using more than 30° of flaps on the 727 even going so far as installing plates on the flap lever slot to prevent selection of more than 30° of flaps noiseedit the 727 is one of the noisiest commercial jetliners categorized as stage 2 by the us noise control act of 1972 which mandated the gradual introduction of quieter stage 3 aircraft the 727s jt8d jet engines use older lowbypass turbofan technology whereas stage 3 aircraft use the more efficient and quieter highbypass turbofan design when the stage 3 requirement was being proposed boeing engineers analyzed the possibility of incorporating quieter engines on the 727 they determined that the jt8d200 engine could be used on the two sidemounted pylons but the structural changes to fit the largerdiameter engine 492 inches 125 cm fan diameter in the jt8d200 compared to 399 inches 101 cm in the jt8d7 into the fuselage at the number two engine location were prohibitive a lufthansa boeing 727–100 approaching london heathrow airport 1978 current regulations require that a 727 in commercial service must be retrofitted with a hush kit to reduce engine noise to stage 3 levels one such hush kit is offered by fedex21 and has been purchased by over 60 customers22 aftermarket winglet kits originally developed by valsan partners and later marketed by quiet wing corp23 have been installed on many 727s to reduce noise at lower speeds as well as to reduce fuel consumption in addition raisbeck engineering developed packages to enable 727s to meet the stage 3 noise requirements these packages managed to get light and mediumweight 727s to meet stage 3 with simple changes to the flap and slat schedules for heavierweight 727s exhaust mixers must be added to meet stage 323 american airlines ordered and took delivery of 52 raisbeck 727 stage 3 systems other customers included twa pan am air algérie tame and many smaller airlines2425 since september 1 2010 727 jetliners including those with a hush kit are banned from some australian airports because they are too loud26 operational historyedit this section needs

this template message in addition to domestic flights of medium range the 727 was popular with international passenger airlines14 the range of flights it could cover and the additional safety added by the third engine meant that the 727 proved efficient for short to mediumrange international flights in areas around the world prior to its introduction fourengined jets or propellerdriven airliners were required for transoceanic service interior photo of the cockpit area of a flight simulator for a boeing 727 at the pan am international flight academy the 727 also proved popular with cargo and charter airlines fedex express introduced 727s in 197827 the 727s were the backbone of its fleet until the 2000s fedex began replacing them with boeing 757s in 200727 many cargo airlines worldwide employ the 727 as a workhorse since as it is being phased out of us domestic service because of noise regulations it becomes available to overseas users in areas where such noise regulations have not yet been instituted charter airlines sun country champion air and ryan international airlines all started with 727 aircraft a fedex express 727233 departs portland international airport the 727 had some military uses as well since the aft stair could be opened in flight the central intelligence agency used them to drop agents and supplies behind enemy lines in vietnam28 the 727 has proven to be popular where the airline serves airports with gravel or otherwise lightly improved runways the canadian airline first air for example previously used a 727100c to serve the communities of resolute bay and arctic bay in nunavut whose resolute bay airport and former nanisivik airport both have gravel runways the highmounted engines greatly reduce the risk of foreign object damage according to the boeing jetliner databook the justice prisoner and alien transportation system also known as con air currently uses four 727 aircraft to transport persons in legal custody between prisons detention

international airport 1998 at the start of the 21st century the 727 remained in service with a few large airlines faced with higher fuel costs lower passenger volumes due to the post911 economic climate increasing restrictions on airport noise and the extra expenses of maintaining older planes and paying flight engineers salaries most major airlines phased out their 727s they were replaced by twinengined aircraft which are quieter and more fuelefficient modern airliners also have a smaller flight deck crew of two pilots while the 727 required two pilots and a flight engineer delta air
