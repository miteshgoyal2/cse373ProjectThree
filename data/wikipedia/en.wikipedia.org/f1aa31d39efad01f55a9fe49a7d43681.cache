are some situations where a mission statement can be considered pointless or not useful to a business unrealistic in most cases mission statements turn out to be unrealistic and far too optimistic an unrealistic mission statement can also affect the performance and morale of the employees within the workplace this is because an unrealistic mission statement would reduce the likelihood of employees being able to meet this standard which could demotivate employees in the long term unrealistic mission statements also serve no purpose and can be considered a waste of managements time another issue which could arise from an unrealistic mission statement is that poor decisions could be made in an attempt to achieve this goal which has the potential to harm the business and be seen as a waste of both time and resources waste of time and resources mission statements require planning this takes time and effort for those who are responsible for creating the mission statement if the mission statement is not achieved then the process of creating the mission statement could be seen as a waste of time for all of the people involved a lot of thought and time is spent in designing a good mission statement and to have all of that time wasted is not what businesses can afford to be doing the wasted time could have been spent on much more important tasks within the organisation such as decisionmaking for the business designedit according to forbes the following questions must be answered in the mission statement10 “what do we do” — the mission statement should clearly outline the main purpose of the organisation and what they do “how do we do it” — it should also mention how you plan on achieving the mission statement “whom do we do it for” — the audience of the mission statement should be clearly stated within the mission statement “what value are we bringing” — the benefits and values of the mission statement should be clearly outlined when designing a mission statement it should be very clear to the audience what the purpose of it is it is ideal for a business to be able to communicate their mission goals and objectives to the reader without including any unnecessary information through the mission statement11 us federal emergency management agencys mission statement poster richard branson has commented on ways of crafting a good mission statement he explains the importance of having a mission statement that is clear and straight to the point and does not contain unnecessary baffling he went on to analyse a mission statement using yahoos mission statement at the time 2013 as an example in his evaluation of the mission statement he seemed to suggest that while the statement sounded interesting most people will not be able to understand the message it is putting across in other words the message of the mission statement potentially meant nothing to the audience12 “ this further backs up the idea that a good mission statement is one that is clear and answers the right questions in a simple manner and does not over complicate things an example of a good mission statement would be googles which is to organise the worlds information and
