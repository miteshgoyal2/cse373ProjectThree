colleagues edward n clarke joseph j gruber milton schneider robert l hopkins robert l hoch richard n rau and arthur v siefert left their employment at the semiconductor division of sperry rand corporation the founding of the new company was followed by sperry rand filing a lawsuit against national semiconductor for patent infringement3 by 1965 as it was reaching the courts the preliminaries of the lawsuit had caused the stock value of national to be depressed the depressed stock values allowed peter j sprague4 to invest heavily in the company with spragues family funds sprague also relied on further financial backing from a pair of west coast investment firms and a new york underwriter to take control as the chairman of national semiconductor at that time sprague was 27 years old jeffrey s young characterised the era as the beginning of venture capitalism5 that same year national semiconductor acquired molectro molectro was founded in 1962 in santa clara california by j nall and d spittlehouse who were formerly employed at fairchild camera and instrument corporation the acquisition also brought to national semiconductor two experts in linear semiconductor technologies robert widlar and dave talbert who were also formerly employed at fairchild the acquisition of molectro provided national with the technology to launch itself in the fabrication and manufacture of monolithic integrated circuits67 in 1967 sprague hired five top executives away from fairchild among whom were charles e sporck and pierre lamond at the time of sporcks hiring robert noyce was de facto head of semiconductor operations at fairchild and sporck was his operations manager sporck was appointed president and ceo of national to make the deal better for sporcks hiring and appointment for half his former salary at fairchild sporck was allotted a substantial share of nationals stock in essence sporck took four of his personnel from fairchild with him as well as three others from ti perkinelmer and hewlett packard to form a new eight man team at national semiconductor5 incidentally sporck had been widlars superior at fairchild before widlar left fairchild to join molectro due to a compensation dispute with sporck8 in 1968 national shifted its headquarters from danbury connecticut to santa clara california however like many companies national retained its registration as a delaware corporation for legal and financial expediency over the years national semiconductor acquired several companies like fairchild semiconductor 1987 and cyrix 1997 however over time national semiconductor spun off these acquisitions fairchild semiconductor became a separate company again in 1997 and the cyrix microprocessors division was sold to via technologies of taiwan in 1999 from 1997 to 2002 national enjoyed a large amount of publicity and awards with the development of the cyrix media center cyrix webpad webpad metro and national origami pda concept devices created by nationals conceptual products group based largely on the success of the webpad national formed the information appliance division highly integrated processors internet gadgets in 1998 the information appliance division was sold to amd in 2003 other business like digital wireless chipsets image sensors pc io chipsets have also been recently closed down or sold off as national has reincarnated itself as a high performance analog semiconductor company the transformation of national semiconductoredit the national semiconductor 8250 uart chip one of the most prolific and most cloned uart chips due to its presence in the first ibm personal computer peter sprague pierre lamond and the affectionately called charlie sporck worked handinhand with support of the board of directors to transform the company into a multinational and worldclass semiconductor concern immediately after becoming ceo sporck started an historic price war among semiconductor companies which then trimmed the number of competitors in the field among the casualties to exit the semiconductor business were general electric and westinghouse9 cost control overhead reduction and a focus on profits implemented by sporck was the key element to national surviving the price war and subsequently in 1981 becoming the first semiconductor company to reach the us1 billion annual sales mark however the foundation that made national successful was its expertise in analogue electronics ttl transistor–transistor logic and mosfet metaloxidesemiconductor fieldeffect transistor integrated circuit technologies as they had while employed in fairchild sporck and lamond directed national semiconductor towards the growing industrial and commercial markets and to rely less on military and aerospace contracts those decisions coupled with inflationary growth in use of computers provided the market for the expansion of national meanwhile sources of funds associated with sprague coupled with creative structuring of cash flow buffering due to sporck and lamond provided the financing required for that expansion lamond and sporck had also managed to attract and extract substantial funds to finance the expansion10 among sporcks cost control efforts was his attraction towards lowcost labour and outsourcing of labour national semiconductor was among the pioneers in the semiconductor industry to invest in facilities to perform final manufacturing operations of integrated circuits in developing countries especially in southeast asia national semiconductors manufacturing improvements under sporck in collaboration with lamond had not been enabled by emphasis on process innovation but on improving and standardizing processes already established by other companies like fairchild and texas instruments as well as by frequent raiding to hire from fairchilds pool of talents weaknesses of sporcks leadershipedit national semiconductor under sporck was not particularly invested in marketing strategies even though it had the vision to launch itself into new and apparent opportunities in the consumer market sporck had applied strategies that made national semiconductor function as a lowcost mass manufacturer of semiconductor commodities11 a few key executives and engineers left the company in 1981 among them was pierre lamond who had been the chief ic designer now partner at sequoia capital12 robert swansons leaving the company in the same year to found linear technology was another indication of the appropriateness of organisational strategies of national semiconductor under sporck for 13 of 14 years at national i was a gungho guy then the company started to get big i kept looking at all the companies whose butts wed been kicking and then national started organizing itself like them it was frustrating swanson said in the may 13 1991 business journalsan jose sporcks strategy of outsourcing sales to external sources meant national semiconductor did not have sufficient or responsive resources to respond to requests from innovators inventors and academic research which would have been helpful in the technological innovation boom of the 1980s national semiconductors lack and loss of innovation meant it was producing products that were easily copied and reproducible it may have been the cheapest manufacturer in the united states but it was not the cheapest compared to the asian manufacturers this weakness in national semiconductor was evident in its failure to compete during the globalisation of japanese semiconductor companies in the 1980s followed by the taiwanese and south koreans leadership under gilbert f amelioedit on may 27 1991 charles e sporck was replaced by gilbert f amelio as ceo and president amelio was then president of rockwell internationals semiconductor division and had a phd in physics from georgia institute of technology amelio had also been formerly employed at fairchild amelio was faced with a company plagued with overcapacity and shrinking market share amelio found that just prior to his taking helm despite having spent us1 billion over the last five years on research and development national semiconductor had a disappointing record in new products the business section of the new york times january 11 1991 reflected the overcapacity generated by sporck that had to be inherited by amelio amelio disposed off the noncore products and assets in which national semiconductor had no market motivation or expertise and turned the company towards its core expertise analogue semiconductors national semiconductor under amelio emphasized on reduction of cost of sales improving capacity utilization scrap reduction and cycletime reduction redundant facilities were sold and consolidated with the progress of restructuring national semiconductor increased revenues each year in 1994 national semiconductor under amelio posted record net revenues of us229 billion it was also a time when us semiconductor companies had regained market leadership amelio introduced benchmarking to evaluate productivity restructured marketing strategies and reorganised management by introducing modern management practices and workplace environments amelio divided products into two divisions standard products group which comprised lowmargin logic and memory chips commodity products which were more susceptible to cyclical demands and through which national semiconductor had matured and communications computing group which comprised highmargin valueadded analogue and mixedsignal chips amelios thus division of products seemed to prepare national semiconductor for the eventual disposal of lowmargin commodity products which came to fruition later with the sale of a reconstituted fairchild national semiconductor under amelio chose to build a brand new eight inch 200 mm wafer fabrication plant in south portland maine it chose to divest itself from its then somewhat new plant in migdal haemek israel which became tower semiconductor in 1995 amelio was elected as the chairman of the board of directors of national semiconductor in 1996 amelio accepted invitation from apple computer a customer of national semiconductor to join its board of directors troubles at apple later prompted the board to invite amelio to take on the position of ceo which he accepted in february 1996 national semiconductor announced the resignation of amelio as the companys president chairman and chief executive officer on february 2 1996 leadership under brian l hallaedit national semiconductor announced the appointment of brian l halla as its chairman president and ceo on may 3 1996 halla was then the head of lsi logic products division prior to lsi he had been with intel for 14 years halla reinforced amelios emphasis on the expertise of national semiconductor in analogue technologycitation needed he also was on occasions an evangelist for analogue technology however he found that national semiconductor under amelio had insufficient product offeringscitation needed halla embarked on a diversification into personal computer and graphics businesscitation needed he advocated pconachip aka systemonachip as a business direction for national semiconductorcitation needed during his tenure at lsi lsi had successfully applied similar concepts however lsi had steered clear of getting involved with pc technologies that would make it a competitor with intelcitation needed halla held the vision that information appliances ias would succeed the personal computer as a trendcitation needed he predicted that ias would overtake sales of pcs by the year 2000citation needed to achieve the goal national semiconductor started acquiring companies that would provide the technological complements to do so among the acquisitions were cirrus logic incs picopower business for its specialised expertise in small form factor devices mediamatics inc which makes multimedia connectivity products future integrated systems inc a pc graphics company gulbransen inc a digital audio technology maker comcore semiconductor inc a maker of digital signal processing for lans cyrix the maker of intel x86 clones on march 11 1997 national semiconductor corporation announced the us550 million sale of a reconstituted fairchild to the management of fairchild with the backing of sterling llc a unit of citicorp venture capital fairchild carried with it what was mostly the standard products group previously segregated by amelio incidentally the effective price of acquisition of cyrix was also us550 million on november 17 1997 national semiconductor and cyrix announced the merger of the companies cyrix would become an autonomous wholly owned subsidiary halla had earlier emphasized that national was after the lowend cpu market as part of the systemonachip pursuit and therefore would not place emphasis on cyrixs current development of highend 6x86mx designcitation needed however cyrix later announced that its merger with national semiconductor would not change its development or marketing planscitation needed the acquisition of an independentminded cyrix subsequently turned national semiconductor from a collaborator into a competitor with intel national lost its business with intelcitation needed intel reinstated the relationship after the sale of cyrixcitation needed the acquisition of cyrix also carried with it a business obligation as well as technical constraints to use ibm microelectronics division to fabricate the cyrix chipscitation needed while national semiconductor had plans to transfer their fabrication to its south portland fabcitation needed national incurred huge losses due to its processor business and announced the sale of cyrix to via in 1999citation needed in 1999 national semiconductor also put out feelers that it would sell if not the whole then a majority stake of its fabrication plant in south portland mainecitation needed however that did not come to fruitioncitation needed on june 28 2000 national semiconductor and tsmc taiwan signed an agreement that would allow transfer of advanced fabrication technologies from tsmc to the national semiconductor fabrication plant in south portland maine1314 on march 11 2009 national announced plans to close its assembly and test plant in suzhou china and its wafer fabrication plant in arlington texas15 on october 9 2009 brian halla announced his retirement as national’s ceo he remains executive chairman the company promoted donald don macleod who had previously served as the company’s president and chief operating officer to ceocitation needed leadership under donald macleodedit don macleod became national semiconductor’s chief executive officer on november 30 2009 he was named chairman of the board on may 31 2010 acquisition by texas instrumentsedit further information texas instruments on april 4 2011 texas instruments announced that it had agreed to buy national semiconductor for 65 billion in cash texas instruments paid 25 per share of national semiconductor stock an 80 premium over the april 4 2011 closing share price of 1407 the deal made texas instruments one of the worlds largest makers of analog technology components16 on september 19 2011 the chinese minister approved the
