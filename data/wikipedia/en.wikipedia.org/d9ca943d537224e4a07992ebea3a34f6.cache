minnesota a suburb of minneapolis medtronic was founded in 1949 in northeastern minneapolis by earl bakken and his brotherinlaw palmer hermundslie as a medical equipment repair shop10 through his repair business bakken came to know c walton lillehei a doctor of heart surgery at the university of minnesota medical school the deficiencies of the pacemakers of the day were made painfully obvious following a power outage over halloween in 1957 which affected large sections of minnesota and western wisconsin11 a pacemakerdependent paediatric patient of lillehei died because of the blackout the next day lillehei spoke with bakken about developing some form of batterypowered pacemaker bakken modified a design for a transistorised metronome and created the first batterypowered external artificial pacemaker medtronics old headquarters in st anthony minnesota the company expanded through the 1950s mostly selling equipment built by other companies but also developing some custommade devices bakken built a small pacemaker that could be strapped to the body and powered by batteries work in the new field later produced an implantable pacemaker in 1960 the company built headquarters in the minneapolis suburb of st anthony minnesota in 196012 and the company moved to fridley in the 1970s medtronics main competitors in the cardiac rhythm field include boston scientific and st jude medical in 1998 medtronic acquired physiocontrol for 538 million13 animal rightsedit in 2005 2008 and 2010 peta threatened to submit a shareholder resolution to improve animal welfare standards in the company in 2005 peta attempted to stop five specific animal experiments that it deemed crude and cruel in 2008 peta protested the outsourcing of animal testing to countries with lax animal welfare laws such as china in 2010 peta attempted to stop medtronics reported use of live animals in testing and training in response medtronic conducted a feasibility study that found that banning the use of live animals was impractical medtronic continues to use live animals for testing and training but has said that it will look for alternatives in the future in each case peta withdrew its shareholder resolution after talks with medtronics leadership1415 recent historyedit after 2008 and the global financial crisis its stock value dropped dramatically despite sales and gross margins well above the average of most industries with steady revenue growth since 2008 and a gross margin above 60 medtronic initiated a series of restructurings in 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 including physiocontrols spinoff for 487 million16 its stock price now approaches prerecession values in may 2014 medtronic agreed to pay over 1 billion to settle patent litigation with edwards lifesciences after years of protracted

six main business units which develop and manufacture devices and therapies to treat more than 30 chronic diseases including heart failure parkinsons disease urinary incontinence downs syndrome obesity chronic pain spinal disorders and diabetes cardiac rhythm disease managementedit cardiac rhythm disease management is the oldest and largest of medtronics business units its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957 when bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormallyslow heart rates since then it has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases it has also made an effort to address overall disease management by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices an independentlyoperating dutch pacemaker manufacturer vitatron acquired by medtronic in 1986 is now a european subsidiary of the unit50 medtronic and vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by medtronic carelink model 2090 programmer for medtronic and vitatron devices they use separate interfaces51 in 2007 medtronic recalled its sprint fidelis product the flexible wires or leads which connect a defibrillator to the interior of the heart the leads were found to be failing at an unacceptable rate resulting in unnecessary shocks or no shocks when needed either can be lethal the scope of the problem continues to be a matter of research studies since the recall disputed by medtronic suggest that the failure rate of alreadyimplanted sprint fidelis leads is increasing exponentially medtronics liability is limited by various court decisions52 spinal and biologicsedit spinal and biologics is medtronics secondlargest business medtronic is the world leader in spinal and musculoskeletal therapies in 2007 medtronic purchased kyphon a manufacturer and seller of spinal implants that are necessary for procedures like kyphoplasty53 in may 2008 medtronic spine agreed to pay the us government 75 million to settle a qui tam lawsuit after a whistleblower alleged that medtronic committed medicare fraud the company was charged with illegally convincing healthcare providers to offer kyphoplasty a spinal fracture repair surgery as an inpatient not an outpatient procedure to make thousands of dollars more in profits per surgery54 a special report by writer steven brill in time showed that according to medtronics quarterly sec filing of october 2012 the company had on average a 751 profit margin on its spine products and therapies55 cardiovascularedit medtronics cardiovascular therapies span the major specialities of interventional cardiology cardiac surgery and vascular surgery the products are used to reduce the potentially debilitating effects of coronary aortic and structural heart disease neuromodulationedit neuromodulation is the secondoldest and thirdlargest department of medtronic its products include neurostimulation systems and implantable drug delivery systems for chronic pain common movement disorders and urologic and gastrointestinal disorders it relies on innovative development methodologies to build cuttingedge medical technology devices with embedded software the departments revenues in 2014 amounted to 19 billion or 11 of medtronic’s total revenues56 diabetesedit the diabetes management manufacturing and sales division of medtronic is based in northridge california57 the original company minimed technologies was founded in the early 1980s by alfred e mann and spun off from pacesetter systems to design a practical insulin pump for lifelong wear58 most devices then were either too large or impossible to program and were extremely unreliable the release of the lightweight menudriven minimed 500 series changed the landscape and it was a major factor in bringing insulin pump usage to the mainstream in 1996 the minimed was redesigned by the innovation consulting rks design to look both more flashy and more elegant and to resemble a beeper the friendliness of the device boosted adoption rate and sales increased by 35759 in the early 2000s medtronic purchased minimed to form medtronic minimed60 on 11 may 2009 medtronic announced it had chosen san antonio texas for the location of its new diabetes therapy management and education center the company announced that it expected 1400 new jobs would be created to staff the 150000squarefoot 14000 m2 facility61 in september 2016 the fda approved a device minimed 670g which automatically pumps insulin to a diabetic patients body on sensing its absence or reduction62 surgical technologiesedit oarm surgical imaging system federal center of neurosurgery in tyumen 2013 the surgical technologies business group designed and manufactured products for the diagnosis and treatment of ear nose and throat ent diseases and cranial spinal and neurologic conditions it also encompassed a surgical navigation division to design stealthstation systems software and instruments for computer assisted surgery cas and a special intraoperative xray imaging system known as the oarm imaging system many of the products are used for minimallyinvasive surgical procedures in 2016 the business unit was dissolved and each site folded into new business groups technology safetyedit in 2011 jay radcliffe an independent black hat security researcher revealed a security vulnerability in a medtronic insulin pump allowing an attacker to take control of the pump medtronic responded by assuring users of the full safety of its devices63 in 2008 a team of computer security researchers was able to take remote control of a medtronic cardiac implant the team using an unused implant in a lab was able to control the electrical shocks delivered by the defibrillator component and even glean patient data from the device64 see alsoedit companies portal referencesedit a b c d locations medtroniccom  a b medtronic 10k report 2015 securities and exchange commission retrieved 6 november 2016
