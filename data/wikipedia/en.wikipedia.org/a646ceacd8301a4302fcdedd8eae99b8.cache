business and the implementation of welfare programs by the federal government as unconstitutional during the great depression he ruled against the constitutionality of many new deal laws— the agricultural adjustment administration and the national recovery administration— which had been supported by his fellow democrat franklin roosevelt3 this earned him a place among the socalled four

eloquent minority opinions on november 15 1939 butler went into the hospital for a minor ailment but died in the early morning hours of november 16 he wrote the majority opinion 63 in united states v

was the lone dissenter on the court the rest of the justices believed that a state was not restrained from trying a man a second time for the same crime butler believed this violated the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitutioncitation needed he sided with the majority in pierce v society of sisters holding unconstitutional an oregon state law which prohibited parents from sending their children to private or religious schools6 in the 1927 decision for buck v bell butler was the only justice who dissented from the 81 ruling7 and justice oliver wendell holmes jrs opinion holding that the forced sterilization of an allegedly feebleminded woman in virginia was constitutional8 holmes believed that butlers religion influenced his thinking in buck remarking that butler knows this is good law i wonder whether he will have the courage to vote with us in spite of his religion9 although butler dissented in both buck and palko he did not write a dissenting opinion in either case10 the practice of a justices noting a dissent without opinion was much more common then than it would be in the later 20th and early 21st centuries another consequential dissent was from the opinion
