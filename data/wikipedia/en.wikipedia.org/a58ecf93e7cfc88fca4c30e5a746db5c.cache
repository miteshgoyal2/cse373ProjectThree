russian ссср was a socialist state in eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 nominally a union of multiple equal national soviet republicsa its government and economy were highly centralized the country was a oneparty state governed by the communist party with moscow as its capital in its largest republic the russian soviet federative socialist republic the russian nation had constitutionally equal status among the many nations of the union but exerted de facto dominance in various respects10 other major urban centres were leningrad kiev minsk almaata and novosibirsk the soviet union was one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possessed the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction11 it was a founding permanent member of the united nations security council as well as a member of the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and the leading member of the council for mutual economic assistance cmea and the warsaw pact the soviet union had its roots in the october revolution of 1917 when the bolsheviks led by vladimir lenin overthrew the russian provisional government which had replaced tsar nicholas ii during world war i in 1922 the soviet union was formed with the unification of the russian transcaucasian ukrainian and byelorussian republics following lenins death in 1924 and a brief power struggle joseph stalin came to power in the mid1920s stalin committed the states ideology to marxism–leninism which he created and initiated a centrally planned economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization during this period of totalitarian rule political paranoia fermented the late1930s great purge removed stalins opponents within and outside of the party via arbitrary arrests and persecutions of many people resulting in an estimated 600000 deaths suppression of political critics forced labor and famines were carried out by stalins government in 1933 a major famine struck soviet ukraine causing the deaths of some 312 to 7 million people shortly before world war ii stalin signed the molotov–ribbentrop pact agreeing to nonaggression with nazi germany after which the two countries invaded poland in september 1939 in june 1941 the pact collapsed as germany turned to attack to the soviet union opening the largest and bloodiest theatre of war in history soviet war casualties accounted for the highest proportion of the conflict in the effort of acquiring the upper hand over axis forces at intense battles such as stalingrad and kursk the territories overtaken by the red army became satellite states of the ussr the postwar division of europe into capitalist and communist halves would lead to increased tensions with the west led by the united states the cold war emerged by 1947 as the eastern bloc united under the warsaw pact in 1955 confronted the western bloc united under nato in 1949 on 5 march 1953 stalin died and was quickly succeeded by nikita khrushchev who in 1956 denounced stalin and began the destalinization of soviet society through the khrushchev thaw the soviet union took an early lead in the space race with the first artificial satellite and the first human spaceflight khrushchev was removed from power by his colleagues in 1964 and was succeeded as head of state by leonid brezhnev in the 1970s there was a brief détente of relations with the united states but tensions resumed with the soviet–afghan war in 1979 in the mid1980s the last soviet leader mikhail gorbachev sought to reform and liberalize the economy through his policies of glasnost and perestroika under gorbachev the role of the communist party in governing the state was removed from the constitution causing a surge of severe political instability to set in the cold war ended during his tenure and in 1989 soviet satellite states in eastern europe overthrew their respective communist governments with the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements inside the ussrs republics gorbachev tried to avert a dissolution of the soviet union in the postcold war era a march 1991 referendum boycotted by some republics resulted in a majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the union as a renewed federation gorbachevs power was greatly diminished after russian president boris yeltsin played a highprofile role in facing down an abortive august 1991 coup détat attempted by communist party hardliners on 25 december 1991 gorbachev resigned and the remaining twelve constituent republics emerged as independent postsoviet states the russian federation—formerly the russian sfsr—assumed the soviet unions rights and obligations and is recognized as the primary legal successor of the soviet union131415 in summing up the international

state council which functioned from 1810 to 1917 was referred to as a council of ministers after the revolt of 190517 during the georgian affair vladimir lenin envisioned an expression of great

republics of europe and asia russian союз советских республик европы и азии soyuz sovetskikh respublik yevropy i azii18 stalin initially resisted the proposal but ultimately accepted it although – with lenins agreement – he changed the name of the newly proposed state to the union of soviet socialist republics although all the republics began as socialist soviet and did not change to the other order until 1936 in addition in the national languages of several republics the word councilconciliar in the respective language was only quite late changed to an adaptation of the russian soviet –

february revolution due in part to the strain of fighting in world war i which lacked public support a shortlived russian provisional government took power to be overthrown in the october revolution ns 7 november 1917 by revolutionaries led by the bolshevik leader vladimir lenin22 the soviet union was officially established in december 1922 with the union of the russian ukrainian byelorussian and transcaucasian soviet republics each ruled by local bolshevik parties despite the foundation of the soviet state as a federative entity of many constituent republics each with its own political and administrative entities the term soviet russia – strictly applicable only to the russian federative socialist republic – was often applied to the entire country by nonsoviet writers and politicians revolution and foundation main article history of soviet russia and the soviet union 1917–27 modern revolutionary activity in the russian empire began with the decembrist revolt of 1825 although serfdom was abolished in 1861 it was done on terms unfavorable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries a parliament—the state duma—was established in 1906 after the russian revolution of 1905 but tsar nicholas ii resisted attempts to move from absolute to constitutional monarchy social unrest continued and was aggravated during world war i by military defeat and food shortages in major soviet cities vladimir lenin leon trotsky and lev kamenev celebrating the second anniversary of the october revolution 1919 a spontaneous popular uprising in petrograd in response to the wartime decay of russias economy and morale culminated in the february revolution and the toppling of the imperial government in march 1917 the tsarist autocracy was replaced by the russian provisional government which intended to conduct elections to the russian constituent assembly and to continue fighting on the side of the entente in world war i at the same time workers councils known in russian as soviets sprang up across the country the bolsheviks led by vladimir lenin pushed for socialist revolution in the soviets and on the streets on 7 november 1917 the red guards stormed the winter palace in petrograd ending the rule of the provisional government and leaving all political power to the soviets this event would later be known as the great october socialist revolution in december the bolsheviks signed an armistice with the central powers though by february 1918 fighting had resumed in march the soviets ended involvement in the war for good and signed the treaty of brestlitovsk a long and bloody civil war ensued between the reds and the whites starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the reds victory it included foreign intervention the execution of the former tsar and his family and the famine of 1921 which killed about five million people23 in march 1921 during a related conflict with poland the peace of riga was signed splitting disputed territories in belarus and ukraine between the republic of poland and soviet russia soviet russia had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established republic of finland the republic of estonia the republic of latvia and the republic of lithuania unification of republics the russian sfsr as a part of the ussr in 1922 the russian sfsr as a part of the ussr after 1936 russian territorial changes on 28 december 1922 a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the russian sfsr the transcaucasian sfsr the ukrainian ssr and the byelorussian ssr approved the treaty on the creation of the ussr24 and the declaration of the creation of the ussr forming the union of soviet socialist republics25 these two documents were confirmed by the 1st congress of soviets of the ussr and signed by the heads of the delegations26 mikhail kalinin mikhail tskhakaya mikhail frunze grigory petrovsky and alexander chervyakov27 on 30 december 1922 the formal proclamation was made from the stage of the bolshoi theatre on 1 february 1924 the ussr was recognized by the british empire the same year a soviet constitution was approved legitimizing the december 1922 union an intensive restructuring of the economy industry and politics of the country began in the early days of soviet power in 1917 a large part of this was done according to the bolshevik initial decrees government documents signed by vladimir lenin one of the most prominent breakthroughs was the goelro plan which envisioned a major restructuring of the soviet economy based on total electrification of the country the plan was developed in 1920 and covered a 10 to 15year period it included construction of a network of 30 regional power stations including ten large hydroelectric power plants and numerous electricpowered large industrial enterprises28 the plan became the prototype for subsequent fiveyear plans and was fulfilled by 193129 stalin era main article history of the soviet union 1927–53 stalin and nikolai yezhov head of the nkvd after yezhov was executed he was edited out of the image from its creation the government in the soviet union was based on the oneparty rule of the communist party bolsheviks30 after the economic policy of war communism during the russian civil war as a prelude to fully developing socialism in the country the soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry in the 1920s and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax the stated purpose of the oneparty state was to ensure that capitalist exploitation would not return to the soviet union and that the principles of democratic centralism would be most effective in representing the peoples will in a practical manner debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after lenins death in 1924 initially lenin was to be replaced by a troika consisting of grigory zinoviev of the ukrainian ssr lev kamenev of the russian sfsr and joseph stalin of the transcaucasian sfsr on 3 april 1922 stalin was named the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union lenin had appointed stalin the head of the workers and peasants inspectorate which gave stalin considerable power by gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmaneuvering his rivals within the party stalin became the undisputed leader of the soviet union and by the end of the 1920s established totalitarian rule in october 1927 grigory zinoviev and leon trotsky were expelled from the central committee and forced into exile in 1928 stalin introduced the first fiveyear plan for building a socialist economy in place of the internationalism expressed by lenin throughout the revolution it aimed to build socialism in one country in industry the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization in agriculture rather than adhering to the lead by example policy advocated by lenin31 forced collectivization of farms was implemented all over the country famines ensued causing millions of deaths surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to gulags to do forced labour32 social upheaval continued in the mid1930s stalins great purge resulted in the execution or detainment of many old bolsheviks who had participated in the october revolution with lenin according to declassified soviet archives in 1937 and 1938 the nkvd arrested more than one and a half million people of whom 681692 were shot over those two years that averages to over one thousand executions a day33 according to historian geoffrey hosking excess deaths during the 1930s as a whole were in the range of 10–11 million34 although historian timothy d snyder claims that archival evidence suggests a maximum excess mortality of nine million during the entire stalin era35 yet despite the turmoil of the midtolate 1930s the soviet union developed a powerful industrial economy in the years before world war ii under the doctrine of state atheism in the soviet union there was a governmentsponsored program of forced conversion to atheism conducted by communists363738 the communist regime targeted religions based on state interests and while most organized religions were never outlawed religious property was confiscated believers were harassed and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools39 in 1925 the government founded the league of militant atheists to intensify the propaganda campaign40 accordingly although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the official structures and mass media and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions teachers state bureaucrats soldiers to be openly religious as for the russian orthodox church soviet authorities sought to control it and in times of national crisis to exploit it for the regimes own purposes but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it during the first five years of soviet power the bolsheviks executed 28 russian orthodox bishops and over 1200 russian orthodox priests many others were imprisoned or exiled believers were harassed and persecuted most seminaries were closed and the publication of most religious material was prohibited by 1941 only 500 churches remained open out of

between the west and the ussr from 1932 to 1934 the soviet union participated in the world disarmament conference in 1933 diplomatic relations between the united states and the ussr were established when in november the newly elected president of the united states franklin d roosevelt chose to formally recognize stalins communist government and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two nations41 in september 1934 the soviet union joined the league of nations after the spanish civil war broke out in 1936 the ussr actively supported the republican forces against the nationalists who were supported by fascist italy and nazi germany in december 1936 stalin unveiled a new soviet constitution the constitution was seen as a personal triumph for stalin who on this occasion was described by pravda as a genius of the new world the wisest man of the epoch the great leader of communismcitation needed by contrast western historians and historians from former soviet occupied countries have viewed the constitution as a meaningless propaganda documentcitation needed sergei korolev the father of the soviet space program shortly after his arrest during stalins great terror the late 1930s saw a shift towards the axis powers in 1939 almost a year after the united kingdom and france had concluded the munich agreement with germany the ussr dealt with the nazis as well both militarily and economically during extensive talks the two countries concluded the molotov–ribbentrop pact and the german–soviet commercial agreement in august 1939 the nonaggression pact made

state world war ii main article eastern front world war ii the battle of stalingrad is considered by many historians as a decisive turning point of world war ii although it has been debated whether the soviet union intended to invade germany once it was strong enough42 germany itself broke the treaty and invaded the soviet union on 22 june 1941 starting what was known in the ussr as the great patriotic war the red army stopped the seemingly invincible german army at the battle of moscow aided by an unusually harsh winter the battle of stalingrad which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943 dealt a severe blow to the germans from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war after stalingrad soviet forces drove through eastern europe to berlin before germany surrendered in 1945 the german army suffered 80 of its military deaths in the eastern front43 the same year the ussr in fulfillment of its agreement with the allies at the yalta conference denounced the soviet–japanese neutrality pact in april 194544 and invaded manchukuo and other japancontrolled territories on 9 august 194545 this conflict ended with a decisive soviet victory contributing to

nikita khrushchev left with john f kennedy in vienna 3 june 1961 because moscow considered eastern europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defense of its western borders in case of another major invasion such as the german invasion of 1940 the ussr sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the eastern european countries into satellite states dependent upon and subservient to its leadership soviet military force was used to suppress antistalinist uprisings in hungary and poland in 1956 in the late 1950s a confrontation with china regarding the ussrs rapprochement with the west and what mao zedong perceived as khrushchevs revisionism led to the sino–soviet split this resulted in a break throughout the global marxist–leninist movement with the

soviet union and warsaw pact allies invaded czechoslovakia to halt the prague spring reforms in the aftermath brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of eastern european states by introducing the brezhnev doctrine which claimed the right of the soviet union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace marxism–leninism with capitalism soviet

way for revolutions of 1989 with the tearing down of the berlin wall and with east germany and west germany pursuing unification the iron curtain between the west and sovietcontrolled regions came down in the late 1980s the constituent republics of the soviet union started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories citing article 72 of the ussr constitution which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede53 on 7 april 1990 a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than twothirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum54 many held their first free elections in the soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990 many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the union laws in what was known as the war of laws in 1989 the russian sfsr which was then the largest constituent republic with about half of the population convened a newly elected congress of peoples deputies boris yeltsin was elected its chairman on 12 june 1990 the congress declared russias sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the ussrs laws after a landslide victory of sąjūdis in lithuania that country declared its independence restored on 11 march 1990 a referendum for the preservation of the ussr was held on 17 march 1991 in nine republics the remainder having boycotted the vote with the majority of the population in those nine republics voting for preservation of the union the referendum gave gorbachev a minor boost in the summer of 1991 the new union treaty which would have turned the soviet union into a much looser union was agreed upon by eight republics boris yeltsin stands on a tank in moscow to defy the august coup 1991 the signing of the treaty however was interrupted by the august coup—an attempted coup détat by hardline members of the government and the kgb who sought to reverse gorbachevs reforms and reassert the central governments control over the republics after the coup collapsed yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions while gorbachevs power was effectively ended the balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics in august 1991 latvia and estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence following lithuanias 1990 example gorbachev resigned as general

independence ukraines secession ended any realistic chance of the soviet union staying together even on a limited scale changes in national boundaries after the end of the cold war on 8 december 1991 the presidents of russia ukraine and belarus formerly byelorussia signed the belavezha accords which declared the soviet union dissolved and established the commonwealth of independent states cis in

soviet flag was lowered for the last time and the russian tricolor was raised in its place the following day the supreme soviet the highest governmental body of the soviet union voted both itself and the soviet union out of existence this is generally recognized as marking the official final dissolution of the soviet union as a functioning state the soviet army originally remained under overall cis command but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states the few remaining soviet institutions that had not been taken over by russia ceased to function by the end of 1991 following the dissolution of the soviet union on 26 december 1991 russia was internationally recognized55 as its legal successor on the international stage to that end russia voluntarily accepted all soviet foreign debt and claimed overseas soviet properties as its own under the 1992 lisbon protocol russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former soviet republics since then the russian federation has assumed the soviet unions rights and obligations ukraine has refused to recognize exclusive russian claims to succession of the ussr and claimed such status for ukraine as well which was codified in articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law on legal succession of ukraine since its independence in 1991 ukraine has

power hierarchies in the soviet union the legislature represented by the supreme soviet of the soviet union the government represented by the council of ministers and the communist party of the soviet union cpsu the only legal party and the ultimate policymaker in the country76 communist party main article communist party of the soviet union at the top of the communist party was the central committee elected at party congresses and conferences the central committee in turn voted for a politburo called the presidium between 1952–1966 secretariat and the general secretary first secretary from 1953 to 1966 the de facto highest office in the ussr77 depending on the degree of power consolidation it was either the politburo as a collective body or the general secretary who always was one of the politburo members that effectively led the party and the country78 except for the period of the highly personalized authority of stalin exercised directly through his position in the council of ministers rather than the politburo after 194179 they were not controlled by the general party membership as the key principle of the party organization was democratic centralism demanding strict subordination to higher bodies and elections went uncontested endorsing the candidates proposed from above80 the communist party maintained its dominance over the state largely through its control over the system of appointments all senior government officials and most deputies of the supreme soviet were members of the cpsu of the party heads themselves stalin in 1941–1953 and khrushchev in 1958–1964 were premiers upon the forced retirement of khrushchev the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership81 but the later general secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the largely ceremonial position of chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet the nominal head of state the institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by primary party organizations82 in practice however the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state bureaucracy particularly after the death of stalin was far from total with the bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party83 nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom although factions were officially banned84 government main article government of the soviet union the grand kremlin palace seat of the supreme soviet of the soviet union 1982 the supreme soviet successor of the congress of soviets and central executive committee was nominally the highest state body for most of the soviet history85 at first acting as a rubber stamp institution approving and implementing all decisions made by the party however the powers and functions of the supreme soviet were extended in the late 1950s 1960s and 1970s including the creation of new state commissions and committees it gained additional powers relating to the approval of the fiveyear plans and the soviet government budget86 the supreme soviet elected a presidium to wield its power between plenary sessions87 ordinarily held twice a year and appointed the supreme court88 the procurator general89 and the council of ministers known before 1946 as the council of peoples commissars headed by the chairman premier and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society87 state and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions although the russian sfsr unlike the other constituent republics for most of its history had no republican branch of the cpsu being ruled directly by the unionwide party until 1990 local authorities were organized likewise into party committees local soviets and executive committees while the state system was nominally federal the party was unitary90 the state security police the kgb and its predecessor agencies played an important role in soviet politics it was instrumental in the stalinist terror91 but after the death of stalin the state security police was brought under strict party control under yuri andropov kgb chairman in 1967–1982 and general secretary from 1982 to 1984 the kgb engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the partystate structure92 culminating in the anticorruption campaign targeting high party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s93

was governed less by statute than by informal conventions and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the politburo after the deaths of lenin96 and joseph stalin97 as well as after khrushchevs dismissal98 itself due to a decision by both the politburo and the central committee99 all leaders of the communist party before gorbachev died in office except georgy malenkov100 and khrushchev both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party99 between 1988 and 1990 facing considerable opposition mikhail gorbachev enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the supreme soviet less dependent on them the congress of peoples deputies was established the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in march 1989 the congress now elected the supreme soviet which became a fulltime parliament much stronger than before for the first time since the 1920s it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and council of ministers101 in 1990 gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the president of the soviet union concentrated power in his executive office independent of the party and subordinated the government102 now renamed the cabinet of ministers of the ussr to himself103 tensions grew between the unionwide authorities under gorbachev reformists led in russia by boris yeltsin and controlling the newly elected supreme soviet of the russian sfsr and communist party hardliners on 19–21 august 1991 a group of hardliners staged an abortive coup attempt following the failed coup the state council of the soviet union became the highest organ of state power in the period of transition104 gorbachev resigned as general secretary only remaining president for the final months of the existence of the ussr105 judicial system main article law of the soviet union see also socialist law the judiciary was not independent of the other branches of government the supreme court supervised the lower courts peoples court and applied the law as established by the constitution or as interpreted

federation of constituent union republics which were either unitary states such as ukraine or byelorussia ssrs or federal states such as russia or transcaucasia sfsrs76 all four being the founding republics who signed the treaty on the creation of the ussr in december 1922 in 1924 during the national delimitation in central asia uzbekistan and turkmenistan were formed from parts of the russias turkestan assr and two soviet dependencies the khorezm and bukharan ssrs in 1929 tajikistan was split off from the uzbekistan ssr with the constitution of 1936 the transcaucasian sfsr was dissolved resulting in its constituent republics of armenia georgia and azerbaijan being elevated to union republics while kazakhstan and kirghizia were split off from russian sfsr resulting in the same status107 in august 1940 moldavia was formed from parts of the ukraine and bessarabia and northern bukovina estonia latvia and lithuania ssrs were also admitted into the union which was not recognized by most of the international community and was considered an illegal occupation karelia was split off from russia as a union republic in march 1940 and was reabsorbed in 1956 between july 1956 and september 1991 there were 15 union republics see map below108 while nominally a union of equals in practice the soviet union was dominated by the ethnic russians to such an extent that for most of the soviet unions existence it was commonly but incorrectly referred to as russia while the rsfsr was technically only one republic within the larger union it was by far the largest both in terms of population and geography most powerful and most highly developed historian matthew white wrote that it was an open secret that the soviet unions federal structure was window dressing for russian dominance for that reason the people of the soviet union were usually called russians not soviets since everyone knew who really ran the show109 the republics of the soviet union 1956–1991 flag

were centralized and directed by the government the first bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of war communism which involved the nationalization of industry centralized distribution of output coercive requisition of agricultural production and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money as well as private enterprises and free trade after the severe economic collapse caused by the war lenin replaced war communism with the new economic policy nep in 1921 legalising free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses the economy quickly recovered119 following a lengthy debate among the members of politburo over the course of economic development by 1928–1929 upon gaining control of the country joseph stalin abandoned the nep and pushed for full central planning starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization which greatly expanded soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s119 preparation for war was one of the main driving forces behind industrialization mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalistic world120 as a result the ussr was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after world war ii121 during the war the soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation and required extensive reconstruction122 picking cotton in armenia in the 1930s by the early 1940s the soviet economy had become relatively selfsufficient for most of the period until the creation of comecon only a very small share of domestic products was traded internationally123 after the creation of the eastern bloc external trade rose rapidly still the influence of the world economy on the ussr was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade124 grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s123 during the arms race of the cold war the soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry at the same time the soviet union became the largest arms exporter to the third world significant amounts of soviet resources during the cold war were allocated in aid to the other socialist states123 from the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991 the way the soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged the economy was formally directed by central planning carried out by gosplan and organized in fiveyear plans in practice however the plans were highly aggregated and provisional subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors all key economic decisions were taken by the political leadership allocated resources and plan targets were normally denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods credit was discouraged but widespread final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized unplanned contracting although in theory prices were legally set from above in practice the actual prices were often negotiated and informal horizontal links between producer factories etc were widespread119 a number of basic services were statefunded such as education and healthcare in the manufacturing sector heavy industry and defense were assigned higher priority than the production of consumer goods125 consumer goods particularly outside large cities were often scarce of poor quality and limited choice under command economy consumers had almost no influence over production so the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices126 a massive unplanned second economy grew up alongside the planned one at low levels providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965119 workers of the salihorsk potash plant belarus 1968 although statistics of the soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely127128 by most accounts the economy continued to expand until the mid1980s during the 1950s and 1960s the soviet economy experienced comparatively high growth and was catching up to the west129 however after 1970 the growth while still positive steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock the rate of increase in capital was only surpassed by japan119 overall between 1960 and 1989 the growth rate of per capita income in the soviet union was slightly above the world average based on 102 countriescitation needed according to stanley fischer and william easterly growth could have been faster by their calculation per capita income of soviet union in 1989 should have been twice as high as it was considering the amount of investment education and population the authors attribute this poor performance to low productivity of capital in the soviet union130 steven rosenfielde states that the standard of living actually declined as a result of stalins despotism and while there was a brief improvement following his death lapsed into stagnation131 in 1987 mikhail gorbachev tried to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika his policies relaxed state control over enterprises but did not yet allow it to be replaced by market incentives ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in production output the economy already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues started to collapse prices were still fixed and property was still largely stateowned until after the dissolution of the soviet union119126 for most of the period after world war ii up to its collapse the soviet economy was the second largest in the world by gdp ppp and was 3rd in the world during the middle of the 1980s to 1989132 though in per capita terms the soviet gdp was behind that of the first world countries133 when compared to countries who had a similar gdp per capita to the soviet union in 1928 the soviets experienced significant growth134 in 1990 the soviet union had a human development index of 0920 placing them in the high category of human development they had the third highest in the eastern bloc behind czechoslovakia and east germany and the twentyfifth highest in the world out of one hundredthirty countries in total135 energy main article energy policy of the soviet union soviet

1970s to the 1980s136 both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product at the start this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975 from 1975 and 1980 it grew even slowerclarification needed only 26 percent137 david wilson a historian believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of soviet fuel production by the end of the century his theory did not come to fruition because of the ussrs collapse138 the ussr in theory would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2–25 percent during the 1990s because of soviet energy fieldsclarification needed139 however the energy sector faced many difficulties among them the countrys high military expenditure and hostile relations with the first world pregorbachev era140 in 1991 the soviet union had a pipeline network of 82000 kilometres 51000 mi for crude oil and another 206500 kilometres 128300 mi for natural gas141 petroleum and petroleumbased products natural gas metals wood agricultural products and a variety of manufactured goods primarily machinery arms and military equipment were exported142 in the 1970s and 1980s the soviet union heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard currency123 at its peak in 1988 it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of crude oil surpassed only by saudi arabia143 science and technology main article science and technology in the soviet union soviet stamp showing the orbit of sputnik 1 the soviet union placed great emphasis on science and technology within its economy144 however the most remarkable soviet successes in technology such as producing the worlds first space satellite typically were the responsibility of the military125 lenin believed that the ussr would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding soviet authorities proved their commitment to lenins belief by developing massive networks research and development organizations in the early 1960s the soviets awarded 40 of chemistry phds to women compared to only 5 who received such a degree in the united states145 by 1989 soviet scientists were among the worlds besttrained specialists in several areas such as energy physics selected areas of medicine mathematics welding and military technologies due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy the soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry biology and computers when compared to the first world project socrates under the reagan administration determined that the soviet union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the us was using in the case of the us economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors in contrast the soviet union was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology while preventing the us from acquiring a competitive advantage however in addition the soviet unions technologybased planning was executed in a centralized governmentcentric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility it was this significant lack of flexibility that was exploited by the us to undermine the strength of the soviet union and thus foster its reform146147148 transport main article transport in the soviet union aeroflots flag during the soviet era transport was a key component of the nations economy the economic centralization of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale most notably the establishment of aeroflot an aviation enterprise149 the country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land water and air141 however due to bad maintenance much of the road water and soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the first world150 soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world150 it was also better developed than most of its western counterparts151 by the late 1970s and early 1980s soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burden from the railways and to improve the soviet government budget152 the street network and automotive industry153 remained underdeveloped154 and dirt roads were common outside major cities155 soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had by the earlytomid1980s the soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones155 meanwhile the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction156 the underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport157 despite improvements several aspects of the transport sector were stillwhen riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure lack of investment corruption and bad decisionmaking soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services the soviet merchant navy was one of the largest in the world141 demographics main article demographics of the soviet union population of the ussr red and the postsoviet states blue from 1961 to 2009 and projection dotted blue 2010 to 2100 excess deaths over the course of world war i and the russian civil war including the postwar famine amounted to a combined total of 18 million158 some 10 million in the 1930s34 and more than 26 million in 1941–5 the postwar soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if prewar demographic growth had continued46 according to catherine merridale reasonable estimate would place the total number of excess deaths for the whole period somewhere around 60 million159 the birth rate of the ussr decreased from 440 per thousand in 1926 to 180 in 1974 largely due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages the mortality rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well – from 237 per thousand in 1926 to 87 in 1974 in general the birth rates of the southern republics in transcaucasia and central asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the soviet union and in some cases even increased in the post–world war ii period a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics160 soviet europe moved towards subreplacement fertility while soviet central asia continued to exhibit population growth well above replacementlevel fertility161 the late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the ussr and was especially notable among men of working age but was also prevalent in russia and other predominantly slavic areas of the country162 an analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late1970s and the early 1980s adult mortality began to improve again163 the infant mortality rate increased from 247 in 1970 to 279 in 1974 some researchers regarded the rise as largely real a consequence of worsening health conditions and services164 the rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by soviet officials and the soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late1980s when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real causes165 education main article education in the soviet union soviet pupils in milovice czechoslovakia now czech republic 1985 anatoly lunacharsky became the first peoples commissar for education of soviet russia at the beginning the soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy people who were literate were automatically hired as teacherscitation needed for a short period quality was sacrificed for quantity by 1940 joseph stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated throughout the 1930s social mobility rose sharply which has been attributed to soviet reforms in education166 in the aftermath of the great patriotic war the countrys educational system expanded dramatically this expansion had a tremendous effect in the 1960s nearly all soviet children had access to education the only exception being those living in remote areas nikita khrushchev tried to make education more accessible making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society education also became important in giving rise to the new man167 citizens directly entering the work force had the constitutional right to a job and to free vocational training the countrys system of education was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens with affirmative action for applicants from nations associated with cultural backwardness however as part of the general antisemitic policy an unofficial jewish quota was applied in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations168169170171 the brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local komsomol party secretary172 according to statistics from 1986 the number of higher education students per the population of 10000 was 181 for the ussr compared to 517 for the us173 ethnic groups people in samarkand uzbek ssr 1981 svaneti man in mestia georgian ssr 1929 the soviet union was a very ethnically diverse country with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups the total population was estimated at 293 million in 1991 according to a 1990 estimate the majority were russians 5078 followed by ukrainians 1545 and uzbeks 584174 all citizens of the ussr had their own ethnic affiliation the ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen175 by the childs parents if the parents did not agree the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father partly due to soviet policies some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones such as the mingrelians of georgia who were classified with the linguistically related georgians176 some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated while others were brought in by force russians belarusians and ukrainians shared close cultural ties while other groups did not with multiple nationalities living in the same territory ethnic antagonisms developed over the years177neutrality is disputed ethnographic map of the soviet union 1941

distribution of muslims within the soviet union in 1979 health main article health care in the soviet union an early sovietera poster discouraging unsafe abortion practices in 1917 before the revolution health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries as lenin later noted either the lice will defeat socialism or socialism will defeat the lice178 the soviet principle of health care was conceived by the peoples commissariat for health in 1918 health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge this at the time being a revolutionary concept article 42 of the 1977 soviet constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the ussr before leonid brezhnev became general secretary the healthcare system of the soviet union was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists this changed however from brezhnevs accession and mikhail gorbachevs tenure as leader the soviet health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision179 minister of health yevgeniy chazov during the 19th congress of the communist party of the soviet union while highlighting such soviet successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world recognized the systems areas for improvement and felt that billions of soviet rubles were squandered180 after the socialist revolution the life expectancy for all age groups went up this statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system these improvements continued into the 1960s when the life expectancy in the soviet union surpassed that of the united states it remained stable during most years although in the 1970s it went down slightly possibly because of alcohol abuse at the same time infant mortality began to rise after 1974 the government stopped publishing statistics on this this trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the asian part of the country where infant mortality was highest while declining markedly in the more developed european part of the soviet union181 the ussr had several centers of excellence such as the fyodorov eye microsurgery complex founded in 1988 by russian eye surgeon svyatoslav fyodorov language main article languages of the soviet union the soviet government headed by vladimir lenin gave small language groups their own writing systems182 the development of these writing systems was very successful even though some flaws were detected during the later days of the ussr countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies a serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other183 when a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication that language would attain official language status there were many minority languages which never received their own writing system therefore their speakers were forced to have a second language184 there are examples where the soviet government retreated from this policy most notable under stalins regime where education was discontinued in languages which were not widespread enough these languages were then assimilated into another language mostly russian185 during the great patriotic war some minority languages were banned and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy186 as the most widely spoken of the soviet unions many languages russian de facto functioned as an official language as the language of interethnic communication russian язык межнационального общения but only assumed the de jure status as the official national language in 1990187 religion main article religion in the soviet union the cathedral of christ the saviour moscow during its demolition in 1931 christianity and islam had the greatest number of adherents among the soviet states religious citizens188 eastern christianity predominated among christians with russias traditional russian orthodox church being the soviet unions largest christian denomination about 90 percent of the soviet unions muslims were sunnis with shias concentrated in azerbaijan188 smaller groups included roman catholics jews buddhists and a variety of protestant denominations188 religious influence had been strong in the russian empire the russian orthodox church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions189 the immediate period following the establishment of the soviet state included a struggle against the orthodox church which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former ruling classes190 in soviet law the freedom to hold religious services was constitutionally guaranteed although the ruling communist party regarded religion as incompatible with the marxist spirit of scientific materialism190 in practice the soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right and in fact utilized a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups190 the 1918 council of peoples commissars decree establishing the russian soviet federative socialist republic rsfsr as a secular state also decreed that the teaching of religion in all places where subjects of general instruction are taught is forbidden citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately191 among further restrictions those adopted in 1929 a halfdecade into stalins rule included express prohibitions on a range of church activities including meetings for organized bible study190 both christian and nonchristian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s by 1940 as many as 90 percent of the churches synagogues and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed192 soviet stamp saint sophias cathedral kiev and statue of bohdan khmelnytsky 1989 convinced that religious antisovietism had become a thing of the past with most soviet christians and with the looming threat of war the stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s193 soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during the soviet war with nazi germany amid other accommodations to religious faith after nazi germany attacked the soviet union churches were reopened radio moscow began broadcasting a religious hour and a historic meeting between stalin and orthodox church leader patriarch sergius of moscow was held in 1943 stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the soviet union even through the late 1980s193 the general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths194 the soviet establishment under general secretary nikita khrushchevs leadership clashed with the churches in 1958–1964 a period when atheism was emphasized in the educational curriculum and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views193 during this period the number of churches fell from 20000 to 10000 from 1959 to 1965 and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97195 the number of working mosques also declined falling from 1500 to 500 within a decade195 religious institutions remained monitored by the soviet government but churches synagogues temples and mosques were all given more leeway in the brezhnev era196 official relations between the orthodox church and the soviet government again warmed to the point that the brezhnev government twice honored orthodox patriarch alexy i with the order of the red banner of labour197 a poll conducted by soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20 percent of the soviet population as active religious believers198 culture main article culture of the soviet union see also soviet cuisine and fashion in the soviet union the enthusiasts march a 1930s song famous in the soviet union soviet singersongwriter poet and actor vladimir vysotsky in 1979 young pioneers in the second building of the moscow railway museum 1984 the culture of the soviet union passed through several stages during the ussrs 69year existence during the first eleven years following the revolution 1918–1929 there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive soviet style of art lenin wanted art to be accessible to the russian people on the other hand hundreds of intellectuals writers and artists were exiled or executed and their work banned for example nikolay gumilyov shot for alleged conspiring against the bolshevik regime and yevgeny zamyatin banned199 the government encouraged a variety of trends in art and literature numerous schools some traditional and others radically experimental proliferated communist writers maxim gorky and vladimir mayakovsky were active during this time film as a means of influencing a largely illiterate society received encouragement from the state much of director sergei eisensteins best work dates from this period later during stalins rule soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the governmentimposed style of socialist realism with all other trends being severely repressed with rare exceptions for example mikhail bulgakovs works many writers were imprisoned and killed200 following the khrushchev thaw of the late 1950s and early 1960s censorship was diminished during this time a distinctive period of soviet culture developed characterized by conformist public life and intense focus on personal life greater experimentation in art forms were again permissible with the result that more sophisticated and subtly critical work began to be produced the regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism thus for instance many protagonists of the novels of author yury trifonov concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism an underground dissident literature known as samizdat developed during this late period in architecture the khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of stalins epoch in the second half of the 1980s gorbachevs policies of perestroika and glasnost significantly expanded freedom of expression throughout the soviet union in the media press201 sport see also voluntary sports societies of the soviet union cska moscow soviet union at the olympics and soviet union mens national ice hockey team valeri

countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur as it put the selffinanced amateurs of the western countries at a disadvantage the soviet union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students soldiers or working in a profession but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a fulltime basis202 nevertheless the ioc held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism203 a 1989 report by a committee of the australian senate claimed that there is hardly a medal winner at the moscow games certainly not a gold medal winnerwho is not on one sort of drug or another usually several kinds the moscow games might well have been called the chemists games204 a member of the ioc medical commission manfred donike privately ran additional tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to epitestosterone in urine twenty percent of the specimens he tested including those from sixteen gold medalists would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official the results of donikes unofficial tests later convinced the ioc to add his new technique to their testing protocols205 the first documented case of blood doping occurred at the 1980 summer olympics as a runner was transfused with two pints of blood before winning medals in the 5000 m and 10000 m206 documents obtained in 2016 revealed the soviet unions plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 summer olympics in los angeles dated prior to the countrys decision to boycott the games the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program along with suggestions for further enhancements the communication directed to the soviet unions head of track and field was
