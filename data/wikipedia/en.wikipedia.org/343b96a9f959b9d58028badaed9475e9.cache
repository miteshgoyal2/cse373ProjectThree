external links biographyedit early yearsedit rodney temperton was born in cleethorpes lincolnshire on 9 october 19492 interviewed for the bbc radio 2 documentary the invisible man the rod temperton story temperton said that he was a musician from an early age my father wasnt the kind of person whod read you a story before you went off to sleep – he used to put a transistor radio in the crib right on the pillow and id go to sleep listening to radio luxembourg and i think that had an influence3 temperton attended de aston grammar school market rasen4 and he formed a group for the schools music competitions he was a drummer at this time id get in the living room with my snare drum and my cymbal and play along to the bbc test card which was all kinds of music theyd be playing continuously5 on leaving school he started working for ross frozen foods in grimsby lincolnshire2 heatwaveedit he soon became a fulltime musician as a keyboard player and played in several dance bands this took him to worms in germany in 1974 he answered an advert in melody maker placed by johnnie wilder jr and as a result became a member of the funk and disco band heatwave which wilder was putting together at the time he was the first british guy that i had ever met personally he spoke kind of funny but he had a good sense of humour and he was a very friendly guy after meeting him and then seeing him play i kind of determined he was a good enough player and entertainer and i just knew he would fit in the group said wilder3 temperton played wilder tunes he had been composing i was very interested because we were doing a lot of cover tunes – we werent doing a lot of original material – i was really interested the songs provided material for 1976s too hot to handle including boogie nights which broke the band in britain and the united states and the ballad always and forever – both tracks were millionsellers in the us67 despite the slick american sound tempertons working surroundings were still far from glamorous alan kirk a yorkshire musician with jimmy james and the vagabonds who toured with heatwave in the mid 1970s remembered the always and forever track was written on a wurlitzer piano at the side of a pile of pungent washing – sorry to disappoint all the romantics and producer barry blue recalled he had a very small flat so everything had to be done within one room and he had piles of washing and had the tv on top of the organ it was a nightmare he had trams running outside but he made it he just absorbed himself in the music and rod seemed to come up with these amazing songs3 in 1977 heatwave followed up the success of their first album with their second central heating barry blue again producing and temperton behind the majority of the songs it included the groove line another international hit single in 1978 temperton decided to concentrate on writing and left heatwave though he continued to write for the band8 songs written for michael jacksonedit tempertons work attracted the attention of quincy jones and he asked his engineer bruce swedien to check out the heatwave album holy cow i simply loved rods musical feeling – everything about it – rods arrangements his tunes his songs – was exceedingly hip recalled swedien also calling temperton the most disciplined pop music composer ive ever met when he comes to the studio every musical detail is written down or accounted for in rods mind he never stops until he feels confident that the music were working on is able to stand on its own9 in 1979 temperton was
