1950s–1960s 3 1970s 4 1980s 5 1990s 6 2000s 7 2010s 8 see also 9 notes 10 references 11 external links early teen idolsedit 1930 caricature of rudy vallée the first known person to have been treated as a teen idol was franz liszt the hungarian pianist who in the 1840s drew such a following among young women that the term lisztomania soon came to describe the phenomenon the kind of idolizing following liszt drew in europe would not be followed for several decades geraldine farrar american opera singer had a large following of young women nicknamed gerryflappers in the early 20th century45 rudy vallée who became a major success in 1929 with hits like honey and deep night may have been the first american popular singer to have been idolised by hundreds of teenaged girls at soldout concerts he was also possibly the first popular singer to have a star vehicle created for him the vagabond lover frank sinatra whose early career is often linked to his appeal to bobby soxers3 is also regarded as having been amongst the first teen idols 1950s–1960sedit the great success of young rock stars like elvis presley and pat boone film stars like marlon brando paul newman james dean tab hunter and sal mineo in the 1950s as well as the wider emergence of youth subcultures led promoters to the deliberate creation of teen idols such as singers frankie avalon fabian forte frankie lymon and connie stevens even crooners like dean martin and frank sinatra were still considered idols and rather handsome actors edd byrnes and troy donahue and other artists deliberately cultivated a safer idol image like paul anka anka initially modelled himself on a particular generic type the teen idol who carried on the process of changing the image of male youth from wild to mild by providing a cleaner more wholesome image of masculinity than that of the previous eras rebellious rockabilly heroes and workingclass socalled juvenile delinquents like those in west side story — 6 portable phonograph postwar teens were able to buy relatively inexpensive phonographs — including portable models that could be carried to friends houses — and the new 45rpm singles rock music played on 45s became the soundtrack to the 1960s as people bought what they heard on the radio the great majority of the music being marketed to 1950s teens was being written by adults but 1960s teens were increasingly appreciating and emulating artists closer to their own age to teen fashion and to lyrics which addressed their own concerns their parents worried about their attraction to artists and djs who were edgy and rebellious faces on magazines fed fans fans buy records see films watch tv and buy fashions marketing of the teen idol generally focuses on the image the teen idol is structured to appeal to the preteen and young teen female pop audience member and children in general they are commodified in forms and images that are relatively nonthreatening to this young audience and to the ancillary market of parents the teen idol never appears to be autonomous and therefore never appears to be threatening as an adult he remains as long as he is popular perpetually childlike and dependent — 7 teen idols of the 1950s include elvis presley fabian forte tommy sands and ricky nelson as pictured some marketers turned to film and tv for fresh attractive safe faces tommy sandss debut in a television film about the phenomenon the idol made a teen idol out of sands himself ricky nelson a performer of rockabilly music also became a teen idol through his parents television series the adventures of ozzie and harriet8 some young tv stars were being hustled into studios to make recordings for example exmousketeer annette funicello became one of the first big female idols as well as the lennon sisters whom had cut out dolls and were always on the covers of the gossip magazines another johnny crawford of the rifleman had five top40 hits3 in 1963 luke halpin made a big splash as a teen idol in the television program flipper after bye bye birdie was released in 1963 bobby rydell became an instant teen idol in the 1960s as situation comedies and dramas on television using child actors became more popular actors paul petersen patty petersen and shelley fabares from the donna reed show dwayne hickman from the many loves of dobie gillis sally field of gidget jon provost of lassie jay north from dennis the menace billy mumy of lost in space and later of novelty group barnes and barnes sajid khan of maya and keith and kevin schultz known as the schultz twins on the monroes all became younger preteen idols and grew into being teen idols likewise tommy steele the beatles with beatlemania the rolling stones and the beach boys were teen idols especially during the earlier part of their careers although they quickly grew out of that status the rolling stones did it through a more rebellious image the beatles did it through their more developed or grown up music similarly neil sedaka had two distinct eras of his career with about a decade in between one as a teen idol in the 1960s and a later career in adult contemporary music from the family band the cowsills susan cowsill john cowsill and barry cowsill became teen idols and were on teen magazine covers for many years the tv show the partridge family was written in their likenesscitation needed many of the teen idols of the era were the sons of older established stars dino desi billy were active as teen idols during the midsixties the group included desi arnaz jr son of bandleader desi arnaz dean paul martin son of singer dean martin and billy hinsche a mutual friend whose parents were not famous gary lewis son of comedian jerry lewis fronted the playboys during this era all of the monkees became instant teen idols in the late 1960s after their tv show became an overnight success especially for micky dolenz and davy jones the british born member of the monkees davy jones was regularly featured in all time teen idol lists in 2008 yahoo music named jones the number one teen idol of all time9 and in 2009 he was ranked second in a list compiled by fox news10 davy jones still to this day tends to win many number ones and the top of the list in best teen idol contests 1965 saw tiger beat magazine an influential teen idols news magazine get published for the first time

success during this time frame the brady bunchs barry williams and christopher knight as was tennis proactor vincent van patten all were constantly in the fan magazines at the time actors richard thomas robby benson peter barton leif garrett mark lester janmichael vincent william katt and jack wild were the talk of the teenagers in the 1970s as well musicians the hudson brothers were on many teen magazine covers for a number of years as teen idols they had two shows on tv during the 1970s and recorded many albums one of the features of many teen idols is that their fans and in some cases the musicians themselves tend to develop a distaste for the music once they became adults and it is not much listened to by adults except for nostalgia the legacy of bubblegum pop teen idol performers in this category would include shaun cassidy leif garrett the osmond brothers particularly donny osmond and their teen idol sister marie osmond andy gibb tony defranco of the defranco family and the bay city rollers even modern classic hits and oldies outlets which cover this time period rarely play cuts from the teen idols of the era a notable exception is michael jackson of the jackson five who began his career as a teen idol along with his brothers but whose individual career eventually evolved far beyond the limitations of that description and into superstardom the jackson five were the first africanamerican music group to become national teen idols11 appearing alongside white idols in magazines such as 16 and tiger beat12 1980sedit in 1985 actress alyssa milano from whos the boss
