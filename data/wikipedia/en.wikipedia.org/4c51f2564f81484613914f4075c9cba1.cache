computer program designed to run on a mobile device such as a phonetablet or watch mobile applications often stand in contrast to desktop applications that run on desktop computers and with web applications which run in mobile web browsers rather than directly on the mobile device the term app is a shortening of the term software application it has become very popular and in 2010 was listed as word of the year by the american dialect society1 in 2009 technology columnist david pogue said that newer smartphones could be nicknamed app phones to distinguish them from earlier lesssophisticated smartphones2 contents 1 overview 2 development 3 distribution 31 google play 32 app store 33 others 4 enterprise management 41 app wrapping vs native app management 5 see also 6 references 7 external links overview most such devices are sold with several apps bundled as preinstalled software such as a web browser email client calendar mapping program and an app for buying music or other media or more apps some preinstalled apps can be removed by an ordinary uninstall process thus leaving more storage space for desired ones where the software does not allow this some devices can be rooted to eliminate the undesired apps apps that are not preinstalled are usually available through distribution platforms called app stores they began appearing in 2008 and are typically operated by the owner of the mobile operating system such as the apple app store google play windows phone store and blackberry app world however there are independent app stores such as cydia getjar and fdroid some apps are free while others must be bought usually they are downloaded from the platform to a target device but sometimes they can be downloaded to laptops or desktop computers for apps with a price generally a percentage 2030 goes to the distribution provider such as itunes and the rest goes to the producer of the app3 the same app can therefore cost a different price depending on the mobile platform apps can also be installed manually for example by running an android application package on android devices the official us army iphone app presents the services technology news updates and media in a single place mobile apps were originally offered for general productivity and information retrieval including email calendar contacts stock market and weather information however public demand and the availability of developer tools drove rapid expansion into other categories such as those handled by desktop application software packages as with other software the explosion in number and variety of apps made discovery a challenge which in turn led to the creation of a wide range of review recommendation and curation sources including blogs magazines and dedicated online appdiscovery services in 2014 government regulatory agencies began trying to regulate and curate apps particularly medical apps4 some companies offer apps as an alternative method to deliver content with certain advantages over an official website usage of mobile apps has become increasingly prevalent across mobile phone users5 a may 2012 comscore study reported that during the previous quarter more mobile subscribers used apps than browsed the web on their devices 511 vs 498 respectively6 researchers found that usage of mobile apps strongly correlates with user context and depends on users location and time of the day7 mobile apps are playing an everincreasing role within healthcare and when designed and integrated correctly can yield many benefits89 market research firm gartner predicted that 102 billion apps would be downloaded in 2013 91 of them free which would generate 26 billion in the us up 444 on 2012s us18 billion10 by q2 2015 the google play and apple stores alone generated 5 billion an analyst report estimates that the app economy creates revenues of more than €10 billion per year within the european union while over 529000 jobs have been created in 28 eu states due to the growth of the app market11 development developers at work main article mobile application development developing apps for mobile devices requires considering the constraints and features of these devices mobile devices run on battery and have less powerful processors than personal computers and also have more features such as location detection and cameras developers also have to consider a wide array of screen sizes hardware specifications and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms although these issues can be overcome with mobile device detection mobile application development requires use of specialized integrated development environments mobile apps are first tested within the development environment using emulators and later subjected to field testing emulators provide an inexpensive way to test applications on mobile phones to which developers may not have physical accesscitation needed mobile user interface ui design is also essential mobile ui considers constraints and contexts screen input and mobility as outlines for design the user is often the focus of interaction with their device and the interface entails components of both hardware and software user input allows for the users to manipulate a system and devices output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users manipulation mobile ui design constraints include limited attention and form factors such as a mobile devices screen size for a users hand mobile ui contexts signal cues from user activity such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within a mobile application overall mobile ui designs goal is primarily for an understandable userfriendly interface mobile uis or frontends rely on mobile backends to support access to enterprise systems the mobile backend facilitates data routing security authentication authorization working offline and service orchestration this functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components including mobile app servers mobile backend as a service mbaas and soa infrastructure conversational interfaces display the computer interface and present interactions through text instead of graphic elements they emulate conversations with real humans12 there are two main types of conversational interfaces voice assistants like the amazon echo and chatbots12 conversational interfaces are growing particularly practical as users are starting to feel overwhelmed with mobile apps a term known as “app fatigue”1314 david limp amazon’s senior vice president of devices says in an interview with bloomberg “we believe the next big platform is voice”15 distribution see also list of mobile software distribution platforms the two biggest app stores are google play for android and app store for ios google play main article google play google play formerly known as the android market is an international online software store developed by google for android devices it opened in october 200816 in july 2013 the number of apps downloaded via the google play store

available which had been downloaded by 200 million ios users1920 during apples 2012 worldwide developers conference ceo tim cook announced that the app store has 650000 available apps to download as well as 30 billion apps downloaded from the app store until that date21 from an alternative perspective figures seen in july 2013 by the bbc from tracking service adeven indicate over twothirds of

product line under the nokia brand24 and ovi store was renamed nokia store in october 201125 nokia store will no longer allow developers to publish new apps or app updates for its legacy symbian and meego operating systems from january 201426 windows phone store was introduced by microsoft for its windows phone platform which was launched in october 2010 as of october 2012update it has over 120000 apps available27 windows store was introduced by microsoft for its windows 8 and windows rt platforms while it can also carry listings for traditional desktop programs certified for compatibility with windows 8 it is primarily used to distribute windows store apps—which are primarily built for use on tablets and other touchbased devices but can still be used with a keyboard and mouse and on desktop computers and laptops2829 samsung apps was introduced in september 200930 as of october 2011 samsung apps reached 10 million downloads the store is available in 125 countries and it offers apps for windows mobile android and bada platforms the electronic appwrapper was the first electronic distribution service to collectively provide encryption and purchasing electronically31 fdroid — free and open source android app repository there are numerous other independent app stores for android devices enterprise management main article mobile application management mobile application management mam describes software and services responsible for provisioning and controlling access to internally developed and commercially available mobile apps used in business settings the strategy is meant to offset the security risk of a bring your own device byod work strategy when an employee brings a personal device into an enterprise setting mobile application management enables the corporate it staff to transfer required applications control access to business data and remove locally cached business data from the device if it is lost or when its owner no longer works with the company containerization is an alternate byod security solution rather than controlling an employees entire device containerization apps create isolated and secure pockets separate from all personal data company control of the device only extends to that separate container32 app wrapping vs native app management especially when employees bring your own device mobile apps can be a significant security risk for businesses because they transfer unprotected sensitive data to the internet without knowledge and consent of the users reports of stolen corporate data show how quickly corporate and personal data can fall into the wrong hands data theft is not just the loss of confidential information but makes companies vulnerable to attack and blackmail33 professional mobile application management helps companies protect their data one option for securing corporate data is app wrapping but there also are some disadvantages like copyright infringement or the loss of warranty rights functionality productivity and user experience are particularly limited under app wrapping the policies of a wrapped app cant be changed if required it must be recreated from scratch adding cost3435 an app wrapper is a mobile app made wholly from an existing website or platform36 with few or no changes made to the underlying application the wrapper is essentially a new management layer that allows developers to set up usage policies appropriate for app use36 examples of these policies include whether or not authentication is required allowing data to be stored on the device and enablingdisabling file sharing between users3738 because most app wrappers are often websites first they often do not align with ios or android developer guidelines alternatively it is possible to offer native apps securely through enterprise mobility management without limiting the native user experience this enables more flexible it management as apps can be easily implemented and policies adjusted at any time39 see also enterprise mobile application mobile commerce app store optimization references app voted 2010 word of the year by the american dialect society updated american dialect
