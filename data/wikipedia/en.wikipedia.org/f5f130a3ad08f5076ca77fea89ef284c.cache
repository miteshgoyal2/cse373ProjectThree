after the great seattle fire of june 6 1889 seattle began reconstruction of the citys central business district under a new building code requiring the use of fireproof materials such as stone and brick by the end of 1890 465 buildings had been built completing the initial phase of reconstruction and city boosters looked to build modern highrise buildings after the infusion of new money from the klondike gold rush later that decade89 the pioneer building whose observation tower surpassed 110 feet 34 m was completed in 1892 and is regarded as the citys first modern highrise building1011 the alaska building completed in 1904 and rising 203 feet 62 m above 2nd avenue in pioneer square is considered to be seattles first skyscraper and first steelframed highrise building it held the title of tallest habitable building in the city until the completion of the 205foot 62 m 18story hoge building in 19111213 both buildings had been surpassed in height by the clocktower of king street station opened in 1906 which stands 245 feet 75 m tall14 seattles continued growth at the turn of the century bolstered by the hosting of the alaska–yukon–pacific exposition in 1909 and the opening of the metropolitan tract to development led to a building boom north of yesler way in the modernday downtown15 on july 4 1914 firearm and typewriter magnate lyman cornelius smith opened the 484foottall 148 m smith tower the citys new tallest building for several years the 38story tower would hold the title of tallest west of the mississippi river and dominate the seattle skyline16 by the end of the 1920s building boom several new art deco highrises above 200 feet 61 m were completed in seattle including the medical dental building 1925 seattle tower 1930 roosevelt hotel 1929 washington athletic club 1930 textile tower building 1930 harborview medical center 1931 and pacific tower 19331 new highrise construction in seattle was halted during the great depression and world war ii and slowed during the postwar economic boom in the 1950s as suburbanization took hold in the region15 the first new building in downtown to be built after the war was the norton building in 1959 a 19story office building in the international style with a glass curtain wall and simple exterior features a departure from the previous neogothic and art deco styles used in highrises1017 seattle was selected to host the worlds fair in 1962 revitalizing the downtown area and bringing the construction of the fairgrounds centerpiece the space needle the 605foot 184 m observation tower became the symbol of the fair and a landmark for seattle and was the first new structure to surpass the smith tower in height1518 an aerial view of downtown seattle looking north in 1969 after the completion of the 50story seafirst building the 50story seafirst building now safeco plaza became the citys tallest when it opened in 1969 standing 630 feet 190 m and signalling the start of a major construction boom in downtown seattle110 the boom would last well into the 1980s despite an economic downturn caused by the boeing bust and 1970s energy crisis and introduce elements of modernist and postmodern architecture to highrise construction in the city19 during this period 15 skyscrapers taller than 400 feet 122 m in height were constructed in seattlecitation needed including 901 fifth avenue 1973 the wells fargo center 1973 the henry m jackson federal building 1974 1600 seventh avenue 1976 rainier tower 1977 1111 third avenue 1980 800 fifth avenue 1981 union square 1981 and 1989 and the westin building115 in 1984 the 76story 943foot 287 m columbia center was completed becoming the tallest building in seattle and on the west coast of the united states110 during the 1980s the suburb of bellevue emerged as an urban center boasting a skyline of its own that would continue to grow well into the 21st century20 the downtown seattle skyline in 1986 viewed from elliott bay the boom of the 1980s was capped by the columbia center and other downtown towers such as 1000 second avenue 1987 1201 third avenue 1988 the us bank centre 1989 and the gateway tower 1990115 with new downtown office space in the decade surpassing what had been built over the previous 100 years in seattle21 the new wave of development sparked fears of manhattanization in downtown that would push out lowerincome residents and reduce quality of life1022 a downtown land use plan adopted in 1984 and shelved until 1986 required the addition of public benefits for major construction projects opposition to the new downtown plan which would allow generous new construction unhindered by a height limit23 led to the creation of the citizens alternative plan which would limit buildings to 450 feet 140 m and restrict development to an annual limit of 1 million square feet 93000 m2 of space per year the plan was approved by voters as a ballot initiative on may 16 1989 replacing the land use plan and introduced the citys modern design review process for new development102425 development of new highrises slowed down across us cities during the early 1990s recession as demand caught up to an overbuilt market26 with seattles 1980s office buildings suffering from a lack of tenants that forced ownership changes or the threat of bankruptcy and foreclosure27 by 1992 vacancy rates for office space in downtown seattle reached 147 percent while vacancy rates in outlying suburbs remained much lower28 the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s including a local economy boosted by boeing and microsoft led a cut of the vacancy rate to 6 percent by 199729 between 1997 and 1999 new office buildings created an average of 15 million square feet 140000 m2 of additional office space per year30 after the burst of the dotcom bubble and the early 2000s recession downtown office vacancies shot up from 1 percent to 13 percent by the end of 200131 two major downtown projects the idx tower 2003 and wamu center 2006 were completed during the early 2000s and were the first office buildings to be built since the key tower in 199032 by the mid2000s office vacancies in downtown seattle improved to below 10 percent but office developers were hesitant to break ground on new projects3334 a new downtown zoning plan adopted in 2006 effectively repealed the 1989 citizens alternative plan and its modified 540foot 160 m height limit favoring unlimited heights in downtown and 400foot 120 m residential towers on the periphery of downtown35 the new zoning plan set off a wave of highrise residential development in the late 2000s including the completion of fifteen twentyone second avenue 2008 escala 2009 and olive 8 2009 coming at the peak of the united states housing bubble and the demand for downtown luxury condominiums before the great recession3637 during the great recession downtown office vacancies rose to a record 21 percent by the beginning of 201038 but dropped to 10 percent by 201339 the downturn was partially blamed on the collapse of washington mutual which employed 3500 in its downtown offices40 the surge in demand for office space revived several proposed downtown highrise office projects including the mark and madison centre both exceeding 500 feet 150 m in height and planned to open in 201741 other planned office and mixeduse buildings in downtown seattle include 2u the stalled civic square project and the rainier square tower proposed to be the citys secondtallest building at 850 feet 260 m142 since 2010 developers have also proposed highrise residential buildings in downtown
