edward f noyes 1 joseph roswell hawley 1 the platformedit the platform significantly so in the first section boasted of the partys achievements since it had attained power in 1861 the republican party of the united states assembled in national convention in the city of philadelphia on the 5th and 6th days of june 1872 again declares its faith appeals to its history and announces its position upon the questions before the country first during eleven years of supremacy it has accepted with grand courage the solemn duties of the time it suppressed a gigantic rebellion emancipated four millions of slaves decreed the equal citizenship of all and established universal suffrage exhibiting unparalleled magnanimity it criminally punished no man for political offenses and warmly welcomed all who proved loyalty by obeying the laws and dealing justly with their neighbors it has steadily decreased with firm hand the resultant disorders of a great war and initiated a wise and humane policy toward the indians the pacific railroad and similar vast enterprises have been generously aided and successfully conducted the public lands freely given to actual settlers immigration protected and encouraged and a full acknowledgment of the naturalized citizens rights secured from european powers a uniform national currency has been provided repudiation frowned down the national credit sustained under the most extraordinary burdens and new bonds negotiated at lower rates the revenues have been carefully collected and honestly applied despite large annual reductions of the rates of taxation the public debt has been reduced during general grants presidency at the rate of a hundred millions a year great financial crises have been avoided and peace and plenty prevail throughout the land menacing foreign difficulties have been peacefully and honorably composed and the honor and power of the nation kept in high respect throughout the world this glorious record of the past is the partys best pledge for the future we believe the people will not in trust the government to any party or combination of men composed chiefly of those who have resisted every step of this beneficent progress second the recent amendments to the national constitution should be cordially sustained because they are right not merely tolerated because they are laws and should be carried out according to their spirit by appropriate legislation the enforcement of which can safely be entrusted only to the party that secured those amendments third complete liberty and exact equality in the enjoyment of all civil political and public rights should be established and effectually maintained throughout the union by efficient and appropriate state and federal legislation neither the law nor its administration should admit any discrimination in respect of citizens by reason of race creed color or previous condition of servitude fourth the national government should seek to maintain honorable peace with all nations protecting its citizens everywhere and sympathizing with all peoples who strive for greater liberty fifth any system of the civil service under which the subordinate positions of the government are considered rewards for mere party zeal is fatally demoralizing and we therefore for a reform of the system by laws which shall abolish the evils of patronage and make honesty efficiency and fidelity the essential qualifications for public positions without practically creating a lifetenure of office sixth we are opposed to further grants of public lands to corporations and monopolies and demand that the national domain be set apart for free homes and people seventh the annual revenue after paying current expenditures pensions and the interest on the public debt should furnish a moderate balance for the reduction of the principal and that revenue except so much as may be derived from a tax upon tobacco and liquors should be raised by duties upon importations the details of which should be so adjusted as to aid in securing remunerative wages to labor and to promote the industries prosperity and growth of the whole country eight we hold in undying honor the soldiers and sailors whose valor saved the union their pensions are a sacred debt of the nation and the widows and orphans of those who died for their country are entitled to the care of a generous and grateful people we favor such additional legislation as will extend the bounty of the government to all our soldiers and sailors who were honorably discharged and who in the line of duty became disabled without regard to the length of service or the cause of such discharge nine the doctrine of great britain and other european powers concerning allegiance once a subject always a subject having at last through the efforts of the republican party been abandoned and the american idea of the individuals right to transfer allegiance having been accepted by european nations it is the duty of our government to guard with jealous care the rights of adopted citizens against the assumption of unauthorized claims by their former governments and we urge continued careful encouragement and protection of voluntary immigration tenth the franking privilege ought to be abolished and the way prepared for a speedy reduction in the rates of postage eleventh among the questions which press for attention is that which concerns the relations of capital and labor and the republican party recognizes the duty of so shaping legislation as to secure full protection and amplest field for capital and for labor the creator of capital the largest opportunities and a just share of the mutual profits of these two great servants of civilization twelfth we hold that congress and the president have only fulfilled an imperative duty in their measures for the suppression of violent and treasonable organizations in certain lately rebellious regions and for the protection of the ballotbox and therefore they are entitled to the thanks of the nation thirteenth we denounce repudiation of the public debt in any form or disguise as a national crime we witness with pride the reduction of the principal of the debt and of the rates of interest upon the balance and confidently expect that our excellent national currency will be perfected by a speedy resumption of specie payment fourteenth the republican party is mindful of its obligations to the loyal women of america for their noble devotion to the cause of freedom their admission to wider fields of usefulness is viewed with satisfaction and the honest demand of any class of citizens for additional rights should be treated with respectful consideration fifteenth we heartily approve the action of congress in extending amnesty to those lately in rebellion and rejoice in the growth of peace and fraternal feeling throughout the land sixteenth the republican party proposes to respect the rights reserved by the people to themselves as carefully as the powers delegated by them to the state and to the federal government it disapproves of the resort to unconstitutional laws for the purpose of removing evil by interference with rights not surrendered by the people to either the state or national government seventeenth it is the duty of the general government to adopt such measures as may tend to encourage and restore american commerce and shipbuilding eighteenth we believe that the modest patriotism the earnest purpose the sound judgement the practical wisdom the incorruptible integrity and the illustrious services of ulysses s grant have commended him to the heart of the american people and with him at our head we start today upon a new march to victory nineteenth henry wilson nominated for the vicepresidency known to the whole land from the early days of the great struggle for liberty as an indefatigable laborer in all campaigns an incorruptible legislator and a representative man of
