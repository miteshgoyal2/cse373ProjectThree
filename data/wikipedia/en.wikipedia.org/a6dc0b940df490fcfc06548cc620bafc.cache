firms might derive royalties for the use of a patented technology from the retail price of the downstream licensed product16 in arab countries a royalty as a percentage of sales may be difficult to transact a flat fee may be preferred as percentages may be interpreted as percentage of profit17 trade markedit trade marks are words logos slogans sounds or other distinctive expressions that distinguish the source origin or sponsorship of a good or service in which they are generally known as service marks trade marks offer the public a means of identifying and assuring themselves of the quality of the good or service they may bring consumers a sense of security integrity belonging and a variety of intangible appeals the value that inures to a trade mark in terms of public recognition and acceptance is known as goodwill a trade mark right is an exclusive right to sell or market under that mark within a geographic territory the rights may be licensed to allow a company other than the owner to sell goods or services under the mark a company may seek to license a trade mark it did not create in order to achieve instant name recognition rather than accepting the cost and risk of entering the market under its own brand that the public does not necessarily know or accept licensing a trade mark allows the company to take advantage of alreadyestablished goodwill and brand identification like patent royalties trade mark royalties may be assessed and divided in a variety of different ways and are expressed as a percentage of sales volume or income or a fixed fee per unit sold when negotiating rates one way companies value a trade mark is to assess the additional profit they will make from increased sales and higher prices sometimes known as the relief from royalty method trade mark rights and royalties are often tied up in a variety of other arrangements trade marks are often applied to an entire brand of products and not just a single one because trade mark law has as a public interest goal of the protection of a consumer in terms of getting what they are paying for trade mark licences are only effective if the company owning the trade mark also obtains some assurance in return that the goods will meet its quality standards when the rights of trade mark are licensed along with a knowhow supplies pooled advertising etc the result is often a franchise relationship franchise relationships may not specifically assign royalty payments to the trade mark licence but may involve monthly fees and percentages of sales among other payments in a longrunning dispute in the united states involving the valuation of the dhl trade mark of dhl corporation18 it was reported that experts employed by the irs surveyed a wide range of businesses and found a broad range of royalties for trade mark use from a low of 01 to a high of 15 franchisesedit while a payment to employ a trade mark licence is a royalty it is accompanied by a guided usage manual the use of which may be audited from time to time however this becomes a supervisory task when the mark is used in a franchise agreement for the sale of goods or services carrying the reputation of the mark for a franchise it is said a fee is paid even though it comprises a royalty element to be a franchise the agreement must be a composite of the items the right to use a trade mark to offer sell or distribute goods or services the trademark element payment of a required royalty or fee the fee element significant assistance or control with respect to the franchisees business the supervisory element one of the above three items must not apply for the franchise agreement to be considered a trade mark agreement and its laws and conventions in a franchise for which there is no convention laws apply concerning training brand support operating systemssupport and technical support in a written format disclosure19 copyrightedit copyright law gives the owner the right to prevent others from copying creating derivative works or using their works copyrights like patent rights can be divided in many different ways by the right implicated by specific geographic or market territories or by more specific criteria each may be the subject of a separate license and royalty arrangements copyright royalties are often very specific to the nature of work and field of endeavor with respect to music royalties for performance rights in the united states are set by the library of congress copyright royalty board performance rights to recordings of a performance are usually managed by one of several performance rights organizations payments from these organizations to performing artists are known as residuals and performance royalties royaltyfree music provides more direct compensation to the artists in 1999 recording artists formed the recording artists coalition to repeal supposedly technical revisions to american copyright statutes which would have classified all sound recordings as works for hire effectively assigning artists copyrights to record labels2021 book authors may sell their copyright to the publisher alternatively they might receive as a royalty a certain amount per book sold it is common in the uk for example for authors to receive a 10 royalty on book sales some photographers and musicians may choose to publish their works for a onetime payment this is known as a royaltyfree license book publishingedit all bookpublishing royalties are paid by the publisher who determines an authors royalty rate except in rare cases in which the author can demand high advances and royalties for most cases the publishers advance an amount part of the royalty which can constitute the bulk of the authors total income plus whatever little flows from the running royalty stream some costs may be attributed to the advance paid which depletes further advances to be paid or from the running royalty paid the author and the publisher can independently draw up the agreement that binds them or alongside an agent representing the author there are many risks for the author—definition of cover price the retail price net price the discounts on the sale the bulk sales on the pod publish on demand platform the term of the agreement audit of the publishers accounts in case of impropriety etc which an agent can provide the following illustrates the income to an author on the basis chosen for royalty particularly in pod which minimizes losses from inventory and is based on computer technologies bookpublishing royalties net and retail compared retail basis net basis cover

royalties on the published price of trade books usually range from 10 to 125 with 15 for more important authors on paperback it is usually 75 to 10 going up to 125 only in exceptional cases all the royalties displayed below are on the cover price paying 15 to the author can mean that the other 85 of the cost pays for editing and proofreading printing and binding overheads and the profits if any to the publisher the publishing company pays no royalty on bulk purchases of books since the buying price may be a third of the cover price sold on a singles basis unlike the uk the united states does not specify a maximum retail price for books that serves as base for calculation based on net receiptsedit methods of calculating royalties changed during the 1980s due to the rise of retail chain booksellers which demanded increasing discounts from publishers as a result rather than paying royalties based on a percentage of a books cover price publishers preferred to pay royalties based on their net receipts according to the writers and artists yearbook of 1984 under the new arrangement appropriate upward adjustments are of course made to the royalty figure and the arrangement is of no disadvantage to the author22 despite this assurance in 1991 frederick nolan author and former publishing executive explained that net receipts royalties are often more in the interest of publishers than authors it makes sense for the publisher to pay the author on the basis of what he receives but it by no means makes it a good deal for the author example 10000 copies of a 20 book with a 10 percent coverprice royalty will earn him 20000 the same number sold but discounted at 55 percent will net the publisher 90000 the authors ten percent of that figure yields him 9000 which is one reason why publishers prefer net receipts contractsamong the many other advantages to the publisher of such contracts is the fact that they make possible what is called a sheet deal in this the multinational publisher of that same 10000 copy print run can substantially reduce his printing cost by running on a further 10000 copies that is to say printing but not binding them and then further profit by selling these sheets at costprice or even lower if he so chooses to subsidiaries or overseas branches then paying the author 10 percent of net receipts from that deal the overseas subsidiaries bind up the sheets into book form and sell at full price for a nice profit to the group as a whole the only one who loses is the author23 in 2003 two american authors ken englade and patricia simpson successfully sued harpercollins usa for selling their work to its foreign affiliates at improperly high discounts harper collins is essentially selling books to itself at discounted rates upon which it then calculates the authors royalty and then harper collins shares in the extra profit when the book is resold to the consumer by the foreign affiliates without paying the author any further royalty24 this forced a class action readjustment for thousands of authors contracted by harpercollins between november 1993 and june 199925 musicedit unlike other forms of intellectual property music royalties have a strong linkage to individuals – composers score songwriters lyrics and writers of musical plays – in that they can own the exclusive copyright to created music and can license it for performance independent of corporates recording companies and the performing artists that create a sound recording of the music enjoy a separate set of copyrights and royalties from the sale of recordings and from their digital transmission depending on national laws with the advent of pop music and major innovations in technology in the communication and presentations of media the subject of music royalties has become a complex field with considerable change in the making a musical composition obtains copyright protection as soon as it is written out or recorded but it is not protected from infringed use unless it is registered with the copyright authority for instance the copyright office in the united states which is administered by the library of congress no person or entity other than the copyright owner can use or employ the music for gain without obtaining a license from the composersongwriter inherently as copyright it confers on its owner a distinctive bundle of five exclusive rights a to make copies of the songs through print or recordings b to distribute them to the public for profit c to the public performance right live or through a recording d to create a derivative work to include elements of the original music and e to display it not very relevant in context where the score and the lyric of a composition are contributions of different persons each of them is an equal owner of such rights these exclusivities have led to the evolution of distinct commercial terminology used in the music industry they take four forms 1 royalties from print rights 2 mechanical royalties from the recording of composed music on cds and tape 3 performance royalties from the performance of the compositionssongs on stage or television through artists and bands and 4 synch for synchronization royalties from using or adapting the musical score in the movies television advertisements etc and with the advent of the internet an additional set of royalties has come into play the digital rights from simulcasting webcasting streaming downloading and online ondemand service in the following the terms composer and songwriter either lyric or score are synonymous print rights in musicedit brief historyedit while the focus here is on royalty rates pertaining to music marketed in the print form or sheet music its discussion is a prelude to the much more important and larger sources of royalty income today from music sold in media such as cds television and the internet sheet music is the first form of music to which royalties were applied which was then gradually extended to other formats any performance of music by singers or bands requires that it be first reduced to its written sheet form from which the song score and its lyric are read otherwise the authenticity of its origin essential for copyright claims will be lost as has been the case with folk songs and american westerns propagated by the aural tradition the ability to print music arises from a series of technological developments in print and art histories over a long span of time from the 11th to the 18th century of which two will be highlighted the first and commercially successful invention was the development of the movable type printing press the gutenberg press in the 15th century it was used to print the wellknown gutenberg bible and later the printing system enabled printed music printed music till then tended to be one line chants the difficulty in using movable type for music is that all the elements must align – the note head must be properly aligned with the staff lest it have an unintended meaning musical notation was well developed by then originating around 1025 guido darezzo developed a system of pitch notation using lines and spaces until this time only two lines had been used guido expanded this system to four lines and initiated the idea of ledger lines by adding lines above or below these lines as needed he used square notes called neumes this system eliminated any uncertainty of pitch which existed at that time guido also developed a system of clefs which became the basis for our clef system bass clef treble clef and so on coexisting civilizations used other forms of notation in europe the major consumers of printed music in the 17th and 18th centuries were the royal courts for both solemn and festive occasions music was also employed for entertainment both by the courts and the nobility composers made their livings from commissioned work and worked as conductors performers and tutors of music or through appointments to the courts to a certain extent music publishers also paid composers for rights to print music but this was not royalty as it is generally understood today the european church was also a large user of music both religious and secular however performances were largely based on handwritten music or aural training american contribution the origins of music copyright and royaltiesedit until the mid18th century american popular music largely consisted of songs from the british isles whose lyric and score were sometimes available in engraved prints mass production of music was not possible until the movable type was introduced music with this type was first printed in the us in 175026 at the beginning the type consisted of the notehead stem and staff which were combined into a single font later the fonts were made up of the notehead stems and flags attached to the staff line until that time prints existed only on engraved plates the first federal law on copyright was enacted in the us copyright act of 1790 which made it possible to give protection to original scores and lyrics americas most prominent contribution is jazz and all the music styles which preceded and coexist with it – its variations on church music africanamerican work songs cornfield hollers wind bands in funeral procession blues rag etc – and of innovations in church music rhythmic variations stamping tapping of feet strutting shuffling wailing laments and spiritual ecstasy until its recent sophistication jazz was not amenable to written form and thus not copyrightable due to its improvisational element and the fact that many of the creators of this form could not read or write music27 it was its precursor minstrelsy which came to be written and royalties paid for the use of popular music blackface minstrelsy in which white men parodied black music of the day with makeupblackened faces was the first distinctly theatrical form in the 1830s and 1840s it was at the core of the rise of an american music industry for several decades it provided the means through which white america saw black america the blackfaces were not products of the american south but first prevailed in the midwest and the north starting in lowlevel white establishments and later moving to upscale theaters white workingclass northerners could identify with the characters portrayed in early performances with images of white slavery and wage slavery28 in 1845 the blackfaces purged their shows of low humor christys minstrels formed by cf christy among the major minstrels of that time was to epitomize the songs of its best known composer stephen foster stephen foster was the preeminent songwriter in the united states of that time his songs such as oh susanna camptown races my old kentucky home beautiful dreamer and swanee river remain popular 150 years after their composition and have worldwide appreciation29 foster had little formal music training while he was able to publish several songs before he was twenty his sophistication came from henry kleber and dan rice kleber was a classically trained german immigrant and rice was a popular blackface performer who befriended foster but it was his joining the christy minstrels which made him and his songs favorites in north america wc peters was the first major publisher of fosters works but foster saw very little of the profits oh susanna was an overnight success and a goldrush favorite but foster received just 100 from his publisher for it in part due to his lack of interest in money and the free gifts of music he gave to him fosters first love lay in writing music and its success foster did later contract with christy for 15 each for old folks at home and farewell my lilly dear oh susanna also led foster to two new york publishers firth pond and co and fd benson who contracted with him to pay royalties at 2 cents for every printed copy sold by them30 minstrelsy slowly gave way to songs generated by the american civil war followed by the rise of tin pan alley and parlour music31 both of which led to an explosion of sheet music greatly aided by the emergence of the player piano while the player piano was to make inroads deep into the 20th century more and more music was reproduced through radio and the phonograph leading to new forms of royalty payments but leading to the decline of sheet music american innovations in church music also provided royalties to its creators while stephen foster is often credited as the originator of print music in america william billings is the real father of american music in 1782 of the 264 music compositions in print 226 were his churchrelated compositions similarly billings was the composer of a quarter of the 200 anthems published until 1810 neither he nor his family saw any royalties although the copyright act of 1790 was in place by then church music plays a significant part in american print royalties when the lutheran church split from the catholic church in the 16th century more than religion changed martin luther wanted his entire congregation to take part in the music of his services not just the choir this new chorale style finds its way in both present church music and jazz print royalties musicedit the royalty rate for printing a book a novel lyrics or music globally or its download for sale varies from 2030 of the suggested retail sales value typically 20–25 for a new writer that is taken by the publisherdistributor the payment is made by the publisherdistributor and corresponds to the agreement license between the writer and the publisherdistributor as with other music royalties the agreement is typically nonexclusive to the publisher and the term may vary from 3–5 years established writers favor certain publishersdistributors and usually receive higher royalties all of the royalty does not occur to the writer it is shared with the publisher on of book sales income on a 5050 basis if a book involved is a play it might be dramatized the right to dramatize is a separate right – known as a grand right this income is shared by the many personalities and organizations who come together to offer the play the playwright composer of the music played producer director of the play and so forth there is no convention to the royalties paid for grand rights and it is freely negotiated between the publisher and the mentioned participants if the writers work is only part of a publication then the royalty paid is prorata a facet which is more often met in a book of lyrics or in a book of hymns and sometimes in an anthology church music – that is music that is based on written work – is important particularly in the americas and in some other countries of europe examples are hymns anthems and songbooks unlike novels and plays hymns are sung with regularity very often the hymns and songs are sung from lyrics in a book or more common nowadays from the work projected on computer screen in the us the christian copyright licensing international inc is the collection agency for royalties but song or hymn writers have to be registered with them and the songs identified32 foreign publishingedit viewed from a us perspective foreign publishing involves two basic types of publishing – subpublishing and copublishing occurrences in one or more territories outside that of basic origin subpublishing itself is one of two forms subpublishers who merely license out the original work or those which make and sell the products which are the subject of the license such as print books and records with local artists performing the work subpublishers who produce and market a product retain 10–15 of the marked retail price and remit the balance to the main publisher with whom they have the copyright license those subpublishers who merely license out the work earn between 15–2533 mechanical royaltiesedit although the terms mechanical and mechanical license have their origins in the piano rolls on which music was recorded in the early part of the 20th century the scope of their modern usage is much wider and covers any copyrighted audio composition that is rendered mechanically ie without human performers as such it includes compact discs vinyl records and tape recordings music videos ringtones midi files downloaded tracks dvds vhs umds computer games musical toys etc the united states treatment of mechanical royalties differs markedly from international practice in the united states while the right to use copyrighted music for making records for public distribution for private use is an exclusive right of the composer the copyright act provides that once the music is so recorded anyone else can record the compositionsong without a negotiated license but on the payment of the statutory compulsory royalty thus its use by different artists could lead to several separately owned copyrighted sound recordings the following is a partial segment of the compulsory rates as they have applied from 1998 to 2007 in the united states34 the royalty rates in the table have two elements i a minimum rate applies for a duration equivalent to 5 minutes or less of a musical compositionsong and ii a perminute rate if the composition exceeds it whichever is greater compulsory mechanical royalty rates united states period royalty rate 1 january 1998 – 31 december 1999 710 cents or 135 centsmin 1 january 2000 – 31 december 2001 755 cents or 143 centsmin 1 january 2002 – 31 december 2003 800 cents or 155 centsmin 1 january 2004 – 31 december 2005 850 cents or 165 centsmin 1 january 2006 – 31 december 2007 910 cents or 175 centsmin in the predominant case the composer assigns the song copyright to a publishing company under a publishing agreement which makes the publisher exclusive owner of the composition the publishers role is to promote the music by extending the written music to recordings of vocal instrumental and orchestral arrangements and to administer the collection of royalties which as will shortly be seen is in reality done by specialized companies the publisher also licenses subpublishers domestically and in other countries to similarly promote the music and administer the collection of royalties in a fair publishing agreement every 100 units of currency that flows to the publisher gets divided as follows 50 units go to the songwriter and 50 units to the publisher minus operating and administrative fees and applicable taxes however the music writer obtains a further 25 units from the publishers share if the music writer retains a portion of the music publishing rights as a copublisher in effect the copublishing agreement is a 5050 share of royalties in favor of the songwriter if administrative costs of publishing are disregarded this is near international practice when a company recording label records the composed music say on a cd master it obtains a distinctly separate copyright to the sound recording with all the exclusivities that flow to such copyright the main obligation of the recording label to the songwriter and her publisher is to pay the contracted royalties on the license received while the compulsory rates remain unaffected recording companies in the us typically will negotiate to pay not more than 75 of the compulsory rate where the songwriter is also the recording artist35 and will further in the us extend that to a maximum of 10 songs even though the marketed recording may carry more than that number this reduced rate results from the incorporation of a controlled composition clause in the licensing contract36 since the composer as recording artist is seen to control the content of the recording mechanical royalties for music produced outside of the united states are negotiated – there being no compulsory licensing – and royalty payments to the composer and her publisher for recordings are based on the wholesale retail or suggested retail value of the marketed cds recording artists earn royalties only from the sale of cds and tapes and as will be seen later from sales arising from digital rights where the songwriter is also the recording artist royalties from cd sales add to those from the recording contract in the us recording artists earn royalties amounting to 10–25 of the suggested retail price of the recording37 depending on their popularity but such is before deductions for packaging breakage promotion sales and holdback for returns which act to significantly reduce net royalty incomes in the us the harry fox agency hfa is the predominant licensor collector and distributor for mechanical royalties although there are several small competing organizations for its operations it charges about 6 as commission hfa like its counterparts in other countries is a stateapproved quasimonopoly and is expected to act in the interests of the composerssongwriters – and thus obtains the right to audit record company sales additional third party administrators such as rightsflow provide services to license account and pay mechanical royalties and are growing rightsflow is paid by the licensees artists labels distributors online music services and in turn does not extract a commission from the mechanical royalties paid out38 in the uk the mechanicalcopyright protection society mcps now in alliance with prs acts to collect and distribute royalties to composers songwriters and publishers for cds and for digital formats it is a notforprofit organization which funds its work through a commissions on aggregate revenues the royalty rate for licensing tracks is 65 of retail price or 85 of the published wholesale price in europe the major licensing and mechanical royalty collection societies are sacem in france39 gema in germany40 sfa in italy41 sacem acts collectively for francophone countries in africa the uk society also has strong links with englishspeaking african countries mechanical societies for other countries can be found at the main national collection societies42 the mechanical royalty rate paid to the publisher in europe is about 65 on the published price to dealer ppd43 record companies are responsible for paying royalties to those artists who have performed for a recording based on the sale of cds by retailers performanceedit performance in the music industry can include any of the following a performance of a song or composition – live recorded or broadcast a live performance by any musician a performance by any musician through a recording on physical media performance through the playing of recorded music music performed through the web digital transmissions it is useful to treat these royalties under two classifications a those associated with conventional forms of music distribution which have prevailed for most part of the 20th century and b those from emerging digital rights associated with newer forms of communication entertainment and media technologies from ring tones to downloads to live internet streaming in the united kingdom the church of england is specifically exempted from performance royalties for music performed in services because it is a stateestablished church traditionally american music publishers have not sought performance royalties for music sung and played in church services–the license to perform being implied by distributors of church sheet music ascap bmi and sesac exempt church worship services from performance royalties but make no exemption for churchhosted concerts conventional forms of royalty paymentedit in the conventional context royalties are paid to composers and publishers and record labels for public performances of their music on vehicles such as the jukebox stage radio or tv users of music need to obtain a performing rights license from music societies – as will be explained shortly – to use the music performing rights extend both to live and recorded music played in such diverse areas as cafés skating rinks etc licensing is generally done by music societies called performing rights organizations pros some of which are governmentapproved or governmentowned to which the composer the publisher performer in some cases or the record label have subscribed the diagram on the right titled the performance rights complex44 shows the general sequences by which a song or a composition gets to be titled a performance and which brings royalties to songwriterspublishers performing artists and record labels how and to whom royalties are paid is different in the united states from what it is for example in the uk most countries have practices more in common with the uk than the us in the united kingdom there are three principal organizations i phonographic performance limited ppl ii prs for music formerly the performing right society iii mechanicalcopyright protection society mcps who license music to musicusers and act as royalty collection and distribution agencies for their members ppl issues performance licenses to all uk radio tv and broadcast stations as well as establishments who employ sound recordings tapes cds in entertaining the public45 the licensing company collects and distributes royalties to the record label for the sound recording and to featured uk performers in the recording performers do not earn from sound recordings on video and film prs which is now in alliance with mcps46 collects royalties from musicusers and distributes them directly to songwriters and publishers whose works are performed live on radio or on tv on a 5050 basis mcps licenses music for broadcast in the range 3 to 525 of net advertising revenues47 mcps also collects and disburses mechanical royalties to writers and publishers in a manner similar to prs although allied they serve for now as separate organizations for membership the next diagram shows the sequences in the licensing of performances and the royalty collection and distribution process in the uk44 every song or recording has a unique identity by which they are licensed and tracked details of songs or recordings are notified to the pros directly or through catco an electronic tracking system it needs to be clarified that while blanket licenses are commonly issued to musicusers the latter are responsible for usage returns – the actual frequency of performances under the license – which then becomes the basis for the pro to apportion royalties to writers publishers and record labels diy indies are doityourself independent songwriters – and often the performers as well – who record and publish under their own labels in the uk music is licensed and royalties paid on it at the track level there is also a separate organization in the uk called vpl which is the collecting society set up by the record industry in 1984 to grant licenses to users of music videos eg broadcasters programmakers video jukebox system suppliers48 the licensing income collected from users is paid out to the societys members after administrative costs are deducted there are different models for royalty collection in the european countries in some of them mechanical and performing rights are administered jointly sacem france sabam belgium gema germany and jasrac japan work that way in the united states in contrast the ascap bmi broadcast music inc and sesac society of european stage authors composers are the three principal performance rights organizations pros although smaller societies exist the royalty that is paid to the composer and publisher is determined by the method of assessment used by the pro to gage the utilization of the music there being no external metrics as in mechanical royalties or the reporting system used in the uk very basically a pro aggregates the royalties that are due to all of the composerssongwriters who are its members and each composer and publisher is paid royalties based on the assessed frequency of the musics performance post deductions of charges which are many the pros are audited agencies they directly pay the songwriter and the publisher their respective shares if part of the publishers share is retained by the songwriter the publisher pays the songwriter that part of the publishers share typically the pro negotiates blanket licenses with radio stations television networks and other music users each of whom receives the right to perform any of the music in the repertoire of the pro for a set sum of money pros use different types of surveys to determine the frequency of usage of a compositionsong ascap uses random sampling sesac utilizes cue sheets for tv performances and digital pattern recognition for radio performances while bmi employs more scientific methods in the united states only the composer and the publisher are paid performance royalties and not performing artists digital rights being a different matter likewise the record label whose music is used in a performance is not entitled to royalties in the us on the premise that performances lead sales of records where a performance has cowriters along with the composersongwriter – as in a musical play – they will share the royalty in digital distributionedit us regulatory provisionsedit regulatory provisions in the us eu and elsewhere is in a state of flux continuously being challenged by developments in technology thus almost any regulation stated here exists in a tentative format the us copyright act of 1976 identified musical works and sound recordings eligible for copyright protection the term musical work refers to the notes and lyrics of a song or a piece of music while a sound recording results from its fixation on physical media copyright owners of musical works are granted exclusive rights to license overtheair radio and tv broadcasts entitling them royalties which are as said earlier collected and distributed by the pros under the act record companies and recording artists are presently not entitled to royalties from radio and tv broadcasts of their music except in the case of digital services and webcasts where copyright owners and performers obtain royalties see later this is in contrast to international standards where performers also obtain royalties from overtheair and digital broadcasting in 1995 the congress introduced the digital performance right in sound recordings act dpra which became effective 1 feb 1996 this act granted owners of sound recordings the exclusive license to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of digital audio transmissions but it exempted nonsubscription services and some other services where the rights owner could not voluntarily reach agreement with the broadcaster it could avail of compulsory licensing provisions under the act the compulsory royalty the royalty schedule follows was to be shared in the manner 50 to the record companies 45 to featured artists 2½ to nonfeatured musicians through american federation of musicians afm in the united states and canada49 and 2½ for nonfeatured vocalists through american federation of television and radio artists aftra50 united states congress also created a new compulsory license for certain subscription digital audio services which transmit sound recordings via cable television and directbroadcast satellite dbs on a noninteractive basis in the absence of a voluntary negotiation and agreement in 1998 the congress amended dpra to create the digital millennium copyright act dmca by redefining the abovenoted subscription services of dpra as preexisting subscription services and expanded the statutory license to include new categories of digital audio services that may operate under the license in effect dmca created three categories of licensees preexisting satellite digital audio radio services new subscription services and eligible nonsubscription transmission services in addition to the above a fourth license was created permit webcasters to make ephemeral recordings of a sound recording temporary copies to facilitate streaming but with a royalty to be paid nonsubscription webcasting royalties have also to be shared between record companies and performers in the proportions set out under dpra the table below titled summary of statutory royalty rates for digital webcasting united states encapsulates the royalties set for noninteractive webcasting to qualify for compulsory licensing under nonsubscription services the webcasting needs to fit the following six criteria it is noninteractive it does not exceed the sound recording performance complement it is accompanied by information on the song title and recording artist it does not publish a program schedule or specify the songs to be transmitted it does not automatically switch from one program channel to another and it does not allow a user to request songs to be played particularly for that user an interactive service is one which allows a listener to receive a specially created internet stream in which she dictates the songs to be played by selecting songs from the website menu such a service would take the website out from under the compulsory license and require negotiations with the copyright owners however a service is noninteractive if it permits people to request songs which are then played to the public at large nonetheless several rules apply such as within any threehour period three cuts from a cd but no more than two cuts consecutively can be played or a site can play four songs from any singer from a boxed cdset but no more than three cuts consecutively both interactive and noninteractive streaming services are required and regulated by the copyright royalty judges to pay out a minimum fee per stream interactive services must pay out 00022 per stream while noninteractive streaming services must pay 00017 per stream these rates are set to be what these services are required to distribute per stream and has been the rate since january 1 2016 and will be reevaluated after december 31 2020citation needed the soundexchange a nonprofit organization is defined under the legislation to act on behalf of record companies including the majors to license performance and reproduction rights and negotiate royalties with the broadcasters it is governed by a board of artist and label representatives services include track level accounting of performances to all members and collection and distribution of foreign royalties to all members51 in the absence of a voluntary agreement between the soundexchange and the broadcasters copyright arbitration royalty panel carp was authorized to set the statutory rates as could prevail between a willing buyer and willing sellers soundexchange handles only the collection of royalties from compulsory licenses for noninteractive streaming services that use satellite cable or internet methods of distribution to recap under the law three types of licenses are required for streaming of musical recordings a a performance license applicable for underlying words lyrics and music score b a performance license applicable to the streaming the sound recording c a storage license for the passage of a sound recording through a file server the royalties for the first of the above two licenses are obtained from soundexchange and the third from the pros failure to make required payments constitutes copyright infringement and is subject to statutory damages both broadcasters involved in webcasting and pureinternet nonbroadcasters are required to pay these royalties under the rules framed under the act all webcasters are also required to be registered with the united states copyright office summary of statutory royalty rates for digital webcasting united states52 1 webcaster dmca compliant

statutorily exempt 10 of gross proceeds minimum fee all cases 500 per year for each licensee uk legislationedit the united kingdom adopted the european copyright directive eucd in 2003 and the meaning of broadcast performance was broadened to cover communicating to the public this then included music distribution through the internet and the transmission of ringtones to mobiles thus a music download was a copy of proprietary music and hence required to be licensed after a prolonged battle on royalties between online music companies such as aol napster and the recording companies but not all of them represented by the british phonographic industry bpi and organizations representing the interests of songwriters mcps and prs a compromise was reached leading to a subsequent 3year interim legislation 2007 adopted by the uk copyright tribunal under the copyright designs and patents act 198853 the legislation referring to a new jol joint online license applies only to music purchased within uk the applicable royalties are given in the table below which interestingly also includes music downloads and music services through mobile devices this pathbreaking legislation is expected to become the model for eu which is yet to develop comprehensive legislation and perhaps even extend to the us note that the new legislation includes the distinction between downloads of musical tracks from itunes and other stores which were considered sales and the webcasts considered performances in brief the compromise reached is that songwriters will receive 8 of gross revenues definition follows less vat as royalty for each track downloaded bridging the demand of the artists demanding a 12 royalty rate what was otherwise the norm for a cd and music companies holding out for 65 slightly higher than the 57 paid for a 79p track sold by itunes54 a minimum of four pence will be paid in the new legislation if tracks are discounted the terms used in the legislated table are

participating principally aol yahoo and realnetworks the tribunal set the royalty rate for pure webcasting at 575 uk legislation recognizes the term online as referring to downloading digital files from the internet and mobile network operators offline is the term used for the delivery of music through physical media such as a cd or a dvd a stream is a file of continuous music listened to through a consumers receiving device with no playable copy of the music remaining permanent downloads are transfers sale of music from a website to a computer or mobile telephone for permanent retention and use whenever the purchaser wishes analogous to the purchase of a cd a limited download is similar to a permanent download but differs from it in that the consumers use of the copy is in some way restricted by associated technology for instance becomes unusable when the subscription ends say through an encoding such as drm of the downloaded music ondemand streaming is music streamed to the listener on the computer or mobile to enable her to listen to the music once twice or a number of times during the period of subscription to the service pure webcasting is where the user receives a stream of preprogrammed music chosen by the music service provider it is noninteractive to the extent that even pausing or skipping of tracks is not possible premium and interactive webcasting are personalized subscription services intermediate between pure webcasting and downloading special webcasting is a service where the user can choose a stream of music the majority of which comprises works from one source – an artist group or particular concert simulcasting although not in the table above is the simultaneous retransmission by a licensed transmission of the program of a radio or tv station over the internet of an otherwise traditional broadcast the person receiving the simulcast normally makes no permanent copy of it it is defined in the legislation as an offline service gross revenue which is comprehensively defined in the legislation summarized here means all revenue received or receivable by the licensee from users all revenue received through advertisements associated with the music service sponsorship fees commissions from third parties and revenue arising from barter or contra deals no deductions are permitted except for refunds of unused music due to technical faults the advertising revenue which is shared between the artist and music provider is defined as when the advertising is instream when the music offered forms the only content of a page featuring advertising excluding the advertisement itself and when the music offered forms more than 75 of a page featuring advertising excluding the advertisement itself synchronizationedit according to joel mabus the term synchronization comes from the early days of the talkies when music was first synchronized with film55 the terminology originated in us industry but has now spread worldwide in the uk and elsewhere with the exception of the us there is apparently no legal prohibition to the combination of audio and visual images and no explicit statutory right for the collection of synch royalties in the us however the copyright act defines the audiovisual format as that of combining images with music for use in machines and there is no explicit rate set such as the compulsory royalty rate for copying music however there are instances of courts implying the synchronization right5657 but even so it is an amorphous colloquial commercial term of acceptance synchronization royalties sync licenses are paid for the use of copyrighted music in largely audiovisual productions such as in dvds movies and advertisements music used in news tracks are also synch licenses synchronization can extend to live media performances such as plays and live theatre they become extremely important for new media the usage of music in the form of mp3 wav flac files and for usage in webcasts embedded media in microchips eg karaoke etc but the legal conventions are yet to be drawn synchronization royalties are due to the composersongwriter or hisher publisher they are strictly contractual in nature and vary greatly in amount depending on the subjective importance of the music the mode of production and the media used the royalty payable is that of mutual acceptance but is conditioned by industry practice it is useful to note in this connection the concept of the needle drop now laser drop in that the synch royalty becomes payable every time the needle drops on the record player in a public performance all openings and closings every cut to advertisements every cut back from ads all reruns shown by every tv company in every country in the world generates a synchro although a single payment may be renegotiable in advance58 there is a category of royalty free music in the field of synchronization this refers to the use of music in a library for which a onetime royalty has been negotiated it is an alternative to needledrop negotiation in terms of numbers royalties can range from say 500–2000 for a festivaluse license to 250000 or more for a movie film score for lowbudget films which are deemed less than 2 million the royalties range from 3–659 or could be per song per usage audio home recording act of 1992edit in the us the audio home recording act became effective law in october 199260 the law enabled the release of recordable digital formats such as sony and philips digital audio tape without fear of contributory infringement lawsuits see alsoedit recoupment art royaltiesedit resale royalty or droit de suiteedit art resale royalty is a right to a royalty payment upon resales of art works that applies in some jurisdictions whilst there are currently approximately 60 countries that have some sort of resale royalty on their statute books evidence of resale schemes that can be said to be actually operating schemes is restricted to europe australia and the american state of california for example in may 2011 the european commissions eceuropa webpage on resale royalty stated that under the heading indicative list of third countries article 72   a letter was sent to member states on 1 march 2006 requesting that they provide a list of third countries which meet these requirements and that they also provide evidence of application to date the commission has not been supplied with evidence for any third country which demonstrates that they qualify for inclusion on this list61 the emphasis is from the european commission web page apart from placing a levy on the resale of some artlike objects there are few common facets to the various national schemes most schemes prescribe a minimum amount that the artwork must receive before the artist can invoke resale rights usually the hammer price or price some countries prescribe and others such as australia do not prescribe the maximum royalty that can be received most do prescribe the calculation basis of the royalty some countrys make the usage of the royalty compulsory some countrys prescribe a sole monopoly collection service agency while others like the uk and france allow multiple agencies some schemes involve varying degrees of retrospective application and other schemes such as australias are not retrospective at all in some cases for example germany an openly taxlike use is made of the royalties half of the money collected is redistributed to fund public programs the new zealand and canadian governments have not proceeded with any sort of artist resale scheme the australian scheme does not apply to the first resale of artworks purchased prior to the schemes enactment june 2010 and individual usage of the right by australian artists is not compulsory in australia artists have a case by case right under clause 2223 of the act to refuse consent to the usage of the right by the appointed collection society andor make their own collection arrangements details of the australian scheme can be gotten from62 the website of the sole appointed australian agency the copyright agency limited the uk scheme is in the context of commonlaw countries an oddity no other commonlaw country has mandated an individual economic right where actual usage of the right is compulsory for the individual right holder whether the common law conception of an individual economic right as an individual right of control of usage is compatible with the code civil origins of droit de suite is open to question the uk is the largest art resale market where a form of arr is operating details of how the royalty is calculated as a portion of sale price in the uk can be accessed here dacs in the uk the scheme was in early 2012 extended to all artists still in copyright in most european jurisdictions the right has the same duration as the term of copyright in california law heirs receive royalty for 20 years the royalty applies to any work of graphic or plastic art such as a ceramic collage drawing engraving glassware lithograph painting photograph picture print sculpture tapestry however a copy of a work is not to be regarded as a work unless the copy is one of a limited number made by the artist or under the artists authority in the uk the resale of a work bought directly from the artist and then resold within 3 years for a value of €10000 or less is not affected by the royalty the situation as to how arr applies in situations where an art work is physically made by a person or persons who are not the name artist who first exhibits and sells the work is not clear in particular whilst arr is inalienable it seems conceivable that in cases where the copyright on an artwork is transferredsold prior to the first sale of an artwork the inalienable arr right is also effectively sold transferred whether resale royalties are of net economic benefit to artists is a highly contested area many economic studies have seriously questioned the assumptions underlying the argument that resale royalties have net benefits to artists many modelings have suggested that resale royalties could be actually harmful to living artists economic positions63 australias chief advocate for the adoption of artist resale royalties the collection society viscopy commissioned in 2004 a report from access economics to model the likely impact of their scheme in the resulting report access economics warned that the claim of net benefit to artists was based upon extremely unrealistic assumptions in particular the assumption that seller and buyer behaviour would be completely unaffected by the introduction of rrr arr and that access economics considers that the results of this analysis are both unhelpful and potentially misleading64 artwork royaltiesedit an artwork is usually a copyrighted article which be massproduced for sale such as greeting cards they are both seasonal and on occasion in the uk it is estimated that one billion pounds are spent on greeting cards every year with the average person sending 55 cards per year the royalty range is 2–5 with an upfront royalty other artwork royalties are as under65 greeting cards and gift wrap 2 to 5 household items such as cups sheets towels 3 to 8 fabrics apparel tshirts caps decals 2 to 10 posters and prints 10 or more toys and dolls 3 to 8

arrangementsedit the term royalty also covers areas outside of ip and technology licensing such as oil gas and mineral royalties paid to the owner of a property by a resources development company in exchange for the right to exploit the resource in a business project the promoter financier lhs enabled the transaction but are no longer actively interested may have a royalty right to a portion of the income or profits of the business this sort of royalty is often expressed as a contract right to receive money based on a royalty formula rather than an actual ownership interest in the business in some businesses this sort of royalty is sometimes called an override alliances and partnershipsedit royalties may exist in technological alliances and partnerships the latter is more than mere access to secret technical or a trade right to accomplish an objective it is in the last decade of the past century and the first of this one of the major means of technology transfer its importance for the licensor and the licensee lies in its access to markets and raw materials and labor when the international trend is towards globalization there are three main groups when it comes to technological alliances they are jointventures sometimes abbreviated jv the franchises and strategic alliances sa6667 jointventures are usually between companies long in contact with a purpose jvs are very formal forms of association and depending on the country where they are situated subject to a rigid code of rules in which the public may or may not have an opportunity to participate in capital partly depending on the size of capital required and partly on governmental regulations they usually revolve around products and normally involve an inventive step franchises revolve around services and they are closely connected with trademarks an example of which is mcdonalds although franchises have no convention like trademarks or copyrights they can be mistaken as a trademarkcopyright in agreements the franchisor has close control over the franchisee which in legal terms cannot be tieins such as frachisee located in an areas owned by the franchisor strategic alliances can involve a project such as bridge building a product or a service as the name implies is more a matter of marriage of convenience when two parties want to associate to take up a particular but modest shortterm task but generally are uncomfortable with the other but the strategic alliance could be a test of compatibility for the forming of a joint venture company and a precedent step note that all of these ventures s could be in a third county jvs and franchises are rarely found formed within a county they largely involve third countries on occasion a jv or sa may be wholly oriented to research and development typically involving multiple organizations working on an agreed form of engagement the airbus is an example of such technical assistance and service in technology transferedit firms in developing countries often are asked by the supplier of knowhow or patent licensing to consider technical service ts and technical assistance ta as elements of the technology transfer process and to pay royalty on them ts and ta are associated with the ip intellectual property transferred – and sometimes dependent on its acquisition – but they are by no means ip68 ta and ts may also be the sole part of the transfer or the tranferor of the ip their concurrent supplier they are seldom met with in the developed countries which sometimes view even knowhow as similar to ts ts comprises services which are the specialized knowledge of firms or acquired by them for operating a special process it is often a bundle of services which can by itself meet an objective or help in meeting it it is delivered over time at end of which the acquirer becomes proficient to be independent of the service in this process no consideration is given on whether the transfer of the proprietary element has been concluded or not on the other hand technical assistance is a package of assistance given on a short timetable it can range variously from procurement of equipment for a project inspection services on behalf of the buyer the training of buyers personnel and the supply technical or managerial staff again ta is independent of ip services the payment for these services is a fee not a royalty the ts fee is dependent on how many of the specialized staff of its supplier are required and over what period of time sometimes the learning capacity to whom the ts is supplied is involved in any case the cost per servicehour should be calculated and evaluated note that in selecting a ts supplier often the ip supplier experience and dependency are critical in the case of ta there is usually a plurality of firms and choice is feasible approaches to royalty rateedit intellectual propertyedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations

unsourced material may be challenged and removed september 2008 learn how and when to remove this template message there are three general approaches to assess the applicable royalty rate in the licensing of intellectual property they are the cost approach the comparable market approach the income approach for a fair evaluation of the royalty rate the relationship of the parties to the contract should – be at armslength related parties such as the subsidiary and the parent company need to transact as though they were independent parties – be viewed as acting free and without compulsion cost approachedit the cost approach considers the several elements of cost that may have been entered to create the intellectual property and to seek a royalty rate that will recapture the expense of its development and obtain a return that is commensurate with its expected life costs considered could include rd expenditures pilotplant and testmarketing costs technology upgrading expenses patent application expenditure and the like the method has limited utility since the technology is not priced competitively on what the market can bear principles or in the context of the price of similar technologies more importantly by lacking optimization through additional expense it may earn benefits below its potential however the method may be appropriate when a technology is licensed out during its rd phase as happens with venture capital investments or it is licensed out during one of the stages of clinical trials of a pharmaceutical in the former case the venture capitalist obtains an equity position in the company developing the technology in exchange for financing a part of the development cost recovering it and obtaining an appropriate margin when the company gets acquired or it goes public through the ipo route recovery of costs with opportunity of gain is also feasible when development can be followed stagewise as shown below for a pharmaceutical undergoing clinical trials the licensee pays higher royalties for the product as it moves through the normal stages of its development success state of development royalty rates nature preclinical success 0–5 invitro phase i safety 5–10 100 healthy people phase ii efficacy 8–15 300 subjects phase iii effectiveness 10–20 several thousand patients launched product 20 regulatory body approval a similar approach is used when custom software is licensed an inlicense ie an incoming license the product is accepted on a royalty schedule depending on the software meeting set stagewise specifications with acceptable error levels in performance tests comparable market approachedit here the cost and the risk of development are disregarded the royalty rate is determined from comparing competing or similar technologies in an industry modified by considerations of useful remaining life of the technology in that industry and contracting elements such as exclusivity provisions frontend royalties field of use restrictions geographic limitations and the technology bundle the mix of patents knowhow trademark rights etc accompanying it economist j gregory sidak explains that comparable licenses when selected correctly reveal what the licensor and the licensee consider to be fair compensation for the use of the patented technology and thus will most accurately depict the price that a licensee would willingly pay for that technology69 the federal circuit has on numerous occasions confirmed that the comparable market approach is a reliable methodology to calculate a reasonable royalty70 although widely used the prime difficulty with this method is obtaining access to data on comparable technologies and the terms of the agreements that incorporate them fortunately there are several recognizedby whom organizations see royalty rate websites listed at the end of this article who have comprehensivecitation needed information on both royalty rates and the principal terms of the agreements of which they are a part there are also iprelated organizations such as the licensing executives society which enable its members to access and share privately assembled data the two tables shown below are drawn selectively from information that is available with an iprelated organization and online7172 the first depicts the range and distribution of royalty rates in agreements

incorporating biological materials including genes proteins and peptide fragments expression systems cells and antibodies for the field of plant disease the comparability between transactions requires a comparison of the significant economic conditions that may affect the contracting parties similarity of geographies relevant date same industry market size and its economic development contracting or expanding markets market activity whether wholesale retail other relative market shares of contracting entities locationspecific costs of production and distribution competitive environment in each geography fair alternatives to contracting parties income approachedit the income approach focuses on the licensor estimating the profits generated by the licensee and obtaining an appropriate share of the generated profit it is unrelated to costs of technology development or the costs of competing technologies the approach requires the licensee or licensor a to generate a cashflow projection of incomes and expenses over the lifespan of the license under an agreed scenario of incomes and costs b determining the net present value npv of the profit stream based on a selected discount factor and c negotiating the division of such profit between the licensor and the licensee the npv of a future income is always lower than its current value because an income in the future is attended by risk in other words an income in the future needs to be discounted in some manner to obtain its present equivalent the factor by which a future income is reduced is known as the discount rate thus 100 received a year from now is worth 09091 at a 10 discount rate and its discounted value will be still lower two years down the line the actual discount factor used depends on the risk assumed by the principal gainer in the transaction for instance a mature technology worked in different geographies will carry a lower risk of nonperformance thus a lower discount rate than a technology being applied for the first time a similar situation arises when there is the option of working the technology in one of two different regions the risk elements in each region would be different the method is treated in greater detail using illustrative data in royalty assessment the licensors share of the income is usually set by the 25 rule of thumb which is said to be even used by tax authorities in the us and europe for armslength transactions the share is on the operating profit of the licensee firm even where such division is held contentious the rule can still be the starting point of negotiations following are three aspects that are important for the profit a the profit that accrues to the licensee may not arise solely through the engine of the technology there are returns from the mix of assets it employs such as fixed and working capital and the returns from intangible assets such as distribution systems trained workforce etc allowances need to be made for them b profits are also generated by thrusts in the general economy gains from infrastructure and the basket of licensed rights – patents trademark knowhow a lower royalty rate may apply in an advanced country where large market volumes can be commanded or where protection to the technology is more secure than in an emerging economy or perhaps for other reasons the inverse c the royalty rate is only one aspect of the negotiation contractual provisions such as an exclusive license rights to sublicense warranties on the performance of technology etc may enhance the advantages to the licensee which is not compensated by the 25 metric the basic advantage of this approach which is perhaps the most widely applied is that the royalty rate can be negotiated without comparative data on how other agreements have been transacted in fact it is almost ideal for a case where precedent does not exist it is perhaps relevant to note that the irs also uses these three methods in modified form to assess the attributable income or division of income from a royaltybased transaction between a us company and its foreign subsidiary since us law requires that a foreign subsidiary pay an appropriate royalty to the parent company74 other compensation modesedit royalties are only one among many ways of compensating owners for use of an asset others include buying the asset outright possibly with a leaseback arrangement offering the licensor an equity position in the licensee company staged milestone payments as in drug development and commissioned software arrangements lump sum payment made to the licensor in one or more installments crosslicensing agreements with or without cash payments and entering into a strategic alliance or joint venture in discussing the licensing of intellectual property the terms valuation and evaluation need to be understood in their rigorous terms evaluation is the process of assessing a license in terms of the specific metrics of a particular negotiation which may include its circumstances the geographical spread of licensed rights product range market width licensee competitiveness growth prospects etc on the other hand valuation is the fair market value fmv of the asset – trademark patent or knowhow – at which it can be sold between a willing buyer and willing seller in the context of best awareness of circumstances the fmv of the ip where assessable may itself be a metric for evaluation if an emerging company is listed on the stock market the market value of its intellectual property can be estimated from the data of the balance sheet
