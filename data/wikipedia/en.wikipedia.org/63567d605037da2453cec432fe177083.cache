august 1862 – 11 april 1890 often incorrectly called john merrick was an english man with very severe deformities who was first exhibited at a freak show as the elephant man and then went to live at the london hospital after he met frederick treves so becoming well known in london society merrick was born in leicester and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life his skin appeared thick and lumpy he developed enlarged lips and a bony lump grew on his forehead one of his arms and both of his feet became enlarged and at some point during his childhood he fell and damaged his hip resulting in permanent lameness when he was 9 his mother died from bronchopneumonia and his father soon remarried merrick left school at the age of 13 and had difficulty finding employment rejected by his father and stepmother he left home in late 1879 merrick aged 17 entered the leicester union workhouse in 1884 after four years in the workhouse merrick contacted a showman named sam torr and proposed that torr should exhibit him torr agreed and arranged for a group of men to manage merrick whom they named the elephant man after touring the east midlands merrick travelled to london to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop on whitechapel road which was rented by showman tom norman normans shop directly across the street from the london hospital was visited by a surgeon named frederick treves who invited merrick to be examined and photographed soon after merricks visits to the hospital tom normans shop was closed by the police and merricks managers sent him to tour in europe in belgium merrick was robbed by his road manager and abandoned in brussels he eventually made his way back to london unable to communicate he was found by the police to have dr trevess card on him treves came and took merrick back to the london hospital although his condition was incurable merrick was allowed to stay at the hospital for the remainder of his life treves visited him daily and the pair developed quite a close friendship merrick also got visits from the wealthy ladies and gentlemen of london society including alexandra princess of wales merrick died on 11 april 1890 aged 27 although the official cause of his death was asphyxia treves who performed the autopsy on the body said that merrick had died of a dislocated neck he believed that merrick who had to sleep sitting up because of the weight of his head had been attempting to sleep lying down to be like other people in absence of the possibility of genetic tests the exact cause of merricks deformities has long been unclear so that throughout much of the 20th century it was speculated that merrick was affected by other neurological syndromes only in 1986 was it conjectured that he had proteus syndrome a very rare congenital disorder also known as wiedemann syndrome named after the german pediatrician hansrudolf wiedemann dna tests on his hair and bones in 2003 in a study by charis eng were inconclusive merricks life was depicted in a 1979 play by bernard pomerance called the elephant man and a david lynch film also called the elephant man in 1980 in late 2014 and early 2015 bradley cooper starred in

joseph rockley merrick and his wife mary jane née potterton1 joseph rockley merrick c 1838 – 1897 was the son of londonborn weaver barnabas merrick 1791 – 1856 who moved to leicester during the 1820s or 1830s and his third wife sarah rockley2 mary jane potterton c 1837 – 1873 had been born at evington leicestershire her father being william potterton who was described as an agricultural labourer in the 1851 census of thurmaston leicestershire3 she is said to have had some form of physical disability and as a young woman worked as a domestic servant in leicester before marrying joseph rockley merrick then a brougham driver in 1861 the following year joseph carey merrick was born apparently healthy and had no outward symptoms of any disorder for the first few years of his life named after his father he was given the middle name carey by his mother a baptist after the preacher william carey4 the merricks had two more children not three as stated on his mothers gravejohn thomas born 21 april 1864 did indeed die of smallpox 24 july of the same year but he was not related to joseph and mary jane merrick5 william arthur born january 1866 who died of scarlet fever on 21 december 1870 aged four and was buried on christmas day 1870 william is buried with his mother aunts and uncles in welford road cemetery in leicester6 marian eliza born 28 september 1867 who was born with physical disabilities and died of myelitis and seizures on 19 march 1891 aged 24 marian is buried with her father in belgrave cemetery in leicester7 when writing of in his book the elephant man a study in human dignity ashley montagu states that john thomas sic merrick was born on 21 april 18648 montagu believed trevess statement in his book the elephant man and other reminiscences that merricks first name was john not joseph and confused him with his younger brother a child which has now been proved was not related to joseph merrick9 a pamphlet titled the autobiography of joseph carey merrick produced c 1884 to accompany his exhibition states that he started to display symptoms at approximately five years of age with thick lumpy skin like that of an elephant and almost the same colour10 according to a 1930 article in the illustrated leicester chronicle he began to develop swellings on his lips at the age of 21 months followed by a bony lump on his forehead and a loosening and roughening of the skin11nb 1 as he grew a noticeable difference between the size of his left and right arms appeared and both his feet became significantly enlarged11 the merrick family explained his symptoms as the result of marys being knocked over and frightened by a fairground elephant while she was pregnant with joseph11 the concept of maternal impression—that the emotional experiences of pregnant women could have lasting physical effect on their unborn children—was still common in 19th century britain13 merrick held this belief about the cause of his affliction for his entire life14 in addition to his deformities at some point during his childhood merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip this injury became infected and left him permanently lame15 although affected by his physical deformities merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother15 she was a sunday school teacher and his father worked as an engine driver at a cotton factory as well as running a haberdashery business15 on 29 may 1873 less than three years after the death of her youngest son william mary jane merrick died from bronchopneumonia16 joseph rockley merrick moved with his two children to live with mrs emma wood antill a widow with children of her own they married on 3 december 187417 employment and the workhouseedit i was taunted and sneered at so that i would not go home to my meals and used to stay in the streets with a hungry belly rather than return for anything to eat what few halfmeals i did have i was taunted with the remark—thats more than you have earned — the autobiography of joseph carey merrick10 merrick left school aged 13 which was usual for the time18 his homelife was now a perfect misery10 and neither his father nor his stepmother demonstrated affection towards him17 he ran away two or three times but was brought back by his father each time10 at 13 he found work rolling cigars in a factory but after three years his right hand deformity had worsened and he no longer had the dexterity required for the job18 now unemployed he spent his days wandering the streets looking for work and avoiding his stepmothers taunts1 merrick was becoming a greater financial burden on his family and eventually his father secured him a hawkers licence which enabled him to earn money selling items from the haberdashery shop door to door19 this endeavour was unsuccessful since merricks facial deformities rendered his speech increasingly unintelligible and prospective customers reacted with horror to his physical appearance housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only stared at him but began to follow him out of curiosity19 merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself on returning home one day in 1877 he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good20 merrick photographed in 1888 merrick was now homeless on the streets of leicester his uncle a barber named charles merrick heard of his nephews situation sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home21 merrick continued to hawk around leicester for the next two years but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before eventually his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the commissioners for hackney carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal21 with young children to provide for charles could no longer afford to support his nephew in late december 1879 now 17 years old merrick entered the leicester union workhouse22 merrick became one of 928 residents in the workhouse23 the group was segregated by age and sex and therefore merrick was housed with the other men between 16 and 6024 on 22 march 1880 only 12 weeks after entering merrick signed himself out of the workhouse and spent two days looking for work with no more success than before he found himself with no option but to return to the workhouse this time he stayed for four years25 around 1882 merrick underwent surgery on his face the protrusion from his mouth had grown to 8–9 inches and severely inhibited his speech and made it difficult to eat26 he was operated on in the workhouse infirmary under the direction of dr clement frederick bryan and had a large part of the mass removed27 life as a curiosityedit merrick concluded that his only escape from the workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions2829 he knew of a leicester music hall comedian and proprietor named sam torr merrick wrote to torr who came and visited him at the workhouse torr decided that he could make money exhibiting merrick although to retain merricks novelty he would have to be a travelling exhibit28 to this end he organised a group of managers for merrick music hall proprietor j ellis travelling showman george hitchcock and fair owner sam roper on 3 august 1884 merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career30 the shop on whitechapel road where merrick was exhibited today it sells saris the showmen named merrick the elephant man and advertised him as halfaman and halfanelephant30 they showed him around the east midlands including in leicester and nottingham before moving him on to london for the winter season george hitchcock contacted an acquaintance showman tom norman who ran penny gaff shops in londons east end exhibiting human curiosities without a meeting norman agreed to take over merricks management and in november hitchcock travelled with merrick to london31 when tom norman first saw merrick he was dismayed by the extent of his deformities fearing his appearance might be too horrific to be a successful novelty32 nevertheless he exhibited merrick in the back of an empty shop on whitechapel road merrick had an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy norman observed merrick asleep one morning and learned that he always slept sitting up with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees his enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and as merrick put it he would risk waking with a broken neck33 norman decorated the shop with posters that had been created by hitchcock depicting a monstrous halfman halfelephant34 a pamphlet titled the autobiography of joseph carey merrick was created outlining merricks life to date this biography whether written by merrick or not provided a generally accurate account of his life it contained an incorrect date of birth but throughout his life merrick was vague about when he was born35 ladies and gentlemen i would like to introduce mr joseph merrick the elephant man before doing so i ask you please to prepare yourselves—brace yourselves up to witness one who is probably the most remarkable human being ever to draw the breath of life —tom norman36 norman gathered an audience by standing outside the shop and drawing a crowd through his showman patter he would then lead his onlookers into the shop explaining that the elephant man was not here to frighten you but to enlighten you34 drawing aside the curtain he allowed the onlookers—often visibly horrified—to observe merrick up close while describing the circumstances leading to his present condition including his mothers alleged accident with an elephant the elephant man exhibit was moderately successful and made money primarily from the sales of the autobiographical pamphlet33 merrick was able to put his share of the profits aside hoping to earn enough to one day buy a home of his own37 the shop on whitechapel road was directly across the road from the london hospital an excellent location as medical students and doctors visited the shop curious to see merrick33 one visitor was a young house surgeon named reginald tuckett like his colleagues tuckett was intrigued by the elephant mans deformities and told his senior colleague frederick treves38 merricks cap and hood frederick treves first met merrick that november at a private viewing before norman opened the shop for the day33 treves later recalled in his 1923 reminiscences that merrick was the most disgusting specimen of humanity that i had ever seen at no time had i met with such a degraded or perverted version of a human being as this lone figure displayed39 the viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes after which treves returned to work later that day he sent tuckett back to the shop to ask if merrick might be willing to come to the hospital for an examination norman and merrick agreed40 to enable him to travel the short distance without drawing undue attention merrick wore a costume consisting of an oversized black cloak and a brown cap with a burlap sack that covered his face and rode in a cab hired by treves41nb 229 at the hospital treves examined merrick observing that he was shy confused not a little frightened and evidently much cowed39 at this point treves assumed that the elephant man was an imbecile39 he measured merricks head circumference at the large size of 36 inches 91 cm his right wrist at 12 inches 30 cm and one of his fingers at 5 inches 13 cm in circumference he noted that his skin was covered in papillomata warty growths the largest of which exuded an unpleasant smell43 the subcutaneous tissue appeared to be weakened and caused a loosening of the skin which in some areas hung away from the body there were bone deformities in the right arm both legs and most conspicuously in the large skull44 despite the corrective surgery to his mouth in 1882 merricks speech remained barely intelligible his left arm and hand were not large and were not deformed his penis and scrotum were normal apart from his deformities and the lameness in his hip treves concluded that merrick appeared to be in good general health45 norman later recalled that merrick went to the hospital for examination two or three times40 and during one of their meetings treves gave merrick his calling card1 on one of the visits treves had photographs taken and he provided merrick with a set of copies which were later added to his autobiographical pamphlet46 on 2 december treves presented merrick at a meeting of the pathological society of london in bloomsbury47 eventually merrick told norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital according to norman he said he was stripped naked and felt like an animal in a cattle market48 during this time in victorian britain tastes were changing in regard to freak show exhibitions like the elephant man shows like normans were a cause for public concern both on the grounds of decency and due to the disruption caused by crowds gathering outside them49 not long after merricks last examination with frederick treves the police closed down normans shop on whitechapel road and merricks leicester managers withdrew him from normans care48 in 1885 merrick went on the road with sam ropers travelling fair50 he befriended two other performers ropers midgets—bertram dooley and harry bramley—who on occasion defended merrick from public harassment42 europeedit the dampening of public enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued and the police and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing shows down merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and roper grew nervous about the negative attention the elephant man drew from local authorities42 merricks group of managers decided that he should go on tour in continental europe with the hope that authorities there would be more lenient merricks management was assumed by an unknown man possibly named ferrari and they left for the continent51 the elephant man was no more successful there than in britain and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions in brussels merrick was deserted by this new manager who stole merricks £50 2015 equivalent £4900 savings52 abandoned merrick made his way by train to ostend where he attempted to board a ferry for dover but was refused passage53 he travelled to antwerp and was able to board a ship bound for harwich in essex from there he travelled by train to london and arrived at liverpool street station54 merrick arrived at liverpool street station on 24 june 1886 safely back in his own country but with nowhere to go he was not eligible to enter a workhouse in london for more than one night and would be accepted only by leicester union where he was a permanent resident leicester was 98 miles 158 km away55 he approached strangers for help but his speech was unintelligible and his appearance repugnant he drew a crowd of curious onlookers until a policeman helped him into an empty waiting room where he huddled in a corner exhausted unable to make himself understood his only identifying possession was frederick trevess card56 the police contacted treves who went to the station recognising merrick treves took him in a hansom cab to the london hospital merrick was admitted for bronchitis washed fed and put to bed in a small isolation room in the hospitals attic57 london hospitaledit merricks close friend and doctor frederick treves in 1884 with merrick admitted into the hospital treves now had time to conduct a more thorough examination he discovered that merricks physical condition had deteriorated over the previous two years and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities treves also suspected that merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he had only a few years left to live58 merricks general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance they overcame this and cared for him59 the problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and treves gradually developed an understanding of merricks speech a new set of photographs was taken the question of merricks longterm care had to be addressed francis carr gomm the chairman of the hospital committee had supported treves in his decision to admit merrick but by november longterm plans needed to be made the london hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable which merrick clearly was59 carr gomm contacted other institutions and hospitals more suited to caring for chronic cases but none would accept merrick gomm wrote a letter to the times printed on 4 december outlining merricks case and asking readers for suggestions60 the public response—in letters and donations—was significant and the situation was even covered by the british medical journal61 with the financial backing of the many donors gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping merrick in the hospital it was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life62 he was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard the rooms were adapted and furnished to suit merrick with a specially constructed bed and—at trevess instruction—no mirrors63 merrick settled into his new life at the london hospital treves visited him daily and spent a couple of hours with him every sunday64 now that merrick had found someone who understood his speech he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor64 treves and merrick built a friendly relationship although merrick never completely confided in him he told treves that he was an only child and treves had the impression that merricks mother whose picture merrick always carried with him had abandoned him as a baby64 merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers65 it did not take treves long to realise that contrary to his initial impressions merrick was not intellectually impaired64 the only surviving letter written by merrick treves observed that merrick was very sensitive and showed his emotions easily66 at times merrick was bored and lonely and demonstrated signs of depression67 he had spent his entire adult life segregated from women first in the workhouse and then as an exhibit the women he met were either disgusted or frightened by his appearance68 his opinions about women were derived from his memories of his mother and what he read in books treves decided that merrick would like to be introduced to a woman and it would help him feel normal69 the doctor arranged for a friend of his named mrs leila maturin a young and pretty widow to visit merrick39 she agreed and with fair warning about his appearance she went to his rooms for an introduction the meeting was short as merrick quickly became overcome with emotion69 he later told treves that maturin had been the first woman ever to smile at him the first to shake his hand39 she kept in contact with him and a letter written by merrick to her thanking her for the gift of a book and a brace of grouse a pair of birds is the only surviving letter written by merrick70 this first experience of meeting a woman though brief instilled in merrick a new sense of selfconfidence71 he met other women during his life at the hospital and appeared taken with them all treves believed that merricks hope was to go to live at an institution for the blind where he might meet a woman who could not see his deformities71 merrick wanted to know about the real world and questioned treves on a number of topics one day he expressed a desire to see inside what he considered a real house and treves obliged taking him to visit his wimpole street townhouse and meet his wife72 at the hospital merrick filled his days with reading and constructing models of buildings out of card he entertained visits from treves and his house surgeons he rose each day in the afternoon and would leave his rooms to walk in the small adjacent courtyard after dark card church built by merrick a replica of mainz cathedral as a result of carr gomms letters to the times merricks case attracted the notice of londons high society one person who took a keen interest was actress madge kendal73 although she probably never met him in person she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for merrick74 she sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver to go to his rooms and teach him the craft75 other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however bringing gifts of photographs and books he reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows76 a young man charles taylor the son of the engineer responsible for modifying merricks rooms spent time with him sometimes playing the violin74 occasionally he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital when he was discovered he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses who feared that he might frighten the patients76 on 21 may 1887 two new buildings were completed at the hospital and the prince and princess of wales came to open them officially77 princess alexandra wished to meet the elephant man so after a tour of the hospital the royal party went to his rooms for an introduction the princess shook merricks hand and sat with him an experience that left him overjoyed78 she gave him a signed photograph of herself which became a prized possession and she sent him a christmas card each year39 on at least one occasion merrick was able to fulfil a longheld desire to visit the theatre79 treves with the help of madge kendal arranged for him to attend the christmas pantomime at the theatre royal drury lane treves sat with some nurses concealed in baroness burdettcoutts private box80 according to treves merrick was awed and enthralled the spectacle left him speechless so that if he were spoken to he took no heed39 for weeks following the show merrick talked about the pantomime reliving the story as if it had been real81 last yearsedit on three occasions merrick left the hospital and london on holiday spending a few weeks at a time in the countryside82 through elaborate arrangements that allowed merrick to board a train unseen and have an entire carriage to himself he travelled to northamptonshire to stay at fawsley hall the estate of lady knightley82 he stayed at the gamekeepers cottage and spent the days walking in the estates woods collecting wild flowers83 he befriended a young farm labourer who later recalled merrick as an interesting and welleducated man70 treves called this the one supreme holiday of merricks life although in fact there were three such trips3984 merricks condition gradually deteriorated during his four years at the london hospital he required a great deal of care from the nursing staff and spent much of his time in bed or sitting in his quarters with diminishing energy70 his facial deformities continued to grow and his head became even more enlarged he died on 11 april 1890 at the age of 2785 at around 300 pm trevess house surgeon visited merrick and found him lying dead across his bed his body was formally identified by his uncle charles merrick86 an inquest was held on 15 april by wynne edwin baxter who had come to notoriety conducting inquests for the whitechapel murders of 188885 he often said to me that he wished he could lie down to sleep like other people he must with some determination have made the experiment thus it came about that his death was due to the desire that had dominated his life—the pathetic but hopeless desire to be like other people —frederick treves39 merricks death was ruled accidental and the certified cause of death was asphyxia caused by the weight of his head as he lay down8788 treves who performed an autopsy on the body said that merrick had died of a dislocated neck88 knowing that merrick had always slept sitting upright out of necessity treves came to the conclusion that merrick must have made the experiment attempting to sleep lying down like other people3988 treves dissected merricks body and took plaster casts of his head and limbs he took skin samples which were later lost during the second world war and mounted his skeleton which remains in the pathology collection at the royal london hospital89 although the skeleton has never been on public display there is a small museum dedicated to his life housing some of his personal effects medical conditionedit the skeleton of joseph merrick ever since joseph merricks days as a novelty exhibit on whitechapel road his condition has been a source of curiosity for medical professionals his appearance at the meeting of the pathological society of london in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present but none of the answers nor the attention that treves had hoped for the case received only a brief mention in the british medical journal and the lancet declined to mention it at all90 four months later in 1885 treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time by then tom normans shop on whitechapel road had been closed and the elephant man had moved on without merrick treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations one of the doctors present at the meeting was henry radcliffe crocker a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases91 after hearing trevess description of merrick and viewing the photographs crocker proposed that merricks condition might be a combination of dermatolysis pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity all caused by changes in the nervous system49 crocker wrote about merricks case in his 1888 book diseases of the skin their description pathology diagnosis and treatment92 in 1909 dermatologist frederick parkes weber wrote an article about von recklinghausen disease in the british journal of dermatology93 erroneously citing merrick as an example of the disease which german pathologist friedrich daniel von recklinghausen had described in 188294 but in the last year has been found that this conjecture was wrong in fact symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones small warty growths on the skin95 and which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots96 however these spots were never observed on merricks body97 for this reason although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century other conjectural diagnosis were advanced such as those of who suffer maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia albrights disease97 in a 1986 article in the british medical journal michael cohen and jar tibbles put forward the theory that merrick had suffered from proteus syndrome a very rare congenital disorder recently identified by cohen in 1979 this explains why this diagnosis was not advanced previously citing merricks lack of reported café au lait spots and the absence of any histological proof that he had suffered from the previously conjectured syndrome98 in fact proteus syndrome affects tissue other than nerves and it is a sporadic disorder rather than a genetically transmitted disease99 cohen and tibbles said that merrick showed the following signs of proteus syndrome macrocephaly hyperostosis of the large skull hypertrophy of long bones and thickened skin and subcutaneous tissues particularly of the hands and feet including plantar hyperplasia lipomas and other unspecified subcutaneous masses98 in a letter to biologist in june 2001 british teacher and chartered biologist paul spiring100 speculated that merrick might have suffered from a combination of the two syndromes101 this hypothesis was reported by robert matthews a correspondent for the sunday telegraph102 the possibility that merrick had both conditions formed the basis for a 2003 documentary film entitled the curse of the elephant man that was produced for the discovery health channel by natural history new zealand103104 during 2002 genealogical research for the film led to a bbc appeal to trace merricks maternal family line in response to the appeal a leicester resident named pat selby was discovered to be the granddaughter of merricks uncle george potterton a research team took dna samples from selby in an unsuccessful attempt to diagnose merricks condition105 during 2003 the filmmakers commissioned further diagnostic tests using dna that was extracted from merricks hair and bone however the results of these tests proved inconclusive therefore the precise cause of merricks medical condition remains uncertain103104106 legacyedit in 1923 frederick treves published a volume the elephant man and other reminiscences in which he detailed what he knew of merricks life and their personal interactions this account is the source of much of what is known about merrick but there were several inaccuracies in the book merrick never completely confided in treves about his early life so these details were consequently sketchy in trevess reminiscences a more mysterious error is that of merricks first name treves in his earlier journal articles as well as his book insisted on calling him john merrick the reason for this is unclear merrick clearly signed his name as joseph in the examples of his handwriting that remain107 in the handwritten manuscript for the elephant man and other reminiscences treves began his account by writing joseph and then crossed it out and replaced it with john108 whatever the reason for the error it is one that persisted throughout much of the 20th century later biographers who based their work on trevess book have continued the error trevess depiction of tom norman the showman who had exhibited merrick was that of a cruel drunk who had ruthlessly exploited his charge109110 in a letter to the worlds fair newspaper and later in his own memoirs norman denied this characterisation and said that he provided his show attractions with a way of earning a living and that at the london hospital merrick was still on display but with no control over how or when he was viewed according to nadja durbach author of the spectacle of deformity freak shows and modern british culture normans view gives an insight into the victorian freak shows function as a means of survival for poor people with deformities as well as the attitude of medical professionals of the time111 durbach cautions that both trevess and normans memoirs must be understood as narrative reconstructions that reflect personal and professional prejudices and cater to the demands and expectations of their very different audiences112 in 1971 anthropologist ashley montagu published the elephant man a study in human dignity which drew on trevess book and explored merricks character113 montagu reprinted trevess account alongside various others such as carr gomms letter to the times and the report on merricks inquest he pointed out inconsistencies between the accounts and sometimes disputed trevess version of events he noted for example that while treves claimed merrick knew nothing of his mothers appearance carr gomm refers to merrick carrying a painting of his mother with him114 and he criticised trevess assumption that merricks mother was worthless and inhuman114 however montagu also perpetuated some of the errors in trevess work115 including his use of the name john rather than joseph114 in 1980 michael howell and peter ford published the true history of the elephant man presenting the fruits of their detailed archival research howell and ford brought to light a large amount of new information about merrick in addition to proving that his name was joseph not john they were able to describe in more detail his life story they refuted some of the inaccuracies in trevess account showing that merricks mother did not abandon him and that merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living tis true my form is something odd but blaming me is blaming god could i create myself anew i would not fail in pleasing you if i could reach from pole to pole or grasp the ocean with a span i would be measured by the soul the minds the standard of the man  —poem used by joseph merrick to end his letters adapted from false greatness by isaac watts10 between 1979 and 1982 merricks life story became
