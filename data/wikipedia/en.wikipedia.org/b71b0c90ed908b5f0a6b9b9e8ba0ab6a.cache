machine which was exported overseas the companys first 30 years focused on the development and production of these machinescitation needed despite the success of his looms suzuki believed that his company would benefit from diversification and he began to look at other products based on consumer demand he decided that building a small car would be the most practical new venture the project began in 1937 and within two years suzuki had completed several compact prototype cars these first suzuki motor vehicles were powered by a theninnovative liquidcooled fourstroke fourcylinder engine it had a cast aluminum crankcase and gearbox and generated 13 horsepower 97 kw from a displacement of less than 800cccitation needed with the onset of world war ii production plans for suzukis new vehicles were halted when the government declared civilian passenger cars a nonessential commodity at the conclusion of the war suzuki went back to producing looms loom production was given a boost

market collapsed in 1951citation needed faced with this colossal challenge suzuki returned to the production of motor vehicles after the war the japanese had a great need for affordable reliable
