i owed the video store 40 i had misplaced the cassette it was all my fault i didn’t want to tell my wife about it and i said to myself i’m going to compromise the integrity of my marriage over a late fee later on my way to the gym i realized they had a much better business model you could pay 30 or 40 a month and work out as little or as much as you wanted6 hastings said that when he founded netflix he had no idea whether customers would use the service7 netflix cultureedit after his experiences at pure atria hastings was concerned with the problems of growth if building an entertainment company was his public goal his private goal was to build a company that would grow rapidly without losing its entrepreneurial spirit in the process netflix was a testbed for his theories as netflix grew the company began getting noticed for its innovative management practices—the results of the culture hastings was exploring—called freedom and responsibility13 netflix is known to pay salaries that are typically much higher than customary to attract the best talent and is one of the few companies where employees can choose annually how much of their compensation they want in cash vs stock13 other innovations include their treatment of employees who dont meet expectations13 at most companies average performers get an average raise says hastings13 at netflix they get a generous severance package because that way managers dont feel too guilty to let average performers go13 the company also gained notoriety for eliminating sick and vacation time for employees and instead allowing them to manage this time off individually hastings would meet each new employee and discuss the culture and his theories about it over the years his personal presentation codified into a powerpoint slide deck that was widely shared internally reviewed and tweaked by upper management and refined actively in august 2009 hastings posted this internal culture guide publicly online it laid out hastings strongly held beliefs about workers and management the guide became a preemployment screening tool that dissuaded incompatible persons from applying17 as of january 2015 the deck has been viewed more than 105 million times17 internet televisionedit hastings is a proponent of internet television and sees it as the future18 he credits youtube for his shift in strategy for developing a video streaming service19 netflix launched a service in 2007 to stream movies and television to computers18 controversyedit in july 2011 netflix announced that subscription prices were changing that dvd rental prices would drop by 20 but that the initially free streaming service would now be charged for many customers this represented a savings but for the group that both received discs and enjoyed streaming it would result in a cost increase of up to 60 the move led to reported customer backlash cancellations lower than projected subscriber growth and a decline in stock price20 in response netflix admitted to poor public relations decisions in announcing the change21 but kept its policy in place two months later in september 2011 netflix announced that it would spin off its popular dvd business under a new brand name qwikster leading to customer and market confusion22 netflix reversed the decision less than a month later232425 during this time the companys stock value plummeted and

philanthropy and politics3 one of the issues hastings most strongly advocates is charter schools publicly funded elementary or secondary schools that have been freed from some of the rules regulations and statutes that apply to other public schools in exchange for some type of accountability for producing certain results which are set forth in each schools charter3 on july 11 2006 the santa cruz

elected school board member and former deputy mayor alturrick kenney and milwaukee wisconsin teachers union president bob peterson responded to hastings by saying that unelected school boards are not democratic they added that elected school boards are necessary to slowdown the process of privatization of public schools and that unelected school boards work to expand privately managed charter
