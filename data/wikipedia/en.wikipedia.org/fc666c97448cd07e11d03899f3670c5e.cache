of the moscow public museum and rumiantsev museum or the rumiantsev library it is nicknamed the leninka3 rumyantsev museum part of the complex was moscows first public museum and housed the art collection of count nikolai petrovich rumyantsev which had been given to the russian people and transferred from st petersburg to moscow its donation covered above all books and manuscripts as well as an extensive numismatic and an ethnographic collection these as well as approximately 200 paintings and more than 20000 prints which had been selected from the collection of the hermitage in st petersburg could be seen in the socalled pashkov house a palace established between 1784 and 1787 in the proximity of the kremlin tsar alexander ii of russia donated the painting the appearance of

building of the library view of the front entrance in 2007 in front is the monument to dostoevsky the citizens of moscow deeply impressed by the counts altruistic donation named the new museum after its founder and had the inscription from count rumyantsev for the good enlightenment carved above its entrance in the subsequent years the collection of the museum grew by numerous further donations of objects and money so that the museum soon housed a yet more important collection of western european paintings an extensive antique collection and a large collection of icons indeed the collection grew so much that soon the premises of the pashkov house became insufficient and a second building was built beside the museum shortly after the turn of the 20th century to house the paintings in particular after the october revolution the contents again grew enormously and again lack of space became an urgent problem acute financial problems also arose for most of the money to finance the museum flowed into the pushkin museum which had only been finished a few years before and was assuming the rumyantsev museums role therefore it was decided in 1925 to dissolve the rumyantsev museum and to spread its collections over other museums and institutions in the country part of the collections in particular the western european art and antiques were thus transferred to the pushkin museum
