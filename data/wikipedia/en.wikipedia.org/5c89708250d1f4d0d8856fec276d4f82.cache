numbering plan the north american numbering plan nanp is a telephone numbering plan that encompasses 25 distinct regions in twenty countries primarily in north america including the caribbean and the us territories not all north american countries participate in the nanp the nanp was originally devised in the 1940s by att for the bell system and independent telephone operators in north america to unify the diverse local numbering plans that had been established in the preceding decades att continued to administer the numbering plan until the breakup of the bell system when administration was delegated to the north american numbering plan administration nanpa a service that has been procured from the private sector by the federal communications commission fcc in the united states each participating country forms a regulatory authority that has plenary control over local numbering resources1 the fcc also serves as the us regulator canadian numbering decisions are made by the canadian numbering administration consortium the nanp divides the territories of its members into numbering plan areas npas which are encoded numerically with a threedigit telephone number prefix commonly called the area code2 each telephone is assigned a sevendigit telephone number unique only within its respective plan area the telephone number consists of a threedigit central office code and a fourdigit station number the combination of an area code and the telephone number serves as a destination routing address in the public switched telephone network pstn for international call

these systems expanded by growing their subscriber bases as well as increasing their service areas by implementing additional local exchanges that were interconnected with tie trunks it was the responsibility of each local administration to design telephone numbering plans that accommodated the local requirements and growth4 as a result the bell system as a whole developed into an unorganized system of many differing local numbering systems the diversity impeded the efficient operation and interconnection of exchanges into a nationwide system for longdistance telephone communication by the 1940s the bell system set out to unify the various numbering plans in existence and developed the north american numbering plan as a unified systematic approach to efficient longdistance service that eventually did not require the involvement of switchboard operators the new numbering plan was officially accepted in october 1947 dividing most of north america into 86 numbering plan areas npas each npa was assigned a numbering plan area code often abbreviated as area code these codes were first used by longdistance operators to establish longdistance calls between toll offices the first customerdialed direct call using area codes was made on november 10 1951 from englewood new jersey to alameda california5 direct distance dialing ddd was subsequently introduced across the country and by the early 1960s most areas of the bell system had been converted and it was commonplace in cities and most larger towns in the following decades the system expanded to include all of the united states and its territories canada bermuda and 17 nations of the caribbean67 by 1967 129 area codes had been assigned8 at the request of the british colonial office the numbering plan was first expanded to bermuda and the british west indies because of their historic telecommunications administration through canada as parts of the british empire and their continued associations with canada especially during the years of the telegraph and the all red line system not all north american countries participate in the nanp exceptions include mexico the central american countries and some caribbean countries cuba haiti and the french caribbean the only spanishspeaking state in the system is the dominican republic mexican participation was planned9 but implementation stopped after two area codes had been assigned and mexico opted for an international numbering format using country code 52 the area codes in use were withdrawn in 1991 by the nanpa area code 905 formerly for mexico city was reassigned to a split of area code 416 in the greater toronto area area code 706 formerly for northwest mexico was reassigned to northern georgia10 surrounding the atlanta region which retained 404 and area code 903 which also served a small portion of northern mexico was reassigned to northeastern texas when it split from area code 214 dutchspeaking sint maarten joined the nanp in september 201111 receiving area code 721 saint pierre and miquelon country code 508 and greenland 299 both north american possessions of european union nations use independent country codes that are distinct from those of their respective home countries france 33 and denmark 45 administrationedit the nanp is administered by the north american numbering plan administration nanpa12 today this function is overseen by the federal communications commission which assumed the responsibility upon the breakup of the bell system the fcc solicits private sector contracts for the role of the administrator initially the service was provided by a division of lockheed martin in 1997 the contract was awarded to neustar inc which was spun off from lockheed for this purpose in 2012 the contract was renewed until 201713 numbering planedit the vision and goal of the architects of the north american numbering plan was a system by which telephone subscribers in the united states and canada could themselves dial and establish a telephone call to any other subscriber without the assistance of switchboard operators while this required an expansion of most existing local numbering plans many of which required only four or five digits to be dialed or even fewer in small communities the plan was designed to enable local telephone companies to make as few changes as possible in their systems most subscribers should not have to dial a long full national telephone number to make a local telephone call numbering plan areas and central officesedit the new numbering plan divided the north american continent into regional service areas called numbering plan areas npa primarily based on the jurisdictional boundaries of us states and canadian provinces14 each npa was identified by a threedigit code number the numbering plan areas were created in accordance with principles that were deemed to maximize customer understanding and minimize the dialing effort while reducing plant cost15 the existing telephone exchanges and central offices became the local exchange points in the nationwide system and each was assigned a number of three digits which was unique in the numbering plan area but of similar form to all others these codes served as destination routing codes for use by operators and subscribers to reach any central office through the switching network14 the most populous states required division into multiple numbering plan areas as each npa was limited to 540 unique central office codes15 for example new york state was initially divided into five areas the most of any state followed by illinois ohio pennsylvania and texas with four npas each these divisions attempted to avoid cutting across heavy toll traffic routes so that most toll traffic remained within an area and outgoing traffic in one area would not be tributary to toll offices in an adjacent area1614 traditionally each central office could serve up to 10000 subscriber numbers resulting in a fourdigit line or station number thus the new numbering plan identified each telephone in the system with the combination of the area code the central office code and the line number resulting in a closed telephone numbering plan with a tendigit national telephone number for each telephone17 the leading part of this address was the area code three digits followed by the sevendigit subscriber number consisting of three digits for the central office and four digits for the station the intent was that subscribers should not have to dial an area code when making a local call or a call within their plan area resulting in sevendigit dialing area codes were only required in tendigit dialing when placing foreign area calls to subscribers in another state or numbering plan area international dialingedit while the national numbering plan of the nanp was designed as a 10digit closed plan international direct distance dialing iddd was accomplished by extensive modifications in switching systems to accommodate an open international numbering plan for telephone numbers from 7 to 12 digits18 initial numbering systemedit states that were divided into multiple areas were assigned area codes with a 1 in the middle the second position while areas that covered an entire state or province were numbered with the digit 0 as the middle digit in order to distinguish sevendigit dialing from tendigit dialing central office codes were restricted to not having a 0 or 1 in the middle position this was already common practice because the system of using the initial letters of central office names did not assign letters to digits 1 and 0 furthermore area codes and central office codes could not start with 0 or 1 because 0 was used for operator assistance and a leading single pulse ie the digit 1 was automatically ignored by most switching equipment of the time14 additionally the last two digits of an area code could not be the same so that the assignments n00 and n11 n 2–9 were reserved for special purposes as some central offices had been using them already for special services the area codes n10 were reserved similarly and most were used for the teletypewriter exchange service twx the central office code was chosen such that it could be represented by the first two letters of the central office name according to a digittoletter mapping that was printed on the face of a rotary dial by grouping a set of letters with the digits 2 through 9 such letter translations designed by wg blauvelt in 1917 had been used in the bell system in large metropolitan areas since the late 1910s19 the network reorganization eventually resulted in a 2letter 5digit 2l5n representation of telephone numbers for every exchange in north america the new network design completed in 1947 provided for 152 area codes each with a capacity to serve 540 central offices15 originally only 86 area codes were assigned new jersey received the first area code in the new system area code 20120 the second area code 202 was assigned to the district of columbia the allocation of area codes was readjusted as early as 1948 to account for inadequacies in some metropolitan areas for example indiana area code 317 was split to provide a larger number pool in the indiana suburbs of chicago area code 219 modern planedit in the late 1980s and early 1990s the nanpa implemented calling procedures that required all longdistance calls within an area code to be prefixed with the area code in an effort to make it possible to assign centraloffice prefixes with 0 or 1 in the middle position except for n11 which would otherwise be wrongly taken by the local telephone switch to be the area code as it had nearly run out of area codes using the existing assignment methods this expanded the number pool for each area code by nearly 25 and also allowed for the later addition of area codes with middle digits other than 0 or 1 requiring a 1 to be dialed before the full number in some areas also provided for area codes of the form n10 such as 210 in the san antonio texas area and 410 in eastern maryland therefore someone calling from san jose california to los angeles before the change would have dialed 2135550123 and after the change 12135550123 which permitted the use of 213 as an exchange prefix in the san jose area the preceding 1 also ideally indicates a toll call however this is inconsistent across the nanp because the fcc has left it to the us state public utilities commissions to regulate for traditional landlines and it has since become moot for mobile phones and digital voip services which now offer nationwide calling without the extra digit the nanp number format may be summarized in the notation npanxxxxxx component name number ranges notes npa numbering plan area code allowed ranges 2–9 for the first digit and 09 for the second and third digits when the second and third digits of an area code are the same that code is called an easily recognizable code erc ercs designate special services eg 888 for tollfree service the nanp is not assigning area codes with 9 as the second digit21 covers canada the united states parts of the caribbean sea and some atlantic and pacific islands the area code is often enclosed in parentheses nxx central office exchange code allowed ranges 2–9 for the first digit and 0–9 for both the second and third digits however in geographic area codes the third digit of the exchange cannot be 1 if the second digit is also 1 often considered part of a subscriber number the threedigit central office codes are assigned to a specific co serving its customers but may be physically dispersed by redirection or forwarding to mobile operators and other services xxxx subscriber number 0–9 for each of the four digits this unique fourdigit number is the subscriber number or station code for example 2342355678 is a valid telephone number with area code 234 central office prefix 235 and line number 5678 the number 2349115678 is invalid because the central office code must not be in the form n11 3141592653 is invalid because the office code must not begin with 1 1232345678 is invalid because the npa must not begin with 0 or 1 the country calling code for all countries participating in the nanp is 1 in international format an nanp number should be listed as 13015550100 where 301 is an area code maryland each threedigit area code has a capacity of 7919900 telephone numbers nxx may begin only with the digits 2–9 providing a base of 8 million numbers 8 × 100 × 10000 however the last two digits of nxx cannot both be 1 to avoid confusion with the n11 codescitation needed despite the widespread usage of nxx 555 for fictional telephone numbers—see 555 telephone number—today the only such numbers now specifically reserved for fictional use are 5550100 through 5550199 with the remaining 555 numbers released for actual assignment as information numbers subtract 100 in individual geographic area codes several other nxx prefixes are generally not assigned the home area codes adjacent domestic area codes and overlays area codes reserved for future relief nearby industry testing codes generally nxx 958 and 959 and special service codes such as nxx 950 and 976 various office codes in certain plan areas are deliberately not issued for example numbers 212718xxxx where 212 and 718 are both new york city area codes are typically avoided to prevent confusion between an area code and a similarly numbered local exchange in the same region 958xxxx and 959xxxx are usually test numbers using 0 or 1 as the first digit of an area code or sevendigit local number is invalid as is a 9 as the middle digit of an area code these are trunk prefixes or reserved for north american numbering plan expansion lists of exchanges in an individual area code posted by cnac in canada nanp in the united states all list various prefixes as deliberately not issued expansionedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed february 2014 learn how and when to remove this template message canada and the united states have experienced rapid growth in the number of area codes particularly between 1990 and 2005 there are two main reasons for this first there is the increasing demand for telephone services particularly resulting from widescale adoption of fax modem and mobile phone communications the second and more important reason is the telecom regulation of local telephone service in the united states beginning in the early to mid1990s at that time the federal communications commission began allowing telecommunication companies to compete with the incumbent local exchange carrier usually by forcing the existing sole service provider to lease infrastructure to other local providers who then resold the service to consumers however because of the original design of the numbering plan and telephone switching network that assumed only a single provider number allocations had to be made in 10000number blocks thus whenever a new local service provider entered a given market it would be allocated 10000 numbers by default even if the provider obtained only a few customers as more companies requested numbering allocations many area codes were faced with the problem of exhausting their number supply in telecom jargon such an area is in jeopardy many of the new telecom ventures were not successful while the number of area codes increased rapidly this did not always translate to a much larger number of telephone subscribers as large blocks of numbers remained unassigned because of the 10000number block allocation methodology when these telecom ventures were merged or terminated their blocks transferred to the successors or remained unused no regulatory mechanism existed to reclaim and reassign these underutilized blocks in general area codes are added by two methods splits and overlays splits were implemented by dividing a plan area into two or more regions one of which retained the existing area code and the other areas receiving a new code in an overlay multiple codes are assigned to the same geographical area obviating the need for any renumbering of existing services subtle variations of these techniques have been used as well such as dedicated overlays in which the new code is reserved for a particular type of service such as cellular phones and pagers and concentrated overlays in which a part of the area retained a single code while the rest of the region received an overlay code the only servicespecific overlay in the nanp was area code 917 new york city when it was first installed such servicespecific area code assignments were later prohibited by the federal communications commission most area codes of the form n10 originally reserved for atts teletypewriter exchange twx service were transferred to western union in 1969 and were freed up for other use in 1981 after conversion to telex ii service was complete the last of these 1610 was assigned to canada and liberated in 1992 these new area codes along with codes formerly used as aliases to mexican numbers were used for telephone area code splits in the late 1980s and early 1990s as all other area codes under the original plan had been consumed after the remaining valid area codes were used up by expansion in 1995 the rapid increase in the need for more area codes both splits and overlays forced nanpa to allow the digits 2 through 8 to be used as a middle digit in new area code assignments with 9 being reserved as a last resort for potential future expansion at the same time local exchanges were allowed to use 1 or 0 as a middle digit the first area codes without a 1 or 0 as the middle digit were area code 334 in alabama and area code 360 in washington which both began service on january 15 1995 this was quickly followed by area code 520 serving arizona on march 19 1995 codes ending in double digits are reserved as easily recognizable codes ercs to be used for special purposes such as tollfree numbers personal 500 numbers canadian nongeographic area code 600 carrierspecific 700 numbers and hightoll 900 numbers rather than for geographic areas nevada was denied 777 lucky 7s a reference to the states legalized gambling for this reason22 it received 775 instead when most of nevada split from 702 which continues to serve the las vegas metropolitan area area code splits and overlaysedit by 1995 many cities in the united states and canada had more than one area code either through splitting the city into different areas splits or having more than one code for the same area overlays for example in manhattan subscribers numbers had the npa code 212 but two additional codes—first 917 which initially was exclusively for cellular phones and pagers until that idea was struck down in a federal courtcitation needed then 646—were also introduced this means that the area code must be dialed even for local calls in other areas 10digit or 11digit dialing is now required for all local calls the transition to 10digit dialing typically starts with a permissive dialing phase in which 10digit dialing is optional during this period the transition is heavily publicized after a period of several months the mandatory dialing phase is introduced in which 7digit dialing no longer works atlanta was the first us city to require mandatory 10digit dialing throughout the metropolitan area roughly coinciding with the 1996 summer olympics held there atlanta was used as the test case not only because of its size but also because it enjoyed the worlds largest fiber optic network at the time five times that of new york then and it was home to bellsouth now part of att then the southeastern regional bell operating companycitation needed 7digit dialing nxx xxxx npa code not required 10digit dialing npa nxx xxxx 11digit dialing 1 npa nxx xxxx 1 is the nanp trunk prefix for long distance circuits expansion issuesedit depending on the techniques used for area code expansion the effect on telephone users varies in areas in which overlays were used this generally avoids the need for converting telephone numbers so existing directories business records letterheads business cards advertising and speeddialing settings can retain the same phone numbers while the overlay is used for new number allocations the primary impact on telephone users is the necessity of remembering and dialing 10 or 11digit numbers when only 7digit dialing was previously permissible splitting instead of overlaying generally avoids the requirement for mandatory areacode dialing but at the expense of having to convert a region to the new code in addition to the requirements of updating records and directories to accommodate the new numbers for efficient conversion this requires a period of permissive dialing in which the new and old codes are both allowed to work also many splittings involved significant technical issues especially when the area splittings occurred over boundaries other than phone network divisions in 1998 area code 612 which had covered the minneapolis – saint paul twin cities was split to create area code 651 for st paul and the eastern metropolitan area the minnesota public utilities commission mandated that the new boundary exactly follow municipal boundaries which were distinctly different from telephone exchange boundaries and that all subscribers keep their 7digit numbers these two goals were directly at odds with the reason for the split namely to provide additional phone numbers more than 40 exchanges had territory that straddled the new boundary as a result prefixes were duplicated in both area codes which counteracted much of the benefit of the splitting with only 200 of 700 prefixes in area 612 moving entirely to area 651 in less than two years area code 612 again exhausted its supply of phone numbers and required a threeway split in 2000 creating the new area codes 763 and 952 again the split followed political boundaries rather than rate center boundaries resulting in additional split prefixes a few numbers moved from 612 to 651 and then to 763 in less than two years decrease in expansion rateedit recognizing that the proliferation of area codes was largely due to the telecom regulation act and the assignment of numbers in blocks of 10000 the fcc instructed nanpa by then administered by neustar to alleviate the numbering shortage as a result number pooling was piloted in 2001 as a system for allocating local numbers to carriers in blocks of 1000 rather than 10000 because of the then design of the switched telephone network this was a considerable technical obstacle number pooling was implemented with another technical obstacle local number portability the program has been implemented in much of the united states by state regulators a limited number of cities have also implemented rate center consolidation fewer rate centers resulted in more efficient use of numbers as carriers would reserve blocks of 1000 or 10000 numbers in each of multiple rate centers in the same area even if they had relatively few clients in the area23 together with aggressive reclamation of unused number blocks from telecom providers number pooling has reduced the need for additional area codes so that many previously designated area splits and overlays have been postponed indefinitely there is no number pooling in canada number allocation remains highly inefficient as even the tiniest village is a rate center and every clec is assigned blocks of ten thousand numbers in every place it offers new local service as a result dialing seven digits even in remote locations like james bay is more likely to produce an intercept message dial the area code than an actual voice connection new area codes outside the united states and canadaedit before 1995 all nanp countries and territories outside the contiguous united states alaska hawaii and canada shared the area code 809 this included puerto rico and the us virgin islands each has since been assigned one or more distinct numbering plan areas code 809 is

estimates that the existing numbering system is sufficient until 2044 based on the assumption that a maximum of 667 npas continue to be available and that on the average 4400 central office codes are needed per year24 various plans are discussed for expanding the numbering plan to provide relief after exhaustion one plan being considered adds digit 1 or 0 either to the beginning or to the end of the area code or the beginning of the sevendigit subscriber number this would require 11digit dialing even for local calls between any two nanp numberscitation needed in another proposal existing

dialing may be permissible in areas with single area codes25 depending on the requirement of toll alerting it may be necessary to prefix a telephone numbers with 1 the nanpa publishes dial plan information for individual area codes26 the standard dial plans in most cases are as follows local within area code local outside area code toll within area code toll outside area code single code

uncommon today requires central office code protection locally if using toll alerting across the entire area code otherwise to avoid assignment of the same sevendigit number on both sides most areas permit local calls as 110d except for texas georgia and some jurisdictions in canada which require that landline callers know which numbers are local and which are toll dialing 10d for local calls and

an asterisk symbol are intended for use on touchtone telephones whereas the fourdigit numbers prefixed 11xx are intended for use on rotary dial telephones where the touchtone symbol is not available not all nanp countries use the same codes for example the emergency telephone number is not always 911 trinidad and tobago and dominica uses 999 as in the united kingdom the country of barbados uses 211 for police force 311 for fire and 511 for ambulance while jamaica uses 114 for directory assistance 119 for police force and 110 for fire and ambulance services despite its early importance as a share of the worldwide telephone system few of the nanps codes such as 911 have been adopted outside the system determining that 911 requires unnecessary rotation time on rotary dial telephones the european union has adopted its own standardized number of 112 while countries in asia and the rest of the world use a variety of other two or threedigit emergency telephone number combinations the 112 code is gaining prevalence because of its preprogrammed presence in mobile telephones that conform to the european gsm standard the european union and many other countries have chosen the international telecommunication unions 00 as their international access number instead of 011 the tollfree prefix 800 has been widely adopted elsewhere including as the international tollfree country

them smscapable devices have all 26 letters the alphabet is apportioned to the buttons as follows no letters are typically mapped to keys 1 and 0 although some corporate voicemail systems use 1 for q and z and some old telephones assigned the z to the digit 0 originally this scheme was used as a mnemonic device for telephone number prefixes when telephone numbers in the united states were standardized in the mid20th century to seven digits the first two digits of the exchange prefix were expressed as letters rather than numbers using the telephone exchange name before world war ii the largest cities used three letters and four or five numbers while in most cities with customer dialing phone numbers had only six digits 2l4n the prefix was a name and the first two or three letters usually shown in capital letters were dialed later the third letter where implemented was replaced by a digit or an extra digit was added this generally happened after world war ii although new york city converted already in 1930 the adoption of sevendigit local numbers 2l5n was chosen as the requirement for direct distance dialing and progressively deployed starting the late 1940s thus the famous glenn miller tune pennsylvania 65000 refers to telephone number pe65000 a number still in service at the hotel pennsylvania 212 7365000 in new york similarly the classic film butterfield 8 is set in the east side of manhattan between roughly 64th and 86th streets where the telephone prefixes include 288 in some works of fiction phone numbers will begin with klondike 5 or klamath 5 which translates to 555 an exchange that is reserved for information numbers in north america the letter system was phased out beginning before 1965 although it persisted ten years later in some places it was included in bell of pennsylvania directories until 1983 even today some businesses still display a 2l5n number in advertisements eg the belvedere construction company in detroit michigan not only still uses the 2l5n format for its number tyler 87100 it uses the format for the tollfree number 1800ty87100 despite the phasing out of the letter system otherwise alphabetic phonewords remain as a commercial mnemonic gimmick particularly for tollfree numbers for example one can dial 1800flowers to send flowers to someone or 1800dentist to find a local dentist sometimes longer phonewords are used — for example one might be invited to give money to a public radio station by dialing 1866kpbsgive the number is eight digits long but only the first seven need be dialed if an eighth or more digit is dialed the landline switching system will ignore it mobile and voip users may need to manually drop any numbers past the seventh digit as some mobile switching systems will not automatically ignore them resulting in a failed call also some users of smartphones can have difficulty dialing phonewords as some of those devices do not have the apportioned letters on the keys used for dialing this can be avoided by accompanying the use of phonewords with the actual numeric phone number allowing users of such smartphones to dial using the numeric phone number some smartphones permit dialing phonewords by holding down a special function key such as alt in the case of the blackberry while pressing another key on the qwerty pad in addition to commercial uses alphabetic dialing has occasionally influenced the choice of regional area codes in the united states for example when area 423 east tennessee was split in 1999 the region surrounding knoxville was assigned area code 865 chosen to represent the word vol volunteers the nickname of tennessee the volunteer state as well as athletic teams at the university of tennessee2728 several caribbean area codes were chosen as an alphabetic abbreviation of the country name which are indicated in the table of nanp regions cellular servicesedit the north american numbering plan does not set aside special nongeographic area codes exclusively for cellular phones only one regional exception exists in area code 600 in canada in many other national numbering plans outside the nanp mobile services are assigned separate prefixes cell phone numbers in the nanp are allocated within each area code from special central office prefixes and calls to them are billed at the same rate as any other call consequently the caller pays pricing model adopted in other countries in which calls to cellular phones are charged at a higher nationwide rate but incoming mobile calls are not charged to the mobile user could not be implemented instead north american cellular telephone subscribers are also generally charged for receiving calls subscriber pays this has discouraged mobile users from publishing their telephone number however price competition among carriers has reduced the average price per call minute for contract customers for both inbound and outbound calls which compare favorably to those in callerpays countriescitation needed most users select bundle pricing plans that include an allotment of minutes expected to be used in the billing period of the four major national carriers in the united states all four att sprint tmobile verizon offer free calling between mobile phones on the carriers network and sprint also offers its customers free calling to mobile phones on other networkscitation needed industry observers have attributed the relatively low mobile phone penetration rate in the united states compared to that of europe to the subscriberpays modelcitation needed in this model the convenience of the mobility is charged to the subscriber callers from outside the localcalling region of the assigned number however pay for a longdistance call although domestic longdistance rates are generally lower than the rates in callerpays systems conversely an advantage of callerpays is the relative absence of telemarketing and nuisance calls to mobile numbers the integrated numbering plan also enables local number portability between fixed and wireless services within a region allowing users to switch to mobile service while keeping their telephone number the initial plan for area code overlays did allow for providing separate area codes for use by mobile devices although these were still assigned to a specific geographical area and were charged at the same rate as other area codes initially the area code 917 for new york city was specifically assigned for this purpose within the boroughs however a federal court overturned the practice and the use of an area code for a specific telephony purposecitation needed since mobile telephony has been expanding faster than landline use new area codes typically have a disproportionately large fraction of mobile and nomadic numbers although landline and other services rapidly follow and local network portability can blur these distinctions the experience of hurricane katrina and similar events revealed a possible disadvantage of the methods employed in the geographic assignment of cellular numbers many mobile phone users could not be reached even when they were far from the stricken areas because the routing of calls to their phones depended on equipment in the affected area they could make calls but not receive themcitation needed the use of geographic numbers may also lead to tromboning one can take a handset with a vancouver number into st johns and outbound calls to st johns numbers while in that city will be local but incoming calls must make the crosscountry trip to vancouver and back this adds costs for subscribers as an 8000 km crosscountry call as a worst case incurs longdistance tolls in both directions amps subscribers used to be provided with a local number such as 1npanxxroam in each city allowing them to be reached by dialing that number plus the tendigit mobile telephone number this is no longer supported number portabilityedit the telecommunications act of 1996 47 usc § 251 b2 authorizes the federal communications commission fcc to require all local exchange carriers lecs to offer local number portability29 the fcc regulations were enacted on june 27 1996 and changes were to take effect in the 100 largest metropolitan statistical areas by october 1 1997 and elsewhere by december 31 199830 tollfree telephone numbers area codes 800 888 877 866 855 and 844 have been portable through the resporg system since 199331 the north american numbering council nanc was directed to select the local number portability administrators lnpas also referred to as the number portability administrator32 akin to the north american numbering plan administrator nanpa33 toll chargesedit calls between different countries and territories of the nanp are not typically charged as domestic calls however calls between the united states and canada are considered domestic but are typically charged at higher rates than calls to most domestic areascitation needed calls to other destinations in the nanp are often charged at overseas rates even on flatrate plans in the united states and canada for example it generally costs more to call bermuda from the united states than it does to call the uk or japan even though the dialing format is the same as the domestic formatcitation needed similarly calls from bermuda to us numbers including tollfree 1800 incur high international rates this was because many of the island nations at the time implemented a plan of subsidizing the cost of local phone services by directly charging higher pricing levies on international longdistance servicescitation needed because of these higher fees scams had taken advantage of customers unfamiliarity with pricing structure to call the legacy regional area code 809 some scams lured customers from the united states and canada into placing expensive calls to the caribbean by representing area code 809 as a regular domestic lowcost or tollfree call the split of 809 which formerly covered all of the caribbean nanp points into multiple new area codes created many new unfamiliar prefixes which could be mistaken for us or canada domestic area codes but carried high tariffs in various island nations premium exchanges such as 1876hot 1876wet or 1876sex where 876 is jamaica became a means to circumvent consumerprotection laws governing area code 900 or similar usdomestic premium numbers these scams are on the decline with many of the cable and wireless service monopolies being opened up to competition hence bringing rates down additionally many caribbean territories have implemented local government agencies to regulate telecommunications rates of providers3435 fictional telephone numbersedit main article 555 telephone number american television programs and films often use the central office code 555 or klamath 5 and klondike 5 in older movies and shows for fictitious telephone numbers to prevent disturbing actual telephone subscribers if anyone is tempted to dial a telephone number seen on screen occasionally valid telephone numbers are used in contexts such as songs with varying intents and consequences an example is the 1981 song 8675309jenny by tommy tutone which is the cause of a large number of calls36 not all numbers beginning with 555 are fictional for example 5551212 is the standard number for directory assistance only 5550100 through 5550199 are reserved for fictional use where used these are often routed to information services canadian telephone companies briefly promoted 5551313 as a payperuse name that number
