part of the united kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of great britain161718 it shares a border with england to the south and is otherwise surrounded by the atlantic ocean with the north sea to the east and the north channel and irish sea to the southwest in addition to the mainland the country is made up of more than 790 islands19 including the northern isles and the hebrides the kingdom of scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the early middle ages and continued to exist until 1707 by inheritance in 1603 james vi king of scots became king of england and king of ireland thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the kingdom of england on 1 may 1707 to create the new kingdom of great britain2021 the union also created a new parliament of great britain which succeeded both the parliament of scotland and the parliament of england in 1801 great britain itself entered into a political union with the kingdom of ireland to create the united kingdom of great britain and ireland22 within scotland the monarchy of the united kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the preunion kingdom of scotland the legal system within scotland has also remained separate from those of england and wales and northern ireland scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law23 the continued existence of legal educational religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the uk have all contributed to the continuation of scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with england24 in 1997 a scottish parliament was reestablished in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members having authority over many areas of domestic policy25 scotland is represented in the united kingdom parliament by 59 mps and in the european parliament by 6 meps26

history main article history of scotland etymology main article etymology of scotland scotland comes from scoti the latin name for the gaels the late latin word scotia land of the gaels was initially used to refer to ireland29 by the 11th century at the latest scotia was being used to refer to gaelicspeaking scotland north of the river forth alongside albania or albany both derived from the gaelic alba30 the use of the words scots and scotland to encompass all of what is now scotland became common in the late middle ages20 early history main article prehistoric scotland see also timeline of prehistoric scotland repeated glaciations which covered the entire land mass of modern scotland destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the mesolithic period it is believed the first postglacial groups of huntergatherers arrived in scotland around 12800 years ago as the ice sheet retreated after the last glaciation3132 scara brae a neolithic settlement located on the west coast of mainland orkney the groups of settlers began building the first known permanent houses on scottish soil around 9500 years ago and the first villages around 6000 years ago the wellpreserved village of skara brae on the mainland of orkney dates from this period neolithic habitation burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the northern isles and western isles where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone33 the 2009 discovery in scotland of a 4000yearold tomb with burial treasures at forteviot near perth the capital of a pictish kingdom in the 8th and 9th centuries ad is unrivalled anywhere in britain it contains the remains of an early bronze age ruler laid out on white quartz pebbles and birch bark it was also discovered for the first time that early bronze age people placed flowers in their graves3435 scotland may have been part of a late bronze age maritime trading culture called the atlantic bronze age which included other celtic nations and the areas that became england france spain and portugal36373839 in the winter of 1850 a severe storm hit scotland causing widespread damage and over 200 deaths40 in the bay of skaill the storm stripped the earth from a large irregular knoll known as skerrabra when the storm cleared local villagers found the outline of a village consisting of a number of small houses without roofs4041 william watt of skaill the local laird began an amateur excavation of the site but after uncovering four houses the work was abandoned in 186841 the site remained undisturbed until 1913 when during a single weekend the site was plundered by a party with shovels who took away an unknown quantity of artefacts40 in 1924 another storm swept away part of one of the houses and it was determined the site should be made secure and more seriously investigated40 the job was given to university of edinburghs professor vere gordon childe who travelled to skara brae for the first time in mid192740 roman influence main article scotland during the roman empire one part of a distance slab found at boness dated ca ad 142 depicting roman cavalryman trampling caledonians original at the nms with a full replica at boness42 the written protohistory of scotland began with the arrival of the roman empire in southern and central great britain when the romans occupied what is now england and wales administering it as a province called britannia roman invasions and occupations of southern scotland were a series of brief interludes according to the roman historian tacitus the caledonians turned to armed resistance on a large scale attacking roman forts and skirmishing with their legions in a surprise nightattack the caledonians very nearly wiped out the whole 9th legion until it was saved by agricolas cavalry43 in ad 83–84 the general gnaeus julius agricola defeated the caledonians at the battle of mons graupius tacitus wrote that before the battle the caledonian leader calgacus gave a rousing speech in which he called his people the last of the free and accused the romans of making the world a desert and calling it peace freely translated43 after the roman victory roman forts were briefly set along the gask ridge close to the highland line only cawdor near inverness is known to have been constructed beyond that line three years after the battle the roman armies had withdrawn to the southern uplands44 the romans erected hadrians wall to control tribes on both sides of the wall45 so the limes britannicus became the northern border of the roman empire although the army held the antonine wall in the central lowlands for two short periods – the last during the reign of emperor septimius severus from 208 until 21046 the roman military occupation of a significant part of what is now northern scotland lasted only about 40 years although their influence on the southern section of the country occupied by brythonic tribes such as the votadini and damnonii would still have been considerable between the first and fifth centuries the welsh term hen ogledd old north is used by scholars to describe what is now the north of england and the south of scotland during its habitation by brittonicspeaking people around ad 500 to 80045 according to writings from the 9th and 10th centuries the gaelic kingdom of dál riata was founded in the 6th century in western scotland4748 the traditional view is that settlers from ireland founded the kingdom bringing gaelic language and culture with them however some archaeologists have argued against this view saying there is no archaeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites49 middle ages main articles scotland in the early middle ages scotland in the high middle ages and scotland in the late middle ages the class i pictish stone at aberlemno known as aberlemno 1 or the serpent stone the kingdom of the picts based in fortriu by the 6th century was the state that eventually became known as alba or scotland the development of pictland according to the historical model developed by peter heather was a natural response to roman imperialism50 another view places emphasis on the battle of dun nechtain and the reign of bridei m beli 671–693 with another period of consolidation in the reign of óengus mac fergusa 732–76151 the kingdom of the picts as it was in the early 8th century when bede was writing was largely the same as the kingdom of the scots in the reign of alexander i 1107–1124 however by the tenth century the pictish kingdom was dominated by what we can recognise as gaelic culture and had developed a traditional story of an irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty cináed mac ailpín kenneth macalpin525354 from a base of territory in eastern scotland north of the river forth and south of the river oykel the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south by the 12th century the kings of alba had added to their territories the englishspeaking land in the southeast and attained overlordship of gaelicspeaking galloway and norsespeaking caithness by the end of the 13th century the kingdom had assumed approximately its modern borders however processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured scotland looked very different in the later middle ages the push for this change was the reign of david i and the davidian revolution feudalism government reorganisation and the first legally recognised towns called burghs began in this period these institutions and the immigration of french and anglofrench knights and churchmen facilitated cultural osmosis whereby the culture and language of the lowlying and coastal parts of the kingdoms original territory in the east became like the newly acquired southeast englishspeaking while the rest of the country retained the gaelic language apart from the northern isles of orkney and shetland which remained under norse rule until 1468555657 the scottish state entered a largely successful and stable period between the 12th and 14th centuries there was relative peace with england trade and educational links were well developed with the continent and at the height of this cultural flowering john duns scotus was one of europes most important and influential philosophers the wallace monument commemorates william wallace the 13thcentury scottish hero the death of alexander iii in march 1286 followed by that of his granddaughter margaret maid of norway broke the centuriesold succession line of scotlands kings and shattered the 200year golden age that began with david i edward i of england was asked to arbitrate between claimants for the scottish crown and he organised a process known as the great cause to identify the most legitimate claimant john balliol was pronounced king in the great hall of berwick castle on 17 november 1292 and inaugurated at scone on 30 november st andrews day edward i who had coerced recognition as lord paramount of scotland the feudal superior of the realm steadily undermined johns authority58 in 1294 balliol and other scottish lords refused edwards demands to serve in his army against the french instead the scottish parliament sent envoys to france to negotiate an alliance scotland and france sealed a treaty on 23 october 1295 known as the auld alliance 1295–1560 war ensued and king john was deposed by edward who took personal control of scotland andrew moray and william wallace initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to english rule in what became known as the wars of scottish independence 1296–132859 the nature of the struggle changed significantly when robert the bruce earl of carrick killed his rival john comyn on 10 february 1306 at greyfriars kirk in dumfries60 he was crowned king as robert i less than seven weeks later robert i battled to restore scottish independence as king for over 20 years beginning by winning scotland back from the norman english invaders piece by piece victory at the battle of bannockburn in 1314 proved the scots had regained control of their kingdom in 1315 edward bruce brother of the king was briefly appointed high king of ireland during an ultimately unsuccessful scottish invasion of ireland aimed at strengthening scotlands position in its wars against england in 1320 the worlds first documented declaration of independence the declaration of arbroath won the support of pope john xxii leading to the legal recognition of scottish sovereignty by the english crown however war with england continued for several decades after the death of bruce a civil war between the bruce dynasty and their longterm comynballiol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century although the bruce dynasty was successful david iis lack of an heir allowed his halfnephew robert ii to come to the throne and establish the stewart dynasty5661 the stewarts ruled scotland for the remainder of the middle ages the country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the scottish renaissance to the reformation this was despite continual warfare with england the increasing division between highlands and lowlands and a large number of royal minorities6162 this period was the height of the francoscottish alliance the scots guard – la garde écossaise – was founded in 1418 by charles vii of france the scots soldiers of the garde écossaise fought alongside joan of arc against england during the hundred years war63 in march 1421 a francoscots force under john stewart 2nd earl of buchan and gilbert de lafayette defeated a larger english army at the battle of baugé three years later at the battle of verneuil the french and scots lost around 7000 men64 the scottish intervention contributed to frances victory in the war early modern era main article scotland in the early modern era james vi succeeded to the english and irish thrones in 1603 in 1502 james iv of scotland signed the treaty of perpetual peace with henry vii of england he also married henrys daughter margaret tudor setting the stage for the union of the crowns for henry the marriage into one of europes most established monarchies gave legitimacy to the new tudor royal line65 a decade later james made the fateful decision to invade england in support of france under the terms of the auld alliance he was the last british monarch to die in battle at the battle of flodden66 within a generation the auld alliance was ended by the treaty of edinburgh france agreed to withdraw all land and naval forces in the same year 1560 john knox realised his goal of seeing scotland become a protestant nation and the scottish parliament revoke papal authority in scotland67 mary queen of scots a catholic and former queen of france was forced to abdicate in 156768 in 1603 james vi king of scots inherited the thrones of the kingdom of england and the kingdom of ireland and became king james i of england and ireland and left edinburgh for london69 with the exception of a short period under the protectorate scotland remained a separate state but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the covenanters over the form of church government the glorious revolution of 1688–89 saw the overthrow of king james vii of scotland and ii of england by the english parliament in favour of william iii and mary ii in common with countries such as france norway sweden and finland scotland experienced famines during the 1690s mortality reduced childbirths and increased emigration reduced the population of parts of the country by between 10 and 15 per cent70 in 1698 the company of scotland attempted a project to secure a trading colony on the isthmus of panama almost every scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the darien scheme its failure bankrupted these landowners but not the burghs nevertheless the nobles bankruptcy along with the threat of an english invasion played a leading role in convincing the scots elite to back a union with england7172 on 22 july 1706 the treaty of union was agreed between representatives of the scots parliament and the parliament of england and the following year twin acts of union were passed by both parliaments to create the united kingdom of great britain with effect from 1 may 170721 there was popular opposition and antiunion riots in edinburgh glasgow and elsewhere7374 18th century david moriers depiction of the battle of culloden with trade tariffs with england now abolished trade blossomed especially with colonial america the clippers belonging to the glasgow tobacco lords were the fastest ships on the route to virginia until the american war of independence in 1776 glasgow was the worlds premier tobacco port dominating world trade75 the disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the scottish lowlands and the ancient clans of the scottish highlands grew amplifying centuries of division the deposed jacobite stuart claimants had remained popular in the highlands and northeast particularly amongst nonpresbyterians including roman catholics and episcopalian protestants however two major jacobite risings launched in 1715 and 1745 failed to remove the house of hanover from the british throne the threat of the jacobite movement to the united kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the battle of culloden great britains last pitched battle this defeat paved the way for largescale removals of the indigenous populations of the highlands and islands known as the highland clearances the scottish enlightenment and the industrial revolution made scotland into an intellectual commercial and industrial powerhouse76–so much so voltaire said we look to scotland for all our ideas of civilisation77 with the demise of jacobitism and the advent of the union thousands of scots mainly lowlanders took up numerous positions of power in politics civil service the army and navy trade economics colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent british empire historian neil davidson notes after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by scots in political life particularly outside scotland davidson also states far from being peripheral to the british economy scotland – or more precisely the lowlands – lay at its core78 19th century main article scotland in the modern era shipping on the clyde by john atkinson grimshaw 1881 the scottish reform act 1832 increased the number of scottish mps and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes79 from the midcentury there were increasing calls for home rule for scotland and the post of secretary of state for scotland was revived80 towards the end of the century prime ministers of scottish descent included william gladstone81 and the earl of rosebery82 in the later 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by keir hardies success in the mid lanarkshire byelection 1888 leading to the foundation of the scottish labour party which was absorbed into the independent labour party in 1895 with hardie as its first leader83 glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world and known as the second city of the empire after london84 after 1860 the clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron after 1870 made of steel which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world it became the worlds preeminent shipbuilding centre85 the industrial developments while they brought work and wealth were so rapid that housing townplanning and provision for public health did not keep pace with them and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad with overcrowding high infant mortality and growing rates of tuberculosis86 walter scott whose waverley novels helped define scottish identity in the 19th century while the scottish enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century87 disproportionately large scottish contributions to british science and letters continued for another 50 years or more thanks to such figures as the physicists james clerk maxwell and lord kelvin and the engineers and inventors james watt and william murdoch whose work was critical to the technological developments of the industrial revolution throughout britain88 in literature the most successful figure of the mid19th century was walter scott his first prose work waverley in 1814 is often called the first historical novel89 it launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise scottish cultural identity90 in the late 19th century a number of scottishborn authors achieved international reputations such as robert louis stevenson arthur conan doyle j m barrie and george macdonald91 scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture the glasgow school which developed in the late 19th century and flourished in the early 20th century produced a distinctive blend of influences including the celtic revival the arts and crafts movement and japonisme which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental europe and helped define the art nouveau style proponents included architect and artist charles rennie mackintosh92 this period saw a process of rehabilitation for highland culture in the 1820s as part of the romantic revival tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite not just in scotland but across europe9394 prompted by the popularity of macphersons ossian cycle9596 and then walter scotts waverley novels97 however the highlands remained very poor and traditional98 the desire to improve agriculture and profits led to the highland clearances in which much of the population of the highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed principally so that they could be used for sheep farming the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout britain but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing the lack of legal protection for yearbyyear tenants under scots law the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system and the brutality of many evictions99 one result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities or further afield to england canada america or australia100 the population of scotland grew steadily in the 19th century from 1608000 in the census of 1801 to 2889000 in 1851 and 4472000 in 1901101 even with the development of industry there were not enough good jobs as a result during the period 1841–1931 about 2 million scots migrated to north america and australia and another 750000 scots relocated to england102 the disruption assembly painted by david octavius hill after prolonged years of struggle in the kirk in 1834 the evangelicals gained control of the general assembly and passed the veto act which allowed congregations to reject unwanted intrusive presentations to livings by patrons the following ten years conflict of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the nonintrusionists in the civil courts the result was a schism from the church by some of the nonintrusionists led by dr thomas chalmers known as the great disruption of 1843 roughly a third of the clergy mainly from the north and highlands formed the separate free church of scotland103 in the late 19th century growing divisions between fundamentalist calvinists and theological liberals resulted in a further split in the free church as the rigid calvinists broke away to form the free presbyterian church in 1893104 catholic emancipation in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of irish immigrants particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s mainly to the growing lowland centres like glasgow led to a transformation in the fortunes of catholicism in 1878 despite opposition a roman catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country and catholicism became a significant denomination within scotland104 industrialisation urbanisation and the disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools from 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship and in 1872 scotland moved to a system like that in england of statesponsored largely free schools run by local school boards105 the historic university of glasgow became a leader in british higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes as opposed to the upper class106 the university of st andrews pioneered the admission of women to scottish universities from 1892 scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century107 early 20th century royal scots with a captured japanese hinomaru yosegaki flag burma 1945 scotland played a major role in the british effort in the first world war it especially provided manpower ships machinery fish and money108 with a population of 48 million in 1911 scotland sent over half a million men to the war of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease and 150000 were seriously wounded109 field marshal sir douglas haig was britains commander on the western front the war saw the emergence of a radical movement called red clydeside led by militant trades unionists formerly a liberal stronghold the industrial districts switched to labour by 1922 with a base among the irish catholic working class districts women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues however the reds operated within the labour party and had little influence in parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s110 the shipbuilding industry expanded by a third and expected renewed prosperity but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 and it did not fully recover until 1939 the interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas and high unemployment111 indeed the war brought with it deep social cultural economic and political dislocations thoughtful scots pondered their declension as the main social indicators such as poor health bad housing and longterm mass unemployment pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best or even a downward spiral service abroad on behalf of the empire lost its allure to ambitious young people who left scotland permanently the heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem and no one offered workable solutions the despair reflected what finlay 1994 describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the second world war112 during the second world war scotland was targeted by nazi germany largely due to its factories ship yards and coal mines113 cities such as glasgow and edinburgh were targeted by german bombers as were smaller towns mostly located in the central belt of the country113 perhaps the most significant airraid in scotland was the clydebank blitz of march 1941 which intended to destroy naval shipbuilding in the area114 528 people were killed and 4000 homes totally destroyed114 rudolf hess deputy führer of nazi germany crashed his plane at bonnyton moor in the scottish central belt in an attempt to make peace perhaps scotlands most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when rudolf hess flew to renfrewshire possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the duke of hamilton115 before his departure from germany hess had given his adjutant karlheinz pintsch a letter addressed to hitler that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the british pintsch delivered the letter to hitler at the berghof around noon on 11 may116 albert speer later said hitler described hesss departure as one of the worst personal blows of his life as he considered it a personal betrayal117 hitler worried that his allies italy and japan would perceive hesss act as an attempt by hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the british as in world war i scapa flow in orkney served as an important royal navy base attacks on scapa flow and rosyth gave raf fighters their first successes downing bombers in the firth of forth and east lothian118 the shipyards and heavy engineering factories in glasgow and clydeside played a key part in the war effort and suffered attacks from the luftwaffe enduring great destruction and loss of life119 as transatlantic voyages involved negotiating northwest britain scotland played a key part in the battle of the north atlantic120 shetlands relative proximity to occupied norway resulted in the shetland bus by which fishing boats helped norwegians fled the nazis and expeditions across the north sea to assist resistance121 scottish industry came out of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity absorbing unemployed men and many women as well the shipyards were the centre of more activity but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the british bombers tanks and warships119 agriculture prospered as did all sectors except for coal mining which was operating mines near exhaustion real wages adjusted for inflation rose 25 per cent and unemployment temporarily vanished increased income and the more equal distribution of food obtained through a tight rationing system dramatically improved the health and nutrition the average height of 13yearolds in glasgow increased by 2 inches122 modern day the official reconvening of the scottish parliament in july 1999 with donald dewar then first minister of scotland left with queen elizabeth ii centre and presiding officer sir david steel right after 1945 scotlands economic situation worsened due to overseas competition inefficient industry and industrial disputes123 only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance economic factors contributing to this recovery included a resurgent financial services industry electronics manufacturing see silicon glen124 and the north sea oil and gas industry125 the introduction in 1989 by margaret thatchers government of the community charge widely known as the poll tax one year before the rest of great britain126 contributed to a growing movement for scottish control over domestic affairs127 following a referendum on devolution proposals in 1997 the scotland act 1998128 was passed by the uk parliament which established a devolved scottish parliament and scottish government with responsibility for most laws specific to scotland129 the scottish parliament was reconvened in edinburgh on 4 july 1999130 the first first minister of scotland was donald dewar who served until his sudden death in 2000131 the scottish parliament building at holyrood itself did not open until october 2004 after lengthy construction delays and running over budget132 the scottish parliament has a form of proportional representation the additional member system which normally results in no one party having an overall majority the proindependence scottish national party led by alex salmond achieved this in the 2011 election winning 69 of the 129 seats available133 the success of the snp in achieving a majority in the scottish parliament paved the way for the september 2014 referendum on scottish independence the majority voted against the proposition with 55 voting no to independence134 more powers particularly in relation to taxation were devolved to the scottish parliament after

typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of double jeopardy there is however the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to pervert the course of justice – see the provisions of the double jeopardy scotland act 2011 many laws differ between scotland and the other parts of the united kingdom and many terms differ for certain legal
