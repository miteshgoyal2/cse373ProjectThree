resulted in arrests of strikers build up of the first red scare the seattle general strike of 1919 was a fiveday general work stoppage by more than 65000 workers in the city of seattle washington which lasted from february 6 to february 11 of that year dissatisfied workers in several unions began the strike to gain higher wages after two years of world war i wage controls most other local unions including members of the american federation of labor afl and the industrial workers of the world iww joined the walkout although the strike was nonviolent and lasted less than a week government officials the press and much of the public viewed the strike as a radical attempt to subvert us institutions some commentators raised alarm by calling it the work of bolsheviks and other radicals inspired by unamerican ideologies making it the first concentrated eruption of the antired hysteriacitation needed that characterized the red scare of 1919 and 1920 contents 1 background 2

workers in the city were organized in unions than ever before there was a 400 percent increase in union membership from 1915 to 1918 at the time workers in the united states particularly in the pacific northwest were becoming increasingly radicalized with many in the rank and file supportive of the recent revolution in russia and working toward a similar revolution in the united states in the fall of 1919 for instance seattle longshoremen refused to load arms destined for the antibolshevik white army in russia and attacked those who attempted to load them1 most unions in seattle were officially affiliated with the afl but the ideas of ordinary workers tended to be more radical than their leaders a local labor leader from the time discussed the politics of seattles workers in june 19192 i believe that 95 percent of us agree that the workers should control the industries nearly all of us agree on that but very strenuously disagree on the method some of us think we can get control through the cooperative movement some of us think through political action and others think through industrial action another journalist described the spread of propaganda relating to the russian revolution2 for some time these pamphlets were seen by hundreds on seattles streetcars and ferries read by men of the shipyards on their way to work seattles businessmen commented on the phenomenon sourly it was plain to everyone that these workers were conscientiously and energetically studying how to organize their coming to power already workers in seattle talked about workers power as a practical policy for the not far distant future strikeedit a few weeks after the november 1918 armistice ended world war i unions in seattles shipbuilding industry demanded a pay increase for unskilled workers in an attempt to divide the ranks of the union the yard owners responded by offering a pay increase only to skilled workers the union rejected that offer and seattles 35000 shipyard workers went on strike on january 21 1919citation needed controversy erupted when charles piez head of the emergency fleet corporation efc an enterprise created by the federal government as a wartime measure and the largest employer in the industry sent a telegram to the yard owners threatening to withdraw their contracts if any increase in wages were granted the message intended for the metal trades association the owners was accidentally delivered to the metal trades council the union the shipyard workers responded with anger directed at both their employers and the federal government which through the efc seemed to be siding with corporate interestscitation needed the workers immediately appealed to the seattle central labor council for a general strike of all workers in seattle members of various unions were polled with almost unanimous support in favor–even among traditionally conservative unions as many as 110 locals officially supported the call for a general strike to begin on february 6 1919 at 1000 am3 among the strikers were war veterans who wore their uniforms as they went on strike4 life during the strikeedit a cooperative body made up of rank and file workers from all the striking locals was formed during the strike called the general strike committee it acted as a virtual countergovernment for the city5 the committee organized to provide essential services for the people of seattle during the work stoppage for instance garbage that would create a health hazard was collected laundry workers continued to handle hospital laundry and firemen remained on duty exemptions to the stoppage of labor had to be passed by the strike committee and authorized vehicles bore signs to that effect35 in general work was not halted if doing so would endanger lives5 in other cases workers acted on their own initiative to create new institutions milk wagon drivers after being denied the right by their employers to keep certain dairies open established a distribution system of 35 neighborhood milk stations a system of food distribution was also established which throughout the strike committee distributed as many as 30000 meals each day strikers paid twentyfive cents per meal and the general public paid thirtyfive cents beef stew spaghetti bread and coffee were offered on an allyoucaneat basis3 army veterans created an alternative to the police in order to maintain order a group called the labor war veterans guard forbade the use of force and did not carry weapons and used persuasion only3 peacekeeping proved unnecessary the regular police forces made no arrests in actions related to the strike and general arrests dropped to less than half their normal number major general john f morrison stationed in seattle claimed that he had never seen a city so quiet and orderly3 the methods of organization adopted by the striking workers bore resemblance to anarchosyndicalism perhaps reflecting the influence of the industrial workers of the world in the pacific northwestcitation needed though only a few striking locals were officially affiliated with the iww3 radical visionsedit the pamphlet entitled russia did it revolutionary pamphlets littered the streets of the city one called russia did it proclaimed the russians have shown you the way out what are you going to do about it you are doomed to wage slavery till you die unless you wake up realize that you and the boss have nothing in common that the employing class must be overthrown and that you the workers must take over the control of your jobs and through them the control over your lives instead of offering yourself up to the masters as a sacrifice six days a week so that they may coin profits out of your sweat and toil6 in an editorial in the seattle union record a union newspaper activist anna louise strong tried to describe the general strikes power and potential7 the closing down of seattles industries as a mere shutdown will not affect these eastern gentlemen much they could let the whole northwest go to pieces as far as money alone is concerned but the closing down of the capitalistically controlled industries of seattle while the workers organize to feed the people to care for the babies and the sick to preserve order—this will move them for this looks too much like the taking over of power by the workers labor will not only shut down the industries but labor will reopen under the management of the appropriate trades such activities as are needed to preserve public health and public peace if the strike continues labor may feel led to avoid public suffering by reopening more and more activities under its own management and that is why we say that we are starting on a road that leads – no one knows where newspaper across the country reprinted excerpts from strongs editorial8 end of the general strikeedit three simultaneous movements brought the strike to an endcitation needed mayor hanson increased the police and military forces available to enforce order though there was no disorder and possibly to take the place of striking workers union officials especially those more senior and those at higher levels of the labor movement feared that using the general strike as a tactic would fail and set back their organizing efforts union members perhaps seeing the strength of the forces arrayed against them perhaps mindful of their union leaders concerns began to go back to workcitation needed the general strike committee attributed the end of the strike to pressure from international union officers and the difficulty of continuing to live in the shutdown city9 mayor hanson had federal troops available and stationed 950 sailors and marines across the city by february 7 he added 600 men to the police force and hired 2400 special deputies students from the university of washington for the most part8 on february 7 mayor hansen threatened to use 1500 police and 1500 troops to replace striking workers the next day but the strikers assumed this was an empty threat and were proved correct10 the mayor continued his rhetorical attack on february 9 saying that the sympathetic strike was called in the exact manner as was the revolution in petrograd11 mayor hansen told reporters that any man who attempts to take over the control of the municipal government functions will be shot12 the international offices of some of the unions and the national leadership of the afl began to exert pressure on the general strike committee and individual unions to end the strike13 some locals gave in to this pressure and returned to work the executive committee of the general strike committee pressured by the afl and international labor organizations proposed ending the general strike at midnight on february 8 but their recommendation was voted down by the general strike committee13 on february 8 some streetcar operators returned to work and restored some critical city transportation services seattles main department store reopened as well14 then teamsters and newsboys returned to work15 on february 10 the general strike committee voted to end the general strike on february 11 and by noon on that day it was over16 it stated its reasons pressure from international officers of unions from executive committees of unions from the leaders in the labor movement even from those very leaders who are still called bolsheviki by the undiscriminating press and added to all these the pressure upon the workers themselves not of the loss of their own jobs but of living in a city so tightly closedthis quote needs a citation the city had been effectively paralyzed for five days but the general strike collapsed as labor reconsidered its effectiveness under pressure from senior labor leaders and their own obvious failure to match the mayors propaganda in the war for public opinioncitation needed the shipyard strike in support of which the general strike had been called persisted17 aftermathedit hanson july 1 1919 immediately following the general strikes end 39 iww members were arrested as ringleaders of anarchy18 despite their playing a marginal role in the development of events seattles mayor ole hanson took credit for ending the strike and was hailed by some of the press he resigned a few months later and toured the country giving lectures on the dangers of domestic bolshevism he earned 38000 in seven months five times his annual salary as mayor19 he agreed that the general strike was a revolutionary event in his view the fact that it was peaceful proved its revolutionary nature and intent he wrote618 the socalled sympathetic seattle strike was an attempted revolution that there was no violence does not alter the fact the intent openly and covertly announced was for the overthrow of the industrial system here first then everywhere true there were no flashing guns no bombs no killings revolution i repeat doesnt need violence the general strike as practised in seattle is of itself the weapon of revolution all the more dangerous because quiet to succeed it must suspend everything stop the entire life stream of a community that is to say it puts the government out of operation and that is all there is to revolt–no matter how achieved between the strikes announcement and beginning on february 4 the us senate voted to expand the work of its overman judiciary subcommittee from investigating german spies to bolshevik propaganda the committee launched a month of hearings on february 11 the day the strike collapsed its sensational report detailed bolshevik atrocities and the threat of domestic agitators bent on revolution and the abolition of private property the labor radicalism represented by the seattle general strike fit neatly into its conception of the threat american institutions faced20 notesedit history committee of the general strike committee accessed june 6 2011 a b brecher 120 a b c d e f zinn 368–9 hagedorn 867 a b
