polled 8232 votes 49325 he served in the house from 1989 until 199226 freshman legislator odon bacqué of lafayette a no party member of the house stood alone in 1989 when he attempted to deny seating to duke on the grounds that the incoming representative had resided outside his district at the time of his election when treen failed in a court challenge in regard to dukes residency duke was seated lawmakers who opposed duke said that they had to defer to his constituents who narrowly chose duke as representative27 as state representative duke took his seat on the same day as jerry luke leblanc of lafayette parish who won another special election held on the same day as the duketreen runoff to choose a successor to kathleen blanco the future governor who was elected to the louisiana public service commission duke and leblanc were sworn in separately colleague ron gomez of lafayette stated that duke as a shortterm legislator was so single minded he never really became involved in the nuts and bolts of house rules and parliamentary procedure it was just that shortcoming that led to the demise of most of his attempts at lawmaking28 one legislative issue pushed by duke was the requirement that welfare recipients be tested for the use of narcotics the recipients had to show themselves to be drugfree to receive state and federal benefits under his proposal29 gomez a longtime journalist recalls having met and interviewed duke in the mid1970s when duke was a state senate candidate he was still in his mid20s and very nondescript tall and slimly built he had a very prominent nose flat cheek bones a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair the interview turned out to be quite innocuous and i hadnt thought about it again until duke came to my legislative desk and we shook hands who was this guy tall and wellbuilt with a perfect nose a models cheek bones prominent chin blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair he looked like a movie star he obviously didnt remember from the radio encounter and i was content to leave it at that30 consistent with gomezs observation duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented following his election to the louisiana house of representatives he shaved his mustache3132 gomez in his 2000 autobiography wrote about duke he once presented a bill on the floor one of the few which he had managed to get out of committee he finished his opening presentation and strolled with great selfsatisfaction back up the aisle to his seat in his mind he had spoken made his presentation and that was that before he had even reached his desk and refocused on the proceedings another firstterm member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill the house voted for the motions effectively killing the bill that and similar procedures were used against him many times33 gomez said that he recalls duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences34 gomez added that dukes tenure in the house was short and uninspired never has anyone parlayed an election by such a narrow margin to such a minor position to such international prominence he has run for numerous other positions without success but has always had some effect usually negative on the outcome35 gomez continued dukes new message was that he had left the klan shed the nazi uniform he had proudly worn in many previous appearances and only wanted to serve the people he eliminated his highoctane antisemitic rhetoric he was particularly concerned with the plight of europeanamericans he never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the growing underclass he used the tried and true demagoguery of class envy to sell his message excessive taxpayers money spent on welfare school busing practices affirmative action and setaside programs he also embraced a subject near and dear to every jefferson parish voter protection of the homestead exemption36 duke launched unsuccessful campaigns for the us senate in 1990 and governor in 1991 villere did not again seek office but instead concentrated his political activity within the republican organization37 1990 campaign for us senate main article united states senate election in louisiana 1990 duke has often criticized

johnston jr of shreveport39 whom duke derided as j benedict johnston40 former governor david treen whose brother john treen duke had defeated for state representative in 1989 called dukes senatorial platform garbage i think he is bad for our party because of his espousal of nazism and racial superiority41 the republican party officially endorsed state senator ben bagert of new orleans in a state convention on january 13 1990 but national gop officials in october just days before the primary election concluded that bagert could not win to avoid a runoff between duke and bagert the gop decided to surrender the primary to johnston funding for bagerts campaign was halted and after initial protest bagert dropped out two days before the election with such a late withdrawal bagerts name remained on the ballot but his votes most of which were presumably cast as absentee ballots were not counted4243 duke received 4351 percent 607391 votes of the primary vote to johnstons 5393 percent 752902 votes39 dukes views prompted some of his critics including republicans such as journalist quin hillyer to form the louisiana coalition against racism and nazism which directed media attention to dukes statements of hostility to blacks and jews44 in a 2006 financial times editorial gideon rachman recalled interviewing dukes 1990 campaign manager who said the jews just arent a big issue in louisiana

dickson from the council of conservative citizens another sponsor speaking about the very very destructive effect of opposing the nazis in world war ii—opposition that caused people to view hitlers

freedom is the same as our fight for freedom in a second interview he said israel makes the nazi state look very very moderate syrian parliament member mohammad habash later stated that dukes visit

false tax return under 26 usc § 7206 and mail fraud under 18 usc § 13414 according to the new york times mr duke was accused of telling supporters that he was in financial straits then misusing the money they sent him from 1993 to 1999 he was also accused of filing a false 1998 tax return mr duke used the money for personal investments and gambling trips the supporter contributions were as small as 5 and according to the united states attorney jim letten there were so many that returning the money would be unwieldy165 four months later duke was sentenced to 15 months in prison and he served the time in big spring texas he was also fined us10000 and ordered to cooperate with the internal revenue service and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes following his release in may 2004 he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the united states federal court system and not his guilt he said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence the mail fraud charges stemmed from what prosecutors described as a sixyear scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations using the postal service duke appealed to his supporters for funds by fraudulently stating he was about to lose his house and his life savings prosecutors alleged that duke raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in this scheme prosecutors also stipulated that in contrast to what he stated in the mailings he sold his home at a hefty profit had multiple investment accounts and spent much of his money gambling at
