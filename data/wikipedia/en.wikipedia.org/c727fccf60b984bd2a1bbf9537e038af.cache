thomas and their relationship lasted for two years in 2003 usher started working on the album which would become confessions which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of usher and his collaborators the songs about infidelity and pregnant mistresses were inspired not by ushers private life but by jermaine dupris own personal challenges at the time360 dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about usher and arouse fans curiosity about how much of the infidelity story was ushers own confession360 the unintended result of this was to arouse thomass suspicions about usher360 they broke up in december 2003 this was followed by a media frenzy surrounding the personal nature of confessions many fans believed that the infidelity portrayed in confessions was real and the real reason for the split8 in february 2004 in an interview on the bert show on the atlanta radio channel q100 thomas seemed to claim that usher cheated on her usher did the ultimate nono to mei will never be with him again and that is that361 usher defended it just didnt work out but cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash that aint what broke it up8 this was backed up years later by thomas who said people assumed that album was about us but it was not362 in 2004 it was reported that usher briefly dated british supermodel naomi campbell for a few months together
