historyedit caravan eraedit the first american television newscast in history was made by nbc news on february 21 1940 anchored by lowell thomas 18921981 and airing weeknights at 645 pm6 in june 1940 nbc through its flagship station in new york city w2xbs renamed commercial wnbt in 1941 now wnbc operating on channel one televised 30¼ hours of coverage of the republican national convention live and direct from philadelphia the station used a series of relays from philadelphia to new york and on to upper new york state for rebroadcast on w2xb in schenectady now wrgb making this among the first network programs of nbc television due to wartime restrictions there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions although films of the events were reportedly shown over wnbt the next day in 1948 nbc teamed up with life magazine to provide election night coverage of president harry s trumans surprising victory over new york governor thomas e dewey the television audience was small but nbcs share in new york was double that of any other outlet7 the following year the camel news caravan anchored by john cameron swayze debuted on nbc lacking the graphics and technology of later years it nonetheless contained many of the elements of modern newscasts8 nbc hired its own film crews and in the programs early years it dominated cbss competing program which did not hire its own film crews until 19538 by contrast cbs spent lavishly on edward r murrows weekly series see it now8 in 1950 david brinkley began serving as the programs washington correspondent but attracted little attention outside the network until paired with chet huntley in 19569 in 1955 the camel news caravan fell behind cbss douglas edwards with the news and swayze lost the already tepid support of nbc executives8 the following year nbc replaced the program with the huntleybrinkley report beginning in 1951 nbc news was managed by director of news bill mcandrew who reported to vice president of news and public affairs j davidson taylor10 huntleybrinkley eraedit nbc news had close to 700 correspondents and cameramen in 1961 who were stationed throughout the world film was received in the united states by plane or by the jointly operated nbcbbc transatlantic film cable television assumed an increasingly prominent role in american family life in the late 1950s and nbc news was called televisions champion of news coverage11 nbc president robert kintner provided the news division with ample amounts of both financial resources and air time8 in 1956 the network paired anchors chet huntley and david brinkley and the two became celebrities9 supported by reporters including john chancellor frank mcgee edwin newman sander vanocur nancy dickerson tom pettit and ray scherer created by producer reuven frank nbcs huntleybrinkley report had its debut on october 29 1956 during much of its 14year run it exceeded the viewership levels of its cbs news competition anchored initially by douglas edwards and beginning in april 1962 by walter cronkite nbcs vice president of news and public affairs j davidson taylor was a southerner who with producer reuven frank was determined that nbc would lead televisions coverage of the civil rights movement12 in 1955 nbc provided national coverage of rev martin luther king jrs leadership of the bus boycott in montgomery alabama airing reports from frank mcgee then news director of nbcs montgomery affiliate wsfatv who would later join the network13 a year later john chancellors coverage of the admission of black students to central high school in little rock arkansas was the first occasion when the key news story came from television rather than print13 and prompted a prominent us senator to observe later when i think of little rock i think of john chancellor10 other reporters who covered the movement for the network included sander vanocur herbert kaplow charles quinn and richard valeriani12 who was hit with an ax handle at a demonstration in marion alabama in 196514 while walter cronkites enthusiasm for the space race eventually won the anchorman viewers for cbs nbc news with the work of correspondents such as frank mcgee roy neal jay barbree and peter hackes also provided ample coverage of american manned space missions in the project mercury project gemini and project apollo programs in an era when space missions rated continuous coverage nbc configured its largest studio studio 8h for space coverage it utilized models and mockups of rockets and spacecraft maps of the earth and moon to show orbital trackage and stages on which animated figures created by puppeteer bil baird were used to depict movements of astronauts before onboard spacecraft television cameras were feasible studio 8h had been home to the nbc symphony orchestra and is now the home of saturday night live nbcs coverage of the first moon landing in 1969 earned the network an emmy award15 in the late 1950s kintner reorganized the chain of command at the network making bill mcandrew president of nbc news reporting directly to kintner10 mcandrew served in that position until his death in 196810 mcandrew was succeeded by his executive vice president producer reuven frank who held the position until 197310 on november 22 1963 nbc interrupted various programs on its affiliate stations at 145 pm to announce that president john f kennedy had been shot in dallas texas eight minutes later at 15312 pm nbc broke into programming with a network bumper slide and chet huntley bill ryan and frank mcgee informing the viewers what was going on as it happened but since a camera was not in service the reports were audio only however nbc did not begin broadcasting over the air until 157 pm et about 40 minutes later after word came that jfk was pronounced dead nbc suspended regular programming and carried 71 hours of uninterrupted news coverage of the assassination and the funeral of the president—including the only live broadcast of the fatal shooting of kennedys assassin lee harvey oswald by jack ruby as oswald was being led in handcuffs by lawenforcement officials through the basement of dallas police headquarters16 nbc nightly news eraedit nbcs ratings lead began to slip toward the end of the 1960s and fell sharply when chet huntley retired in 1970 huntley died of cancer in 1974 the loss of huntley along with a reluctance by rca to fund nbc news at a similar level as cbs was funding its news division left nbc news in the doldrums nbcs primary news show gained its present title nbc nightly news on august 3 1970 logo of msnbc used from 2006 to 2008 the network tried a platoon of anchors brinkley mcgee and john chancellor during the early months of nightly news despite the efforts of the networks eventual lead anchor the articulate eventoned chancellor and an occasional firstplace finish in the nielsens nightly news in the 1970s was primarily a strong second8 by the end of the decade nbc had to contend not only with a powerful cbs but also a surging abc led by roone arledge tom brokaw became sole anchor in 1983 after coanchoring with roger mudd for a year and began leading nbcs efforts in 1986 and 1987 nbc won the top spot in the nielsens for the first time in years17 only to fall back when nielsens ratings methodology changed in late 1996 nightly news again moved into first place18 a spot it has held onto in most of the succeeding years brian williams assumed primary anchor duties when brokaw retired in december 200419 in february 2015 nbc suspended williams for six months for telling an inaccurate story about his experience in the 2003 invasion of iraq20 he was replaced by lester holt on an interim basis on june 18 2015 it was announced that holt would become the permanent anchor and williams would be moved to msnbc as an anchor of breaking news and special reports beginning in august21 in 1993 dateline nbc broadcast an investigative report about the safety of general motors gm trucks gm discovered the actual footage utilized in the broadcast had been rigged by the inclusion of explosive incendiaries attached to the gas tanks and the use of improper sealants for those tanks gm subsequently filed an antidefamation lawsuit against nbc which publicly admitted the results of the tests were rigged and settled the lawsuit with gm on the very same day22 company newsedit on october 22 2007 nightly news moved into its new high definition studios at studio 3c at nbc studios in 30 rockefeller plaza in new york city the networks 24hour cable

nbc news was urged to save 500 million by nbc universal on that occasion nbc news laid off several of its inhouse reporters such as kevin corke jeannie ohm and don teague this was the largest layoff in nbc news history after the sudden death of the influential moderator tim russert of meet the press in june 2008 tom brokaw took over as an interim host and on december 14 2008 david gregory became

share costs with msnbc and share in the cable networks advertising and subscriber revenue made it far more profitable than its network rivals26 controversiesedit virginia tech massacreedit further information virginia tech massacre on april 16 2007 cho seunghui gunman in the virginia tech massacre took time between the two shooting episodes to prepare and mail a large multimedia package to nbc news in new york city containing messages about his anger at the wealthy and alluding to the slaughter that was about to take place although the package was sent overnight mail it was not received until 11 am on april 18 because of chos confusion over the zip code of nbcs headquarters at 30 rockefeller plaza the package contained a dvd showing video clips of cho speaking and more than two dozen photos of cho including 11 of him thrusting pistols at the camera a postal worker delivering the parcel to the networks rockefeller center offices recognized the sender and alerted nbc security personnel they immediately reported the package to the fbi meanwhile nbc made copies of the contents and aired carefully edited pieces on its evening news and cable programs snippets from the package including still photos videos and voice narration were also made available to competing news outlets who agreed to credit the network as the source thennbc news president steve capus defended use of the material but the frequency of its broadcast was cut dramatically shooting of trayvon martinedit main article shooting of trayvon martin nbc nightly news broadcast march 2008 on march 27 2012 nbc news broadcast an edited segment from a 911 call placed by george zimmerman before he shot trayvon martin the editing made it appear that zimmerman volunteered that martin was black rather than merely responding to the dispatchers inquiry which would support a view that the shooting was racially motivated a media watchdog organization accused nbc news of engaging in an allout falsehood while nbc news initially declined to comment27 the news agency did issue an apology to viewers28 the washington post called the statement skimpy on the details on just how the mistake unfolded28 nbc news team kidnappingedit main article nbc news team kidnapping in syria on december 13 2012 nbc news reporter richard engel and his five crew members aziz akyavaş ghazi balkiz john kooistra ian rivers and ammar cheikh omar were abducted in syria having escaped after five days in captivity engel said he believed that a shabiha group loyal to alassad was behind the abduction and that the crew was freed by the ahrar alsham group five days later29 engels account was however challenged from early on30 in april 2015 nbc had to revise the kidnapping account following further investigations by the new york times which suggested that the nbc team was almost certainly taken by a sunni criminal element affiliated with the free syrian army rather than by a loyalist shia group31 presidentsedit nine men have served
