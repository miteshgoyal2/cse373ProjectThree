controlling the funky space reporter ulala as she grooves to rescue hostages and stop the enemy each level is split up into several parts revolving around danceoffs or shootouts during which the player must repeat commands spoken by the opponent up down left right and shoot in time to the rhythm danceoffs involve dancing against an opponent with some routines differing depending on the players performance while shootouts require players to shoot attacking enemies and rescue hostages successful moves increase ratings while making mistakes will lower ratings and cause the player to lose hearts possibly causing them to lose hostages if the player loses all their hearts during certain battles or if the ratings drop too low the player will have to restart the level clearing the game unlocks an alternate story mode with some differences plotedit space channel 5 takes place five hundred years in the future where interstellar television stations fight for ratings ulala is a new reporter for one such station space channel 5 joining up with them having previously been saved by one of their reporters ten years ago when a strange alien race known as the morolians start kidnapping hostages and forcing them to dance ulala is sent in to report the news and rescue the hostages with her funky moves the morolians arent the only problem however as ulala must also contend with rival reporter pudding and pirate broadcaster jaguar as ulala investigates further into this incident she starts to learn that not everything is as it seems charactersedit ulala うらら urara space channel 5s top reporter when she was young a reporter from space channel 5 saved her life which inspired her to become a reporter for the channel she carries with her trusty microphone and two guns the chu beam is used for shooting aliens robots and other attackers while the rescue beam is used to rescue hostages being forced to dance when ratings are high she emits a pink aura signifying she is full of groove energy fuse ヒューズ hyūzu the broadcaster of space channel 5 he remains in the broadcasting ship all the time and his face is never seen he relays instructions to ulala to help her through her missions although he often gets fascinated by ulalas moves pudding プリン purin a former teen idol that has become the reporter for channel 42 she dislikes ulala stealing her remaining popularity and usually shows up early on in the games with her bodyguards groupies and her catchphrase its me pudding pudding desu in the japanese version she challenges ulala but usually finds herself beaten in part 2 she challenges ulala to a guitar battle in both games she teams up with ulala on later levels jaguar ジャガー jagā a reporter from a pirate broadcasting station dedicated to giving viewers the truth in the first game he tends to act snubby against ulalas affiliation with space channel 5 he was a former member of space channel 5 and was indeed the reporter who saved ulalas life 10 years ago but he sensed corruption from the stations head chief blank he does however rescue ulala once again from blank and uses his back up group to get ulala back in the groove in part 2 he mysteriously disappears while investigating something later it was revealed that he was brainwashed by purge becoming the shadow シャドー shadō he is saved by ulala near the end of part 2 space michael スペースマイケル supēsu

to dance in the first game they have very high voices it was later revealed that space channel 5 chief mr blank was brainwashing them so space channel 5 would get higher ratings in part 2 the leader of the morolians hoorg is a news reporter on morolian news which airs in between reports but constantly gets hijacked by purge in report 5 he joins ulala in stopping purge chief blank ブランク buranku the head chief of space channel 5 in the first game blank became corrupt and brainwashed the morolians to stage an alien invasion so that space channel 5 would get higher ratings he despises reporters who he calls peons and that spread truth like disease he even goes as far as to create a robot clone of ulala called evila the perfect reporter to replace her he is soon defeated using the dance energy of the crowd and sent flying into space evila イビラ ibira the robotic doppelganger also referred to as the puppet of ulala evila was created by chief blank who of course is the head of space channel 5 evila was designed to show chief blanks vision evila looks just like ulala only at the ends of her pigtails are antennas and evila wears black and green dress in the first game she was designed to be the ultimate reporter but easily gets defeated by ulala in part 2 evila was upgraded and recolored by noize to be on ulalas side helping to defeat purge an evila ally costume can be worn in part 2 developmentedit see also michael jacksonrelated games in discussing the study of target demographics producer tetsuya mizuguchi related the story of designing space channel 5 which was at first a vague assignment from sega that asked only that mizuguchi design a game with a broad enough appeal to draw in even casual female gamers this was the first id heard of casual female gamers he said so i didnt really know what to do i personally interviewed a lot of young girls trying to find out what they like women he says tend to enjoy puzzle games while male gamers want to be on top they want to accomplish something and be the champion its difficult he insists to create a game that appeals to both males and females on an equal level2 mizuguchi has also stated that space channel 5 was inspired by the dance troupe stomp he highly enjoyed the performance and began thinking why musicals were so much fun but more importantly how can we get this feeling into an interactive process it was then that space channel 5 was born michael jackson makes a cameo appearance as space michael in space channel 53 near the end of the game the may 2007 issue of egm contains a quote from series creator tetsuya mizuguchi concerning what it was like to work with jackson we were in the middle of production of space channel 5 in 1998 or 1999 i got a call from the us from my partner the executive producer of space channel 5 and he said oh michael wants to act in space channel 5 i said whos michael who is michael jackson he said the michael jackson the real michael jackson my partner had shown him the 60to70 percent complete version when it was almost at the end of the game we had one month to finalize but michael wanted to do something so we suggested that if he was ok with it we could program the people in the game to do the michael jackson dance when taken over by aliens he said yeah we initially had five aliens who danced one of them became michael jackson he had a more prominent role in space channel 5 part 2 where he became the new head of space channel 5 while ulala is distracted by a fake scoop the headquarters are attacked and space michael is kidnapped by purge and the rhythm rogues and has to be rescued by ulala in a level featuring several of jacksons trademark dance moves he then joins ulala in facing up against purge in both versions of the game jackson speaks in english which is subtitled into japanese in the japanese version releaseedit space channel 5 was first released in japan for the dreamcast on december 16 1999 it was later released in the united

pay her 16000 to license her name image and songs for the game though she rejected their offer kirby later learned that the videogame maker went ahead and used her resemblance anyway and she decided
