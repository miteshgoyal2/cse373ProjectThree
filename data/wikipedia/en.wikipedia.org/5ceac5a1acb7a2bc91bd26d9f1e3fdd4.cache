frank the pug brad abrell as worm guy greg ballora as worm guy thom fountain as worm guy carl j johnson as worm guy richard pearson as gordy productionedit despite some initial involvement from david koepp who left to work on spiderman3 the script was written by robert gordon and later revised by barry fanaro who added pop culture references something which gordon had deliberately avoided4 sonnenfeld took issue with the producers focus on the love story between will smiths and rosario dawsons characters saying that i learned on wild wild west that audiences didnt want to see will as the straight man and until tommy comes back into the movie by definition wills the straight man fanaro condensed the first part of the film and brought agent k in earlier3 principal photography began june 11 2001 and ended on september 23 2001 the climax of the story was originally filmed against a backdrop of the twin towers of the original world trade center but after the september 11 attacks the climactic scene was refilmed other scenes incorporating views of the twin towers likewise had to be edited or reshot5 supervising sound editor skip lievsay used a synclavier to recreate and improve the original recording of the neuralyzer sound effect from the first film which was the sound of a strobe flash as it recycles by removing some distortion6 for some of the scenes with the serleena creature the sound crew took tree branches put them inside a rubber membrane and pushed that around and added some water6 for the special effects scene where the subway train is attacked by jeff the worm a specially designed vise was used to crush a subway car and make it look as if it had been bitten in half4 musicedit the motion picture soundtrack to men in black ii was released on june 25 2002
