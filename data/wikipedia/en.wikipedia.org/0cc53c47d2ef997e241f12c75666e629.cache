the zionists to blackmail humanity the same zionist entity swindled the world out of billions of dollars over the years to compensate the wrong and unjust which they claim to have been inflicted on their people it is evident that the holocaust was a conspiracy hatched by the zionists and nazis and many innocent people gave their lives as a result of this inhuman plot12 on 15 december 2013 gulf news in its editorial claimed without mentioning any source that pakistan and afghanistan did not vote for dubai in its bid for expo 202013 the foreign office of pakistan quickly brushed aside the
