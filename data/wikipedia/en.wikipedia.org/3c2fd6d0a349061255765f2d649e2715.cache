legal term for homicide considered by law as less culpable than murder the distinction between murder and manslaughter is sometimes said to have first been made by the ancient athenian lawmaker draco in the 7th century bc1 the definition of manslaughter differs among legal jurisdictions contents 1 general 11 voluntary manslaughter 111 assisted suicide 12 involuntary manslaughter 121 constructive manslaughter 122 criminally negligent manslaughter 123 vehicular or intoxication manslaughter 2 regional differences 21 australian law 22 canadian law 23 english law 24 united states law 3 see also 4 references 5 external links generaledit voluntary manslaughteredit main article voluntary manslaughter in voluntary manslaughter the offender had no prior intent to kill and acted during the heat of passion under circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to become emotionally or mentally disturbed2 there are mitigating circumstances that reduce culpability or when the defendant kills only with an intent to cause serious bodily harm3 voluntary manslaughter in some jurisdictions is a lesser included offense of murder the traditional mitigating factor was provocation however others have been added in various jurisdictions the most common type of voluntary manslaughter occurs when a defendant is provoked to commit the homicide this is sometimes described as a heatofpassion killing4 in most cases the provocation must induce rage or anger in the defendant although some cases have held that fright terror or desperation will suffice5 assisted suicideedit main article assisted suicide assisted suicide is suicide committed with the aid of another person sometimes a physician in some places including parts of the united states of america6 assisted suicide is punishable as manslaughter in other countries such as switzerland7 and canada8 and in some us states6 as long as legal safeguards are observed assisted suicide is legal involuntary manslaughteredit involuntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice aforethought either expressed or implied it is distinguished from voluntary manslaughter by the absence of intention it is normally divided into two categories constructive manslaughter and criminally negligent manslaughter both of which involve criminal liability constructive manslaughteredit constructive manslaughter is also referred to as unlawful act manslaughter it is based on the doctrine of constructive malice whereby the malicious intent inherent in the commission of a crime is considered to apply to the consequences of that crime it occurs when someone kills without intent in the course of committing an unlawful act the malice involved in the crime is transferred to the killing resulting in a charge of manslaughter for example a person who fails to stop at a red traffic light while driving a vehicle and hits someone crossing the street could be found to intend or be reckless as to assault or criminal damage see dpp v newbury9 there is no intent to kill and a resulting death would not be considered murder but would be considered involuntary manslaughter the accuseds responsibility for causing death is constructed from the fault in committing what might have been a minor criminal act reckless driving or reckless handling of a potentially lethal weapon may result in a death that is deemed manslaughter involuntary manslaughter may be distinguished from accidental death a person who is driving carefully but whose car nevertheless hits a child darting out into the street has not committed manslaughter a person who pushes off an aggressive drunk who then falls and dies has probably not committed manslaughter although in some jurisdictions it may depend whether excessive force was used or other factors it is also possible to be held civilly liable for a death and pay damages without being criminally liable and going to prison eg oj simpson as manslaughter is not defined by legislation in australia common law decisions provide the basis for determining whether an act resulting in death amounts to manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act10 to be found guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act the accused must be shown to have committed an unlawful act which is contrary to the criminal law11 and that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have known that by his or her act he or she was exposing the victim to an ‘appreciable risk of serious injury’12 criminally negligent manslaughteredit criminally negligent manslaughter is variously referred to as criminally negligent homicide in the united states and gross negligence manslaughter in england and wales in scotland and some commonwealth of nations jurisdictions the offence of culpable homicide might apply it occurs where death results from serious negligence or in some jurisdictions serious recklessness a high degree of negligence is required to warrant criminal liability13 a related concept is that of willful blindness which is where a defendant intentionally puts himself or herself in a position where the defendant will be unaware of facts which would render him or her liable criminally negligent manslaughter occurs where there is an omission to act when there is a duty to do so or a failure to perform a duty owed which leads to a death the existence of the duty is essential because the law does not impose criminal liability for a failure to act unless a specific duty is owed to the victim it is most common in the case of professionals who are grossly negligent in the course of their employment an example is where a doctor fails to notice a patients oxygen supply has disconnected and the patient dies r v adomako14 another example could be leaving a child locked in a car on a hot day vehicular or intoxication manslaughteredit in some jurisdictions such as some us states15161718 there exists the specific crime of vehicular or intoxication manslaughter an equivalent in canada is causing death by criminal negligence19 under the criminal code punishable by a maximum penalty of life imprisonment regional differencesedit the definition of manslaughter differs from one jurisdiction to another the law generally differentiates between levels of criminal culpability based on the mens rea or state of mind or the circumstances under which the killing occurred mitigating factors manslaughter is usually broken down into two distinct categories voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter20 however this is not the case in all jurisdictions for example in the us state of florida21 in some jurisdictions22 such as the uk23 canada2425 and some australian states26 adequate provocation may be a partial defense to a charge of murder which if accepted by the jury would convert what might otherwise have been a murder charge into manslaughter australian lawedit in australia specifically new south wales manslaughter is referred to however not defined in the crimes act 1900 nsw at section 181b27 manslaughter exists in two forms in new south wales voluntary or involuntary manslaughter a discussion of the different forms of involuntary manslaughter can be found in the case of lane v r 2013 nswcca 317 at 51–65 in new south wales in cases of voluntary manslaughter both the actus reus and mens rea for murder are proven but the defendant has a partial defence such as extreme provocation or diminished responsibility28 in cases of involuntary manslaughter the actus reus for murder is present but there is insufficient mens rea to establish such a charge there are two categories of involuntary manslaughter at common law manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act and manslaughter by criminal negligence the authority for the actus reus and mens rea of involuntary manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act is the high court of australia case of wilson v r29 this case determined that the act that caused the death must breach the criminal law and that the act must carry an appreciable risk of serious injury actus reus regarding the mens rea the court held that the accused must intend to commit the unlawful act and that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised or recognised that the act carried an appreciable risk of serious injury manslaughter by criminal negligence on the other hand finds its authority in the victorian case of nydam v r 30 confirmed by the high court of australia in the queen v lavender 2005 222 clr 67 at 17 60 72 136 and burns v the queen 2012 246 clr 334 per french cj at 19 in nydam v r30 the court described the office at 445 in the following terms in order to establish manslaughter by criminal negligence it is sufficient if the prosecution shows that the act which caused the death was done by the accused consciously and voluntarily without any intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment canadian lawedit canadian law distinguishes between justifiable accidental and culpable homicide if a death is deemed a culpable homicide it generally falls under one of four categories first degree murder second degree murder manslaughter and infanticide canadian law defines manslaughter as a homicide committed without the intention to cause death although there may have been an intention to cause harm there are two broad categories of manslaughter unlawful act and criminal negligence unlawful act is when a person commits a crime that unintentionally results in the death of another person criminal negligence is when the homicide was the result of an act that showed wanton or reckless disregard for the lives of others31 english lawedit main article manslaughter in english law in english law manslaughter is a less serious offence than murder in england and wales the usual practice is to prefer a charge of murder with the judge or defence able to introduce manslaughter as an option see lesser included offence the jury then decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of either murder or manslaughter manslaughter may be either voluntary or involuntary depending on whether the accused has the required mens rea for murder the homicide act 1957 and coroners and justice act 2009 are relevant acts voluntary manslaughter occurs when the defendant avails himherself of the three statutory defenses described in the homicide act 1957 provocation diminished responsibility and a suicide pact involuntary manslaughter occurs when the agent has no intention mens rea of committing murder but caused the death of another through recklessness or criminal negligence the crime of involuntary manslaughter can be subdivided into two main categories constructive manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter united states lawedit main article manslaughter united states law manslaughter is a crime in the united states definitions can vary among jurisdictions but the us follows the general principle that manslaughter involves causing the death of another person in a manner less culpable than murder and observes the distinction between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter32 see alsoedit culpable homicide criminal transmission of hiv depravedheart murder imperfect selfdefense twinkie
