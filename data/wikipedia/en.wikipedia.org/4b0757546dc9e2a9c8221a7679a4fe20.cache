intimate part personal part or private part is a place on the human body which is customarily kept covered by clothing in public venues and conventional settings as a matter of decency decorum and respectfulnesscitation needed definitions vary but usually they are primarily the parts involved in sexual arousal procreation and elimination of excreta and related matter including the buttocks anus perineum and mons pubis for males the penis and scrotum for females the vulva including pudendal cleft and breasts the term intimate parts may be construed to mean only the external body parts that are visible when naked rather than the body parts more commonly referred to for example when naked a womans pudendal cleft is predominantly visible rather than the vagina and a mans scrotum is visible rather than the testes which are contained within1 female breasts are considered as parts that would be covered in most contexts but with a degree of tolerance for toplessness varying in different regions and cultures for example fischtein herold and desmarais 2005 found that acceptance of toplessness in a sample of canadians varied depending on both personal factors such as the respondents gender age and religion and contextual factors ie toplessness in streets parks or beaches2 in some periods of european history female shoulders and legs may have been considered intimate partscitation needed more conservative viewpoints in the west in some contexts still find it appropriate that females should cover their shoulders particularly when entering a church or other sacred space in islamic traditions the definition of awrah is similar to the definition of intimate parts in western culture the extent of cover for the female body depends upon the situation but may include the hair shoulders and neck in addition to the aforementioned intimate parts a majority of scholars agree that the entire body except the face and hands should be covered in public or in front of unrelated nonmuslim women and in front of unrelated men the exceptions are the scholars from hanafi school of thought which has the largest number of followers which agree that the feet are not part of the awrah and therefore may be revealed3 for males most scholars regard all parts of body from the navel to the knees as awrah the intentional exposure of ones intimate parts is a form of exhibitionism such exposure may be subject to strict social rules social control and even criminal justice if it is considered to be a form of indecent exposure the unintentional exposure of intimate parts as in the case of a wardrobe malfunction may be connected with feelings of shame intentionally touching the intimate parts of another person even through clothing is often associated with sexual intent if this is done without legally valid consent of the person being touched it is considered groping or in some cases sexual harassment or sexual assault naturism is a lifestyle choice that is characterized by the practice of nudity both alone and in groups some naturists hold that nakedness is not automatically a sexual state and that covering areas of the body is merely a social construct they believe that the norms of society can be upheld even when all are nude45 see alsoedit nudity portal erogenous zone intimate parts islam public nudity secondary sex characteristic sex organ taboo
