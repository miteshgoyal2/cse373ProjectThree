after president george washington by an act of the united states congress during the creation of washington territory in 1853 the territory was originally to be named columbia for the columbia river and the columbia district but kentucky representative richard h stanton found the name too similar to the district of columbia the national capital itself containing the city of washington and proposed naming the new territory after president washington456 washington is the only us state named after a president7 confusion over the state of washington and the city of washington dc led to renaming proposals during the statehood process for washington in 1889 including david dudley field iis suggestion to name the new state tacoma these proposals failed to garner support8 washington dcs own statehood movement in the 21st century includes a proposal to use the name state of washington douglass commonwealth which would conflict with the current state of washington9 to distinguish it

which support dense forests of conifers and areas of temperate rainforest these deep forests such as the hoh rainforest are among the only temperate rainforests in the continental united states16 eastern washingtonedit southeastern washington eastern washington – the part of the state east of the cascades – has a relatively dry climate in distinct contrast to the west side it includes large areas of semiarid steppe and a few truly arid deserts lying in the rain shadow of the cascades the hanford reservation receives an average annual precipitation of 6 to 7 inches 150 to 180 mm farther east the climate becomes less arid with annual rainfall increasing as one goes east to 212 inches 540 mm in pullman near the washingtonidaho border17 the okanogan highlands and the rugged kettle river range and selkirk mountains cover much of the northeastern quadrant of the state the palouse southeast region of washington was grassland that has been mostly converted into farmland and extends to the blue mountains18 climateedit see also climate change in washington köppen climate types of washington state as described above washingtons climate varies greatly from west to east an oceanic climate also called west coast marine climate predominates in western washington and a much drier semiarid climate prevails east of the cascade range major factors determining washingtons climate include the large semipermanent high pressure and low pressure systems of the north pacific ocean the continental air masses of north america and the olympic and cascade mountains in the spring and summer a high pressure anticyclone system dominates the north pacific ocean causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion for washington this means prevailing winds from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably dry season dryland farming caused a large dust storm in arid parts of eastern washington on october 4 2009 courtesy nasagsfc modis rapid response19 in the autumn and winter a lowpressure cyclone system takes over in the north pacific ocean with air spiraling inward in a counterclockwise fashion this causes washingtons prevailing winds the chinooks to come from the southwest bringing relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably wet season the term pineapple express is used colloquially to describe the extreme form of the wetseason chinook winds20 despite western washingtons having a marine climate similar to those of many coastal cities of europe there are exceptions such as the big snow events of 1880 1881 1893 and 1916 and the deep freeze winters of 1883–84 1915–16 1949–50 and 1955–56 among others during these events western washington experienced up to 6 feet 18 m of snow subzero −18 °c temperatures three months with snow on the ground and lakes and rivers frozen over for weeks21 seattles lowest officially recorded temperature is 0 °f −18 °c set on january 31 1950 but lowaltitude areas approximately three hours away from seattle have recorded lows as cold as −48 °f −44 °c22 weather during the cold season is greatly influenced by the southern oscillation during the el niño phase the jet stream enters the us farther south through california therefore late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snowpack the la niña phase reinforces the jet stream through the pacific northwest causing washington to have even more rain and snow than average in 2006 the climate impacts group at the university of washington published the impacts of climate change in washingtons economy a preliminary assessment on the risks and opportunities presented given the possibility of a rise in global temperatures and their effects on washington state23 rain shadow effectsedit main article rain shadow washington experiences extensive variation in rainfall rainfall in washington varies dramatically going from east to west the western side of the olympic peninsula receives as much as 160 inches 4100 mm of precipitation annually making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a temperate rainforest weeks may pass without a clear day the western slopes of the cascade range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall in some places more than 200 inches or 5100 millimetres water equivalent in the country in the rain shadow area east of the cascades the annual precipitation is only 6 inches 150 mm precipitation then increases again eastward toward the rocky mountains the olympic mountains and cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing orographic lift of the air masses blown inland from the pacific ocean resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels this occurs most dramatically around the olympic mountains and the cascade range in both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild cool temperatures while the puget sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter the western slopes of the cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation often falling as snow at higher elevations mount baker near the states northern border is one of the snowiest places in the world in 1999 it set the world record for snowfall in a single season 1140 inches 95 ft 29 m24 east of the cascades a large region experiences strong rain shadow effects semiarid conditions occur in much of eastern washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central columbia plateau—especially the region just east of the columbia river from about the snake river to the okanagan highland thus instead of rain forests much of eastern washington is covered with grassland and shrubsteppe temperaturesedit the average annual temperature ranges from 51 °f 11 °c on the pacific coast to 40 °f 4 °c in the northeast the lowest temperature recorded in the state was −48 °f −44 °c in winthrop and mazama the highest recorded temperature in the state was 118 °f 48 °c at ice harbor dam both records were set east of the cascades western washington is known for its mild climate considerable fog frequent cloud cover and

of washington state early historyedit a farm and barren hills near riverside in north central washington the skeletal remains of kennewick man one of the oldest and most complete human remains ever found in north america were discovered in washington51 before the coming of europeans the region had many established tribes of aboriginal americans notable for their totem poles and their ornately carved canoes and masks prominent among their industries were salmon fishing and notably among the makah whale hunting the peoples of the interior had a very different subsistencebased culture based on hunting foodgathering and some forms of agriculture as well as a dependency on salmon from the columbia and its tributaries the smallpox epidemic of the 1770s devastated the native american population52 european explorationedit the first recorded european landing on the washington coast was by spanish captain don bruno de heceta in 1775 on board the santiago part of a twoship flotilla with the sonora he claimed all the coastal lands up to prince william sound for spain as part of their claimed rights under the treaty of tordesillas which they maintained made the pacific a spanish lake and all its shores part of the spanish empire in 1778 british explorer captain james cook sighted cape flattery at the entrance to the strait of juan de fuca but cook did not realize the strait existed it was not discovered until charles william barkley captain of the imperial eagle sighted it in 1787 the straits were further explored by spanish explorers manuel quimper in 1790 and francisco de eliza in 1791 and british explorer george vancouver in 1792 settlementedit the britishspanish nootka convention of 1790 ended spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the northwest coast to explorers and traders from other nations most notably britain and russia as well as the fledgling united states american captain robert gray for whom grays harbor county is named then discovered the mouth of the columbia river he named the river after his ship the columbia beginning in 1792 gray established trade in sea otter pelts the lewis and clark expedition entered the state on october 10 1805 explorer david thompson on his voyage down the columbia river camped at the confluence with the snake river on july 9 1811 and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for great britain and stating the intention of the north west company to build a trading post at the site fur trading at fort nez percés in 1841 britain and the united states agreed to what has since been described as joint occupancy of lands west of the continental divide to the pacific ocean as part of the angloamerican convention of 1818 which established the 49th parallel as the international boundary west from lake of the woods to the rocky mountains resolution of the territorial and treaty issues west to the pacific were deferred until a later time spain in 1819 ceded their rights north of the 42nd parallel to the united states although these rights did not include possession negotiations with great britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the oregon boundary dispute was highly contested between britain and the united states disputed jointoccupancy by britain and the us lasted for several decades with american settlers pouring into oregon country hudsons bay company which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade reversed its position in an attempt to maintain british control of the columbia district fur trapper james sinclair on orders from sir george simpson governor of the hudsons bay company led some 200 settlers from the red river colony west in 1841 to settle on hudson bay company farms near fort vancouver the party crossed the rockies into the columbia valley near presentday radium hot springs british columbia then traveled southwest down the kootenai river and columbia river despite such efforts britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the united states in the oregon treaty on june 15 1846 in 1836 a group of missionaries including marcus whitman established several missions and whitmans own settlement waiilatpu in what is now southeastern washington state near present day walla walla county in territory of both the cayuse and the nez perce indian tribes whitmans settlement would in 1843 help the oregon trail the overland emigration route to the west get established for thousands of emigrants in following decades marcus provided medical care for the native americans but when indian patients – lacking immunity to new european diseases – died in striking numbers while at the same time many white patients recovered they held medicine man marcus whitman personally responsible and murdered whitman and twelve other white settlers in the whitman massacre in 1847 this event triggered the cayuse war between settlers and indians fort nisqually a farm and trading post of the hudsons bay company and the first european settlement in the puget sound area was founded in 1833 black pioneer george washington bush and his caucasian wife isabella james bush from missouri and tennessee respectively led four white families into the territory and founded new market now tumwater in 1846 they settled in washington to avoid oregons

washington territory initially extended farther east than the present states including what is now the idaho panhandle and parts of western montana and picked up more land to the southeast that was left behind when oregon was admitted as a state the creation of idaho territory in 1863 established the final eastern border a washington state constitution was drafted and ratified in 1878 but it was

prominent industries in the state included agriculture and lumber in eastern washington the yakima river valley became known for its apple orchards while the growth of wheat using dry farming techniques became particularly productive heavy rainfall to the west of the cascade range produced dense forests and the ports along puget sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products particularly the douglas fir other industries that developed in the state included fishing salmon canning and mining industrial eraedit boeing b17e flying fortress bombers under construction
