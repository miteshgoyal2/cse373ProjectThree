external links production and musicedit you are not alone is a rb ballad about love and isolation23 the song was written by r kelly and produced by kelly and jackson2 kelly wrote the song after losing close people in his life4 kelly was delighted to be able to work with his idol explaining i was psyched  i feel i could have done his whole album not being selfish i was just that geeked about it it was an experience out of this world  its amazing to know that five years ago i was writing songs in a basement in the ghetto and now im writing for michael jackson  id be a fool not to say its a dream come true5 jackson contacted kelly to see if he had any material available kelly forwarded a tape recording of the song and jackson then agreed to work with kelly on the piece5 on the tape sent to jackson kelly sung you are not alone mimicking jacksons vocal style explaining i think i am him i become him i want him to feel that as well jackson found the interpretation amusing6 they spent the last week of november 1994 together in the studio working on the track5 jackson explained that he instantly liked the song but listened to it twice before making his final decision although the song was written by kelly jackson was adamant that the production should be a collaborative effort amongst the two musicians4 the tape sent to him had no harmony or modulations so jackson added a choir in the final portion and added a sense of climax and structure to the final piece7 the song has a tempo of 60 beats per minute making it one of jacksons slowest songs8 in 2007 a belgian court ruled that r kelly had plagiarized the 1993 song if we can start all over when composing you are not alone the court transferred rights of jacksons hit to the twin composer brothers eddy and danny van passel the judgment is only recognized in belgium and airplay of the hit has been banned there91011 critical reactionedit you are not alone received positive views from music critics james hunter of rolling stone noted that the excellent current single scream or the firstrate rb ballad you are not alone – manage to link the incidents of jacksons infamous recent past to universal concepts like injustice or isolation when he bases his music in the bluntness of hiphop jackson sketches funky scenarios denouncing greed blanket unreliability and false accusation3 jon pareles of the new york times said that it was the only conventional love song on the new material on history he compared it to mariah careys song hero and said it sounds like a surefire hit2 in more recent years stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic expressed the opinion that you are not alone was amongst some of the best songs jackson ever released calling the song seductive12 the rb critic and journalist nelson george described the song as lovely and supple13 writer and journalist j randy taraborrelli wrote of the song in 2004 it remains among michaels best songs  on listening to you are not alone one wonders how many times michael tried to tell himself during his most desperate and anguished times that he did have support in his life from a higher power or even friends and family whether he actually believed it or not14 fred shuster of the daily news of los angeles described it as the best song on the album15 conversely while steve holsey of michigan chronicle gave the album a positive review he described the song as the worst on the album calling the kelly penned lyrics trite and below the standard set by jacksons own lyrical skills16 you are not alone received an american music award nomination and a grammy nomination both for best pop vocal performance17 chart performanceedit commercially you are not alone remains one of jacksons best selling singles and it is also his 13th number one hit it holds the guinness world record for the first song ever to debut at number one on the billboard hot 100 chart18 first week sales were 120000 copies it was certified platinum by the riaa and sold one

number 224 with the exception of italy it became a top ten hit in every major market2024 music videoedit presley leans down towards her husband in the temple scene of the music video the music video was directed by wayne isham on july 12 1995 and begins with a large number of paparazzi taking photographs of jackson the plot then centers around two locations a temple where jackson appears in an affectionate seminude scene with his thenwife lisa marie presley and a theater where jackson performs the song to an empty hall jackson also appears alone in other locations such as deserts and along tide pools the slightly extended version that appeared on history on film volume ii was notable for a scene where special effects were used to give jackson white feathery almost angelic wings the other version of the video is included on number ones and michael jacksons vision the temple scenes were a homage to maxfield parrishs 1922 painting daybreak25 the theater scenes were filmed at the pantages theatre in los angeles live performancesedit michael first performed you are not alone at the 1995 soul train music awards then at the 1995 bet awards and also at the 1995 mtv video music
