the cofounder of sony tokyo tsushin kogyoedit sony began in the wake of world war ii in 1946 masaru ibuka started an electronics shop in a department store building in tokyo the company started with a capital of ¥19000017 and a total of eight employees18 in may 1946 ibuka was joined by akio morita to found a company called tokyo tsushin kogyo 東京通信工業1920 tokyo telecommunications engineering corporation the company built japans first tape recorder called the typeg19 in 1958 the company changed its name to sony21 nameedit when tokyo tsushin kogyo was looking for a romanized name to use to market themselves they strongly considered using their initials ttk the primary reason they did not is that the railway company tokyo kyuko was known as ttk19 the company occasionally used the acronym totsuko in japan but during his visit to the united states morita discovered that americans had trouble pronouncing that name another early name that was tried out for a while was tokyo teletech until akio morita discovered that there was an american company already using teletech as a brand name22 the name sony was chosen for the brand as a mix of two words one was the latin word sonus which is the root of sonic and sound and the other was sonny a common slang term used in 1950s america to call a young boy6 in the 1950s japan sonny boys was a loan word into japanese which connoted smart and presentable young men which sony founders akio morita and masaru ibuka considered themselves to be6 the first sonybranded product the tr55 transistor radio appeared in 1955 but the company name did not change to sony until january 195823 at the time of the change it was extremely unusual for a japanese company to use roman letters to spell its name instead of writing it in kanji the move was not without opposition ttks principal bank at the time mitsui had strong feelings about the name they pushed for a name such as sony electronic industries or sony teletech akio morita was firm however as he did not want the company name tied to any particular industry eventually both ibuka and mitsui banks chairman gave their approval19 globalizationedit according to schiffer sonys tr63 radio cracked open the us market and launched the new industry of consumer microelectronics by the mid1950s american teens had begun buying portable transistor radios in huge numbers helping to propel the fledgling industry from an estimated 100000 units in 1955 to 5 million units by the end of 1968citation needed sony cofounder akio morita founded sony corporation of america in 196018 in the process he was struck by the mobility of employees between american companies which was unheard of in japan at that time18 when he returned to japan he encouraged experienced middleaged employees of other companies to reevaluate their careers and consider joining sony18 the company filled many positions in this manner and inspired other japanese companies to do the same18 moreover sony played a major role in the development of japan as a powerful exporter during the 1960s 1970s and 1980s24 it also helped to significantly improve american perceptions of made in japan products25 known for its production quality sony was able to charge abovemarket prices for its consumer electronics and resisted lowering prices25 in 1971 masaru ibuka handed the position of president over to his cofounder akio morita sony began a life insurance company in 1979 one of its many peripheral businesses amid a global recession in the early 1980s electronics sales dropped and the company was forced to cut prices25 sonys profits fell sharply its over for sony one analyst concluded the companys best days are behind it25 around that time norio ohga took up the role of president he encouraged the development of the compact disc in the 1970s and 1980s and of the playstation in the early 1990s ohga went on to purchase cbs records in 1988 and columbia pictures in 1989 greatly expanding sonys media presence ohga would succeed morita as chief executive officer in 198926citation needed under the vision of cofounder akio morita27 and his successors the company had aggressively expanded into new businesses24 part of its motivation for doing so was the pursuit of convergence linking film music and digital electronics via the internet24 this expansion proved unrewarding and unprofitable24 threatening sonys ability to charge a premium on its products27 as well as its brand name27 in 2005 howard stringer replaced nobuyuki idei as chief executive officer marking the first time that a foreigner had run a major japanese electronics firm stringer helped to reinvigorate the companys struggling media businesses encouraging blockbusters such as spiderman while cutting 9000 jobs24 he hoped to sell off peripheral business and focus the company again on electronics27 furthermore he aimed to increase cooperation between business units27 which he described as silos operating in isolation from one another28 in a bid to provide a unified brand for its global operations sony introduced a slogan known as makebelieve in 200926citation needed despite some successes the company faced continued struggles in the mid to late2000s24 in 2012 kazuo hirai was promoted to president and ceo replacing stringer shortly thereafter hirai outlined his companywide initiative named one sony to revive sony from years of financial losses and bureaucratic management structure which proved difficult for former ceo stringer to accomplish partly due to differences in business culture and native languages between stringer and some of sonys japanese divisions and subsidiaries hirai outlined three major areas of focus for sonys electronics business which include imaging technology gaming and mobile technology as well as a focus on reducing the major losses from the television business29 sony store in markville shopping centre in 2014 in february 2014 sony announced the sale of its vaio pc
