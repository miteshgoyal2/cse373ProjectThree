recordingedit the writing of the girl is mine was completed by jackson as he watched cartoons with paul mccartney2 producer quincy jones had initially told jackson to write a song about two men fighting over a girl inspired jackson awoke during the night and sang the song into a tape recorder he later said i sang exactly what i heard in my head starting with the melody and the keyboard and the strings and everything so i just orally put it all on tape jones also asked jackson to add a rap verse3 the song was then recorded by jackson and mccartney at westlake studios los angeles from april 14 to 16 1982 the year before the duo had recorded say say say and the man for mccartneys fifth solo album pipes of peace 19834 jackson said that the recording of the girl is mine was one of his most enjoyable moments in the studio he stated one of my favourite songs to record of all my recordings as a solo artist is probably the girl is mine because working with paul mccartney was pretty exciting and we just literally had fun it was like lots of kibitzing and playing and throwing stuff at each other and making jokes we actually recorded the instrumental track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time and we do have footage of it but its never been shown he concluded maybe one day well give you a sneak preview of it4 the footage of the pair was later shown at the paul mccartney world tour4 many members of the band toto participated in the recording of this song including david paich piano jeff porcaro drums steve lukather guitars and steve porcaro synthesizers compositionedit the musical structuring of the girl is mine uses the aaba form in which the songs title serves as the main source of needed repetition5 when used to the maximum this structuring also known as the thirtytwobar form has the title repeat itself in the same place in at least two of the three a verses5 author sheila davis book the craft of lyric writing notes that the repeated title line simultaneously outlines the framework of the design and drives home the main point of the lyric5 jacksons shes out of my life also uses this musical structuring as does body and soul oh lady be good and try a little tenderness5 the musical chords in the girl is mine are seen in several songs written by jackson thats what you get for being polite from the jacksons destiny album and two unreleased songs why cant i be and thank you for life used the chords before the girl is mine367 release and receptionedit despite recording say say say and the man a year prior the girl is mine was the first song to gain a release from the duo and the first single from the thriller album the girl is mine was released as a single on october 18 1982 the singles cover photograph was taken by mccartneys wife linda4 listeners were not impressed by the girl is mine and thought that jacksons thriller would also be a disappointment the public felt that jackson and the producer quincy jones had created a song for the white pop audience2 despite some of the publics concerns the girl is mine achieved success in the music charts topping the rb singles chart the single peaked at number two on the billboard hot 100 behind maneater by hall oates and down under by men at work and the norwegian singles chart48 the girl is mine reached number one on the hot adult contemporary tracks chart9 the

association of america for shipments of at least one million units10 since its release the girl is mine has received mixed reviews from journalists and music critics journalist robert christgau described the pairing of mccartney and jackson as michaels worst idea since ben11 rolling stone stated that the song was a wimpoid mor middle of the road ballad and that mccartney was tame12 stephen erlewine of allmusic noted that the song had a sweet schmaltz13 jacksons breakdown with the irrepressibly silly paul mccartney was disarmingly goofy according to stylus magazine14 saloncom later described the girl is mine as a sappy duet they concluded that mccartney had become a wimpy old fart15 the song garnered a favourable review from jacksons biographer j randy taraborrelli the writer stated that the song was cute but lacked substance he added that the track had a middleoftheroad calm and was the antithesis of the rambunctious beat it216 chartsedit chart 19821983 peak position

jackson to testify in court and each lawsuit found in the favour of the singer and his record label the first legal trial occurred in 1984 with fred sanford claiming that jackson had cut a tape of his song please love me now jackson however insisted that he composed the girl is mine the 5 million copyright suit was closed after the jury of five men and a woman reached a verdict in the favour of jackson their verdict was reached after a threeday deliberation jackson was not a defendant in the trial but testified to maintain his credibility319 james klenk jacksons attorney praised the singer upon the jurys verdict the man is a genius he doesnt need anyone elses songs his own words were the key3 during the court proceedings jackson revealed how he composes his songs i put them in a tape recorder and i orally sing them into the tape and thats how it happens3 one juror stated his presentation indicated that he was well able to develop his own songs319 the songs second plagiarism trial was in 1993 reynaud jones and robert smith alleged that the girl is mine along with thriller—written by rod temperton—and we are the world resembled their musical works the pair added that they had been childhood neighbours of the jackson family when they had resided in gary indiana jackson lionel richie—cowriter of we are the world—and quincy jones were named as the defendants the plaintiffs asserted that joseph jackson had received a demo tape from them from the tapes the defendants were alleged to have stolen the three hit songs reynaud jones also claimed that he had considered suing jackson over billie jean jackson appeared in court via a taped testimony2021 following the testimony the ninemember jury found jackson to be the writer and composer of the girl is mine in early 1994

demo of the song by jackson before he had recorded the duet with mccartney william added his own vocals and new verse though the remix sampled the demo the daily telegraph alleged that mccartney was omitted because he and jackson had fallen out over the latters purchase of sonyatv music publishing and the beatles song catalogue in 198523 despite the allegation the original version of the girl is mine was included on the album with mccartneys vocals included24 upon its release in 2008 the song reached number 12 in new zealand peaking at 22 in france the song charted within the top 50 of denmark sweden and switzerland the remix peaked at number 51 in switzerland25 receptionedit the girl is mine 2008 received mostly unfavourable reviews from music critics journalist christopher rees stated that william had done a fantastic job of murdering a classic song26 rob sheffield of rolling stone noted that williams production was dumbthug bluster and criticized him for trying to hide the goofy doggone hook—the whole point of the song27 music journalist aidin vaziri criticized the song stating the black eyed peas rapper completely erases paul mccartneys vocal track from the original duet to make room for himself spouting nonsense such as i call her mommy and she call me papaim sorry mike but she loves the way i rocka28 stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic claimed that william had turned the girl is mine into a hapless dance number29 kelefa sanneh of blender noted that william contributes beats why and rhymes why oh why to the girl is mine 2008 30 igns todd gilchrist stated that williams the girl is mine remix was an offense the offense was made even more egregious by the insertion of his own atonal vocal presence in place of mccartneys31 pitchfork media added to the unfavourable reviews stating of william he takes macca off the girl is mine but decides it cant work without someone sounding like an idiot and steps manfully in himself32 the times stated that whoever thought it was a good idea for william to participate in the song ought to be locked in a windowless cell with nothing but those songs on a continuous loop33 popmatters however praised thriller 25 and the remix of the girl is mine they wrote any album good enough to make you forgive although maybe not forget a song as bad as the paul mccartney duet the girl is mine has got to be damn good they added that william had put a breezy spin on the track and that the songs omission of mccartney did not suffer because of it34 chartsedit chart 2008 peak position austrian singles
