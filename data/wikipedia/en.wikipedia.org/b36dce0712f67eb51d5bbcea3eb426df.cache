disambiguation american burlesque dancer lola bel aire performing a traditional striptease josephine baker in her girdle of bananas outfit first seen in the folies bergère show la folie du jour in 192627 a striptease is an erotic or exotic dance in which the performer gradually undresses either partly or completely in a seductive and sexually suggestive manner1 the person who performs a striptease is commonly known as a stripper or exotic dancer in western countries the venues where stripteases are performed on a regular basis are now usually called strip clubs though they may be performed in venues such as pubs especially in the uk theaters and music halls at times a stripper may be hired to perform at a bachelor or bachelorette party in addition to providing adult entertainment stripping can be a form of sexual play between partners this can be done as an impromptu event or – perhaps for a special occasion – with elaborate planning involving fantasy wear music special lighting practiced dance moves or unrehearsed dance moves striptease involves a slow sensuous undressing the stripper may prolong the undressing with delaying tactics such as the wearing of additional clothes or putting clothes or hands in front of just undressed body parts such as the breasts or genitalia the emphasis is on the act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement rather than the state of being undressed in the past the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished though todays strippers usually continue dancing in the nude23 the costume the stripper wears before disrobing can form part of the act in some cases audience interaction can form part of the act with audience urging the stripper to remove more clothing or the stripper approaching the audience to interact with them striptease and public nudity have been subject to legal and cultural prohibitions and other aesthetic considerations and taboos restrictions on venues may be through venue licensing requirements and constraints and a wide variety of national and local laws these laws vary considerably around the world and even between different parts of the same country h l mencken is credited with coining the word ecdysiast – from ecdysis meaning to molt – in response to a request from striptease artist georgia sothern for a more dignified way to refer to her profession gypsy rose lee one of the most famous striptease artists of all time approved of the term456 contents 1 history 11 french tradition 12 american tradition 13 british tradition 14 japan 2

dates and occasions have been given from ancient babylonia to 20th century america the term striptease was first recorded in 19328 though stripping in the sense of women removing clothing to sexually excite men seems to go back to at least the late 19th centurycitation needed there is a stripping aspect in the ancient sumerian myth of the descent of the goddess inanna into the underworld or kur at each of the seven gates she removed an article of clothing or a piece of jewelry as long as she remained in hell the earth was barren when she returned fecundity abounded some believe this myth was embodied in the dance of the seven veils of salome who danced for king herod as mentioned in the new testament in matthew 146 and mark 62122 however although the bible records salomes dance the first mention of her removing seven veils occurs in oscar wildes play of salome in 1893 in ancient greece the lawgiver solon established several classes of prostitutes in the late 6th century bc among these classes of prostitutes were the auletrides female dancers acrobats and musicians noted for dancing naked in an alluring fashion in front of audiences of men91011 in ancient rome dance featuring stripping was part of the entertainments ludi at the floralia an april festival in honor of the goddess flora12 empress theodora wife of 6thcentury byzantine emperor justinian is reported by several ancient sources to have started in life as a courtesan and actress who performed in acts inspired from mythological themes and in which she disrobed as far as the laws of the day allowed she was famous for her striptease performance of leda and the swan13 from these accounts it appears that the practice was hardly exceptional nor new it was however actively opposed by the christian church which succeeded in obtaining statutes banning it in the following century the degree to which these statutes were subsequently enforced is of course opened to question what is certain is that no practice of the sort is reported in texts of the european middle ages an early version of striptease became popular in england at the time of the restoration a strip tease was incorporated into the restoration comedy the rover written by aphra behn in 1677 the stripper is a man an english country gentleman who sensually undresses and goes to bed in a love scene however the scene is played for laughs the prostitute he thinks is going to bed with him robs him and he ends up having to crawl out of the sewer the concept of striptease was also widely known as can be seen in the reference to it in thomas otways comedy the soldiers fortune 1681 where a character says be sure they be lewd drunken stripping whores14 striptease became standard fare in the brothels of 18th century london where the women called posture girls would strip naked on tables for popular entertainment15 la fontaine plate 1896 striptease was also combined with music as in the 1720 german translation of the french la guerre despagne cologne pierre marteau 1707 where a galant party of high aristocrats and opera singers has resorted to a small château where they entertain themselves with hunting play and music in a threeday turn the dancers to please their lovers the more dropped their clothes and danced totally naked the nicest entrées and ballets one of the princes directed the delightful music and only the lovers were allowed to watch the performances16 an arabic custom first noted by french colonialists and described by the french novelist gustave flaubert may have influenced the french striptease the dances of the ghawazee in north africa and egypt consisted of the erotic dance of the bee performed by a woman known as kuchuk hanem in this dance the performer disrobes as she searches for an imaginary bee trapped within her garments it is likely that the women performing these dances did not do so in an indigenous context but rather responded to the commercial climate for this type of entertainment17 middle eastern belly dance also known as oriental dancing was popularized in the united states after its introduction on the midway at the 1893 worlds fair in chicago by a dancer known as little egypt18 some claim the origin of the modern striptease lies in oscar wildes play of salome in 1893 in the dance of the seven veils the female protagonist dances for king herod and slowly removes her veils until she lies naked19 after wildes play and richard strausss operatic version of the same first performed in 1905 the erotic dance of the seven veils became a standard routine for dancers in opera vaudeville film and burlesque a famous early practitioner was maud allan who in 1907 gave a private performance of the dance to king edward vii french traditionedit mata hari the most celebrated segment of her stage act was the progressive shedding of her clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments over her arms and head in the 1880s and 1890s parisian shows such as the moulin rouge and folies bergère were featuring attractive scantily clad women dancing and tableaux vivants in this environment an act in the 1890s featured a woman who slowly removed her clothes in a vain search for a flea crawling on her body the peoples almanac credits the act as the origin of modern striptease in 1905 the notorious and tragic dutch dancer mata hari later shot as a spy by the french authorities during world war i was an overnight success from the debut of her act at the musée guimet20 the most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments over her arms and head21 another landmark performance was the appearance at the moulin rouge in 1907 of an actress called germaine aymos who entered dressed only in three very small shells in the 1920s and 1930s the famous josephine baker danced topless in the danse sauvage at the folies and other such performances were provided at the tabarin these shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers in his 1957 book mythologies semiotician roland barthes interpreted this parisian striptease as a mystifying spectacle a reassuring ritual where evil is advertised the better to impede and exorcise it22 by the 1960s fully nude shows were provided at such places as le crazy horse saloon23 american traditionedit play media charmion in her disrobing act 1901 a fully nude stripper performs outdoor in a pool at nudesapoppin event usa 2013 in the united states striptease started in traveling carnivals and burlesque theatres and featured famous strippers such as gypsy rose lee and sally rand the vaudeville trapeze artist charmion performed a disrobing act onstage as early as 1896 which was captured in the 1901 edison film trapeze disrobing act another milestone for modern american striptease is the possibly legendary show at minskys burlesque in april 1925 the night they raided minskys the minsky brothers brought burlesque to new yorks 42nd street however the burlesque theatres here were prohibited from having striptease performances in a legal ruling of 1937 leading to the later decline of these grindhouses named after the bump n grind entertainment on offer into venues for cinema24 the 1960s saw a revival of striptease in the form of topless gogo dancing this eventually merged with the older tradition of burlesque dancing carol doda of the condor night club in the north beach section of san francisco is given the credit of being the first topless gogo dancer25 the club opened in 1964 and dodas première topless dance occurred on the evening of june 19 of that year262627 the large lit sign in front of the club featured a picture of her with red lights on her breasts the club went bottomless on september 3 1969 and began the trend of explicit full nudity in american striptease dancing28 san francisco is also the location of the notorious mitchell brothers ofarrell theatre originally an xrated movie theater this striptease club pioneered lap dancing in 1980 and was a major force in popularizing it in strip clubs on a nationwide and eventually worldwide basis29 british traditionedit in britain in the 1930s when laura henderson began presenting nude shows at the windmill theatre london the british law prohibited naked girls from moving to get around the prohibition the models appeared in stationary tableaux vivants30 the windmill girls also toured other london and provincial theatres sometimes using ingenious devices such as rotating ropes to move their bodies round though strictly speaking staying within the letter of the law by not moving of their own volition another example of the way the shows stayed within the law was the fan dance in which a naked dancers body was concealed by her fans and those of her attendants until the end of her act in when she posed nude for a brief interval whilst standing still in 1942 phyllis dixey formed her own company of girls and rented the whitehall theatre in london to put on a review called the whitehall follies by the 1950s touring striptease acts were used to attract audiences to the dying music halls arthur fox started his touring shows in 1948 and paul raymond started his in 1951 paul raymond later leased the doric ballroom in soho and opened his private members club the raymond revuebar in 1958 this was one of the first of the private striptease members clubs in britain the windmill theatre in 2009 changes in the law in the 1960s brought about a boom of strip clubs in soho with fully nude dancing and audience participation31 pubs were also used as a venue most particularly in the east end with a concentration of such venues in the district of shoreditch this pub striptease seems in the main to have evolved from topless gogo dancing32 though often a target of local authority harassment some of these pubs survive to the present day an interesting custom in these pubs is that the strippers walk round and collect money from the customers in a beer jug before each individual performance this custom appears to have originated in the late 1970s when topless gogo dancers first started collecting money from the audience as the fee for going fully nude32 private dances of a more raunchy nature are sometimes available in a separate area of the pub3 japanedit striptease became popular in japan after the end of world war ii when entrepreneur shigeo ozaki saw gypsy rose lee perform he started his own striptease revue in tokyos shinjuku neighborhood during the 1950s japanese strip shows became more sexually explicit and less danceoriented until they were eventually simply live sex shows33 pole

private table dancing though despite media misrepresentation lapdancing in the sense of bodily contact was forbidden by law34 feature shows are used to generate interest from potential customers who otherwise would not visit the establishment but know the performer from other outlets a headlining star of a striptease show is referred to as a feature dancer and is often a performer with credits such as contest titles or appearances in adult films or magazines the decadesold practice continued through the late 2000s decade to the present day with highprofile adult film performers such as jenna haze and teagan presley scheduling feature shows through the usa in december 2006 a norwegian court ruled that striptease is an art form and made strip clubs exempt from value added tax35 new

subject to legal and cultural prohibitions on moral and decency grounds such restrictions have been embodied in venue licensing regulations and various national and local laws including liquor licensing restrictions a neoburlesque stripper at the miss exotic world pageant in 2006 showing the use of pasties as required in some us jurisdictions usedit numerous us jurisdictions have specific laws on the books related to striptease one of the more notorious local ordinances is san diego municipal code 33361036 specific and strict in response to allegations of corruption among local officials37 which included contacts in the nude entertainment industry among its provisions is the six foot rule copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a sixfoot distance while performing other rules forbid full nudity in some parts of the usa there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples which have thus to be covered by pasties by the dancer though no such taboo applies to the exposure of male nipples2 in early 2010 the city of detroit banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs following the example of houston which began enforcing a similar ordinance in 200838 the city council has since softened the rules eliminating the requirement for pasties39 but kept other restrictions both cities were reputed to have rampant occurrences of illicit activity linked to its striptease establishments4041 for some jurisdictions even certain postures can be considered indecent such as spreading the legs42 britainedit in britain in the 1930s when the
