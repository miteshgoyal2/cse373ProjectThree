of the voyages of christopher columbus as a year to promote continental unity and liberation 4 after the conference attendees from northern california organized to plan protests against the quincentennial jubilee that had been organized by the united states congress for the san francisco bay area on columbus day 1992 it was to include replicas of columbus ships sailing under the golden gate bridge and reenacting their discovery of america the delegates formed the bay area indian alliance and in turn the resistance 500 task force5 it promoted the idea that columbus discovery of an
