ordered nbc to spin off the former nbc blue network into an independent company in 19433 the split which nbc conducted voluntarily in the event that its appeal to have the ruling overturned was denied was enforced to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the united states as the industry had only a few companies such as nbc and cbs that dominated the radio market and in particular was intended to prevent the limited competition from dominating news and political broadcasting and projecting narrow pointsofview television broadcasting was suspended however during world war ii regular television news broadcasts on abc began soon after the network signed on its initial ownedandoperated television station wjztv now wabctv and production center in new york city in august 1948 abc news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948 however from the 1950s through the early 1970s abc news programs as was the case with the television network in general during that period consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on cbs and nbc until the 1970s the abc television network had fewer affiliate stations as well as a weaker primetime programming slate to be able to truly support the networks news operations in comparison to the two larger networks each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s under roone arledgeedit only after roone arledge the president of abc sports at the time was appointed as president of abc news in 1977 at a time when the networks primetime entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the abc corporation overall was abc able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content arledge known for experimenting with the broadcast model created many of abc news most popular and enduring programs including 2020 world news
