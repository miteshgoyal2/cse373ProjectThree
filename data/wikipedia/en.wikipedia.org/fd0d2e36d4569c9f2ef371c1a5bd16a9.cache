which include record companies publishing firms music retailers independent promoters film and tv companies and artist managers soundscan is the sales source for the billboard music charts making it the largest source of sales records in the music industry nielsen soundscan began tracking sales data for nielsen on march 1 19911 the may 25 issue of billboard published billboard 200 and country album charts based on soundscan piece count data23 and the first hot 100 chart to debut with the system was released on november 30 1991 previously billboard tracked sales by calling stores across the us and asking about sales – a method that was inherently errorprone and open to outright fraud indeed while transitioning from the calling to tracking methods the airplay and sales charts already monitored by nielsen and the hot 100 then still using the calling system often did not match for instance paula abduls promise of a new day and roxettes fading like a flower reached much higher hot 100 peaks than their actual sales and airplay would have allowed them to4 although most record company executives conceded that the new method was far more accurate than the old the charts volatility and its geographical balance initially caused deep concern before the change and the market shifts it brought about were accepted across the industry tower records the countrys secondlargest retail chain was originally not included in the sample because its stores are equipped with different technology to measure sales5 6 at first some industry executives complained that the new system — which relied on hightech sales measurement rather than store employee estimates — was based on an inadequate sample one that favored established and mainstream acts over newcomers7 8 the recording industry

impactedit the incorporation of soundscan tracking by the billboard charting system was noted by the industry as being a possible cause of the early90s popularization of alternative music in the united states an explanation floated was that the previous call system provided data that underrepresented marginal genres under soundscan exact data about alternative music sales allowed these acts to appear higher in the billboard charts than before and this chart success fed back into increasing the genres perceived popularity in popular culture in addition soundscan data quickly found use in the promotion departments at major record labels as a way to use sales data to persuade radio station music directors to add tracks by highselling alternative artists such as nirvana910 see alsoedit
