most of its history up until independence the country was known as santo domingo28—the name of its present capital and patron saint saint dominic—and continued to be commonly known as such in english until the early 20th century29 the residents were called dominicanos dominicans which is the adjective form of domingo and the revolutionaries named their newly independent country la república dominicana in the national anthem of the dominican republic himno nacional the term dominican does not appear the author of its lyrics emilio prudhomme consistently uses the poetic term quisqueyanos that is quisqueyans the word quisqueya derives from a native tongue of the taino indians and means mother of all lands it is often used in songs as another name for the country the name of the country is often shortened to the dr30 history main article history of the dominican republic preeuropean history main article chiefdoms of hispaniola the five caciquedoms of hispaniola the pomier caves are a series of 55 caves located north of san cristobal in the dominican republic they contain the largest collection of 2000yearold rock art in the caribbean the arawakanspeaking taíno moved into hispaniola from the north east region of what is now known as south america displacing earlier inhabitants31 c ad 650 they engaged in farming and fishing32 and hunting and gathering31 the fierce caribs drove the taíno to the northeastern caribbean during much of the 15th century33 the estimates of hispaniolas population in 1492 vary widely including one hundred thousand34 three hundred thousand31 and four hundred thousand to two million35 determining precisely how many people lived on the island in precolumbian times is next to impossible as no accurate records exist36 by 1492 the island was divided into five taíno chiefdoms3738 the taíno name for the entire island was either ayiti or quisqueya39 the spaniards arrived in 1492 after initially friendly relationships the taínos resisted the conquest led by the female chief anacaona of xaragua and her exhusband chief caonabo of maguana as well as chiefs guacanagaríx guamá hatuey and enriquillo the latters successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island within a few years after 1492 the population of taínos had declined drastically due to smallpox40 measles and other diseases that arrived with the europeans41 and from other causes discussed below the first recorded smallpox outbreak in the americas occurred on hispaniola in 150741 the last record of pure taínos in the country was from 1864 still taíno biological heritage survived to an important extent due to intermixing census records from 1514 reveal that 40 of spanish men in santo domingo were married to taino women42 and some presentday dominicans have taíno ancestry4344 remnants of the taino culture include their cave paintings45 as well as pottery designs which are still used in the small artisan village of higüerito moca46 european colonization christopher columbus arrives in the new world christopher columbus arrived on the island in december 5 1492 during the first of his four voyages to the americas he claimed the land for spain and named it la española due to its diverse climate and terrain which reminded him of the spanish landscape47 traveling further east columbus came across the yaque del norte river in the cibao region which he named rio de oro after discovering gold deposits nearby48 on columbus return during his second voyage he established the settlement of la isabela in what is now puerto plata on jan 1494 while he sent alonso de ojeda to search for gold in the region in 1496 bartholomew columbus christophers brother built the city of santo domingo western europes first permanent settlement in the new world the colony thus became the springboard for the further spanish conquest of america and for decades the headquarters of spanish colonial power in the hemisphere soon after the largest discovery of gold in the island was made in the cordillera central region which led to a mining boom by 1501 columbus cousin giovanni colombus had also discovered gold near buenaventura the deposits were later known as minas nuevas two major mining areas resulted one along san cristobalbuenaventura and another in cibao within the la vegacotuybonao triangle while santiago de los caballeros concepcion and bonao became mining towns the gold rush of 1500–1508 ensued49 ferdinand ii of aragon ordered gold from the richest mines reserved for the crown thus ovando expropriated the gold mines of miguel diaz and francisco de garay in 1504 as pit mines became royal mines though placers were open to private prospectors furthermore ferdinand wanted the best indians working his royal mines and kept 967 in the san cristobal mining area supervised by salaried miners49687178125–127 under nicolás de ovando y cáceres governorship the indians were made to work in the gold mines where they were grossly overworked mistreated and underfed according to pons by 1503 the spanish crown legalized the distribution of indians to work the mines as part of the encomienda system according to pons once the indians entered the mines hunger and disease literally wiped them out by 1508 the indian population of about 400000 was reduced to 60000 and by 1514 only 26334 remained about half were located in the mining towns of concepcion santiago santo domingo and buenaventura the repartimiento of 1514 accelerated emigration of the spanish colonists coupled with the exhaustion of the mines in 1516 a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8000 of the remaining 11000 indians in one month by 1519 according to pons both the gold economy and the indian population became extinct at the same time5049191–192 the alcázar of colón located in santo domingo is the oldest viceregal residence in all of the americas after its conquest of the aztecs and incas spain neglected its caribbean holdings english and french buccaneers settled in northwestern hispaniola coast and after years of struggles with the french spain ceded the western coast of the island to france with the 1697 treaty of ryswick whilst the central plateau remained under spanish domain france created a wealthy colony saintdomingue there while the spanish colony suffered an economic decline51 the colony of santo domingo saw a spectacular population increase during the 17th century as it rose from some 6000 in 1637 to about 91272 in 1750 of this number approximately 38272 were white landowners 38000 were free mixed people of color and some 15000 were slaves this contrasted sharply with the population of the french colony of saintdomingue present day haiti – which had a population that was 90 enslaved and overall seven times as numerous as the spanish colony of santo domingo51 french rule 1795 1809 france came to own hispaniola in 1795 when by the peace of basel spain ceded santo domingo as a consequence of the french revolutionary wars the recently freed africans led by toussaint louverture in 1801 took over santo domingo in the east thus gaining control of the entire island in 1802 an army sent by napoleon captured toussaint louverture and sent him to france as prisoner toussaint louverture’s lieutenants and the spread of yellow fever succeeded in driving the french again from saintdomingue which in 1804 the rebels made independent as the republic of haiti eastwards france continued to rule spanish santo domingo in 1805 haitian troops of general henri christophe invaded santo domingo and sacked the towns of santiago de los caballeros and moca killing most of their residents and helping to lay the foundation for two centuries of animosity between the two countries in 1808 following

1822–44 main article unification of hispaniola jeanpierre boyer the mulatto ruler of haiti the newly independent republic ended two months later under the haitian government led by jeanpierre boyer54 as toussaint louverture had done two decades earlier the haitians abolished slavery in order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that haiti agreed to pay the former french colonists and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs the haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the dominicans since haiti was unable to adequately provision its army the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint attempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure terrenos comuneros which had arisen with the ranching economy and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under boyer and joseph balthazar inginacs code rural55 in the rural and rugged mountainous areas the haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws it was in the city of santo domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt and it was there that the movement for independence originated haitis constitution forbade white elites from owning land and dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties many emigrated to cuba puerto rico these two being spanish possessions at the time or gran colombia usually with the encouragement of haitian officials who acquired their lands the haitians associated the roman catholic church with the french slavemasters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property deported all foreign clergy and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the vatican all levels of education collapsed the university was shut down as it was starved both of resources and students with young dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the haitian army boyers occupation troops who were largely dominicans were unpaid and had to forage and sack from dominican civilians haiti imposed a heavy tribute on the dominican people56page number needed many whites fled santo domingo for puerto rico and cuba both still under spanish rule venezuela and elsewhere in the end the economy faltered and taxation became more onerous rebellions occurred even by dominican freedmen

three founding fathers of the dominican republic58 on february 27 1844 the trinitarios the members of la trinitaria declared the independence from haiti they were backed by pedro santana a wealthy cattle rancher from el seibo who became general of the army of the nascent republic the dominican republics first constitution was adopted on november 6 1844 and was modeled after the united states

ostensible aim was to protect the nation from another haitian annexation60 opponents launched the war of restoration in 1863 led by santiago rodríguez benito monción and gregorio luperón among others haiti fearful of the reestablishment of spain as colonial power on its border gave refuge and supplies to the revolutionaries60 the united states then fighting its own civil war vigorously protested the spanish action after two years of fighting spain abandoned the island in 186560 political strife again prevailed in the following years warlords ruled military revolts were extremely common and

base at samaná and also a place for resettling newly freed blacks62 the treaty which included us payment of 15 million for dominican debt repayment was defeated in the united states senate in 187054

threat of military intervention by france and other european creditor powers69 united states president theodore roosevelt sought to prevent european intervention largely to protect the routes to the future panama canal as the canal was already under construction he made a small military intervention to ward off european powers to proclaim his famous roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine and also to obtain his 1905 dominican agreement for us administration of dominican customs which was the chief source of income for the dominican government a 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years the united states agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the dominican republic and assumed responsibility for said debt3269 ramón cáceres after six years in power president ramón cáceres who had himself assassinated heureaux66 was assassinated in 1911 the result was several years of great political instability and civil war us mediation by the william howard taft and woodrow wilson administrations achieved only a short respite each time a political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by wilson telling the dominicans to choose a president or see the us impose one a provisional president was chosen and later the same year relatively free elections put former president 1899–1902 juan isidro jimenes pereyra back in

had control of the country two months later the military government established by the us led by vice admiral harry shepard knapp was widely repudiated by the dominicans with many factions within the country leading guerrilla campaigns against us forces70 the occupation regime kept most dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population the occupying government also revived the dominican economy reduced the nations debt built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country and created a professional national guard to replace the warring partisan units70 vigorous opposition to the occupation continued nevertheless and after world war i it increased in the us as well there president warren g harding 1921–23 wilsons successor worked to put an end to the occupation as he had promised to do during his campaign the us governments rule ended in october 1922 and elections were held in march 192470 horacio vásquez lajara the victor was

governance in which political and civil rights were respected and the economy grew strongly in a relatively peaceful atmosphere7071 during the government of horacio vásquez rafael trujillo held the rank of lieutenant colonel and was chief of police this position helped him launch his plans to overthrow the government of vásquez trujillo had the support of carlos rosario peña who formed the civic movement which had as its main objective to overthrow the government of vásquez in february 1930 when vásquez attempted to win another term his opponents rebelled in secret alliance with the commander of the national army the former national guard general rafael leonidas trujillo molina trujillo secretly cut a deal with rebel leader rafael estrella ureña in return for letting ureña take power trujillo would be allowed to run for president in new elections as the rebels marched toward santo domingo vásquez ordered trujillo to suppress them however feigning neutrality trujillo kept his men in barracks allowing ureñas rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested on march 3 ureña was proclaimed acting president with trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army as per their agreement trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed patriotic coalition of citizens spanish coalición patriotica de los ciudadanos with ureña as his running mate during the election

a violent campaign against his opponents ascending to power on august 16 1930 trujillo age 1930–61 there was considerable economic growth during rafael trujillos long and ironfisted regime although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements there was progress in healthcare education and transportation with the building of hospitals and clinics schools and roads and harbors trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan he finally negotiated an undisputed border with haiti in 1935 and achieved the end of the 50year customs agreement in 1941 instead of 1956 he made the country debtfree in 194732 this was accompanied by absolute repression and the copious use of murder torture and terrorist methods against the opposition trujillo renamed santo domingo to ciudad trujillo trujillo city32 the nations – and the caribbeans – highest mountain la pelona grande spanish for the great bald to pico trujillo spanish for trujillo peak and many towns and a province some other places he renamed after members of his family by the end of his first term in 1934 he was the countrys wealthiest person57p360 and

them73 in 1937 he ordered what became known as the parsley massacre or in the dominican republic as el corte the cutting74 directing the army to kill haitians living on the dominican side of the border the army killed an estimated 17000 to 35000 haitians over six days from the night of october 2 1937 through october 8 1937 to avoid leaving evidence of the armys involvement the soldiers used machetes rather than bullets547375 the soldiers were said to have interrogated anyone with dark skin using the shibboleth perejil parsley to distinguish haitians from afrodominicans when necessary the r of perejil was of difficult pronunciation for haitians74 as a result of the massacre the dominican republic agreed to pay haiti us750000 later reduced to us5250006071 on november 25 1960 trujillo killed three of the four mirabal sisters nicknamed las mariposas the butterflies the victims were patria mercedes mirabal born on february 27 1924 argentina minerva mirabal born on march 12 1926 and antonia maría teresa mirabal born on october 15 1935 along with their husbands the sisters were conspiring to overthrow trujillo in a violent revolt the mirabals had communist ideological leanings as did their husbands the sisters have received many honors posthumously and have many memorials in various cities in the dominican republic salcedo their home province changed its name to provincia hermanas mirabal mirabal sisters province the international day for the elimination of violence against women is observed on the anniversary of their deaths for a long time the us and the dominican elite supported the trujillo government this support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition the massacre of haitians and trujillos plots against other countries the us believed trujillo was the lesser of two or more evils74 the us finally broke with trujillo in 1960 after trujillos agents attempted to assassinate the venezuelan president rómulo betancourt a fierce critic of trujillo7176 posttrujillo 1961–2000 juan bosch the first democratically elected president after the regime of rafael trujillo trujillo was assassinated on may 30 196171 in february 1963 a

of the xviiith airborne corps in operation powerpack we dont propose to sit here in a rocking chair with our hands folded and let the communist set up any government in the western hemisphere johnson said78 the forces were soon joined by comparatively small contingents from the organization of american states79 all these remained in the country for over a year and left after supervising elections in 1966 won by joaquín balaguer he had been trujillo’s last puppetpresident3279 balaguer remained in power as president for 12 years his tenure was a period of repression of human rights and civil liberties ostensibly to keep procastro or procommunist parties out of power 11000 persons were killed8081 his rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor it was however praised for an ambitious infrastructure program which included construction of large housing projects sports complexes theaters museums aqueducts roads highways and the massive columbus lighthouse completed
