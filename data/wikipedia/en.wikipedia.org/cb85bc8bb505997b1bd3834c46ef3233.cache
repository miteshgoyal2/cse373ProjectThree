said that he would finance the group if kirkpatrick would find other young male singers this prompted kirkpatrick to call joey fatone a friend he had met while working at universal studios then fatone and kirkpatrick approached lou pearlman for more suggestions pearlman looked through some tapes they had and one of justin timberlake from the mickey mouse club caught his eye timberlake soon joined the group and recommended his friend jc chasez who also was a cast member on walt disney channels mickey mouse club10 soon they decided to even out their sound by recruiting jason galasso as their bass singer nsync received its name after justin timberlakes mother commented on how in sync the groups singing voices were11 the groups name is also a play on the last letter of each of the initial members names justin chris joey jason and jc12 after several weeks of rehearsals the group set up a showcase and began planning to officially sign with pearlmans trans continental label however at the last minute galasso dropped out he was not fond of the groups musical direction claiming that being a teen idol was never a goal of his13 in need of a bass the group auditioned several people without success timberlake soon called his vocal coach who suggested a 16yearold from mississippi named lance bass bass flew to orlando to audition and was immediately accepted into the group he was nicknamed lansten so they could keep the name nsync14 from there pearlman set the five boys up in a house in orlando florida where they rehearsed constantly learning dance routines and vocal parts and working on promotion for their first public performance at pleasure island on october 22 1995 pearlman hired johnny wright manager of the backstreet boys to manage the group nsync sent him a twosong demotape
