legislative district to the north 35th legislative district in the center and 26th legislative district to the south before redistricting in 2012 the line separating the first and sixth congressional

in as soon as the election was certified to fill the rest of the term left by previous mayor cary bozeman who left to become executive director of the economic development agency port of bremerton lent had been a kitsap county commissioner and ran as a republican incorporated as a firstclass city bremerton has been governed by a nonpartisan strong mayor and ninemember city council since 1985 each member is elected from one of nine wards who in turn elect one member the current form of government was established by a 1983 charter that eliminated a decadesold city commission composed of a mayor public works commissioner and finance commissioner each member of the kitsap county board of commissioners represents a portion of the city of bremerton this arrangement was an attempt to balance bremertons commercial influence with the remainder of the county though most of its sales tax base has since relocated to unincorporated areascitation needed the revenue shortfall has been compensated by increased revenues collected from traffic infractions making bremerton a notorious speed trapcitation needed bremerton politics can vary in intensity with some city council positions regularly unopposed and others having as many as four candidates in the 2005 primary election redevelopment projects have been a major source of debate including the 2007 construction of a federally funded tunnel that would route ferry traffic under the downtown core as well as a planned waterfront boardwalk extension as with most cities in the region bremerton precincts have historically been more favorable for democratic candidates in state and federal elections contrasting with more conservativeleaning voters in rural areas of the county historyedit in the navy yard of puget sound in seattle and the orient 1900 two ships are shown in drydock the two circular insets are titled iowa coming up the sound upper and torpedoboat rowan lower 1890sedit bremerton is within the historical territory of the suquamish tribe the land was made available for nonnative settlement by the treaty of point elliott of 1855 bremerton was planned by german immigrant and seattle entrepreneur william bremer in 1891 in the year 1891 navy lt ab wyckoff purchased approximately 190 acres of waterfront land located on sinclair inlet this land was owned by the bremer family three years earlier a us navy commission determined that point turner between the protected waters of the sinclair and dyes inlets would be the best site in the pacific northwest on which to establish a shipyard recognizing the large number of workers such a facility would employ bremer and his business partner and brotherinlaw henry hensel purchased the undeveloped land near point turner at the inflated price of 200 per acre in april 1891 bremer arranged for the sale of 190 acres 077 km2 to the navy at 50 per acre this land became part of the initial footprint of the puget sound navy yard 1900–1930edit bremerton was incorporated on october 15 1901 with alvyn croxton serving as the citys first mayor progress in the new city soon faced a major crisis as navy secretary charles darling moved all repair work to the mare island navy yard in california in november 1902 darling cited reports from commanders that the bremerton waterfront was rife with prostitution opium houses and frequent strongarmed robberies of sailors politics were probably also at play as local newspapers reported that the citys incorporation left the shipyard essentially landlocked without room to expand a dispute ensued between mayor croxton who wanted to shutter all saloons in bremerton and three members of the city council who attempted to block his efforts croxton eventually won out and the council voted to revoke all liquor licenses in june 1904 with the ban darling reestablished the navy yard as a port of call saloons had begun to return to business within two years however in 1908 the city library and union high school were established to serve the educational needs of the 2993 residents recorded in the 1910 us census during world war i submarine construction and the addition of a third drydock caused the shipyards workforce to balloon to over 4000 employees growth due to the war effort and the 1918 annexation of the city of manette east of bremerton on the port washington narrows can be seen in the 1920 census which reported a population of 8918 bremerton absorbed charleston its neighboring city to the south in 1927 population reached 10170 in 1930 1930sedit manette now also known as part of east bremerton was linked to bremerton by the manette bridge a 1573foot 479 m bridge constructed in june 1930 prior to this time the trip could only be made by ferry or a long trip around dyes inlet through chico silverdale and tracyton on mostly unimproved roads this wooden bridge was replaced with a concrete and steel structure in october 1949 it was replaced by the new manette bridge in 2011 at the shipyard the 250foot 76 m tall hammerhead crane no 28 was completed in april 1933 one of the nations largest it is capable of lifting 250 tons and continues to dominate the bremerton skyline 1940sedit bremertons admiral theater opened in 1942 as a cinema in the 1990s it was remodeled for performances and banquets at the peak of world war ii the bremerton area was home to an estimated 80000 residents due to the heavy workload of shipbuilding repair and maintenance required for the pacific war effort most of the relocation was temporary though and only 27678 citizens were left in the city by 1950 during the 1940s presidents franklin d roosevelt and harry s truman both visited bremerton roosevelt made a campaign stop at the puget sound naval shipyard on august 12 1944 giving a national radio address in front of a backdrop of civilian workers during the course of his 35minute speech it is believed the president suffered an angina attack experiencing severe chest and shoulder pain an electrocardiogram was immediately administered once he left the podium but it showed nothing abnormal president truman took a twoday tour of washington state in 1948 speaking from the balcony of the elks club on the morning of june 10 local legend has it that a man in the large pacific avenue crowd yelled the infamous give em hell harry line for the first time this is a matter of dispute however as local newspapers quoted the man as having shouted lay it on harry despite this there is a bronze plaque attached to the corner of the building declaring that exact spot to be the place where the phrase give em hell harry was first uttered with the return of world war ii gis to the homefront the need for postsecondary education became evident to officials of the bremerton school district

operations to world war ii–surplus quonset buildings at its current 16th chester site about 100 students received associate degrees at the first commencement exercises held june 10 1948 president truman was in attendance and received the colleges first honorary degree operation of the college transferred from the school district to the state of washington in 1967 1950–1970edit the 1950s and 1960s were a period of stability for the city a second high school opened in 19566 and two comprehensive high schools operated in the city until 1978 growth in east bremerton necessitated the construction of another span across the port washington narrows in 1958 the 53 million fourlane warren avenue bridge allowed for increased traffic on state highway 21b now state route 303 the battleship uss missouri site of the japanese surrender treaty signing that ended world war ii was assigned to the pacific reserve fleet at psns in 1955 for 30 years she served as the citys primary

1960 census leading bremerton leaders to annex the shipyard the following year in an effort to include stationed sailors in those figures while the vietnam war spawned protests and sitins on the olympic college campus the city was relatively free of civil disorder during the 1960s 1970sedit with the 1973 selection of the bangor ammunition depot 12 miles 19 km northwest of bremerton as the pacific home of the new trident submarine fleet residential and commercial development began to move closer to silverdale and farther from the bremerton downtown core numerous failed proposals were made at redevelopment beginning in the early 1970s including discussions of a waterfront hotel and the erection of a large canopy over the central business district meanwhile most of the citys office and retail space remained in the hands of edward bremer son of william bremer and the sole remaining heir to his wealth in order to receive their inheritance william bremers three children were honorbound to never marry bremer began to neglect his properties never increasing decadesold lease rates and failing to make necessary maintenance upgrades in 1978 the bremerton city council passed an ordinance declaring the entire downtown a blighted area 1980sedit in 1985 safecosubsidiary winmar corporation developed the kitsap mall in silverdale with lower taxes and minimal planning regulations
