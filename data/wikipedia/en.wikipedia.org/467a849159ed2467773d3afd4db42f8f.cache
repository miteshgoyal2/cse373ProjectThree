notation scientific notation also referred to as scientific form or standard index form or standard form in the uk is a way of expressing numbers that are too big or too small to be conveniently written in decimal form it is commonly used by scientists mathematicians and engineers in part because it can simplify certain arithmetic operations on scientific calculators it is usually known as sci display mode decimal notation scientific notation 2 7000200000000000000♠2×100 300 7002300000000000000♠3×102 4321768 7003432176800000000♠4321768×103 −53000 2995470000000000000♠−53×104 6720000000

power of n where the exponent n is an integer and the coefficient m is any real number called the significand or mantissa1 however the term mantissa may cause confusion because it is the name of the fractional part of the common logarithm if the number is negative then a minus sign precedes m as in ordinary decimal notation in normalized notation the exponent is chosen so that the absolute value of the coefficient is at least one but less than ten decimal floating point is a computer arithmetic system closely related to scientific notation contents 1 normalized notation 2 engineering notation

given integer can be written in the form m×10n in many ways for example 350 can be written as 7002350000000000000♠35×102 or 7002350000000000000♠35×101 or 7002350000000000000♠350×100 in normalized scientific notation called standard form in the uk the exponent n is chosen so that the absolute value of m remains at least one but less than ten 1 ≤ m  10 thus 350 is written as 7002350000000000000♠35×102 this form allows easy comparison of numbers as the exponent n gives the numbers order of magnitude in normalized notation the exponent n is negative for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1 eg 05 is written as 6999500000000000000♠5×10−1 the 10 and exponent are often omitted when the exponent is 0 normalized scientific form is the typical form of expression of large numbers in many fields unless an unnormalized form such as engineering notation is desired normalized scientific notation is often called exponential notation—although the latter term is more general and also applies when m is not restricted to the range 1 to 10 as in engineering notation for instance and to bases other than 10 as in 315×220 engineering notationedit main article engineering notation engineering notation often named eng display mode on scientific calculators differs from normalized scientific notation in that the exponent n is restricted to multiples of 3 consequently the absolute value of m is in the range 1 ≤ m 1000 rather than 1 ≤ m 10 though similar in concept engineering notation is rarely called scientific notation engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding si prefixes which facilitates reading and oral communication for example 6992125000000000000♠125×10−9 m can be read as twelvepointfive nanometers and written as 6992125000000000000♠125 nm while its scientific notation equivalent 6992125000000000000♠125×10−8 m would likely be read out as onepointtwofive times tentothenegativeeight meters significant figuresedit main article significant figures a significant figure is a digit in a number that adds to its precision this includes all nonzero numbers zeroes between significant digits and zeroes indicated to be significant leading and trailing zeroes are not significant because they exist only to show the scale of the number therefore 1230400 usually has five significant figures 1 2 3 0 and 4 the final two zeroes serve only as placeholders and add no precision to the original number when a number is converted into normalized scientific notation it is scaled down to a number between 1 and 10 all of the significant digits remain but the place holding zeroes are no longer required thus 1230400 would become 12304 × 106 however there is also the possibility that the number may be known to six or more significant figures in which case the number would be shown as for instance 123040 × 106 thus an additional advantage of scientific notation is that the number of significant figures is clearer estimated final digitsedit it is customary in scientific measurements to record all the definitely known digits from the measurements and to estimate at least one additional digit if there is any information at all available to enable the observer to make an estimate the resulting number contains more information than it would without that extra digits and it or they may be considered a significant digit because it conveys some information leading to greater precision in measurements and in aggregations of measurements adding them or multiplying them together additional information about precision can be conveyed through additional notations it is often useful to know how exact the final digits are for instance the accepted value of the unit of elementary charge can properly be expressed as 6981160217662079999♠1602176620898×10−19 c2 which is shorthand for 6981160217662079999♠16021766208±00000000098×10−19 c enotationedit a calculator display showing the avogadro constant in enotation most calculators and many computer programs present very large and very small results in scientific notation typically invoked by a key labelled exp for exponent eex for enter exponent ee ex e or ×10x depending on vendor and model because superscripted exponents like 107 cannot always be conveniently displayed the letter e or e is often used to represent times ten raised to the power of which would be written as × 10n and is followed by the value of the exponent in other words for any two real numbers m and n the usage of men would indicate a value of m × 10n in this usage the character e is not related to the mathematical constant e or the exponential function ex a confusion that is unlikely if scientific notation is represented by a capital e although the e stands for exponent the notation is usually referred to as scientific enotation rather than scientific exponential notation the use of enotation facilitates data entry and readability in textual communication since it minimizes keystrokes avoids reduced font sizes and provides a simpler and more concise display but it is not encouraged in publications3 examples and other notationsedit in most popular programming languages 6022e23 or 6022e23 is equivalent to 7023602200000000000♠6022×1023 and 6965160000000000000♠16×10−35 would be written 16e35 eg ada analytica cc fortran since fortran ii as of 1958 matlab scilab perl java4 python lua javascript and others after the introduction of the first pocket calculators supporting scientific notation in 1972 hp35 sr10 the term decapower was sometimes used in the emerging user communities for the poweroften multiplier in order to better distinguish it from normal exponents likewise the letter d was used in typewritten numbers this notation was proposed by jim davidson and published in the january 1976 issue of richard j nelsons hewlettpackard newsletter 65 notes5 for hp65 users and it was adopted and carried over into the texas instruments community by richard c vanderburgh the editor of the 52notes newsletter for sr52 users in november 19766 fortran at least since fortran iv as of 1961 also uses d to signify double precision numbers7 similar a d

19958910111213 the algol 60 1960 programming language uses a subscript ten 10 character instead of the letter e for example 6022102314 the use of the 10 in the various algol standards provided a challenge on some computer systems that did not provide such a 10 character as a consequence stanford university algolw required the use of a single quote eg 6024862315 and some soviet algol variants allowed the use of the cyrillic character ю character eg 6022ю23 subsequently the algol 68 programming language provided the choice of 4 characters e e or 10 by examples 6022e23 6022e23 602223 or 6022102316 this article contains unicode miscellaneous technical characters without proper rendering support you may see question marks boxes or other symbols instead of ₁₀ decimal exponent symbol u23e8 ttf decimal exponent symbol is part of the unicode standard17 eg 6022⏨23 it is included as u23e8 ⏨ decimal exponent symbol to accommodate usage in the programming languages algol 60 and algol 68 the ti83 series and ti84 plus series of calculators use a stylized e character to display decimal exponent and the 10 character to denote an equivalent ×10 operator18 the simula programming language requires the use of or for long for example 602223 or 60222319 the wolfram language utilized in mathematica allows a shorthand notation of 602223 order of magnitudeedit main article order of magnitude scientific notation also enables simpler orderofmagnitude comparisons a protons mass is 6973167260000000000♠00000000000000000000000000016726 kg if written as 6973167260000000000♠16726×10−27 kg it is easier to compare this mass with that of an electron given below the order of magnitude of the ratio of the masses can be obtained by comparing the exponents instead of the more errorprone task of counting the leading zeros in this case −27 is larger than −31 and therefore the proton is roughly four orders of magnitude 7004100000000000000♠10000 times more massive than the electron scientific notation also avoids misunderstandings due to regional differences in certain quantifiers such as billion which might indicate either 109 or 1012 in physics and astrophysics the number of orders of magnitude between two numbers is sometimes referred to as dex a contraction of decimal exponent for instance if two numbers are within 1 dex of each other then the ratio of the larger to the smaller number is less than 10 fractional values can be used so if within 05 dex the ratio is less than 1005 and so on use of spacesedit in normalized scientific notation in enotation and in engineering notation the space which in typesetting may be represented by a normal width space or a thin space that is allowed only before and after × or in front of e is sometimes omitted though it is less common to do so before the alphabetical character20 further examples of scientific notationedit an electrons mass is about 0000000000000000000000000000000910938356 kg21 in scientific notation this is written 6969910938355999999♠910938356×10−31 kg in si units the earths mass is about 5972400000000000000000000 kg22 in scientific notation this is written 7024597240000000000♠59724×1024 kg the earths circumference is approximately 40000000 m23 in scientific notation this is 7007400000000000000♠4×107 m in engineering notation this is written 7007400000000000000♠40×106 m in si writing style this may be written 7007400000000000000♠40 mm 40 megameters an inch is defined as exactly 254 mm quoting a value of 25400 mm shows that the value is correct to the nearest micrometer an approximated value with only two significant digits would be 6998250000000000000♠25×101 mm instead as there is no limit to the number of significant digits the length of an inch could if required be written as say 6998254000000000000♠254000000000×101 mm instead converting numbersedit converting a number in these cases means to either convert the number into scientific notation form convert it back into decimal form or to change the exponent part of the equation none of these alter the actual number only how its expressed decimal to scientificedit first move the decimal separator point sufficient places n to put the numbers value within a desired range between 1 and 10 for normalized notation if the decimal was moved to the left append × 10n to the right × 10−n to represent the number 7006123040000000000♠1230400 in normalized scientific notation the decimal separator would be moved 6 digits to the left and × 106 appended resulting in 7006123040000000000♠12304×106 the number 3002596790000000000♠−00040321 would have its decimal separator shifted 3 digits to the right instead of the left and yield 3002596790000000000♠−40321×10−3 as a result scientific to decimaledit converting a number from scientific notation to decimal notation first remove the × 10n on the end then shift the decimal separator n digits to the right positive n or left negative n the number 7006123040000000000♠12304×106 would have its decimal separator shifted 6 digits to the right and become 7006123040000000000♠1230400 while 3002596790000000000♠−40321×10−3 would have its decimal separator moved 3 digits to the left and be 3002596790000000000♠−00040321 exponentialedit conversion between different scientific notation representations of the same number with different exponential values is achieved by performing opposite operations of multiplication or division by a power of ten on the significand and an subtraction or addition of one on the exponent part the decimal separator in the significand is shifted x places to the left or right and x is added to or subtracted from the exponent as shown below 7003123400000000000♠1234×103 7003123400000000000♠1234×102

powers of other bases can be used too24 base 2 being the next most commonly used one for example in base2 scientific notation the number 1001b in binary 9d is written as 1001b × 2d11b or 1001b × 10b11b using binary numbers or shorter 1001 × 1011 if binary context is obvious in enotation this is written as 1001be11b or shorter 1001e11 with the letter e now standing for times two 10b to the power here in order to better distinguish this base2 exponent from a base10 exponent a base2 exponent is sometimes also indicated by using the letter b instead of e25 a shorthand notation originally proposed by bruce alan martin of brookhaven national laboratory in 196826 as in 1001bb11b or shorter 1001b11 for comparison the same number in decimal representation 1125 × 23 using decimal representation or 1125b3 still using decimal representation some calculators use a mixed representation for binary floating point numbers where the exponent is displayed as decimal number even in binary mode so the above becomes 1001b × 10b3d or shorter 1001b325 this is closely related to the base2 floatingpoint representation commonly used in computer arithmetic and the usage of iec binary prefixes eg 1b10 for 1×210 kibi 1b20 for 1×220 mebi 1b30 for 1×230 gibi 1b40 for 1×240 tebi similar to b or b27 the letters h25 or h27 and o25 or o27 or c25 are sometimes also used to indicate times 16 or 8 to the power as in 125 140h × 10h0h 140h0 140h0 or 98000 27732o × 10o5o 27732o5 27732c525 another similar convention to denote base2 exponents is using a letter p or p for power in this notation the significand is always meant to be hexadecimal whereas the exponent is always meant to be decimal28 this notation can be produced by implementations of the printf family of functions following the c99 specification and single unix specification ieee std 10031 posix standard when using the a or a conversion specifiers282930 starting with c11 c io functions could parse and print the pnotation as well meanwhile the notation has been fully adopted by the language standard since c1731 apples swift supports it as well32 it is also required by the ieee 7542008 binary floatingpoint
