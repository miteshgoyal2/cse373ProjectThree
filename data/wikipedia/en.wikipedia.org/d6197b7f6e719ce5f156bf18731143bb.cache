university college of information sciences and technology website citeseerxistpsuedu registration optional launched 2007 10 years ago 2007 current status active citeseerx originally called citeseer is a public search engine and digital library for scientific and academic papers primarily in the fields of computer and information science manywho consider it to be the first academic paper search engine and the first automated citation indexing system citeseer holds a patentwhich on this topic and is considered a predecessor of academic search tools such as google scholar and microsoft academic searchcitation needed citeseerlike engines and archives usually only harvest documents from publicly available websites and do not crawl publisher websites for this reason authors whose documents are freely available are more likely to be represented in the index citeseers goal is to improve the dissemination and access of academic and scientific literature as a nonprofit service that can be freely used by anyone it has been considered as part of the open access movement that is attempting to change academic and scientific publishing to allow greater access to scientific literature citeseer freely provided open archives initiative metadata of all indexed documents and links indexed documents when possible to other sources of metadata such as dblp and the acm portal to promote open data citeseerx shares its data for noncommercial purposes under a creative commons license1 the name can be construed to have at least two explanations as a pun a sightseer is a tourist who looks at the sights so a cite seer would be a researcher who looks at cited papers another is a seer is a prophet and a cite seer is a prophet of citations citeseer changed its name to researchindex at one point and then changed it back contents 1 history 11 citeseer and citeseerist 12 citeseerx 2 current features 21 automated information extraction 22 focused crawling 23 usage 24

bollacker and steve lawrence in 1997 while they were at the nec research institute now nec labs princeton new jersey usa citeseers goal was to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the web and use autonomous citation indexing to permit querying by citation or by document ranking them by citation impact at one point it was called researchindex citeseer became public in 1998 and had many new features unavailable in academic search engines at that time these included autonomous citation indexing automatically created a citation index that can be used for literature search and evaluation citation statistics and related documents were computed for all articles cited in the database not just the indexed articles reference linking allowing browsing of the database using citation links citation context showed the context of citations to a given paper allowing a researcher to quickly and easily see what other researchers have to say about an article of interest related documents were shown using citation and word based measures and an active and continuously updated bibliography is shown for each document after nec in 2004 it was hosted as citeseerist on the world wide web at the college of information sciences and technology the pennsylvania state university and had over 700000 documents for enhanced access performance and research similar versions of citeseer were supported at universities such as the massachusetts institute of technology university of zürich and the national university of singapore however these versions of citeseer proved difficult to maintain and are no longer available because citeseer only indexes freely available papers on the web and does not have access to publisher metadata it returns fewer citation counts than sites such as google scholar that have publisher metadata citeseer had not been comprehensively updated since 2005 due to limitations in its architecture design it had a representative sampling of research documents in computer and information science but was limited in coverage because it was limited to papers that are publicly available usually at an authors homepage or those submitted by an author to overcome some of these limitations a modular and open source architecture for citeseer was designed citeseerx citeseerxedit citeseerx replaced citeseer and all queries to citeseer were redirected citeseerx2 is a public search engine and digital library and repository for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on computer and information science2 however recently citeseerx has been expanding into other scholarly domains such as economics physics and others released in 2008 it was loosely based on the previous citeseer search engine and digital library and is built with a new open source infrastructure seersuite and new algorithms and their implementations it was developed by researchers dr isaac councill and dr c lee giles at the college of information sciences and technology pennsylvania state university it continues to support the goals outlined by citeseer to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the public web and to use a citation inquery by citations and ranking of documents by the impact of citations currently lee giles prasenjit mitra susan gauch minyen kan pradeep teregowda juan pablo fernández ramírez pucktada treeratpituk jian wu douglas jordan steve carman jack carroll jim jansen and shuyi zheng are or have been actively involved in its development recently a table search feature was introduced3 it has been funded by the national science foundation nasa and microsoft research citeseerx continues to be rated as one of the worlds top repositories and was rated number 1 in july 20104 it currently has over 6 million documents with nearly 6 million unique authors and 120 million citations citeseerx also shares its software data databases and metadata with other researchers currently by amazon s3 and by rsync5 its new modular open source architecture and software available previously on sourceforge but now on github is built on apache solr and other apache and open source tools which allows it to be a testbed for new algorithms in document harvesting ranking indexing and information extraction current featuresedit automated information extractionedit citeseerx uses automated information extraction tools usually built on machine learning methods such parscit to extract scholarly document metadata such as title authors abstract citations etc as such there are sometime errors in authors and titles other academic search engines have similar errors focused crawlingedit citeseerx crawls publicly available scholarly documents primarily from author webpages and other open resources and does not have access to publisher metadata as such citation counts in citeseerx are usually less than those in google scholar and microsoft academic search who have access to publisher metadata usageedit citeseerx has nearly 1 million users worldwide based on unique ip addresses and has millions of hits daily annual downloads of document pdfs was nearly 200 million for 2015 dataedit citeseerx data is regularly shared under a creative commons byncsa license with researchers worldwide and has been and is used in many experiments and competitions other seersuitebased search enginesedit the citeseer model had been extended to cover academic documents in business with smealsearch and in ebusiness with ebizsearch however these were not maintained by their sponsors an older version of both of these could be once found at bizseerist but is no longer in service other seerlike search and repository systems have been built for chemistry chemxseer and for archaeology
