child sexual abuse from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search child sex offender redirects here for sex crimes committed by minors see juvenile sex crimes child sexual abuse or child molestation is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation12 forms of child sexual abuse include engaging in sexual activities with a child whether by asking or pressuring or by other means indecent exposure of the genitals female nipples etc child grooming or using a child to produce child pornography134 child sexual abuse can occur in a variety of settings including home school or work in places where child labor is common child marriage is one of the main forms of child sexual abuse unicef has stated that child marriage represents perhaps the most prevalent form of sexual abuse and exploitation of girls5 the effects of child sexual abuse can include depression6 posttraumatic stress disorder7 anxiety8 complex posttraumatic stress disorder9 propensity to further victimization in adulthood10 and physical injury to the child among other problems11 sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest and can result in more serious and longterm psychological trauma especially in the case of parental incest12 the global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 197 for females and 79 for males13 most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims approximately 30 are relatives of the child most often brothers fathers uncles or cousins14 around 60 are other acquaintances such as friends of the family babysitters or neighbors strangers are the offenders in approximately 10 of child sexual abuse cases15 most child sexual abuse is committed by men studies on female child molesters show that women commit 14 to 40 of offenses reported against boys and 6 of offenses reported against girls151617 the word pedophile is commonly applied indiscriminately to anyone who sexually abuses a child18 but child sexual offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children1920 under the law child sexual abuse is often used as an umbrella term describing criminal and civil offenses in which an adult engages in sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification421 the american psychological association states that children cannot consent to sexual activity with adults and condemns any such action by an adult an adult who engages in sexual activity with a child is performing a criminal and immoral act which never can be considered normal or socially acceptable behavior22 contents 1 effects 11 psychological effects 111 posttraumatic stress disorder 112 research factors 12 physical effects 121 injury 122

shortterm and longterm harm including psychopathology in later life1123 indicators and effects include depression62425 anxiety8 eating disorders26 poor selfesteem26 somatization25 sleep disturbances2728 and dissociative and anxiety disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder729 while children may exhibit regressive behaviours such as thumb sucking or bedwetting the strongest indicator of sexual abuse is sexual acting out and inappropriate sexual knowledge and interest3031 victims may withdraw from school and social activities30 and exhibit various learning and behavioural problems including cruelty to animals32333435 attention deficithyperactivity disorder adhd conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder odd26 teenage pregnancy and risky sexual behaviors may appear in adolescence36 child sexual abuse victims report almost four times as many incidences of selfinflicted harm37 a study funded by the usa national institute of drug abuse found that among more than 1400 adult females childhood sexual abuse was associated with increased likelihood of drug dependence alcohol dependence and psychiatric disorders the associations are expressed as odds ratios for example women who experienced nongenital sexual abuse in childhood were 283 times more likely to suffer drug dependence as adults than were women who were not abused38 a welldocumented longterm negative effect is repeated or additional victimization in adolescence and adulthood1039 a causal relationship has been found between childhood sexual abuse and various adult psychopathologies including crime and suicide154041424344 in addition to alcoholism and drug abuse383945 males who were sexually abused as children more frequently appear in the criminal justice system than in a clinical mental health setting30 a study comparing middleaged women who were abused as children with nonabused counterparts found significantly higher health care costs for the former2546 intergenerational effects have been noted with the children of victims of child sexual abuse exhibiting more conduct problems peer problems and emotional problems than their peers47 a specific characteristic pattern of symptoms has not been identified48 and there are several hypotheses about the causality of these associations64950 studies have found that 51 to 79 of sexually abused children exhibit psychological symptoms4251525354 the risk of harm is greater if the abuser is a relative if the abuse involves intercourse or attempted intercourse or if threats or force are used55 the level of harm may also be affected by various factors such as penetration duration and frequency of abuse and use of force11235657 the social stigma of child sexual abuse may compound the psychological harm to children5758 and adverse outcomes are less likely for abused children who have supportive family environments5960 posttraumatic stress disorder main articles dissociation psychology and posttraumatic stress disorder child abuse including sexual abuse especially chronic abuse starting at early ages has been found to be related to the development of high levels of dissociative symptoms which includes amnesia for abuse memories61 when severe sexual abuse penetration several perpetrators lasting more than one year had occurred dissociative symptoms were even more prominent62 besides dissociative identity disorder did and posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd child sexual abuse survivors may present borderline personality disorder bpd and eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa63 research factors because child sexual abuse often occurs alongside other possibly confounding variables such as poor family environment and physical abuse64 some scholars argue it is important to control for those variables in studies which measure the effects of sexual abuse23496566 in a 1998 review of related literature martin and fleming state the hypothesis advanced in this paper is that in most cases the fundamental damage inflicted by child sexual abuse is due to the childs developing capacities for trust intimacy agency and sexuality and that many of the mental health problems of adult life associated with histories of child sexual abuse are secondorder effects67 other studies have found an independent association of child sexual abuse with adverse psychological outcomes82349 kendler et al 2000 found that most of the relationship between severe forms of child sexual abuse and adult psychopathology in their sample could not be explained by family discord because the effect size of this association decreased only slightly after they controlled for possible confounding variables their examination of a small sample of csadiscordant twins also supported a causal link between child sexual abuse and adult psychopathology the csaexposed subjects had a consistently higher risk for psychopathologic disorders than their csa nonexposed twins49 a 1998 metaanalysis by bruce rind et al generated controversy by suggesting that child sexual abuse does not always cause pervasive harm that some college students reported such encounters as positive experiences and that the extent of psychological damage depends on whether or not the child described the encounter as consensual68 the study was criticized for flawed methodology and conclusions6970 the us congress condemned the study for its conclusions and for providing material used by pedophile organizations to justify their activities71 physical effects injury depending on the age and size of the child and the degree of force used child sexual abuse may cause internal lacerations and bleeding in severe cases damage to internal organs may occur which in some cases may cause death72 infections child sexual abuse may cause infections and sexually transmitted diseases73 due to a lack of sufficient vaginal fluid chances of infections can heighten depending on the age and size of the child vaginitis has also been reported73 neurological damage research has shown that traumatic stress including stress caused by sexual abuse causes notable changes in brain functioning and development7475 various studies have suggested that severe child sexual abuse may have a deleterious effect on brain development ito et al 1998 found reversed hemispheric asymmetry and greater left hemisphere coherence in abused subjects76 teicher et al 1993 found that an increased likelihood of ictal temporal lobe epilepsylike symptoms in abused subjects77 anderson et al 2002 recorded abnormal transverse relaxation time in the cerebellar vermis of adults sexually abused in childhood78 teicher et al 1993 found that child sexual abuse was associated with a reduced corpus callosum area various studies have found an association of reduced volume of the left hippocampus with child sexual abuse79 and ito et al 1993 found increased electrophysiological abnormalities in sexually abused children80 some studies indicate that sexual or physical abuse in children can lead to the overexcitation of an undeveloped limbic system79 teicher et al 199377 used the limbic system checklist33 to measure ictal temporal lobe epilepsylike symptoms in 253 adults reports of child sexual abuse were associated with a 49 increase to lscl33 scores 11 higher than the associated increase of selfreported physical abuse reports of both physical and sexual abuse were associated with a 113 increase male and female victims were similarly affected7781 navalta et al 2006 found that the selfreported math scholastic aptitude test scores of their sample of women with a history of repeated child sexual abuse were significantly lower than the selfreported math sat scores of their nonabused sample because the abused subjects verbal sat scores were high they hypothesized that the low math sat scores could stem from a defect in hemispheric integration they also found a strong association between shortterm memory impairments for all categories tested verbal visual and global and the duration of the abuse82 incest main article incest incest between a child or adolescent and a related adult is known as child incestuous abuse83 and has been identified as the most widespread form of child sexual abuse with a huge capacity to damage the young person12 one researcher stated that more than 70 of abusers are immediate family members or someone very close to the family84 another researcher stated that about 30 of all perpetrators of sexual abuse are related to their victim 60 of the perpetrators are family acquaintances like a neighbor babysitter or friend and 10 of the perpetrators in child sexual abuse cases are strangers15 a child sexual abuse offense where the perpetrator is related to the child either by blood or marriage is a form of incest described as intrafamilial child sexual abuse85 the mostoften reported form of incest is father–daughter and stepfather–daughter incest with most of the remaining reports consisting of motherstepmother–daughterson incest86 father–son incest is reported less often however it is not known if the actual prevalence is less or it is underreported by a greater margin87888990 similarly some argue that sibling incest may be as common or more common than other types of incest goldman and goldman91 reported that 57 of incest involved siblings finkelhor reported that over 90 of nuclear family incest involved siblings92 while cawson et al show that sibling incest was reported twice as often as incest perpetrated by fathersstepfathers93 prevalence of parental child sexual abuse is difficult to assess due to secrecy and privacy some estimates state that 20 million americans have been victimized by parental incest as children86 types child sexual abuse includes a variety of sexual offenses including sexual assault – a term defining offenses in which an adult uses a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification for example rape including sodomy and sexual penetration with an object94 most us states include in their definitions of sexual assault any penetrative contact of a minor’s body however slight if the contact is performed for the purpose of sexual gratification95 sexual exploitation – a term defining offenses in which an adult victimizes a minor for advancement sexual gratification or profit for example prostituting a child96 and creating or trafficking in child pornography97 sexual grooming – a term defining the social conduct of a potential child sex offender who seeks to make a minor more accepting of their advances for example in an online chat room98 commercial sexual exploitation main article commercial sexual exploitation of children commercial sexual exploitation of children csec is defined by the declaration of the first world congress against commercial sexual exploitation of children held in stockholm in 1996 as sexual abuse by an adult accompanied by remuneration in cash or in kind to the child or third persons99 csec usually takes the form of child prostitution or child pornography and is often facilitated by child sex tourism csec is particularly a problem in developing countries of asia100101 in recent years new innovations in technology have facilitated the trade of internet child pornography102 disclosure dolls are sometimes used to help disclose abusecitation needed children who received supportive responses following disclosure had less traumatic symptoms and were abused for a shorter period of time than children who did not receive support103104 in general studies have found that children need support and stressreducing resources after disclosure of sexual abuse105106 negative social reactions to disclosure have been found to be harmful to the survivor’s well being107 one study reported that children who received a bad reaction from the first person they told especially if the person was a close family member had worse scores as adults on general trauma symptoms post traumatic stress disorder symptoms and dissociation108 another study found that in most cases when children did disclose abuse the person they talked to did not respond effectively blamed or rejected the child and took little or no action to stop the abuse106 nonvalidating and otherwise nonsupportive responses to disclosure by the childs primary attachment figure may indicate a relational disturbance predating the sexual abuse that may have been a risk factor for the abuse and which can remain a risk factor for its psychological consequences109 the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry provides guidelines for what to say to the victim and what to do following the disclosure110 asa don brown has indicated a minimization of the trauma and its effects is commonly injected into the picture by parental caregivers to shelter and calm the child it has been commonly assumed that focusing on children’s issues too long will negatively impact their recovery therefore the parental caregiver teaches the child to mask his or her issues111 in many jurisdictions abuse that is suspected not necessarily proven requires reporting to child protection agencies such as the child protection services in the united states recommendations for healthcare workers such as primary care providers and nurses who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child’s immediate need for safety a private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining leading statements that can distort the story are avoided as disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful reassuring the child that he or she has done the right thing by telling and that they are not bad and that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information dolls are sometimes used to help explain what happened for the suspected abusers it is also recommended to use a nonjudgmental nonthreatening attitude towards them and to withhold expressing shock in order to help disclose information112 treatment the initial approach to treating a person who has been a victim of sexual abuse is dependent upon several important factors age at the time of presentation circumstances of presentation for treatment comorbid conditions the goal of treatment is not only to treat current mental health issues and trauma related symptoms but also to prevent future ones children and adolescents children often present for treatment in one of several circumstances including criminal investigations custody battles problematic behaviors and referrals from child welfare agencies113 the three major modalities for therapy with children and adolescents are family therapy group therapy and individual therapy which course is used depends on a variety of factors that must be assessed on a casebycase basis for instance treatment of young children generally requires strong parental involvement and can benefit from family therapy adolescents tend to be more independent they can benefit from individual or group therapy the modality also shifts during the course of treatment for example group therapy is rarely used in the initial stages as the subject matter is very personal andor embarrassing113 major factors that affect both the pathology and response to treatment include the type and severity of the sexual act its frequency the age at which it occurred and the child’s family of origin roland c summit a medical doctor defined the different stages the victims of child sexual abuse go through called child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome he suggested that children who are victims of sexual abuse display a range of symptoms that include secrecy helplessness entrapment accommodation delayed and conflicted disclosure and recantation114 adults adults who have been sexually abused as children often present for treatment with a secondary mental health issue which can include substance abuse eating disorders personality disorders depression and conflict in romantic or interpersonal relationships115 generally the approach is to focus on the present problem rather than the abuse itself treatment is highly varied and depends on the person’s specific issues for instance a person with a history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for depression however there is often an emphasis on cognitive restructuring due to the deepseated nature of the trauma some newer techniques such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing emdr have been shown to be effective116 sexual abuse is associated with many subclinical behavioral issues as well including revictimization in the teenage years a bipolarlike switching between sexual compulsion and shutdown and distorted thinking on the subject of sexual abuse for instance that it is common and happens to everyone when first presenting for treatment the patient can be fully aware of their abuse as an event but their appraisal of it is often distorted such as believing that the event was unremarkable a form of isolation frequently victims do not make the connection between their abuse and their present pathology offenders demographics offenders are more likely to be relatives or acquaintances of their victim than strangers117 a 2006–07 idaho study of 430 cases found that 82 of juvenile sex offenders were known to the victims acquaintances 46 or relatives 36118119 more offenders are male than female though the percentage varies between studies see female child molesters the percentage of incidents of sexual abuse by female perpetrators that come to the attention of the legal system is usually reported to be between 1 and 4120 studies of sexual misconduct in us schools with female offenders have shown mixed results with rates between 4 to 43 of female offenders121 maletzky 1993 found that of his sample of 4402 convicted pedophilic offenders 04 were female122 another study of a nonclinical population found that among those in their sample that had been molested as many as a third were molested by women123 in us schools educators who offend range in age from 21 to 75 years old with an average age of 28124 according to ce dettmeijervermeulen dutch national spokeswoman on human traffic and sexual violence against children in the netherlands 3 of the convicted perpetrators are women125 1458 of the victims are boys125 and most victims were abused by a family member friend or acquaintance125 one in six perpetrators is himself underage126 typology early research in the 1970s and 1980s began to classify offenders based on their motivations and traits groth and birnbaum 1978 categorized child sexual offenders into two groups fixated and regressed127 fixated were described as having a primary attraction to children whereas regressed had largely maintained relationships with other adults and were even married this study also showed that adult sexual orientation was not related to the sex of the victim targeted eg men who molested boys often had adult relationships with women127 later work holmes and holmes 2002 expanded on the types of offenders and their psychological profiles they are divided as follows128 situational – does not prefer children but offend under certain conditions regressed – typically has relationships with adults but a stressor causes them to seek children as a substitute morally indiscriminate – allaround sexual deviant who may commit other sexual offenses unrelated to children naiveinadequate – often mentally disabled in some way finds children less threatening preferential – has true sexual interest in children mysoped – sadistic and violent target strangers more often than acquaintances fixated – little or no activity with own age described as an overgrown child causal factors causal factors of child sex offenders are not known conclusively129 the experience of sexual abuse as a child was previously thought to be a strong risk factor but research does not show a causal relationship as the vast majority of sexually abused children do not grow up to be adult offenders nor do the majority of adult offenders report childhood sexual abuse the us government accountability office concluded the existence of a cycle of sexual abuse was not established before 1996 there was greater belief in the theory of a cycle of violence because most of the research done was retrospective—abusers were asked if they had experienced past abuse even the majority of studies found that most adult sex offenders said they had not been sexually abused during childhood but studies varied in terms of their estimates of the percentage of such offenders who had been abused from 0 to 79 percent more recent prospective longitudinal research—studying children with documented cases of sexual abuse over time to determine what percentage become adult offenders—has demonstrated that the cycle of violence theory is not an adequate explanation for why people molest children130 offenders may use cognitive distortions to facilitate their offenses such as minimization of the abuse victim blaming and excuses131 pedophilia main article pedophilia pedophilia is a condition in which an adult or older adolescent is primarily or exclusively attracted to prepubescent children whether the attraction is acted upon or not132133 a person with this attraction is called a pedophile in law enforcement the term pedophile is sometimes used to describe those accused or convicted of child sexual abuse under sociolegal definitions of child including both prepubescent children and adolescents younger than the local age of consent18 however not all child sexual offenders are pedophiles and not all pedophiles engage in sexual abuse of children19134135 for these reasons researchers recommend against imprecisely describing all child molesters as pedophiles136137 the term pedocriminality de pädokriminalität fr pédocriminalité is a controversial term which originated in the 1980s and has been used by organisations such as unicef unhrc the world health organization138 and the council of europe139 to refer to child sexual abuse and sexual violence used against children140141 child prostitution child trafficking and the use of child pornography142 the term cyberpedocriminality has been used to refer to the activities of viewers of child pornography online143 recidivism recidivism rates for sex offenders are lower than for the general criminal population144 estimated rates among child sex offenders vary one study found that 42 of offenders reoffended either a sex crime violent crime or both after they were released risk for reoffense was highest in the first 6 years after release but continued to be significant even 10–31 years later with 23 offending during this time145 a study done in california in 1965 found an 182 recidivism rate for offenders targeting the opposite sex and a 345 recidivism rate for samesex offenders after 5 years146 child and young adolescent offenders main article childonchild sexual abuse when a prepubescent child is sexually abused by one or more other children or adolescent youths and no adult is directly involved it is defined as childonchild sexual abuse the definition includes any sexual activity between children that occurs without consent without equality or due to coercion147 whether the offender uses physical force threats trickery or emotional manipulation to compel cooperation when sexual abuse is perpetrated by one sibling upon another it is known as intersibling abuse a form of incest148 unlike research on adult offenders a strong causal relationship has been established between child and adolescent offenders and these offenders own prior victimization by either adults or other children149150151152 teachers according to a 2010 unicef report 46 of congolese schoolgirls confirmed that they had been victims of sexual harassment abuse and violence committed by their teachers or other school personnel153 in mozambique a study by the ministry of education found that 70 percent of female respondents reported knowing teachers who use sexual intercourse as a necessary condition to advance students to the next grade153 a survey by promundo found that 16 of girls in north kivu said they had been forced to have sex with their teachers153 according to unicef teachers in mali are known to use la menace du bic rouge the threat of the red pen or bad marks if girls do not accept sexual advances153 according to plan international 16 of children in togo for instance named a teacher as responsible for the pregnancy of a classmate153 treatment although there is no known cure for pedophilia154 there are a number of treatments for pedophiles and child sexual abusers some of the treatments focus on attempting to change the sexual preference of pedophiles while others focus on keeping pedophiles from committing child sexual abuse or on keeping child sexual abusers from committing child sexual abuse again cognitive behavioral therapy cbt for example aims to reduce attitudes beliefs and behaviors that may increase the likelihood of sexual offenses against children its content varies widely between therapists but a typical program might involve training in selfcontrol social competence and empathy and use cognitive restructuring to change views on sex with children the most common form of this therapy is relapse prevention where the patient is taught to identify and respond to potentially risky situations based on principles used for treating addictions155 the evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy is mixed155 a 2012 cochrane review of randomized trials found that cbt had no effect on risk of reoffending for contact sex offenders156 metaanalyses in 2002 and 2005 which included both randomized and nonrandomized studies concluded that cbt reduced recidivism157158 there is debate over whether nonrandomized studies should be considered informative154159 more research is needed156 prevalence global based on selfdisclosure data a 2011 metaanalysis of 217 studies estimated a global prevalence of 127 — 18 for girls and 76 for boys the rates of selfdisclosed abuse for specific continents were as follows160 region girls boys africa 202 193 asia 113 41 australia 215 75 europe 135 56 south america 134 138 uscanada 201 8 a 2009 metaanalysis of 65 studies from 22 countries found a global prevalence of 197 for females and 79 for males in that analysis africa had the highest prevalence rate of child sexual abuse 344 primarily because of high rates in south africa europe showed the lowest prevalence rate 92 and america and asia had prevalence rates between 101 and 23913 africa further information virgin cleansing myth see also sexual violence in the democratic republic of the congo and sexual violence in south africa a tencountry schoolbased study in southern africa in 2007 found 196 of female students and 211 of male students aged 11–16 years reported they had experienced forced or coerced sex rates among 16yearolds were 288 in females and 254 in males comparing the same schools in eight countries between 2003 and 2007 agestandardised on the 2007 botswana male sample there was no significant decrease between 2003 and 2007 among females in any country and inconsistent changes among males161 the prevalence of child sexual abuse in africa is compounded by the virgin cleansing myth that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure a man of hiv or aids the myth is prevalent in south africa zimbabwe162 zambia and nigeria and is being blamed for the high rate of sexual abuse against young children163 child rape is on the risewhen in the war ravaged eastern democratic republic of the congo164 aid workers blame combatants on all sides who operate with much impunity for a culture of sexual violence165 south africa has some of the highest incidences of child rape including the rape of babies in the world also see sexual violence in south africa166 a survey by ciet found around 11 of boys and 4 of girls admitted to forcing someone else to have sex with them166 in a related survey conducted among 1500 schoolchildren a quarter of all the boys interviewed said that jackrolling a term for gang rape was fun167 more than 67000 cases of rape and sexual assaults against children were reported in 2000 in south africa compared to 37500 in 1998 child welfare groups believe that the number of unreported incidents could be up to 10 times that number the largest increase in attacks was against children under seven the virgin cleansing myth is especially common in south africa which has the highest number of hivpositive citizens in the world eastern cape social worker edith kriel notes that child abusers are often relatives of their victims – even their fathers and providers168168 a number of highprofile baby rapes appeared since 2001 including the fact that they required extensive reconstructive surgery to rebuild urinary genital abdominal or tracheal systems in 2001 a 9monthold was raped and likely lost consciousness as the pain was too much to bear169 in february 2002 an 8monthold infant was reportedly gang raped by four men one has been charged the infant has required extensive reconstructive surgery the 8monthold infants injuries were so extensive increased attention on prosecution has occurred170 asia further information child prostitution in

population176 in 2007 the ministry of women and child development published the study on child abuse india 2007174 it sampled 12447 children 2324 young adults and 2449 stakeholders across 13 states it looked at different forms of child abuse physical abuse sexual abuse and emotional abuse and girl child neglect in five evidence groups namely children in a family environment children in school children at work children on the street and children in institutions the studys174 main findings included 5322 of children reported having faced sexual abuse among them 5294 were boys and 4706 girls andhra pradesh assam bihar and delhi reported the highest percentage of sexual abuse among both boys and girls as well as the highest incidence of sexual assaults 2190 of child respondents faced severe forms of sexual abuse 569 had been sexually assaulted and 5076 reported other forms of sexual abuse children on the street at work and in institutional care reported the highest incidence of sexual assault the study also reported that 50 of abusers are known to the child or are in a position of trust and responsibility and most children had not reported the matter to anyone despite years of lack of any specific child sexual abuse laws in india which treated them separately from adults in case of sexual offense the protection of children against sexual offences bill 2011 was passed the indian parliament on may 22 2012 which came into force from 14 november 2012177 in one survey 25 of taiwanese adolescents report having experienced childhood sexual abuse178 uk ambassador craig murray

to unicef nearly half of reported rape victims in papua new guinea are under 15 years of age and 13 are under 7 years of age180 while a report by childfund australia citing former parliamentarian dame carol kidu stated 50 of those seeking medical help after rape are under 16 25 are under 10 and 10 are under 8181 additionally a study found that men with a history of victimization especially having been raped or otherwise sexually coerced themselves were more likely than otherwise to have participated in both single perpetrator and multiple perpetrator nonpartner rape182 57·5 5871022 of men who raped a nonpartner committed their first rape as teenagers182 united states and europe child sexual abuse occurs frequently in western society183 although the rate of prevalence can be difficult to determine184185186 research in north america has concluded that approximately 15 to 25 of women and 5 to 15 of men were sexually abused when they were children1516186 in the uk a 2010 study estimated prevalence at about 5 for boys and 18 for girls187 not dissimilar to a 1985 study that estimated about 8 for boys and 12 for girls188 more than 23000 incidents were recorded by the uk police between 2009 and 2010 girls were six times more likely to be assaulted than boys with 86 of attacks taking place against them189190 barnardos charity estimates that two thirds of victims in the united kingdom are girls and 1 third boys barnardos is concerned that boy victims may be overlooked191 a firm of solicitors that acts in many cases of child abuse has published a list of over twenty childrens homes and group actions that they have an interest in or for which they are lead solicitors192 the estimates for the united states vary widely a literature review of 23 studies found rates of 3 to 37 for males and 8 to 71 for females which produced an average of 17 for boys and 28 for girls193 while a statistical analysis based on 16 crosssectional studies estimated the rate to be 72 for males and 145 for females186 the us department of health and human services reported 83600 substantiated reports of sexually abused children in 2005194195 including incidents which were not reported would make the total number even larger196 according to emily m douglas and david finkelhor several national studies have found that black and white children experienced nearequal levels of sexual abuse other studies however have found that both blacks and latinos have an increased risk for sexual victimization197198 surveys have shown that one fifth to one third of all women reported some sort of childhood sexual experience with a male adult199 a 1992 survey studying fatherdaughter incest in finland reported that of the 9000 15yearold high school girls who filled out the questionnaires of the girls living with their biological fathers 02 reported fatherdaughter incest experiences of the girls living with a stepfather 37 reported sexual experiences with him the reported counts included only fatherdaughter incest and did not include prevalence of other forms of child sexual abuse the survey summary stated the feelings of the girls about their incestual experiences are overwhelmingly negative200 others argue that prevalence rates are much higher and that many cases of child abuse are never reported one study found that professionals failed to report approximately 40 of the child sexual abuse cases they encountered201 a study by lawson chaffin indicated that many children who were sexually abused were identified solely by a physical complaint that was later diagnosed as a venereal diseaseonly 43 of the children who were diagnosed with venereal disease made a verbal disclosure of sexual abuse during the initial interview202 it has been found in the epidemiological literature on csa that there is no identifiable demographic or family characteristic of a child that can be used to bar the prospect that a child has been sexually abused184 in us schools according to the united states department of education203 nearly 96 of students are targets of educator sexual misconduct sometime during their school career in studies of student sex abuse by male and female educators male students were reported as targets in ranges from 23 to 44203 in us school settings samesex female and male sexual misconduct against students by educators ranges from 18 to 28 of reported cases depending on the study204 significant underreporting of sexual abuse of boys by both women and men is believed to occur due to sex stereotyping social denial the minimization of male victimization and the relative lack of research on sexual abuse of boys205 sexual victimization of boys by their mothers or other female relatives is especially rarely researched or reported sexual abuse of girls by their mothers and other related andor unrelated adult females is beginning to be researched and reported despite the highly taboo nature of female–female child sex abuse in studies where students are asked about sex offenses they report higher levels of female sex offenders than found in adult reports206 this underreporting has been attributed to cultural denial of femaleperpetrated child sex abuse207 because males have been socialized to believe they should be flattered or appreciative of sexual interest from a female121 journalist cathy young writes that underreporting is contributed to by the difficulty of people including jurors in seeing a male as a true victim208 international law main article laws regarding child sexual abuse child sexual abuse is outlawed nearly everywhere in the world generally with severe criminal penalties including in some jurisdictions life imprisonment or capital punishment209210 an adults sexual intercourse with someone below the legal age of consent is defined as statutory rape211 based on the principle that a child is not capable of consent and that any apparent consent by a child is not considered to be legal consent the united nations convention on the rights of the child crc is an international treaty that legally obliges states to protect childrens rights articles 34 and 35 of the crc require states to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse this includes outlawing the coercion of a child to perform sexual activity the prostitution of children and the exploitation of children in creating pornography states are also required to prevent the abduction sale or trafficking of children212 as of november 2008 193 countries are bound by the crc213 including every member of the united nations except the united states and south sudan214215 the council of europe has adopted the council of europe convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse in order to prohibit child sexual abuse that occurs within home or family in the european union child sexual abuse is subject to a directive216 this directive deals with several forms of sexual abuse of children especially commercial sexual exploitation of children history child sexual abuse has gained public attention in the past few decades and has become one of the most highprofile crimes since the 1970s the sexual abuse of children and child molestation has increasingly been recognized as deeply damaging to children and thus unacceptable for society as a whole while sexual use of children by adults has been present throughout history it has only become the object of significant public attention in recent timescitation needed early writings the first published work dedicated specifically to child sexual abuse appeared in france in 1857 medicallegal studies of sexual assault etude médicolégale sur les attentats aux mœurs by auguste ambroise tardieu the noted french pathologist and pioneer of forensic medicine217 public concern the examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the united states and do not represent a

child sexual abuse became a public issue in the 1970s and 1980s prior to this point in time sexual abuse remained rather secretive and socially unspeakablecitation needed studies on child molestation were nonexistent until the 1920s and the first national estimate of the number of child sexual abuse cases was published in 1948 by 1968 44 out of 50 us states had enacted mandatory laws that required physicians to report cases of suspicious child abuse legal action began to become more prevalent in the 1970s with the enactment of the child abuse prevention and treatment act in 1974 in conjunction with the creation of the national center for child abuse and neglect since the creation of the child abuse and treatment act reported child abuse cases have increased dramatically finally the national abuse coalition was created in 1979 to create pressure in congress to create more sexual abuse laws second wave feminism brought greater awareness of child sexual abuse and violence against women and made them public political issues218219 judith lewis herman harvard professor of psychiatry wrote the first book ever on fatherdaughter incest when she discovered during her medical residency that a large number of the women she was seeing had been victims of fatherdaughter incest herman notes that her approach to her clinical experience grew out of her involvement in the civil rights movement220 her second book trauma and recovery coined the term complex posttraumatic stress disorder and included child sexual abuse as a possible cause221 in 1986 congress passed the child abuse victims rights act giving children a civil claim in sexual abuse cases the number of laws created in the 1980s and 1990s began to create greater prosecution and detection of child sexual abusers during the 1970s a large transition began in the legislature related to child sexual abuse megans law which was enacted in 1996 gives the public access to knowledge of sex offenders nationwide222 anne hastings described these changes in attitudes towards child sexual abuse as the beginning of one of historys largest social revolutions223 according to john jay college of criminal justice professor bj cling by the early 21st century the issue of child sexual abuse has become a legitimate focus of professional attention while increasingly separated from second wave feminismas child sexual abuse becomes absorbed into the larger field of interpersonal trauma studies child sexual abuse studies and intervention strategies have become degendered and largely unaware of their political origins in modern feminism and other vibrant political movements of the 1970s one may hope that unlike in the past this rediscovery of child sexual abuse that began in the 70s will not again be followed by collective amnesia the institutionalization of child maltreatment interventions in federally funded centers national and international societies and a host of research studies in which the united states continues to lead the world offers grounds for cautious optimism nevertheless as judith herman argues cogently the systematic study of psychological traumadepends on the support of a political movement224 civil lawsuits in the united states growing awareness of child sexual abuse has sparked an increasing number of civil lawsuits for monetary damages stemming from such incidents increased awareness of child sexual abuse has encouraged more victims to come forward whereas in the past victims often kept their abuse secret some states have enacted specific laws lengthening the applicable statutes of limitations so as to allow victims of child sexual abuse to file suit sometimes years after they have reached the age of majority225 such lawsuits can be brought where a person or entity such as a school church or youth organization or daycare was charged with supervising the child but failed to do so with child sexual abuse resulting making the individual or institution liable in the catholic sex abuse cases the various roman catholic diocese in the united states have paid out approximately 1 billion settling hundreds of such lawsuits since the early 1990s there have also been lawsuits involving the american religious right crimes have allegedly gone unreported and victims were pressured into silence226 as lawsuits can involve demanding procedures there is a concern that children or adults who file suit will be revictimized by defendants through the legal process much as rape victims can be revictimized by the accused in criminal rape trials the child sexual abuse plaintiffs attorney thomas a cifarelli has written that children involved in the legal system particularly victims of sexual abuse and molestation should be afforded certain procedural safeguards to protect them from harassment during the legal process227 in june 2008 in zambia the issue of teacherstudent sexual abuse and sexual assault was brought to the attention of the high court of zambia where a landmark case decision with presiding judge philip musonda awarded 45million zambian kwacha 13000 usd to the plaintiff a 13yearold girl for sexual abuse and rape by her school teacher this claim was brought against her teacher as a person of authority who as judge musonda stated had a moral superiority responsibility over his students at the time228 a 2000 world health organization – geneva report “world report on violence and health chap 6 – sexual violence” states “action in schools is vital for reducing sexual and other forms of violence in many countries a sexual relation between a teacher and a pupil is not a serious disciplinary offence and policies on sexual harassment in schools either do not exist or are not implemented in recent years though some countries have introduced laws prohibiting sexual relations between teachers and pupils such measures are important in helping eradicate sexual harassment in schools at the same time a wider range of actions is also needed including changes to teacher training and recruitment and reforms of curricula so as to transform gender relations in schools”229 in march 2011 europol the european police in a mission called operation rescue arrested 184 alleged members out of 670 identified of an online paedophile ring and rescued 230 children which is considered as the biggest case of its kind230 in 2010 five men of pakistani heritage were found guilty for sexual offences which occurred between 1997 and 2013 in the uk town of rotherham the scandal caused outrage in the uk due to the length of time the abuse took place and numerous investigative failings231 see also abusive power and control 17thcentury sexual molestation at naples school bacha bazi catholic church sex abuse cases child erotica child
