fifth single from michael jacksons album history past present and future book i released on march 31 1996 the song remains one of the most controversial pieces jackson ever composed in the us media scrutiny surrounding allegations of antisemitic lyrics were the catalyst for jackson issuing multiple apologies and rerecording the song with altered lyrics the singer countered allegations of antisemitism arguing that reviews had misinterpreted the context of the song either unintentionally or deliberately the song was accompanied by two music videos directed by spike lee the first was shot in two locations in brazil in pelourinho the historic city center of salvador and in a favela of rio de janeiro called dona marta23 where the state authorities had tried to ban all production over fears the video would damage their image the area and prospects of rio de janeiro staging the 2004 olympics still the residents of the area were happy to see the singer hoping their problems would be made visible to a wider audience3 the second video was shot in a prison and contained video footage of multiple references to human rights abuses commercially the song became a top ten hit in all european countries and number one in germany for three weeks in the us radio stations were reluctant to play the controversial composition it however managed to peak at number 30 on the billboard hot 100 the song was remixed with parts of songs such as privacy from the album invincible and tabloid junkie and released on the immortal album in november 2011 the song was performed during jacksons third and final concert series the history world tour which ran from 1996 to 1997 as part of a medley with scream and in the closet the song was set to be performed on jacksons this is it comeback

between the chorus lines one child chants dont worry what people say we got it true after which another child says enough is enough of this garbage456 according to the sheet music published on musicnotescom by alfred music publishing they dont care about us is played in the key of d minor and the tracks time signature is common time7 the song which is cited as being a pop song has a moderately slow tempo of 90 beats per minute instruments used include a piano and guitar7 jon pareles stated that jackson was calling himself a victim of police brutality and a victim of hate he continued a listener might wonder just who us is supposed to be  to make the songs lodge in the ear jackson uses elementary singsong melodies – a nyah nyah twonote motif in they dont care about us  and he comes up with all kinds of surprises in the arrangements8 james hunter of rolling stone magazine noted that musically jackson was no longer trying to hide any eccentricities he had he expressed the opinion that in they dont care about us the pop musician sounded more embattled than ever9 jim farber of new york daily news said that jackson snarled while singing that the song clicked and has an original clattering rhythm10 the review of history in the washington times noted of they dont care about us it follows fast inviting more pathos – and more controversy with haunting clapping and a police scanner in the background11 the sacramento bee described it as a looped reggaelite dance beat12 the song gained renewed attention and relevance due to its use during black lives matter protests in 2014 and 20151314 chart performanceedit in the uk it peaked at number four and stayed on the chart for three months15 the song found particular success in europe peaking within the top ten in all countries european highlights came in austria switzerland france belgium and sweden in these countries the song became a top five hit and stayed in their respective charts for a minimum of 21 weeks16 the song reached the top of the charts for three weeks in germany and stayed a full 30 weeks in the survey17 it is the longest consecutive chart run of a michael jackson song in the german charts the lyrical controversy surrounding they dont care about us brought partial commercial disappointment in the us radio stations were reluctant to play the song it peaked at number 30 on the us billboard hot 100 chart falling short of the record breaking success of the two previous singles screamchildhood and you are not alone yet the song peaked at number 10 on the us billboard hot rb singles chart18 music videosedit the cultural music group olodum from the city of salvador with whom jackson collaborated producing the first video proved to be a difficult task for jackson state authorities unsuccessfully tried to ban the singer filming in salvador pelourinho and in rio de janeiro officials in the state of rio feared images of poverty might affect tourism and accused jackson of exploiting the poor ronaldo cezar coelho the state secretary for industry commerce and tourism demanded editing rights over the finished product stating i dont see why we should have to facilitate films that will contribute nothing to all our efforts to rehabilitate rios image some were concerned that scenes of poverty and human rights abuses would affect their chances of hosting the olympics in 2004 others supported jacksons wish to highlight the problems of the region arguing that the government were embarrassed by their own failings a judge banned all filming but this ruling was overturned by an injunction although officials were angry the residents were not and jackson was surrounded by crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming one woman managed to push through security to hug jackson who continued dancing while hugging her another woman appeared and hugged him from behind he then fell to the ground as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away after the director helped jackson get up off the street he continued to sing and dance this incident made it into the music video19 1500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the dona marta favela some residents and officials found it offensive that jacksons production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the citys shantytowns320 the music video was directed by spike lee asked why he chose lee to direct the video jackson responded they dont care about us has an edge and spike lee had approached me its a public awareness song and thats what he is all about its a protest kind of song  and i think he was perfect for it21 jackson also collaborated with 200 members of the cultural group olodum who swayed to the heavy beat of salvadors sambareggae music2022 the media interest surrounding the music video exposed olodum to 140 countries around the world it brought them worldwide fame and increased their credibility in brazil23 at the beginning of the video a brazilian woman says michael eles não ligam pra gente which means michael they dont care about us precarious houses in the favela of complexo do alemão in rio de janeiro identical scenes are viewable in the first music video speaking of the music video in the new brazilian cinema lúcia nagib observed when michael jackson decided to shoot his new music video in a favela of rio de janeiro  he used the favela people as extras in a visual superspectacle  all the while there is a vaguely political appeal in there  the interesting aspect of michael jacksons strategy is the efficiency with which it gives visibility to poverty and social problems in countries like brazil without resorting to traditional political discourse the problematic aspect is that it does not entail a real intervention in that poverty24 in 2009 billboard described the area as now a model for social development and claimed that jacksons influence was partially responsible for this improvement2 for the first time in his career jackson made a second music video for a single this second version was filmed in a prison with cell mates in the video jackson is seen handcuffed it also contains real footage of police attacking african americans the military crackdown of the protest in the tiananmen square the ku klux klan war crimes genocide execution martial law and other human rights abuses25 the first music video of the song appears on the box set visionary the video singles and the video albums history on film volume ii and vision the latter additionally includes the prison version the voice intro michael michael eles não ligam pra gente portuguese for they dont care about us was recorded by angélica vieira producer of manhattan connection26 live performancesedit they dont care about us was only performed as part of the opening medley for the history world tour along with scream and in the closet the segment for they dont care about us began with a short militarystyle dance sequence and contained an excerpt of history a short unedited video clip released after jacksons death of the june 23 2009 rehearsal for the this is it concert series shows jackson performing the song as the main song in a medley with parts of history song as well as why you wanna trip on me and she drives me wild from dangerous27 the song was later remixed and featured as part of cirque du soleils michael jackson the immortal world tour lyric dispute and contextedit the new york times reported the song contained racist and antisemitic content on june 15 1995 just a day before the albums release the publication highlighted the lyrics jew me sue me everybody do me kick me kike me dont you black or white me2829 jackson responded directly to the publication stating “ the idea that these lyrics could be deemed objectionable is extremely hurtful to me and misleading the song in fact is about the pain of prejudice and hate and is a way to draw attention to social and political problems i am the voice of the accused and the attacked i am the voice of everyone i am the skinhead i am the jew i am the black man i am the white man i am not the one who was attacking it is about the injustices to young people and how the system can wrongfully accuse them i am angry and outraged that i could be so misinterpreted ” — michael jackson 28 when questioned further about the lyrics on the abc news program prime time live jackson stated its not antisemitic because im not a racist person  i could never be a racist i love all races28 the singer also claimed that some of his closest employees and friends were jewish that same day jackson received support from his manager and record label who described the lyrics as brilliant that they were about opposition to prejudice and taken out of context28 the following day two leading members of the jewish community stated that jacksons attempt to make a song critical of discrimination had backfired they expressed the opinion that the lyrics used were unsuitable for a teenage audience that might not understand the songs context adding that the song was too ambiguous for some listeners to understand they accepted that jackson meant well and suggested that the entertainer write an explanation in the album booklet4 on june 17 jackson issued another public apology for his choice of words he promised that future copies of the album would include an apology by this point however two million copies of the record had already been shipped the singer concluded i just want you all to know how strongly i am committed to tolerance peace and love and i apologize to anyone who might have been hurt30 the next day in his review of history jon pareles of the new york times alleged in  they dont care about us he gives the lie to his entire catalogue of brotherhood anthems with a burst of antisemitism8 on june 21 patrick macdonald of the seattle times criticized jackson stating he may have lived a sheltered life but there really is no excuse for using terms like jew me and kike in a pop song unless you make it clear you are denouncing such terms and do so in an artful way31 two days later jackson decided despite the cost incurred he would return to the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album jew me and kike me would be substituted with do me and strike me the music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words but with loud abstract noises partially drowning them out he reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some3233 spike lee claimed there was some kind of double standard in the music industry while the new york times asserted the use of racial slurs in they dont care about us they were silent on other racial slurs in the album the notorious big says nigga on this time around another song on the history album but it did not attract media attention as well as many years before use in lyrics of word nigger by john lennon34 track listingedit us and japan maxi singleedit track song duration 1 they dont care about us 444 2 they dont care about us charles full joint mix
