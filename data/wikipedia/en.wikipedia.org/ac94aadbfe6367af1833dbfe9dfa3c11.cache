troutman broshears children 2 david swinson doc maynard march 22 1808 – march 13 1873 was an american pioneer doctor and businessman he was one of seattles primary founders he was an effective civic booster and compared to other white settlers a relative advocate of native american rights his friendship with chief seattle was important in the formation of the city of seattle and it was he who proposed the city be named for this important chief maynard was seattles first doctor merchant prince second lawyer subindian agent justice of the peace and architect of the point elliott treaty of 1855 contents 1 early life 2 early ventures in seattle 3 later life 4 see also 5 references 6 further reading early lifeedit maynard was born to a family of means near castleton vermont at the age of 17 he was accepted into castleton medical school which at the time was associated with middlebury college he was top in his class and apprenticed to dr theodore woodward not to be confused with dr theodore e woodward in 1828 he married lydia a rickey they had a daughter frances in 1830 and a son henry in 1834 according to court papers he discovered in 1841 that she was unfaithful to him but remained with her until 1850 in 1832 the maynards moved to cleveland ohio at the time a town of 500 he made and lost small fortunes in business and political ventures including railroading and a medical school that collapsed in the panic of 1837 maynard left cleveland in 1850 either promising to send for his family when he was settled elsewhere or giving lydia the chance to file for divorce on the grounds of desertion either way she never actually completed the divorce maynard took the railroad to st louis and from there set out for california he circulated among several wagon trains fighting cholera which he had learned about during the 1849 epidemic in cleveland when the leader of one small wagon train heading for oregon territory died he assumed leadership and thus ended up on puget sound he and widow catherine troutman broshears june 19 1816 oct 20 1906 fell in love during their journey however her brother mike simmons refused them permission to marry perhaps on the grounds that maynard was still married early ventures in seattleedit maynard joined in the logging activity at new yorkalki later seattle near the mouth of the duwamish river on puget sound instead of selling his wood to shippers at 4 a cord he leased a vessel from captain felker using the wood itself as security and sold the load in san francisco at ten times the price with that money he bought the fixings for a general store and briefly set up in competition to the only other such store on puget sound which was in olympia and owned by catherines brother mike soon agreed to his sister marrying maynard apparently on condition that they move the store to duwamps and do something about that prior marriage in april 1852 maynard claimed as a married man a tract of land of 640 acres in what is now seattles pioneer square neighborhood and hired indians to help him build a combination cabin and store according to historian bill speidel the land he preferred was the undeveloped southern part of carson borens claim but while boren was out of town arthur denny shifted carsons claim north to make room for maynard maynards building became a hub of activity when maynard became king countys first justice of the peace1 maynard laid out streets in his claim according to the cardinal directions northsouth but boren and denny insisted on orienting the streets according to their stretch of shoreline seattles downtown still shows awkward bends and jogs where the plats meet but the rest of king county follows maynards original design in reference to the disagreement arthur denny would go on to comment that maynard was king of all he surveyed and some of what boren and i surveyed as well in a study conducted by the city of seattle in the 1930s it was determined that denny has platted his streets in violation of donation land claim law under which the original land claims were filed doc maynards character and approach to citybuilding differed from that of his contemporaries william bell arthur denny david denny henry yesler and carson boren in part this may have been because he was much older and had already participated in the development of one city he drank liquor while the denny party were mostly teetotalers and with his friend captain felker found someone to start a good brothel in seattle — the infamous mother damnable — believing that vice was essential to the economic success of a frontier town of that time maynards political skills helped defuse difficult situations with the indian tribes in particular between the duwamish and the more powerful snohomish led by chief patkanim as part of his diplomacy maynard worked to rename the settlement after the duwamishs leader chief sealth or seattle in exchange for an annual payment to sealth local legend has it that the tribes believed having ones name spoken after their death would disturb the named one in the afterlife hence the payoff to sealth to make up for that in advance this friendly relationship paid off during the battle of seattle 1856 when both sealth and patkanim kept their fighters out of the battle maynards political skills were helpful in persuading the legislature of the oregon territory to support the formation of a separate washington territory in return the legislature passed an unusual bill granting maynard a divorce2 he married catherine on january 15 1853 maynard developed many clever ways to improve his property and his city for example he obtained the right to host the post office at his store as a result everyone had to come to his establishment to get their mail he sold a lot cheaply to blacksmith lewis wyckoff people needing smithing therefore came to seattle instead of its rival port madison perhaps his greatest coup was persuading henry yesler to set up a steam sawmill on land sliced from the north part of maynards claim and the south part of borens this sawmill helped establish seattles economic ascendancy when the only lawyer in seattle died in a canoeing accident maynard studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1856 in 1857 doc maynard traded his downtown acreage for charles c terrys farm in west seattle but this new enterprise did not prosper he and catherine then opened a tworoom hospital in what is now pioneer square this enterprise failed because a number of settlers refused to use the hospital after the maynards insisted of serving both whites and indians later lifeedit doc maynard was known as a friend to the indians when washington became a territory in 1853 doc maynard was appointed as the man in charge of indian relations during the seattle indian war doc maynard protected the natives and ensured that they did not starve although maynard was originally one of the citys largest landholders and strongest boosters he is considered not to have prospered as well as his contemporaries among the reasons given for this are that his friendly relations with chief seattle and other natives made him suspect to his fellow settlers the surviving city fathers minimized his role in their reminiscences in response to maynards autocratic rule of early seattle at any rate he died in a mansion furnished with every comfort it is important to note that maynards stated purpose was not to get rich but rather to build the greatest city in the world near the end of his life maynards first wife lydia sold any rights she may have had in maynards property to a person who promptly sued maynard for lydias share of maynards property in seattle claiming that they had never been divorced while he was still married when he built his fortune the common law is not entirely clear as to her claim lydia arrived penniless in seattle to testify on maynards behalf he and catherine let her stay in their mansion on friendly terms as bill speidel has written maynard was seen strolling around town the only man in seattle with a wife on either arm the ultimate result of this land dispute is that the east half of maynards claim reverted to public land as neither of his wives had satisfied their requirements for their share the legal battle passed through several hands until it was ultimately decided against all the maynards in the united states supreme court case of maynard v hill2 see alsoedit history of seattle before 1900 referencesedit junius rochester november 10 1998 maynard dr david
