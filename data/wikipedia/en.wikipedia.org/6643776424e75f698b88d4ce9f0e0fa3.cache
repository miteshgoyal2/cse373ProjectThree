terrorism the free trade agreement of the americas ftaa tax relief to families and the over two million hispanic and portugueseowned small businesses support for faith based initiatives and educational choice for all the impetus behind the conferences creation was the debate surrounding the nomination of conservative lawyer miguel estrada to the dc circuit court of appeals12 the

of the congressional hispanic caucus – mexicanamerican henry bonilla of texas and cubanamericans ileana roslehtinen and lincoln diazbalart of florida – left the caucus in protest over its support for improved relations with cuba3 while roslehtinen remained an active member of the chcs public outreach arm the congressional hispanic caucus institute the caucus has since been composed solely of democratic and democraticcaucusing independent legislators45 feeling there was significant need for a new hispanic conference newly elected florida congressman mario diazbalart began to organize in 2002 a caucus for hispanic republicans to counter what they felt was democratic dominance over hispanic political affairs on march 17 2003 diazbalart revealed the formation of the conference in an open letter published in the wall street journal1 joined by bonilla roslehtinen his brother lincoln and newly elected colleague devin nunes a california congressman of portuguese azorean descent diazbalart decried what he perceived as hispanic democratic efforts to derail the nomination of estrada a selection seen by some at the time as a possible fast track to the us supreme court36 the group was officially announced at a press conference two days later they were soon joined by two more portuguese american congressmen richard pombo of california and patrick toomey of pennsylvania7 like their democratic counterpart the conference allows members from the senate mel martinez the first cubanamerican us senator joined the group shortly after his election in 2004 additionally the conference is open to nonhispanic associate members who represent districts with significant hispanic populations or generally support its goals with regards to public policy89 in 2003 conference members also formed the congressional hispanic leadership institute as an equivalent to the democratic chcaffiliated chci in the 2006 and 2008 elections the conference suffered the loss of nearly half of their members to electoral defeat attempts at higher office or resignations past chair luis fortuño left congress after being elected governor of puerto rico after the 2010 midterm elections six new hispanic republicans were elected to congress senator marco rubio of florida representatives david rivera of florida raúl labrador of idaho francisco canseco and bill flores of texas and jaime
