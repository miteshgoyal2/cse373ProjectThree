goes back to the 20s when it was used theatrically in miming it is a dance in which the dancer moves their limbs in a way that imitates the movements of a robot movements of the robot are normally started and finished with a dimestop a very abrupt stop to give the impression of motors starting and stopping but poppers have also been known to do the robot with a pop to the beat as long as the illusion of being a robot is maintained it is considered the robotcitation needed robot dancing is often considered a subsection of popping because poppers often include the robot in their routines
