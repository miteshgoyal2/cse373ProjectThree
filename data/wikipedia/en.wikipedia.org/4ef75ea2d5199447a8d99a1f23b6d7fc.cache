external links history prior to 1955 billboard did not have a unified allencompassing popularity chart instead measuring songs by individual metrics at the start of the rock era in 1955 three such charts existedcitation needed best sellers in stores was the first billboard chart established in 1936 this chart ranked the biggest selling singles in retail stores as reported by merchants surveyed throughout the country 20 to 50 positions most played by jockeys was billboards original airplay chart it ranked the most played songs on united states radio stations as reported by radio disc jockeys and radio stations 20 to 25 positions most played in jukeboxes ranked the most played songs in jukeboxes across the united states 20 positions this was one of the main outlets of measuring song popularity with the younger generation of music listeners as many radio stations resisted adding rock and roll music to their playlists for many years although officially all three charts had equal weight in terms of their importance many chart historians refer to the best sellers in stores chart when referencing a songs performance prior to the creation of the hot 100 until the start of the rock era in 1955 radio was still in its golden age characterized more by spokenword programs than music radio and physical record sales were still the dominant indicator of a recordings popularitywhy on the week ending november 12 1955 billboard published the top 100 for the first time the top 100 combined all aspects of a singles performance sales airplay and jukebox activity based on a point system that typically gave sales purchases more weight than radio airplay the best sellers in stores most played by jockeys and most played in jukeboxes charts continued to be published concurrently with the new top 100 chart on june 17 1957 billboard discontinued the most played in jukeboxes chart as the popularity of jukeboxes waned and radio stations incorporated more and more rockoriented music into their playlists the week ending july 28 1958 was the final publication of the most played by jockeys and top 100 charts both of which had perez prados instrumental version of patricia ascending to the topcitation needed on august 4 1958 billboard premiered one main allgenre singles chart the hot 100 the hot 100 quickly became the industry standard and billboard discontinued the best sellers in stores chart on october 13 1958 the billboard hot 100 is still the standard by which a songs popularity is measured in the united states the hot 100 is ranked by radio airplay audience impressions as measured by nielsen bds sales data compiled by nielsen soundscan both at retail and digitally and streaming activity provided by online music sourcescitation needed there are several component charts that contribute to the overall calculation of the hot 100 the most significant ones are hot 100 airplay per billboard approximately 1000 stations composed of adult contemporary rb hip hop country rock gospel latin and christian formats digitally monitored twentyfour hours a day seven days a week charts are ranked by number of gross audience impressions computed by crossreferencing exact times of radio airplay with arbitron listener data hot singles sales per billboard the top selling singles compiled from a national sample of retail store mass merchant and internet sales reports collected compiled and provided by nielsen soundscan the chart is released weekly and measures sales of physical commercial singles with the decline in sales of physical singles in the us many songs that become number one on this chart often do not even chart on the hot 100 hot digital songs digital sales are tracked by nielsen soundscan and are included as part of a titles sales points streaming songs a collaboration between billboard nielsen soundscan and national association of recording merchandisers which measures the top streamed radio songs ondemand songs and videos on leading online music services compilation the tracking week for sales and streaming begins on friday and ends on thursday while the radio play trackingweek runs from monday to sunday a new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by billboard on tuesday each chart is postdated with the weekending issue date 11 days after the charts are refreshed online for example friday january 1 – sales trackingweek begins streaming trackingweek begins monday january 4 – airplay trackingweek begins thursday january 7 – sales trackingweek ends streaming trackingweek ends sunday january 10 – airplay trackingweek ends tuesday january 12 – new chart released with issue postdated saturday january 231 hot 100 policy changes the methods and policies by which this data is obtained and compiled have changed many times throughout the charts history as the advent of a singles music chart spawned chart historians and chartwatchers and greatly affected pop culture and produced countless bits of trivia the main purpose of the hot 100 is to aid those within the music industry to reflect the popularity of the product the singles the albums etc and to track the trends of the buying public billboard has many times changed its methodology and policies to give the most precise and accurate reflection of what is popular a very basic example of this would be the ratio given to sales and airplay during the hot 100s early history singles were the leading way by which people bought music at times when singles sales were robust more weight was given to a songs retail points than to its radio airplay as the decades passed the recording industry concentrated more on album sales than singles sales musicians eventually expressed their creative output in the form of fulllength albums rather than singles and by the 1990s many record companies stopped releasing singles altogether see album cuts below eventually a songs airplay points were weighted more so than its sales billboard has adjusted the salesairplay ratio many times to more accurately reflect the true popularity of songs doublesided singles billboard has also changed its hot 100 policy regarding twosided singles several times the prehot 100 chart best sellers in stores listed popular a andbsides together with the side that was played most often based on its other charts listed first one of the most notable of these but far from the only one was elvis presleys dont be cruel hound dog during the presley singles chart run top billing was switched back and forth between the two sides several times but on the concurrent most played in juke boxes most played by jockeys and the top 100 the two songs were listed separately as was true of all songs with the initiation of the hot 100 in 1958 a andbsides charted separately as they had on the former top 100 starting with the hot 100 chart for the week ending november 29 1969 this rule was altered if both sides received significant airplay they were listed together this started to become a moot point by 1972 as most major record labels solidified a trend they had started in the 1960s by putting the same song on both sides of the singles it serviced to radio more complex issues began to arise as the typical aandbside format of singles gave way to 12 inch singles and maxisingles many of which contained more than one bside further problems arose when in several cases a bside would eventually overtake the aside in popularity thus prompting record labels to release a new single featuring the former bside as the aside along with a new bside the inclusion of album cuts on the hot 100 put the doublesided hit issues to rest permanently album cuts as many hot 100 chart policies have been modified over the years one rule always remained constant songs were not eligible to enter the hot 100 unless they were available to purchase as a single however on december 5 1998 the hot 100 changed from being a singles chart to a songs chart3 during the 1990s a growing trend in the music industry was to promote songs to radio without ever releasing them as singles it was claimed by major record labels that singles were cannibalizing album sales so they were slowly phased out during this period accusations began to fly of chart manipulation as labels would hold off on releasing a single until airplay was at its absolute peak thus prompting a top ten or in some cases a number one debut in many cases a label would delete a single from its catalog after only one week thus allowing the song to enter the hot 100 make a high debut and then slowly decline in position as the onetime production of the retail single sold out it was during this period that several popular mainstream hits never charted on the hot 100 or charted well after their airplay had declined during the period that they were not released as singles the songs were not eligible to chart many of these songs dominated the hot 100 airplay chart for extended periods of time 1995 the rembrandts ill be there for you number one for eight weeks 1996 no doubt dont speak number one for 16 weeks 1997 sugar ray featuring super cat fly number one for six weeks 1997 will smith men in black number one for four weeks 1997 the cardigans lovefool number two for eight weeks 1998 natalie imbruglia torn number one for 11 weeks 1998 goo goo dolls iris number one for 18 weeks as debate and conflicts occurred more and more often billboard finally answered the requests of music industry artists and insiders by including airplayonly singles or album cuts in the hot 100citation needed eps extended play ep releases were listed by billboard on the hot 100 and in prehot 100 charts top 100 until the midtolate 1960s with the growing popularity of albums it was decided to move eps which typically contain four to six tracks from the hot 100 to the billboard 200 where they are included to this day digital downloads and online streaming since february 12 2005 the billboard hot 100 tracks paid digital downloads from such internet services as itunes musicmatch and rhapsody billboard initially started tracking downloads in 2003 with the hot digital tracks chart however these downloads did not count towards the hot 100 and that chart as opposed to hot digital songs counted each version of a song separately the chart still exists today along with hot digital songs this was the first major overhaul of the hot 100s chart formula since december 1998 the change in methodology has shaken up the chart considerably with some songs debuting on the chart strictly with robust online sales and others making drastic leaps in recent years several songs have been able to achieve 80to90 position jumps in a single week as their digital components were made available at online music stores since 2006 the alltime record for the biggest singleweek upward movement was broken nine times in the issue dated august 11 2007 billboard began incorporating weekly data from streaming media and ondemand services into the hot 100 the first two major companies to provide their statistics to nielsen bds on a weekly basis were aol music and yahoo music4 on march 24 2012 billboard premiered its ondemand songs chart and its data was incorporated into the equation that compiles the hot 1005 this was expanded to a broader streaming songs chart in january 2013 which ranks web radio streams from services such as spotify as well as ondemand audio titles6 in february 2013 us views for a song on youtube were added to the hot 100 formula harlem shake was the first song to reach number one after the changes were made7 the hot 100 formula starting 2013 generally incorporates sales 35–45 airplay 30–40 and streaming 20–30 and the precise percentage can change from week to week8 remixes billboard has also answered the call of music industry insiderswho who raised an issue regarding song remixes a growing trend in the early first decade of the 21st century was to issue a song as a remix that was so drastically different in structure and lyrical content from its original version that it was essentially a whole new song under normal circumstances airplay points from a songs album version radio mix andor dance music remix etc were all combined and factored into the songs performance on the hot 100 as the structure lyrics and melody remained intact criticisms began when songs were being completely rerecorded to the point that they no longer resembled the original recording the first such example of this scenario is jennifer lopez im real originally entering the hot 100 in its album version a remix was issued in the midst of its chart run that featured rapper ja rule this new version proved to be far more popular than the album version and the track was propelled to number one to address this issue billboard now separates airplay points from a songs original version and its remix if the remix is determined to be a new song since administering this new chart rule several songs have charted twice normally credited as part 1 and part 2 the remix rule is still in place recurrents billboard in an effort to allow the chart to remain as current as possible and to give proper representation to new and developing artists and tracks has since 1991 removed titles that have reached certain criteria regarding its current rank and number of weeks on the chart recurrent criteria have been modified several times and currently as of 2015 a song is permanently moved to recurrent status if it has spent 20 weeks on the hot 100 and fallen below position number 50 additionally descending songs are removed from the chart if ranking below number 25 after 52 weeks9 exceptions are made to rereleases and sudden resurgence in popularity of tracks that have taken a very long time to gain mainstream success these rare cases are handled on a casebycase basis and ultimately determined by billboards chart managers and staff adjustment of tracking week billboard altered its trackingweek for sales streaming and radio airplay in order to conform to a new global release date which now falls on fridays in all majormarket territories united states product was formerly released on tuesdays prior to june 2015 this modified tracking schedule took effect in the issue dated july 25 20151 yearend charts billboards chart year runs from the first week of december to the final week in november this altered calendar allows for billboard to calculate yearend charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of december prior to nielsen soundscan yearend singles charts were calculated by an inversepoint system based solely on a songs performance on the hot 100 for example a song would be given one point for a week spent at position 100 two points for a week spent at position 99 and so forth up to 100 points for each week spent at number one other factors including the total weeks a song spent on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into its yearend total after billboard began obtaining sales and airplay information from nielsen soundscan the yearend charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales and airplay points this gives a more accurate picture of any given years most popular tracks as a song that hypothetically spent nine weeks at number one in march could possibly have earned fewer cumulative points than a song that spent six weeks at number three in january songs at the peak of their popularity at the time of the novemberdecember chartyear cutoff many times end up ranked on the following years chart as well as their cumulative points are split between the two chartyears but often are ranked lower than they would have been had the peak

based on singles sales as singles have themselves become a less common form of song release the hot 100s data represented a narrowing segment of sales until the december 1998 change in the ranking formula few music historians believe that the hot 100 has been a perfectly accurate gauge of the most popular songs for each week or year for example during the 1950s and 1960s payola and other problems skewed the numbers in largely undetectable ways10 further the history of popular music shows nearly as many remarkable failures to chart as it does impressive charting histories certain artists such as pink floyd and led zeppelin had tremendous album sales while being oblivious to the weekly singles charts business changes in the industry also affect artists statistical records single releases were more frequent and steady and were expected to have much shorter shelf lives in earlier decades making direct historical comparisons somewhat specious of the 16 singles to top the billboard chart for more than ten weeks since 1955 only two were released before 1992 during the first 40 years of the rock era no song had ever debuted at number one since a 1995 change in methodology 19 songs have strategizing also plays a role numerous record labels have taken deliberate steps to maximize their chart positions by such tactics as timing a singles debut to face the weakest possible competition or massively discounting the price of singles to the point where each individual sale represented a financial loss meanwhile other labels would deliberately withhold even their most marketable songs in order to boost album sales particularly in the 1990s many of the most heavily played mtv and radio hits were unavailable for separate purchase because of such countervailing strategies it cannot be said that a hot 100 chart necessarily lists the countrys 100 most popular or successful songs strategies like these were the main reason behind the december 1998 change in the charts some criticswho have argued that an overemphasis on a limited number of singles has distorted record industry development efforts and there are nearly as many critics of the hot 100 as there are supporters some of these criticisms however are becoming less and less germane as digital downloads have revitalized the concept of “singles sales” the billboard charts have endured as the only widely circulated published report on songs that have been popular across the united states over the last halfcentury competing publications such as cash box record world radio records and most recently mediabase have offered alternate charts which sometimes differed widely use in media the hot 100 served for many years as the data source for the weekly radio countdown show american top 40 this relationship ended on november 30 1991 as american top 40 started using the airplayonly side of the hot 100 then called top 40 radio monitor the ongoing splintering of top 40 radio in the early 1990s led stations to lean into specific formats meaning that practically no station would play the wide array of genres that typically composed each weekly hot 100 chart similar charts a new chart the pop 100 was created by billboard in february 2005 to answer criticism that the hot 100 was biased in favor of rhythmic songs as throughout most of its existence the hot 100 was seen predominantly as a pop chart it was discontinued in june 2009 due to the charts becoming increasingly similar the canadian hot 100 was launched june 16 2007 like the hot 100 chart it uses sales and airplay tracking compiled by nielsen soundscan and bds11 the japan hot 100 was launched in the issue dated may 31 2008 using the same methodologies as the hot 100 charts for the us and canada
