to air a personal grievance against the future commanderinchief of the british army prince george duke of cambridge313 joseph moses levy the owner of the sunday times agreed to print the newspaper and the first edition was published on 29 june 1855 the paper cost 2d and was four pages long3 nevertheless the first edition stressed the quality and independence of its articles and journalists6 we shall be guided by a high tone of independent action however the paper was not a success and sleigh was unable to pay levy the printing bill13 levy took over the newspaper his aim being to produce a cheaper newspaper than his main competitors in london the daily news and the morning post to expand the size of the overall marketcitation needed levy appointed his son edward levylawson and thornton leigh hunt to edit the newspaper and relaunched it as the daily telegraph with the slogan the largest best and cheapest newspaper in the world14 hunt laid out the newspapers principles in a memorandum sent to levy we should report all striking events in science so told that the intelligent public can understand what has happened and can see its bearing on our daily life and our future the same principle should apply to all other events—to fashion to new inventions to new methods of conducting business15 in 1876 jules verne published his novel michael strogoff whose plot takes place during a fictional uprising and war in siberia verne included among the books characters a war correspondent of the daily telegraph named harry blount—who is depicted as an exceptionally dedicated resourceful and brave journalist taking great personal risks to follow closely the ongoing war and bring accurate news of it to the telegraphs readership ahead of competing papers16 in 1882 the daily telegraph moved to new fleet street premises which were pictured in the illustrated london news 1901 to 1945edit in 1908 kaiser wilhelm ii of germany gave a controversial interview to the daily telegraph that severely damaged anglogerman relations and added to international tensions in the buildup to world war i1718 in 1928 the son of baron burnham harry lawson webster levylawson 2nd baron burnham sold the paper to william berry 1st viscount camrose in partnership with his brother gomer berry 1st viscount kemsley and edward iliffe 1st baron iliffe in 1937 the newspaper absorbed the morning post which traditionally espoused a conservative position and sold predominantly amongst the retired officer class originally william ewart berry 1st viscount camrose bought the morning post with the intention of publishing it alongside the daily telegraph but poor sales of the former led him to merge the two for some years the paper was retitled the daily telegraph and morning post before it reverted to just the daily telegraph in the late 1930s victor gordon lennox the telegraphs diplomatic editor published an antiappeasement private newspaper the whitehall letter that received much of its information from leaks from sir robert vansittart the permanent undersecretary of the foreign office and rex leeper the foreign offices press secretary19 as an result gordon lennox was monitored by mi519 in 1939 the telegraph published clare hollingworths scoop that germany was to invade poland20 in november 1940 with fleet street subjected to almost daily bombing raids by the luftwaffe the telegraph started printing in manchester at kemsley house now the printworks entertainment venue which was run by camroses brother kemsley manchester quite often printed the entire run of the telegraph when its fleet street offices were under threat the name kemsley house was changed to thomson house in 1959 in 1986 printing of northern editions of the daily and sunday telegraph moved to trafford park and in 2008 to newsprinters at knowsley liverpool during the second world war the daily telegraph covertly helped in the recruitment of codebreakers for bletchley park the ability to solve the telegraphs crossword in under 12 minutes was considered to be a recruitment test the newspaper was asked to organise a crossword competition after which each of the successful participants was contacted and asked if they would be prepared to undertake a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort the competition itself was won by f h w hawes of dagenham who finished the crossword in less than eight minutes21 1946 to 1985edit both the camrose berry and burnham levylawson families remained involved in management until conrad black took control in 1986 on the death of his father in 1954 seymour berry 2nd viscount camrose assumed the chairmanship of the daily telegraph with his brother michael berry baron hartwell as his editorinchief during this period the company saw the launch of sister paper the sunday telegraph in 196022 1986 to 2004edit canadian businessman conrad black through companies controlled by him bought the telegraph group in 1986 black through his holding company ravelston corporation owned 78 of hollinger inc which in turn owned 30 of hollinger international hollinger international in turn owned the telegraph group and other publications such as the chicago suntimes the jerusalem post and the spectator on 18 january 2004 black was dismissed as chairman of the hollinger international board over allegations of financial wrongdoing black was also sued by the company later that day it was reported that the barclay brothers had agreed to purchase blacks 78 interest in hollinger inc for £245m giving them a controlling interest in the company and to buy out the minority shareholders later however a lawsuit was filed by the hollinger international board to try to block black from selling his shares in hollinger inc until an investigation into his dealings was completed black filed a countersuit but eventually united states judge leo strine sided with the hollinger international board and blocked black from selling his hollinger inc shares to the twins on 7 march 2004 the twins announced that they were launching another bid this time just for the daily telegraph and its sunday sister paper rather than all of hollinger inc currentwhen owner of the daily express richard desmond was also interested in purchasing the paper selling his interest in several pornographic magazines to finance the initiative desmond withdrew in march 2004 when the price climbed above £600m23 as did daily mail and general trust plc a few months later on 17 june24 2004 to presentedit in november 2004 the telegraph

lessexperienced staff and search engine optimisers28 on 10 september 2014 the telegraph media group advertised in the daily telegraph for a new head of interactive journalism stating candidates should have demonstrable interest in news and journalism previous newsroom experience is not needed however29 political stanceedit the daily telegraph has been politically conservative in modern times30 the personal links between the papers editors and the leadership of the conservative party along with the papers generally rightwing stance and influence over conservative activists have resulted in the paper commonly being referred to especially in private eye as the torygraph30 even when conservative support was shown to have slumped in the opinion polls and labour gained the ascendant particularly when leader tony blair rebranded the party as new labour on becoming leader after the death of john smith in 1994 the newspaper remained loyal to the conservatives this loyalty continued after labour ousted the conservatives from power by a election result in 1997 and in the face of labour election wins in 2001 and the third successive labour election win in 2005 when the barclay brothers purchased the telegraph group for around £665m in late june 2004 sir david barclay suggested that the daily telegraph might no longer be the house newspaper of the conservatives in the future in an interview with the guardian he said where the government are right we shall support them the editorial board endorsed the conservative party in the 2005 general election during the 2014 scottish independence referendum the paper supported the better together no campaign31323334 alex salmond the former leader of the snp called the telegraph extreme on question time in september 201535 sister

site were matthew doull and saul klein and the then marketing manager of the daily telegraph hugo drayton and the webmaster fiona carter drayton later became managing director of the newspaper an early coup for the site was the publication of articles by ambrose evanspritchard on bill clinton and the whitewater controversy the availability of the articles online brought a large american audience to the site in 1997 the clinton administration issued a 331page report that accused evanspritchard of peddling rightwing inventions derek bishton who by then had succeeded rooney as editor later wrote in the days before et it would have been highly unlikely that anyone in the us would have been aware of evanspritchards work – and certainly not to the extent that the white house would be forced to issue such a lengthy rebuttal48 bishton who later became consulting editor for telegraph media group was followed as editor by richard burton who was made redundant in august 2006 edward

arm of the newspaper because of commercial interests12 professor jay rosen at new york university stated that obornes resignation statement was one of the most important things a journalist has written about journalism lately12 oborne cited other instances of advertising strategy influencing the content of articles linking the refusal to take an editorial stance on the repression of democratic demonstrations in hong kong to the telegraphs support from china additionally he said that favourable reviews of the cunard cruise liner queen mary ii appeared in the telegraph noting on 10 may last year the telegraph ran a long feature on cunards queen mary ii liner on the news review page this episode looked to many like a plug for an advertiser on a page normally dedicated to serious news analysis i again checked and certainly telegraph competitors did not view cunards liner as a major news story cunard is an important telegraph advertiser11 in response the telegraph called obornes statement an astonishing and unfounded attack full of inaccuracy and innuendo12 in january 2017 the telegraph media group had a higher number of upheld complaints than any other uk newspaper
