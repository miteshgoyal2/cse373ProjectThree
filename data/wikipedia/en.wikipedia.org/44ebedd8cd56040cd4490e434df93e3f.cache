surveillance capitalism from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search surveillance capitalism is a term used and popularized by academic shoshana zuboff that denotes a new genus of capitalism that monetizes data acquired through surveillance123 according to zuboff surveillance capitalism emerged due to the coupling of the vast powers of the digital with the radical indifference and intrinsic narcissism of the financial capitalism and its neoliberal vision that have dominated commerce for at least three decades especially in the anglo economies2 and depends on the global architecture of computer mediation which produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power she calls big other4 she states it was first discovered and consolidated at google being to surveillance capitalism what ford and general motors were to massproduction and managerial capitalism a century ago and later adopted by facebook and others2 and that it uses illegible mechanisms of extraction commodification and control of behavior to produce new markets of behavioral prediction and modification4 zuboff states that the online world which used to be kind of our world is now where capitalism is developing in new ways5 by data extraction rather than the production of new goods thus generating intense concentrations of power over extraction and threatening core values such as freedom6 and privacy2 contents 1 background 2 key features 3 countermeasures and solutions 4 see also 5 references 6 further reading 7 external links backgroundedit economic pressures of capitalism are driving the intensification of connection and monitoring online with spaces of social life becoming open to saturation by corporate actors directed at the making of profit andor the regulation of action6 relevantly6 turow writes that centrality of corporate power is a direct reality at the very heart of the digital age7 capitalism has become focused on expanding the proportion of social life that is open to data collection and data processing6 this may come with significant implications for vulnerability and control of society as well as for privacy however increased data collection may also have various advantages for individuals and society such as selfoptimization quantified self6 societal optimizations such as by smart cities and new or optimized services such as various google applications still collecting and processing data in the context of capitalisms core profitmaking motive might present an inherent danger zuboff contrasts mass production of industrial capitalism with surveillance capitalism with the former being interdependent with its populations who were its consumers and employees and the latter preying on dependent populations who are neither its consumers nor its employees and largely ignorant of its procedures2 she notes that surveillance capitalism reaches beyond the conventional institutional terrain of the private firm and accumulates not only surveillance assets and capital but also rights and operates without meaningful mechanisms of consent2 surveillance is changing power structures in the information economy8 this might present a further power shift beyond the nationstate and towards a form of corporatocracycitation needed oliver stone creator of the film snowden pointed to the locationbased game pokémon go as the latest sign of the emerging phenomenon of surveillance capitalism91011 in 2014 vincent mosco referred to the marketing of information about customers and subscribers to advertisers surveillance capitalism and makes note of the surveillance state alongside it12 christian fuchs found that the surveillance state fuses with surveillance capitalism13 similarly zuboff informs that the issue is further complicated by highly invisible collaborative arrangements with state security apparatuses14 according to trebor scholz companies recruit people as informants for this type of capitalism15 key featuresedit zuboff identifies four key features in the logic of surveillance capitalism and explicitly follows the four key features identified by googles chief economist hal varian16better source needed the drive toward more and more data extraction and analysis the development of new contractual forms using computermonitoring and automation the desire to personalize and customize the services offered to users of digital platforms the use of the technological infrastructure to carry out continual experiments on its users and consumers countermeasures and solutionsedit numerous organizations have been struggling for free speech and privacy rights in the new surveillance capitalism17 and various national governments have enacted privacy laws it is also conceivable that new capabilities and usages for masssurveillance require structural changes towards a new system to occur to prevent misuse zuboff compares demanding privacy from surveillance capitalists or lobbying for an end to commercial surveillance on the internet to asking henry ford to make each model t by hand and states that such demands are existential threats that violate the basic mechanisms of the entitys survival2 zuboff warns that principles of selfdetermination might forfeit due to ignorance learned helplessness inattention inconvenience habituation or drift and states that we tend to rely on mental models vocabularies and tools distilled from past catastrophes referring to the twentieth centurys totalitarian nightmares or the monopolistic predations of gilded age capitalism with countermeasures that have been developed to fight those earlier threats not being sufficient or even appropriate for the novel challenges2 she also poses the question will we be the masters of information or will we be its slaves and states that if the digital future is to be our home then it is we who must make it so18 see alsoedit 2017 broadband consumer privacy proposal repeal
