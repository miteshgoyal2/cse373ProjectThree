diamond was born in brooklyn new york to a jewish family descended from russian and polish immigrants his parents were rose née rapaport and akeeba kieve diamond a drygoods merchant34 he grew up in several homes in brooklyn having also spent four years in cheyenne wyoming where his father was stationed in the army5 in brooklyn he attended erasmus hall high school6 and was a member of the freshman chorus and choral club along with classmate barbra streisand4155 they were not close friends at the time diamond recalls we were two poor kids in brooklyn we hung out in the front of erasmus high and smoked cigarettes7 after his family moved he then attended abraham lincoln high school89 and was a member of the fencing team5 for his 16th birthday he received his first guitar10 when he was 16 and still in high school diamond spent a number of weeks at surprise lake camp1121 a camp for jewish children in upstate new york when folk singer pete seeger performed a small concert12 seeing the widely recognized singer perform and watching other children singing songs for seeger that they wrote themselves had an immediate effect on diamond who then became aware of the possibility of writing his own songs and the next thing i got a guitar when we got back to brooklyn started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs he said12 he adds that his attraction to songwriting was the first real interest he had growing up besides helping him release his youthful frustrations12 diamond also used his newlydeveloping skill at writing lyrics to write poetry by writing poems for girls he was attracted to in school he soon learned it often won their hearts his male classmates took note and began asking him to write poems for them which they would sing and use with equal success410 he spent the summer following his graduation as a waiter in the catskills resort area there he first met jaye posner who would years later become his wife1126 diamond next attended new york university as a premed major on a fencing scholarshipa his skill at fencing made him a member of the 1960 ncaa mens championship team13 however he was often bored in classes and found writing song lyrics more to his liking he began cutting classes and taking the train up to tin pan alley where he tried to get some of his songs heard by local music publishers12 by his senior year and just 10 units short of graduation sunbeam music publishing offered him a 16week job writing songs for 50 a week us396 in 2016 dollars14 and he dropped out of college to accept it12b careeredit the 1960sedit after his 16 weeks at sunbeam music were up he was not rehired and then began writing and singing his own songs for demo purposes i never really chose songwriting he says it just absorbed me and became more and more important in my life12 diamonds first recording contract was billed as neil and jack an everly brotherstype duo comprising diamond and high school friend jack parker5 they recorded two unsuccessful singles you are my love at last bw what will i do and im afraid bw till youve tried love both released in 1962 later in 1962 diamond signed with the columbia records label as a solo performer columbia released the single at night bw clown town in july 1963 which billboard gave an excellent review but it still failed to chart columbia dropped him from their label and he was back to writing songs in and out of publishing houses for the next seven years he did songwriting wherever he could including on buses and used an upright piano above the birdland club in new york city one of the causes of this early nomadic life as a songwriter was due to his songs having too many words id spent a lot of time on lyrics and they were looking for hooks and i didnt really understand the nature of that he says12 during those lean years he was only able to sell about one song a week barely enough to survive on he found himself only earning enough to spend 35 cents a day on food us3 in 2016 dollars1412 however the privacy he had above the birdland club allowed him to focus on writing without distractions as he explained something new began to happen i wasnt under the gun and suddenly interesting songs began to happen songs that had things none of the others did12 among them were cherry cherry and solitary man solitary man was the first record that diamond recorded in his own name that made the charts it remains one of his personal alltime favorites as it was autobiographical about his early years as a songwriter even though he failed to realize it at the time it wasnt until years later when i went into freudian analysis that i understood that it was me it was an outgrowth of my despair437 diamond spent his early career as a songwriter in the brill building his first success as a songwriter came in november 1965 with sunday and me a top 20 hit for jay and the americans greater success as a writer followed with im a believer a little bit me a little bit you look out here comes tomorrow and love to love all performed by the monkees diamond wrote and recorded the songs for himself but the cover versions were released before his own16 the unintended but happy consequence was that diamond began to gain fame not only as a singer and performer but also as a songwriter im a believer became a gold record within two days of its release and stayed at the top of the charts for seven weeks making it the popular music song of the year in 1966444 and the grass wont pay no mind brought covers from elvis presley who also interpreted sweet caroline and mark lindsay former lead singer for paul revere the raiders other notable artists who recorded his early songs were the english hardrock band deep purple lulu and cliff richardc in 1966 diamond signed a deal with bert bernss bang records then a subsidiary of atlantic his first release on that label solitary man became his first true hit as a solo artistd diamond later followed with cherry cherry and kentucky woman437 his early concerts saw him as a special guest of or opening for everyone from hermans hermits to on one occasion the who445 as a guest performer with the who he was shocked to see pete townshend swinging his guitar like a club and then throwing it against walls and off the stage until the instruments neck broke it was the first time he had seen a band beating up their instruments and amplifiers until they were smashed to pieces446 diamond began to feel restricted by bang records because he wanted to record more ambitious introspective music like his autobiographical brooklyn roads from 1968 berns wanted to release kentucky woman as a single but diamond was no longer satisfied writing simple pop songs so he proposed that shilo which was not about the civil war but rather an imaginary childhood friend while bang believed that the song wasnt commercial enough so it was relegated to being an lp track on just for you in addition to being dissatisfied with his royalties diamond tried to sign with another record label after discovering a loophole in his contract that did not bind him exclusively to either web iv or tallyrand but the result was a series of lawsuits that coincided with a slump in his record sales and professional success a magistrate refused web ivs request for a temporary injunction to prevent diamond from joining another record company while his contract dispute continued in court but the lawsuits persisted until february 18 1977 when he triumphed in court and purchased the rights to his bangera master tapes45118 move to uni records revived success and the 1970sedit on march 18 1968 diamond signed a deal with uni records18 this label was named after universal pictures whose owner mca inc later consolidated its labels into mca records the label is now called universal records his debut album for uni was velvet gloves and spit produced by tom catalano which did not chart at all and he recorded the followup brother loves traveling salvation show at american sound studios in memphis with tommy cogbill and chips moman producing18 in late 1969 he moved to los angeles after brother loves travelling salvation show in february 1969 his sound mellowed with such songs as sweet caroline 1969 holly holy 1969 cracklin rosie 1970 and song sung blue 1972 the last two reaching no 1 on the hot 100 sweet caroline was diamonds first major hit after his slump diamond stated in 2007 that he had written sweet caroline for caroline kennedy after seeing her on the cover of life in an equestrian riding outfit19 however in 2014 he said in an interview on the today show that it was written for his then wife marcia he could not find a good rhyme with the name marcia and therefore used the name caroline2021 it took him just one hour in a memphis hotel to write and compose it the 1971 release i ami said was a top 5 hit in both the us and uk and was his most intensely personal effort to date taking upwards of four months to complete22 in 1971 diamond played 7 soldout concerts at the greek theater in los angeles the outdoor theater which was noted for showcasing the best of current entertainers added a stereo sound system for the first time diamond was also backed by a 35piece string orchestra and six backing singers486 after the first night one leading newspaper called it the finest concert in greek theater history487 i have a lovehate relationship with songwriting i love it because its so satisfyingwhen it works i hate it because it forces you to dig inside yourself it is without question the most difficult thing i do performing on the other hand is the most joyful and happiest thing i do the bigger the audience the more anticipation the more excitement neil diamond 197723 the following august 1972 he played again at the greek this time doing 10 shows when the show was first announced all tickets at the 5000seat theater sold out rapidly493 he added a quadrophonic sound system for his performance to create full surroundsound diamond recalled hot august night captures a very special show for me we went all out to really knock em dead in la493 the august 24 performance was recorded and released as the live double album hot august night hot august night demonstrates diamonds skills as a performer and showman as he reinvigorated his back catalogue of hits with new energy many consider it his best work critic stephen thomas erlewine called hot august night the ultimate neil diamond record which shows diamond the icon in full glory24 the album became a classic and was remastered in 2000 with additional selections in australia which at the time had the most neil diamond fans per capita of any country494 the album ranked no 1 for 29 weeks and stayed in their top 20 bestsellers for two years49425 in the fall of 1972 diamond performed for 20 consecutive nights at the winter garden theater in new york city495 the last occasion when that historical theater had staged any oneman shows had been when al jolson had performed there in the 1920s and the 1930s495 the small approximately 1600seat broadway venue provided an intimate concert setting not common at the time with every performance reportedly sold out495 it also made diamond the first rockera star to headline on broadway495 the review in the new york times stated neil diamonds oneman show seemed on the face of it to be a brash idea oneman shows have traditionally been associated with talents like judy garland and danny kaye but mr diamond is clearly a brash young man and one with both the musical track record and the performance macho to bring it offhe neednt worry about comparisons with the likes of garland and kaye495 after the winter garden shows however diamond announced that he needed a break and he engaged in no more live performances till 1976 he used those four years to work on the score for hall bartletts film version of richard bachs jonathan livingston seagull and to record two albums serenade and beautiful noise he said years later i knew id come back but i wasnt sure when i spent one year on each of those albumsid been on the road six years i had a son 2½ and i felt he needed me more than the audience did so for four years i devoted myself to my son jesse he also said he needed to get back to having a private life one where he could be anonymous23 in 1973 diamond switched labels again returning to columbia records for a milliondollaradvanceperalbum contract us5395052 in 2016 dollars1418 his first project released as a solo album was the soundtrack to hall bartletts film version of jonathan livingston seagull the film received hostile reviews and did poorly at the box office and the album grossed more than the film did richard d bach author of the bestselling source story disowned the film and both he and diamond sued director bartlett though for differing reasons in bachs case it was because he felt the film omitted too much from the original novella whereas in diamonds case it was because he felt the film had butchered his score after jonathan diamond declared i vowed never to get involved in a movie again unless i had complete control bartlett angrily responded to diamonds lawsuit by criticizing his music as having become too slickand its not as much from his heart as it used to be however bartlett also added neil is extraordinarily talented often his arrogance is just a cover for the lonely and insecure person underneath26 despite the controversy surrounding the film the soundtrack was a success peaking at no 2 on the billboard albums chart diamond would also garner a golden globe award for best original score and a grammy award for best score soundtrack album for a motion picture18 from there diamond would
