1838 as the bombay times and journal of commerce1011 the paper published wednesdays and saturdays under the direction of raobahadur narayan dinanath velkar a maharashtrian reformist and contained news from britain and the world as well as the indian subcontinent je brennan was its first editor1213 in 1850 it began to publish daily editions in 1860 editor robert knight 1825–1892 bought the indian shareholders interests merged with rival bombay standard and started indias first news agency it wired times dispatches to papers across the country and became the indian agent for reuters news service in 1861 he changed the name from the bombay times and standard to the times of india knight fought for a press free of prior restraint or intimidation frequently resisting the attempts by governments business interests and cultural spokesmen and led the paper to national prominence1415 in the 19th century this newspaper company employed more than 800 people and had a sizeable circulation in india and europe bennett and coleman ownershipedit subsequently the times of india saw its ownership change several times until 1892 when thomas bennett and frank morris coleman who later drowned in the 1915 sinking of the ss persia acquired the newspaper through their new company bennett coleman co ltd dalmiya ownershipedit sir stanley reed edited the times of india from 1907 until 1924 and received correspondence from the major figures of india such as mahatma gandhi in all he lived in india for fifty years he was respected in the united kingdom as an expert on indian current affairs he christened jaipur as the pink city of india bennett coleman co ltd was sold to sugar magnate ramkrishna dalmia of the thenfamous industrial family the dalmiyas for rs 20 million in 1946 as india was becoming independent and the british owners were leaving16 in 1955 the vivian bose commission of inquiry found that ramkrishna dalmia in 1947 had engineered the acquisition of the media giant bennett coleman co by transferring money from a bank and an insurance company of which he was the chairman in the court case that followed ramkrishna dalmia was sentenced to two years in tihar jail after having been convicted of embezzlement and fraud17 but for most of the jail term he managed to spend in hospital upon his release his soninlaw sahu shanti prasad jain to whom he had entrusted the running of bennett coleman co ltd rebuffed his efforts to resume command of the company1718 jain family shanti prasad jainedit in the early 1960s shanti prasad jain was imprisoned on charges of selling newsprint on the black market1920 and based on the vivian bose commissions earlier report which found wrongdoings of the dalmia – jain group that included specific charges against shanti prasad jain the government of india filed a petition to restrain and remove the management of bennett coleman and company based on the pleading justice directed the government to assume control of the newspaper which resulted in replacing half of the directors and appointing a bombay now mumbai high court judge as the chairman under the government of indiaedit following the vivian bose commission report indicating serious wrongdoings of the dalmia–jain group on 28 august 1969 the bombay high court under justice j l nain passed an interim order to disband the existing board of bennett coleman and to constitute a new board under the government the bench ruled that under these circumstances the best thing would be to pass such orders on the assumption that the allegations made by the petitioners that the affairs of the company were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest and to the interests of the company are correct21 following that order shanti prasad jain ceased to be a director and the company ran with new directors on board appointed by the government of india with the exception of a lone stenographer of the jains curiously the court appointed d k kunte as chairman of the board kunte had no prior business experience and was also an opposition member of the lok sabha back to the jain familyedit in 1976 during the emergency in india the government transferred ownership of the newspaper back to ashok kumar jain sahu shanti prasad jains son ramkrishna dalmias grandson and the father of samir jain and vineet jain22 the jains too often landed themselves in various money laundering scams and ashok kumar jain had to flee the country when the enforcement directorate pursued his case strongly in 1998 for alleged violations of illegal transfer of funds to the tune of us125 million to an overseas account in switzerland23242526 during the emergencyedit on 26 june 1975 the day after india declared a state of emergency the bombay edition of the times of india carried an entry in its obituary column that read dem ocracy beloved husband of truth father of libertie brother of faith hope and justice expired on 25 june27 the
