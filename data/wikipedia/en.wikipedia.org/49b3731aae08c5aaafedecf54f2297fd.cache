which usually also includes a local forecast and in large and midsized markets a brief traffic report and local advertisements although the show provides additional segments for those affiliates who do not provide such a news insert certain nbc affiliates that produce an additional morning newscast for a sister station or digital subchannel may pretape the local inserts aired during the first one

occupied by the christies auction house just down the block from the presentday studio the first set placed a functional newsroom in the studio which garroway called the nerve center of the world the barrier between backstage and onstage was virtually nonexistent garroway and the onair staff often walked through the newsroom set glimpses of the camera crew and technicians were a frequent occurrence as were offscreen voices conversing with garroway gradually machines and personnel were placed behind the scenes to assemble the news and weather reports and the newsroom was gone by 1955 today is broadcast from studio 1a in 10 rockefeller center to the left of the ge building in the summer of 1958 television manufacturer philco complained to nbc that staging today in a studio explicitly called the rca exhibition hall was unfair rca owned nbc at the time the network bowed to the pressure and on july 7 1958 today moved across the street to studio 3k in the rca building where it remained through the early 1960s on july 9 1962 the program returned to a streetside studio in the space then occupied by the florida showcase each day the today production crew would have to move the floridarelated tourism merchandise off the floor and wheel in the today news set desks chairs and cameras when the show wrapped at 900 am eastern time the news set would be put away and the tourism merchandise returned to the floor after three years in the florida showcase today moved back to the rca building on september 13 1965 the network converted its news programming to allcolor broadcasts at that time and nbc could not justify allocating four thenexpensive color cameras to the florida showcase studio for the next 20 years the show occupied a series of studios on the third sixth and eighth floors of nbcs headquarters most notably studio 3k in the 1970s studio 8g adjacent to studio 8h home to saturday night live in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally studio 3b

renovation to prepare for the upgrade to highdefinition broadcasts after the departure of katie couric and while a new set was readied during the summer of 2006 the program was broadcast from a temporary outdoor studio in rockefeller plaza the same set that nbc used at the olympic games since 20048 during the week of august 28 2006 the show was moved to a temporary location outside of studio 1a because mtv was converting the outdoor studio into their red carpet booth for the 2006 mtv video music awards a mock set was set up in datelines studio which was also used during inclement weather the program also used a temporary outdoor set at 30 rock and msnbcs countdown with keith olbermann which joined at studio 1a in 30 rock on october 22 2007 on september 13 2006 today moved back into the revamped studio 1a space the new studio was divided into five different sections on the lower level including an interview area the couch area the news desk the performanceinterviewextra space area and home base which is where the anchors start the show a gigantic panasonic 103inch plasma monitor is often used for graphic display backgrounds a kitchen set is located upstairs from the main studio the blue background that is seen in the opening of the show in home base moves up and down to allow a view of the outside from the home base some minor changes were implemented throughout the early and middle part of 2013 not only in the way that things are presented but also with modified graphics and minor updates to the set that year a new larger anchor desk was introduced with space to seat all four main anchors guthrie lauer morales and roker the new desk brought an end to the news desk as the third news reader morales now sits at the main anchor desk other minor changes included a new larger desk for the third hour after the august 16 2013 broadcast the program vacated studio 1a while the space underwent a remodeling with a more modern look with as stated by executive producer don nash a lot more bells and whistles to play with on september 16 2013 today debuted a new set and graphics package it was originally set to debut on september 9 but was delayed one week to complete final design details9 the home base is located on a platform that can spin 360° therefore allowing the view and direction of the camera to change depending on the halfhour a new couch and background was added in the sofa area where the anchors sit and discuss topics a social media area known as the orange room was also added to studio 1a which contains screens that display twitter comments or trending topics10 carson daly was hired to present segments from the room during the broadcast11 six screens that also connect to one 6 x 16 screen were added in the fashionspecial topic area during its first two days of use the show transitioned away from its news and entertainment format to a format that emphasized the social interaction of the anchors roker and newsreader the graphics were also overhauled with introduction of the new set a slightly modified version of this package and the revised logo debuted on early today that november further integrating the earlymorning news programs branding with today the logotopeacock animation was moved from the left corner to the bottom right side corner of the screen the logo that was first previewed on september 13 2013 pared down

as communicators creator pat weaver envisioned a person whose responsibilities would go beyond the bounds of traditional sitdown news anchors the communicator would interview report moderate dialogue and generally tie the show together into a coherent whole12 garroway and his successors have all followed that model with little variation today the hosts are expected to do much the same and on any given day will talk with correspondents newsmakers and lifestyle experts introduce and close each halfhour conduct special segments such as cooking or fashion and go onassignment to host the program

inception the idea of providing the latest news headlines has been critical to the function of the program in that vein there has always been at least one person on set whose job it is to prepare and deliver newscasts in 1952 that person was called the news editor or informally news chief in modern parlance the term newsreader or news anchor is preferred under the twohour format four newscasts were delivered once every halfhour presently there are only two newscasts delivered at the top of each of the first two hours some anchors including jim fleming lew wood floyd kalber and john palmer

a big chalkboard map of the united states based on information gathered earlier in the morning from the us weather bureau in washington dc subsequent hosts john chancellor and hugh downs dropped the chalkboard weather map concept and instead read a prepared weather summary over a still image of a weather map when the show converted to allcolor broadcasts in 1965 weather maps were prepared and projected on a screen behind frank blair who delivered the forecast immediately after his news summaries15 following blairs retirement on march 14 1975 lew wood took over the newsreader and weather

news at sunrise replaced john palmer at the today newsdesk at which point he assumed her previous role on sunrise she also began substituting for tom brokaw on nbc nightly news shortly after norvilles appointment as todays news anchor the decision was made to feature her as an unofficial third host whereas palmer had read the news from a desk separate from where gumbel and pauley sat norville was seated alongside the programs hosts at the opening and closing of every show before long gossip columns and media observers predicted that nbc would remove jane pauley from the program and replace her with norville in an effort to improve the programs recently declining viewership among young women the demographic most coveted by morning shows20 during this period saturday night live featured a sketch titled all about deborah norville a takeoff on the classic film all about eve which depicted norville as ruthlessly scheming to take pauleys place as today cohost in october 1989 it was announced that 13year veteran pauley would leave today at the end of the year21 nbc as expected announced that norville would become cohost an emotional norville hugged pauley on the air after the announcement was made and many at the network hoped the negative press generated by norvilles increased presence on the program would end however this turned out not to be the case prior to the announcement of pauleys departure much of the criticism had focused on norvilles youth and beauty with many branding her the other woman and a home wrecker in a reference to what some felt seemed like her intent on breaking up the television marriage of gumbel and pauley22 the negative press only heightened after the announcement of pauleys resignation and norville was put under a gag order by nbc brass which prevented her from defending herself from the widespread and erroneous reports that she somehow orchestrated her rise on today in january 1990 the new anchor team of bryant gumbel and

to rival abcs good morning america gma by the end of 1990 today the longtime dominant program was officially the secondplace morning show behind gma and most of the blame was pinned on norville by the outbreak of the persian gulf war in 1991 norville saw her role as cohost continually minimized today aired special editions of the program called america at war with gumbel anchoring most of the show alone it was not uncommon for norville not even to appear until the twohour shows second halfhour in addition she was directed not to initiate conversation on the show and only speak when asked a question by gumbel norville left the show for maternity leave in february 1991 it was announced that katie couric would substitute cohost during norvilles absence ratings for the program rose immediately following norvilles departure and courics arrival23 midway though her maternity leave norville was interviewed by people in the story she avoided conversation about her recent trouble on today and instead focused on her newborn baby boy she was photographed breastfeeding her son a seemingly innocuous event but nbc management was said to be greatly displeased by this believing the photo to be in poor taste by april 1991 in light of improved ratings on today and nbcs displeasure at the people photograph it was announced that norville would not return to today and that katie

after the shooting of florida teenager trayvon martin today ran a selectively edited version of the 911 call that george zimmerman made prior to shooting and killing martin which he defended as being committed in self defense while standing trial for the shooting for which he was acquitted on charges of murder in july 2013 which had the effect of making zimmerman appear racist in a march 2012 edition of the program today played a recording of zimmerman saying this guy looks like hes up to no good he looks black however several seconds of the call were cut from the 911 tape removing zimmermans description of martin and a question asked to him about the teenager by the 911 operator in the original unedited tape zimmerman said this guy looks like hes up to no good or hes on drugs or something its raining and hes just walking around looking about the operator then asked ok and this guy – is he black white or hispanic to which zimmerman answered he looks black the washington post wrote that todays alteration would more readily paint zimmerman as a racial profiler in realitys version zimmerman simply answered a question about the race of the person whom he was reporting to the police nothing prejudicial at all in responding to such an inquiry its a falsehood with repercussions much of the public discussion over the past week has settled on how conflicting facts and interpretations call into question whether zimmerman acted justifiably or criminally to portray that exchange in a way that wrongs zimmerman is high editorial malpractice26 following an internal investigation into the production of the segment nbc news fired two employees that were involved in the piece including a producer based at the divisions miami bureau in april 201227 in december 2012 george zimmerman filed a defamation lawsuit against nbc for the editing of the 911 call florida circuit court judge debra nelson dismissed the suit on june 30 2014 citing that there were no genuine issues of material fact upon which a reasonable jury could find that the defendants nbcuniversal acted with actual malice but although zimmerman could not prove that he was the victim of actual malice stated that the malice standard was appropriate since zimmerman is a public figure28 curry to guthrieedit nbc revealed on june 28 2012 that ann curry would no longer cohost today and would continue to

final show as coanchor was subdued compared to the earlier departures of katie couric and meredith vieira as it did not include retrospectives of currys 15year run on the program or goodbye messages from colleagues and celebrities although curry – seated alongside lauer natalie morales and al roker in the couch area of the studio 1a set – gave a tearfilled farewell message to viewers3031 rumors of currys departure from today began weeks before nbc formally announced that she would no longer be cohost spurring negative press similar to that resulting from the departure of jane pauley and her replacement by deborah norville 23 years earlier as since disproven reports suggested that matt lauer had a hand in the programs decision to let curry go323334 viewership declines for the program that began in the months following curry becoming cohost precipitated in part due to public criticism over lauers alleged involvement in currys departure loyal viewers once again began turning to the competing good morning america which toppled todays 16year consecutive run as the toprated morning news program during the week of april 9 201211 the public relations problems for lauer that resulted from the accusations led thenexecutive producer jim bell to admit responsibility for the negative press in defense of lauer in a series of interviews with the new york times the hollywood reporter and the associated press353637 911 moment of silence omissionedit on september 11 2012 today sparked outrage after the program neglected to cut away from an interview with keeping up with the kardashians

united states that did not interrupt regular programming to broadcast the moment of silence live while the coverage of the ceremonies was not seen on the nbc network feed in most of the country the

400 am eastern time with an updated telecast for viewers in the pacific time zone and on tape delay until 1000 am eastern – corresponding with the start time of today in the pacific time zone – to

saturday broadcast airs for two hours the weekend broadcasts continue the today format of covering breaking news interviews with newsmakers reports on a variety of popularculture and humaninterest stories covering health and finance issues and national weather reports nbc feeds the saturday edition from 700 to 900 am and the sunday edition from 800 to 900 am both in the eastern time zone although many of the networks affiliates air local newscasts in those time slots and carry the network broadcast earlier or later in the morning many nbc affiliates also bookend the sunday edition with local morning newscasts that immediately precede and follow the program nbcs new york city chicago san francisco and los angeles ownedandoperated stations air weekend today simultaneously but not live at 900 am eastern 800 am central and 600 am pacific time weekend editions are tailored to the priorities and interests of weekend viewers – offering special series such as saturday today on the plaza featuring live performances by major music acts and broadway theatrical productions outside the studio throughout the summer during the networks coverage of the olympic games the weekday anchors and staff present the majority of the program on both saturday and sunday throughout the two weeks to maintain promotional momentum with limited contributions from the weekend team from new york later

same anchors as that portion of the broadcast separate anchors began to be used for the third hour over time with only the news anchor ann curry until 2011 then natalie morales and the weather anchor al roker being shared with the main 700 to 900 am block – this was particularly the case during instances where matt lauer andor his cohost katie couric then meredith vieira from 2006 to 2011 ann curry from 2011 to 2012 and finally savannah guthrie during the final months of the original format could not be present for the entire hour due to reporting assignments or personal commitments vieira

dave garroway selected les browns sentimental journey as the programs original theme music which was used during garroways entire run from 1952 to 1961 in 1962 when hugh downs became host django reinhardts melodie au crepuscule was chosen as the new theme it was replaced in 1963 by misty an instrumental ballad composed by erroll garner and performed by bobby hackett and john b seng51 misty served as todays theme until 1971 when nbc news correspondent frank mcgee joined the show composer ray ellis penned an entirely new instrumental theme entitled this is today a jazzy uptempo piece that served as the programs main theme until 1978 because this is today closely resembled stephen schwartzs song day by day from the musical godspell schwartz successfully sued for copyright infringement52 this is today was revised as a result with the second version of the piece incorporating the familiar nbc chime signature was used until 1981 at the close of the tom brokaw–jane pauley era51 the chimes were also used throughout the program to introduce and conclude segments usually in combination with the familiar today sunburst logo by the time bryant gumbel was appointed coanchor of the program in 1982 a new version of ellis this is today theme was introduced using a looser more relaxed arrangement that continued to feature the nbc chimes in its melody a shorter arrangement of this is today was used for the show open featuring a rotating globe and the today sunburst from 1983 to 1985 the main theme was used until 1985 and due to its popularity with viewers was resurrected as the shows secondary theme in january 1993 the 1982 theme later served as the programs official anniversary music used to open and close retrospective segments in the leadup to todays 60th anniversary in

nightly news with tom brokaw williams also composed two themes for today an opening fanfare for the program that was derived from the opening of the mission and a twominute closing theme for the show entitled scherzo for today a dramatic arrangement that made heavy use of strings and flutes in the late 1980s scherzo was played in its entirety multiple times daily during the weather scrolls that ran during local commercial breaks however most nbc affiliates preempted these segments with locally slotted advertising the new today themes – used in tandem with the shows new opening sequence featuring the statue of liberty and a new living room studio set – gave the program a distinctly modern look and sound beginning in september 1985 a series of williamspenned bumpers featuring the mission signature were also used to open and close segments scherzo for today was used as the programs closing theme until 1990 and the mission bumpers were used until 1993 one of them could be heard as a station break leadin on nbcs meet the press until 2004 meanwhile williams opening fanfare had opened the program ever since its 1985 introduction with two brief interruptions new opening themes were briefly introduced and quickly discarded in the summer of 1994 to mark the debut of studio 1a and in 2004 the fanfare was iconically accompanied by fred facey announcing from nbc news this is today… with anchor and anchor with live from studio 1a in rockefeller plaza being added to the introduction on june 20 1994 when the show moved to its new studio although facey died in april 2003 his introduction of the couric–lauer team was used for the duration of courics era except for special editions requiring special introductions weekend today announcer les marshak became the new voice of the weekday program on september 13 200653 a lighter theme employing the nbc chimes was used to open the shows 730 through 930 am halfhour segments and was also used as a closing theme in march 2013
