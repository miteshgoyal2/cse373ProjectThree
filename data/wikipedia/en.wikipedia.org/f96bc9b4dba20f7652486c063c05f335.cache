anglicisation of the native malay name for the country singapura which was in turn derived from sanskrit7 सिंहपुर iast siṃhapura siṃha is lion pura is town or city hence the customary reference to the nation as the lion city and its inclusion in many of the nations symbols eg its coat of arms merlion emblem however it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island sang nila utama the srivijayan prince said to have founded and named the island singapura perhaps saw a malayan tiger there are however other suggestions for the origin of the name and scholars do not believe that the origin of the name to be firmly established89 the central island has also been called pulau ujong as far back as the third century ce literally island at the end of the malay peninsula in malay1011 besides the lion city a translation of its ancient sanskrit name singapore is also referred to as garden city for its treelined streets and greening efforts since independence1213 and the little red dot for how the

writing found on the island at rocky point at the mouth of singapore river inscribed with an indic script c 10th to 13th century17 the grecoroman astronomer ptolemy 90–168 identified a place called sabana in the general area in the second century18 and the earliest written record of singapore occurs in a chinese account from the third century describing the island of pu luo chung 蒲 罗 中 this was itself a transliteration from the malay name pulau ujong or island at the end of the malay peninsula19 the nagarakretagama a javanese epic poem written in 1365 referred to a settlement on the island called tumasik possibly meaning sea town20 in 1299 according to the malay annals the kingdom of singapura was founded on the island by sang nila utama21 although the historicity of the accounts as given in the malay annals is the subject of academic debates22 it is nevertheless known from various documents that singapore in the 14th century then known as temasek was a trading port under the influence of both the majapahit empire and the siamese kingdoms23 inside indosphere24252627 of greater india28293029 these indianized kingdoms a term coined by george cœdès were characterized by surprising resilience political integrity and administrative stability31 historical sources also indicate that around the end of the 14th century its ruler parameswara was attacked by either the majapahit or the siamese forcing him to move on to melaka where he founded the sultanate of malacca32 archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on fort canning was abandoned around this time although a small trading settlement continued in singapore for some time afterwards8 in 1613 portuguese raiders burned down the settlement and the island faded into obscurity for the next two centuries33 by then singapore was nominally part of the johor sultanate34 the wider maritime region and much trade was under dutch control for the following period british colonisation main articles founding of modern singapore and singapore in the straits settlements 1825 survey map singapores free port trade was at singapore river for 150 years fort canning hill centre was home to its ancient and early colonial rulers raffles arrived in singapore on 28 january 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port the island was then nominally ruled by the sultan of johor who was controlled by the dutch and the bugis however the sultanate was weakened by factional division and tengku abdur rahman and his officials were loyal to tengku rahmans elder brother tengku long who was living in exile in riau with the temenggongs help raffles managed to smuggle tengku long back into singapore he offered to recognize tengku long as the rightful sultan of johor given the title of sultan hussein and provide him with a yearly payment of 5000 and 3000 to the temenggong in return sultan hussein would grant the british the right to establish a trading post on singapore35 a formal treaty was signed on 6 february 1819 and modern singapore was born3637 sir stamford raffless statue at the singapore river spot where he first landed in 1824 the entire island as well as the temenggong became a british possession after a further treaty with the sultan38 in 1826 singapore became part of the straits settlements under the jurisdiction of british india becoming the regional capital in 183639 prior to raffles arrival there were only about a thousand people living on the island mostly indigenous malays along with a handful of chinese40 by 1860 the population had swelled to over 80000 more than half being chinese38 many of these early immigrants came to work on the pepper and gambier plantations41 later in the 1890s when the rubber industry also became established in malaya and singapore42 the island became a global centre for rubber sorting and export38 singapore was not much affected by first world war 1914–18 as the conflict did not spread to southeast asia the only significant event during the war was a mutiny by the muslim sepoys from british india who were garrisoned in singapore which occurred in 1915 after hearing rumours that they were to be sent off to fight the ottoman empire which was a muslim state the soldiers rebelled they killed their officers and several british civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by nonmuslim troops arriving from johore and burma raffles hotel was established in 1887 after the first world war the british built the large singapore naval base as part of the defensive singapore strategy originally announced in 1923 the construction of the base proceeded slowly until the japanese invasion of manchuria in 1931 when completed in 1939 at the very large cost of 500 million it boasted what was then the largest dry dock in the world the thirdlargest floating dock and having enough fuel tanks to support the entire british navy for six months it was defended by heavy 15inch naval guns stationed at fort siloso fort canning and labrador as well as a royal air force airfield at tengah air base winston churchill touted it as the gibraltar of the east and military discussions often referred to the base as simply east of suez unfortunately it was a base without a fleet the british home fleet was stationed in europe and the british could not afford to build a second fleet to protect its interests in asia the plan was for the home fleet to sail quickly to singapore in the event of an emergency however after world war ii broke out in 1939 the fleet was fully occupied with defending britain43 world war ii main article japanese occupation of singapore singapore naval base built in 1953 during the second world war the imperial japanese army invaded british malaya culminating in the battle of singapore when the british force of 60000 troops surrendered on 15 february 1942 british prime minister winston churchill called the defeat the worst disaster and largest capitulation in british history44 british losses during the fighting for singapore were heavy with a total of nearly 85000 personnel captured in addition to losses during the earlier fighting in malaya45 about 5000 were killed or wounded46 of which australians made up the majority47 japanese casualties during the fighting in singapore amounted to 1714 killed and 3378 wounded 45note 1 the occupation was to become a major turning point in the histories of several nations including those of japan britain and the thencolonial state of singapore japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war48 singapore was renamed syonanto 昭南島 shōnantō meaning light of the south4950 between 5000 and 25000 ethnic chinese people were killed in the subsequent sook ching massacre51 british forces had planned to liberate singapore in 1945 however the war ended before these operations could be carried out it was subsequently reoccupied by british indian and australian forces following the japanese surrender in september52 meanwhile tomoyuki yamashita was tried by a us military commission for war crimes but not for crimes committed by his

surrender of the japanese forces in the region from general itagaki seishiro on behalf of general hisaichi terauchi on 12 september 1945 and a british military administration was formed to govern the island until march 1946 much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war including harbor facilities at the port of singapore there was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition disease and rampant crime and violence high food prices unemployment and workers discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services by late 1947 the economy began to recover facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world but it would take several more years before the economy returned to prewar levels54 the failure of britain to successfully defend singapore had destroyed its credibility as infallible ruler in the eyes of singaporeans the decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of anticolonial and nationalist sentiments epitomized by the slogan merdeka or independence in the malay language the british on their part were prepared to gradually increase selfgovernance for singapore and malaya54 on 1 april 1946 the straits settlements was dissolved and singapore became a separate crown colony with a civil administration headed by a governor in july 1947 separate executive and legislative councils were established and the election of six members of the legislative council was scheduled in the following year55 david marshall was singapores 1st chief minister but resigned a year later during the 1950s chinese communists with strong ties to the trade unions and chinese schools waged a guerrilla war against the government leading to the malayan emergency the 1954 national service riots chinese middle schools riots and hock lee bus riots in singapore were all linked to these events56 david marshall proindependence leader of the labour front won singapores first general election in 1955 he led a delegation to london but britain rejected his demand for complete selfrule he resigned and was replaced by lim yew hock in 1956 whose policies convinced britain to grant singapore full internal selfgovernment for all matters except defence and foreign affairs57 during the may 1959 elections the peoples action party won a landslide victory singapore became an internally selfgoverning state within the commonwealth with lee kuan yew as its first prime minister58 as a result the 1959 general elections were the first after full internal selfgovernment was granted by the british authorities singapore was not yet fully independent as the british still controlled external affairs such as the military and foreign relations however singapore was now a recognised state governor sir william allmond codrington goode served as the first yang dipertuan negara head of state and was succeeded by yusof bin ishak59 campaign for merger the founding father of modern singapore lee kuan yew declaring the formation of the federation of malaysia on 16 september 1963 in singapore with sabah and sarawak also celebrating along despite their successes in governing singapore the pap leaders believed that singapores future lay with malaya due to strong ties between the two nations it was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market which will support new industries thus solving the ongoing unemployment woes in singapore however a sizable procommunist wing of the pap were strongly opposed to the merger fearing a loss of influencecitation needed this is because the ruling party of malaya united malays national organisation was staunchly anticommunist and would support the noncommunist faction of pap against them umno who were initially skeptical of the idea of a merger as they distrust the pap government and were concerned that the large chinese population in singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended changed their minds about the merger after being afraid of being taken over by procommunists on 27 may malayas prime minister tunku abdul rahman mooted the idea of a federation of malaysia comprising existing federation of malaya singapore brunei and the british borneo territories of north borneo and sarawak60 the umno leaders believed that the additional malay population in the borneo territories would offset singapores chinese population57 the british government for its part believed that the merger would prevent singapore from becoming a haven for communism61 singapore with malaysia main article singapore in malaysia see also independence of singapore agreement 1965 lee kuan yew tunku abdul rahman right lee kuan yew the then prime minister of singapore left tunku adul rahman the then prime minister of malaysia as a result of the 1962 merger referendum on 16 september 1963 singapore joined with the federation of malaya the crown colony of sarawak and the crown colony of north borneo to form the new federation of malaysia under the terms of the malaysia agreement given singapores limited size and lack of natural resources it was felt integrating with malaya would provide a route to stronger economic development the merger would also give the pap legitimacy and remove the threat of communist government over singapore62 however shortly after the merger the singapore state government and the malaysian central government disagreed on many political and economic issues and communal strife culminated in the 1964 race riots in singapore a symbol of singapore the merlion was created in 1964 on 10 march 1965 a bomb planted by indonesian saboteurs on a mezzanine floor of macdonald house exploded killing three people and injuring 33 others it was the deadliest of at least 42 bomb incidents which occurred during the konfrontasi63 two members of the indonesian marine corps osman bin haji mohamed ali and harun bin said were eventually convicted and executed for the crime64 the macdonald house suffered 250000 bomb damage6566 there were many heated ideological conflicts between the two governments even on the economic front despite an earlier agreement to establish a common market singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of malaysia in retaliation singapore did not extend to sabah and sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states the situation escalated to such an intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides because of this on 7 august 1965the then malaysian prime minister tunku abdul rahman seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed advised the parliament of malaysia that it should vote to expel singapore from malaysia67 on 9 august 1965 the malaysian parliament voted 126 to 0 with singaporean delegates not present to
