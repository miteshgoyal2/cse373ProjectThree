grandsons from his former incarnation the scarecrow is a character in the fictional land of oz created by american author l frank baum and illustrator ww denslow in his first appearance the scarecrow reveals that he lacks a brain and desires above all else to have one in reality he is only two days old and merely ignorant throughout the course of the novel he demonstrates that he already has the brains he seeks and is later recognized as the wisest man in all of oz although he continues to credit the wizard for them he is however wise enough to know his own limitations and all too happy to hand the rulership of oz passed to him by the wizard to princess ozma to become one of her trusted advisors though he typically spends more time playing games than advising contents 1 in the wonderful

oz the living scarecrow encounters dorothy gale in a field in the munchkin country while she is on her way to the emerald city he tells her about his creation and of how he at first scared away the crows before an older one realised he was a straw man causing the other crows to start eating the corn the old crow then told the scarecrow of the importance of brains the mindless scarecrow joins dorothy in the hope that the wizard will give him a brain they are later joined by the tin woodman and the cowardly lion when the group goes to the west he kills the witchs crows by twisting their necks he is taken apart by the flying monkeys and his clothes thrown up a tree but when his clothes are filled with straw he is back again after dorothy and her friends have completed their mission to kill the wicked witch of the west the wizard gives the scarecrow brains made out of bran pins and needles – in reality a placebo as he has been the most intelligent of the travelers all along before he leaves oz in a balloon the wizard appoints the scarecrow to rule the emerald city in his stead he accompanies dorothy and the others to the palace of the good witch of the south glinda and she uses the golden cap to summon the winged monkeys who take the scarecrow back to the emerald city his desire for a brain notably contrasts with the tin woodmans desire for a heart reflecting a common debate between the relative importance of the mind and the emotions indeed both believe they have neither this occasions philosophical debate between the two friends as to why their own choices are superior neither convinces the other and dorothy listening is unable to decide which one is right symbolically because they remain with dorothy throughout her quest she is provided with both and need not select1 in wicked musicaledit in the musical of gregory maguires interpretation of the oz franchise this version of the scarecrow was fiyero tigelaar the love interest of elphaba thropp fiyero attends school with elphaba and glinda the good while they were all still young fiyero takes a special interest in elphaba however he is highly sought after by elphabas roommate glinda fiyero and elphaba share a secret romance and when she leaves for the emerald city he gives her a long and meaningful goodbye many years later after elphaba goes into hiding we are shown that glinda and fiyero are to be wed however this is not because of love at least not on fiyeros part for he still loves elphaba once she reappears in the emerald city they escape together much to glindas discontent elphaba then goes to the site of her sisters death dorothys arrival into oz here she is ambushed by guards and about to be taken away when fiyero saves her but he is merely sacrificing himself to save her elphaba in a fit of rage and heartbreak reads a spell to keep fiyero safe with the words of the spell including pleas to let him feel no pain and never die however they try to destroy him although elphaba abandons the spell as she believes it is not working it is not until the end of the production that we are shown that fiyero is still alive and has been transformed into the scarecrow from the wonderful wizard of oz in the novel wicked by gregory maguireedit in gregory maguires novel wicked the life and times of the wicked witch of the west the scarecrow is a companion of dorothy when the quartet of dorothy the scarecrow tin woodman and lion approach elphabas home in fiyeros castle she thinks for a moment that maybe fiyero is the scarecrow having not died earlier in the novel she sends minions after him to tear him apart to see if fiyero is inside but he is not in the novel he is not fiyero but this is probably where they got the idea for the stage version in the novel son of a witch by gregory maguireedit the scarecrow appears briefly in this novel first giving liir advice when he appears at glindas induction liir notes that it is an obvious impostor and not the same scarecrow that he once knew scholarly interpretationsedit main article political interpretations of the wonderful wizard of oz denslows drawing of scarecrow hung up on pole and helpless from first edition of book 1900 july 1896 puck cartoon shows farmer hung up on pole and helpless was this denslows inspiration the hat says silverite the locomotive is gold economics and history professors have published scholarly studies that indicate the images and characters used by baum and denslow closely resembled political images that were well known in the 1890s the scarecrow like other characters and elements in the wonderful wizard of oz was a common theme found in editorial cartoons of the previous decade baum and denslow like most writers used the materials at hand that they knew best they built a story around them added dorothy and added a series of lessons to the effect that everyone possesses the resources they need such as brains a heart and courage if only they had selfconfidence although it was a children’s book of course baum noted in the preface that it was a modernized fairy tale as well those who interpret the wonderful wizard of oz as a political allegory often see the scarecrow a central figure as a reflection of the popular image of the american farmer—although he has been persuaded that he is only a dumb hick he possesses a strong common sense remarkable insight and quickwittedness that needs only to be reinforced by selfconfidence the blackface minstrel star fred stone was the first to play the scarecrow on stage and he brought his minstrel style of performance to the role of the scarecrow baum was delighted with stones performance and he wrote subsequent oz books with stones minstrelstyle in mind2 later oz booksedit cover of the scarecrow of oz 1915 by l frank baum illustration by john r neill the scarecrow also appears in other oz books sharing further adventures with dorothy and her friends his reign as king of the emerald city ends in the marvelous land of oz when general jinjur and her army of revolt oust him in a coup he manages to escape the palace and joins tip and his companions in seeking the aid of glinda the good he spars with h m wogglebug t e on the value of education although he claims to be educated himself and to value education he finds the wogglebugs learning rote and without wisdom although he cannot eat he tells billina that she might be better cooked and generally seems to favor the use of animals as food sometimes making snide remarks to that effect to his animal companions although he himself only gathers nuts and fruit for his traveling companions such as dorothy and tip to eat by the road to oz he is acknowledged at least by the tin woodman to be probably the wisest man in all oz and this is the caption of an illustration suggesting that the reader take his comment at face value dorothy herself in dorothy and the wizard in oz praises the scarecrows wisdom and says the scarecrow seemed just as wise before the wizard gave him brains as after in the emerald city of oz the scarecrow lives in a house shaped like an ear of corn in winkie country in the scarecrow of oz the scarecrow travels to jinxland where he helps capn bill trot and buttonbright overthrow the villainous king krewl in glinda of oz the scarecrow serves as regent to ozma of oz demonstrating that he is ozmas third in command mostly all he does is play croquet until ozmas advisers including himself band together for a rescue operation in the royal book of oz by ruth plumly thompson baums authorized successor as royal historian of oz professor wogglebug accused the scarecrow of having no ancestry so he returns to the pole at the cornfield where he was once hung sliding down it and descending underground he first encounters the midlings and then the silver islands whose people believe themselves to be the ancestors of the chinese apparently when emperor chang wang woe defeated the king of the golden islands in battle the king hired a sorcerer to sneak into the palace and transform the emperor into a crocus which later sprouted into a bean pole preceding a prophecy that the first being to touch the bean pole would become possessed by the spirit of the emperor as it turned out the first thing to touch the pole was the strawstuffed human which would become the scarecrow this account is not consistent with the scarecrows story in the wonderful wizard of oz of becoming aware of each sense as the relevant organs were painted on his head film portrayalsedit early filmsedit the scarecrow has appeared in nearly every early oz film portrayed by different actors each time the fairylogue and radioplays 1908 frank burns the wonderful wizard of oz 1910 robert z leonard the patchwork girl of oz 1914 herbert glennon his majesty the scarecrow of oz 1914 frank moore wizard of oz 1925 larry semon just a man in disguise the land of oz 1932 donald henderson the wizard of ozedit in the 1939 film the wizard of oz the scarecrow was played by ray bolger in what is arguably the actors most famous role he was originally cast as the tin woodsman but bolger had always wanted to play the scarecrow so he was upset about it since he wanted to switch roles with buddy ebsen who was originally going to play the scarecrow ebsen didnt mind the swap so bolger and ebsen swapped roles while ray was pleased with his role as the scarecrow the aluminum dust from ebsens tin man makeup nearly choked him to the edge of death causing ebsen to have to give up that role ebsen was replaced by jack haley for his role of the tin man bolgers costume consisted of a strawstuffed suit and a light face mask of rubber designed to simulate burlap the mask was fragile and usually had to be completely replaced at the start of each new day of filming3 bolgers scarecrow costume minus the mask is part of the collections of the national museum of american history at the smithsonian institution4 bolger was a talented dancer so the scarecrow was given an extended dance sequence in the movie however to shorten the movie much of this sequence was edited out since it would slow down the film while bolger admitted in a 1939 radio broadcast that he was too young to have seen fred stone play the scarecrow in the 1902 musical extravaganza he told stone on the broadcast that the first play he was allowed to see was the red mill featuring stone and that his performance in that play was an inspiration during the scene where the wizard gives him his brains the scarecrow makes a mistake in his first educated pronouncement he recites the pythagorean theorem stating that it applies to an isosceles triangle which is incorrect as it applies to a right triangle he also refers to square roots not to squares this probably reflects ignorance by the scriptwriters not the scarecrow bolger also portrayed the scarecrows kansas counterpart hunk one of aunt em and uncle henrys farmworkers newly created for the film by screenwriter noel langley5 a scene which was written in the script but dropped before filming commenced ended the movie by sending hunk off to agricultural college with dorothy promising to write the scene implied the potential for a romance between the two characterscitation needed he helps zeke cowardly lions alter ego and hickory tin mans alter ego repair a wagon unlike zeke hickory and hunk lose their hats with uncle henry as they struggle to open the cellar when the tornado approaches their farm he closes and locks the cellar with zeke when dorothy arrives at the farmhouse hunk reunites with dorothy when she awakens from being unconscious he is seen with aunt em uncle henry zeke hickory and professor marvel the wizards alter ego the oz kidsedit in 1996 they made a cartoon animated the oz kids he has a son named scarecrow jr his son is smart and knows everything just like him scarecrow sr is voiced by andy milder oz the great and powerfuledit in the 2013 film oz the great and powerful the scarecrows origins are explained being fabricated by the townspeople of oz as a diversionary tactic during the retaliatory attack on the emerald city6 other adaptationsedit in the 1925 film wizard of oz the scarecrow and the tin man were actually human farmhands who were blown to oz by the tornado along with dorothy dorothy in another major departure from the novel turns out to be the rightful ruler of oz having been exiled to kansas as a baby hinton battle originated the role of the scarecrow in the 1975 broadway musical the wiz and michael jackson played the scarecrow in the 1978 film adaptation this version of the scarecrow was a more tragic character before dorothy rescues him while hung on his pole the crows he is unable to scare who force him to humiliate himself and entertain them torment him day and night they force him to sing the song you cant win meaning that he cannot escape the crows rule and his bad luck while stan winston created jacksons makeup it was applied to jacksons face by michael r thomas who portrayed the scarecrow in barry mahons the wonderful land of oz 1969 as well as doing the makeup for that film elijah kelley portrayed the scarecrow in the tv special the wiz live as well as the farmhand sticks in the animated film journey back to oz produced in 1964 but not released until the 1970s the scarecrow was voiced by mickey rooney in an episode of the worlds greatest super friends aquaman temporarily became the scarecrow after a tornado took him superman and wonder woman to mister mxyzptlk’s planet of oz in a 1981 episode of scoobydoo and scrappydoo shaggy is dressed as the scarecrow after a tornado took him scooby and scrappy to ahz a direct spoof of oz with a different spelling by its enunciation justin case an english bicycle acrobat appeared briefly as the scarecrow in the 1985 film return to oz american voice actor michael gough voices the scarecrow in 2011s directtodvd animated film tom and jerry and the wizard of oz the scarecrow appeared in legends of oz dorothys return which is based on dorothy of oz voiced by dan aykroyd the scarecrow appeared in the once upon a time episode our decay voiced by paul scheer many years ago zelena the wicked witch of the west targeted him for his brain as part of her attempt to create a timetravel spell before she can remove scarecrows brain dorothy and toto arrived where they managed to get away from zelena with help from hades who enchanted a bicycle that was found at the remains of dorothys house zelena was able to locate where dorothy and scarecrow are hiding after magically freezing dorothy zelena successfully removed scarecrows brain and was about to show it to hades only to find that he is not there modern worksedit the scarecrow is also a minor character in author gregory maguires revisionist novel wicked the life and times of the wicked witch of the west and is made a more prominent character in its broadway musical adaptation wicked in the musical the scarecrow is revealed to be the remnants of fiyero after he was captured by the wizards officials but made impervious to injury by elphabas incomplete spell the fiyeroscarecrow executes a plan to save elphaba through using the rumor that water will melt her thus she stays alive and the two move out of oz this has no basis in the book other than that in the final scenes elphaba hopes that the scarecrow is really her beloved fiyero in disguise which is proven to be a false hope when he is attacked and she sees that he is nothing but straw the scarecrow is featured more prominently in son of a witch maguires sequel to wicked in that novel the scarecrow helps the witchs son liir avoid political turmoil in the emerald city after the wizards departure later various powerful interests place a different scarecrow on the throne of oz to serve as a puppet ruler the suggestion is that most residents of oz are unable to distinguish one scarecrow from another in the musical the fiyeroscarecrows appearance and style of walking are based on bolgers portrayal of the scarecrow in the 1939 film in the dorothy must die series by danielle paige the scarecrow and dorothys other companions have been corrupted by their gifts and dorothys use of magic the scarecrow has become a twisted mad scientist performing various experiments on the animals to turn them into spies or warriors for dorothys army
