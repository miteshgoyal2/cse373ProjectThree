sanctioned by the national collegiate athletic association ncaa in the united states di schools include the major collegiate athletic powers with larger budgets more elaborate facilities and more athletic scholarships than divisions ii and iii as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition this level was once called the university division of the ncaa in contrast to the lower level college division these terms were replaced with numeric divisions in 1973 the university division was renamed division i while the college division was split in two the college division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became division ii while those who did not want to offer scholarships became division iii1 for the 201415 school year division i contained 345 of the ncaas 1066 member institutions with 125 in fbs 125 in fcs and 95 nonfootball schools with six additional schools in transition from division ii to division i23 there was a moratorium on any additional movement up to di until 2012 after which any school that wants to move to di must be accepted for membership by a conference and show the ncaa it

division i schools must meet minimum financial aid awards for their athletics program and there are maximum financial aid awards for each sport that a division i school cannot exceed several other ncaa sanctioned minimums and differences that distinguish division i from divisions ii and iii4 each playing season has to be represented by each gender as well there are contest and participant minimums for each sport as well as scheduling criteria for sports other than football and basketball division i schools must play 100 percent of the minimum number of contests against division i opponents—anything over the minimum number of games has to be 50 percent division i mens and womens basketball teams have to play all but two games against division i teams for men they must play onethird of all their contests in the home arena5 in addition to the schools that compete fully as di institutions the ncaa allows dii and diii schools to classify one mens and one womens sport other than football or basketball as a di sport as long as they sponsored those sports before the latest rules change in 20116 also division ii schools are eligible to compete for division i national championships in sports that do not have a division ii national championship and in those sports may also operate under di rules and scholarship limits7 fbs and fcsedit for football only division i was further subdivided in 1978 into division ia the principal football schools division iaa the other schools with football teams and division i those schools not sponsoring football89 in 2006 division ia and iaa were renamed football bowl subdivision fbs and football championship subdivision fcs respectively fbs teams are allowed a maximum of 85 players receiving athleticallybased aid per year with each player allowed to receive up to a full scholarship fcs teams have the same 85player limit as fbs teams but are only allowed to give aid equivalent to 63 full scholarships fcs teams are allowed to award partial scholarships a practice technically allowed but essentially never used at the fbs level fbs teams also have to meet minimum game attendance requirements average 15000 people in actual or paid attendance per home game while fcs teams do not need to meet minimum attendance requirements another difference is post season play since 1978 fcs teams have played in the ncaa division i football championship a playoff tournament to determine a ncaasanctioned national champion meanwhile the fbs teams play in bowl games where various polls rank the number one team after the conclusion of the bowl games starting with the 2014 postseason a fourteam playoff called the college football playoff replaced the previous onegame championship format even so division i fbs football

spent on their sport and the money their sport brings in justify their paymentcitation needed in april the ncaa approved studentsathletes getting free unlimited meals and snacks the ncaa stated the adoption of the meals legislation finished a conversation that began in the awards benefits expenses and financial aid cabinet members have worked to find appropriate ways to ensure studentathletes get the nutrition they need without jeopardizing pell grants or other federal aid received by the neediest studentathletes with their vote members of the council said they believe loosening ncaa rules

however in recent years the fastestgrowing has been beach volleyball which went from 14 division i teams in 2011–12 to 55 in 2016–17 † in the 2016–17 school year rugby is classified by the ncaa as an emerging sport for women beach volleyball which had previously been an emerging sport under the name of sand volleyball26 became an official ncaa championship sport in 2015–1627 the number of scholarships are partially linked for indoor volleyball and beach volleyball schools that field both indoor and beach volleyball teams are allowed 60 full scholarship equivalents specifically for beach volleyball as of 2016–17 with the further limitations that 1 no player receiving aid for beach volleyball can be on the indoor volleyball roster and 2 a maximum of 14 individuals can receive aid

typically football and men’s basketball — on network television and in basic cable channels these contracts can be quite lucrative particularly for di schools from the biggest conferences for example the big ten conference in 2016 entered into contracts with fox and espn that pay the conference 264 billion over six years the ncaa also holds certain tv contracts for example the ncaa’s contract to show the men’s basketball championship tournament widely known as march madness is currently under a 14year deal with cbs and turner that runs from 2010 to 2024 and pays 11 billion for the 2014–15

purposes of scholarship limitations headcount sports in which the ncaa limits the total number of individuals that can receive athletic scholarships but allows each player to receive up to a full scholarship equivalency sports in which the ncaa limits the total financial aid that a school can offer in a given sport to the equivalent of a set number of full scholarships roster limitations may or may not apply depending on the sport the term counter is also key to this concept the ncaa defines a counter as an individual who is receiving institutional financial aid that is countable against the aid limitations in a sport32 the number of scholarships that division i members may award in each sport is listed below in this table scholarship numbers for headcount sports are indicated without

athletically related and other countable financial aid equal to at least 25 of a full scholarship34 most institutional and governmental nonathletic aid falls in the countable category35 an official ncaa rules interpretation also allows schools to count aid that would otherwise be exempt by ncaa rule such as purely academic awards toward the 25 limit as long as it also is included in the calculations for the team equivalency limit36 the 25 rule does not apply to baseball schools that offer only needbased aid such as ivy league members37 a second exception to the 25 rule added in 2012 is for players in their final year of athletic eligibility who have not previously received athletically related aid in baseball at any college38 this total is for schools that also sponsor womens indoor volleyball41 if a school does not sponsor womens indoor volleyball it is allowed 80 equivalents for beach volleyball42 for all schools the maximum number of counters in beach volleyball is 144142 if a school sponsors mens crosscountry but does not sponsor either indoor or outdoor track and field for men it is allowed 50 scholarship equivalents for that sport45 if a school sponsors womens crosscountry but does not sponsor either indoor or outdoor track and field for women it is allowed 60 scholarship equivalents for that sport45 fbs programs are also limited to 25 new counters per school year46 fcs programs are also limited to 85 total counters per school year47 effective with the recruiting cycle for the 2018–19 school year the previous limit of 30 new counters per year for fcs programs has been removed48 the number of total counters is limited to 3050 the ncaa division i manual does not include any scholarship limitations for womens ice hockey these limitations are instead found in the division ii manual51 note also that the division ii manual does not include any limit on total counters for any sport including womens ice hockey the ncaa classifies rifle as a mens sport despite the fact that competitions are fully coeducational of the 33 ncaa rifle schools 23 in division i 4 in division ii and 6 in division iii 22 field a single coedmixed team six schools five in division i and one in division iii field womenonly teams schools are also allowed to field any combination of mens womens and mixed teams currently one di school and one diii school field separate mens and womens teams one di school and one dii school field a womenonly team plus a mixed team and one di school vmi fields all three types of teams the scholarship limits are per school not per team the ncaa adopted triathlon as its newest emerging sport for women effective with the 2014–15 school year with an initial limit of 35 scholarship equivalents the total number of equivalents reached its final value of 65 in 2017–1843 rules for multisport athletesedit the ncaa also has rules specifying the sport in which multisport athletes are to be counted with the basic rules being52 anyone who participates in football is counted in that sport even if he does not receive financial aid from the football program an exception exists for players at nonscholarship fcs programs who receive aid in another sport53 participants in basketball are counted in that sport unless they also play football participants in mens ice hockey are counted in that sport unless they also play football or basketball participants in both mens swimming and diving and mens water polo are counted in swimming and diving unless they count in football or basketball participants in womens indoor volleyball are counted in that sport unless they also play basketball all other multisport athletes are counted in whichever sport the school chooses football subdivisionsedit subdivisions in division i exist only in football5455 in all other sports all division i conferences are equivalent the subdivisions were recently given names to reflect the differing levels of football play in them the method by which the ncaa determines whether a school is bowl or championship subdivision is first by attendance numbers and then by scholarships56 for attendance reporting methods the ncaa allows schools to report either total tickets sold or the number of persons in attendance at the games they require a minimum average of 15000 people in attendance every other year56 these numbers get posted to the ncaa statistics website for football each year with the new rules starting in the 2006 season the number of bowl subdivision schools could drop in the future if those schools are not able to pull in enough fans into the games additionally 14 fcs schools had enough attendance to be moved up in 201257 under current ncaa rules these schools must have an invitation from an fbs conference in order to move to fbs three of them—appalachian state georgia southern and old dominion—began fbs transitions in 2013 all had the required fbs conference invitations with old dominion joining conference usa in 2013 and appalachian state and georgia southern joining the sun belt conference in 2014 the difference in the postseasons in each of the subdivisions grant the fcs an advantage to have the best record in college football history 17–0 while the fbs only allows a 15–0 record football bowl subdivisionedit main article ncaa division i football bowl subdivision see also college

automatic bids to the access bowls fbs schools are limited to a total of 85 football players receiving financial assistance58 for competitive reasons a student receiving partial scholarship counts fully against the total of 85 nearly all fbs schools that are not on ncaa probation give 85 full scholarships as of the current 2017 season there are 129 full members of division i fbs with the university of alabama at birmingham uab reinstating a football program that it had dropped after the 2014 season two schools coastal carolina university and liberty university are at varying stages of the fbs transition process coastal began its transition in 2016 when it joined the sun belt conference for nonfootball sports in that season coastal was classified as an fcs independent but was ineligible for the fcs playoffs coastal joins sun belt football for the 2017 season and will be counted as an fbs member for scheduling purposes but full fbs membership and bowl eligibility will not come until 201859 liberty currently a member of the big south conference began its transition in 2017 it remains in the big south that season but is ineligible for the fcs playoffs the ncaa granted liberty a waiver from its normal fcstofbs transition rules requiring that a school have an invitation from an fbs conference to begin the transition meaning that liberty will become an fbs independent for scheduling purposes in 2018 and a full fbs member in 201960 since the 2016 season all fbs conferences have been allowed to conduct a championship game that does not count against the limit of 12 regularseason contests under the current rules such a game can be held either 1 between the winners of each of two divisions with each team having played a full roundrobin schedule within its division or 2 between the conferences top two teams after a full roundrobin conference schedule61 previously exempt championship games could only be held by between the divisional winners of conferences that had at least 12 football teams and split into divisions6263 the prize is normally a specific bowl game bid for which the conference has a tiein some conferences have numbers in their names but this often has no relation to the number of member institutions in the conference the big ten conference did not formally adopt the big ten name until 1987 but unofficially used that name when it had 10 members from 1917 to 1946 and again from 1949 forward however it has continued to use the name even after it expanded to 11 members with the addition of penn state in 1990 12 with the addition of nebraska in 2011 and 14 with the arrival of maryland and rutgers in 2014 the big 12 conference was established in 1996 with 12 members but continues to use that name even after a number of departures and a few replacements left the conference with 10 members on the other hand the pac12 conference has used names official or unofficial that have reflected the number of members since its current charter was established in 1959 the conference unofficially used big five 1959–62 big six 1962–64 and pacific8 1964–68 before officially adopting the pacific8 name the name duly changed to pacific10 in 1978 with the addition of arizona and arizona state and pac12 instead of pacific12 in 2011 when colorado and utah joined conferences also tend to ignore their regional names when adding new schools for example the pac81012 retained its pacific moniker even though its four newest members arizona arizona state colorado utah are located in the inland west and the original big east kept its name even after adding schools either in all sports or for football only located in areas traditionally considered to be in the midwest cincinnati depaul marquette notre dame upper south louisville memphis

seeds 9–24 to determine the two finalists who play for the fcs national title in early january in frisco texas the scheduled host through the 2019 season for thirteen seasons the title game was played in chattanooga tennessee 1997–2009 preceded by five seasons in huntington west virginia where host marshall advanced to the title game in four of the five years67 when iaa was formed 39 years ago in 19788 the playoffs included just four teams for its first three seasons doubling to eight teams for one season in 198168 from 1982 to 1985 iaa had a 12team tournament with each of the top four seeds receiving a firstround bye and a home game in the quarterfinals69 the iaa playoffs went to 16 teams in 1986 and the fcs playoffs expanded to 20 teams starting in 2010 and to 24 in 2013 after 28 seasons the iaa was dropped by the ncaa eleven years ago in 2006 although it is still informally and commonly used abstainersedit the football championship subdivision includes several conferences which do not participate in the eponymous postseason championship tournament the ivy league was reclassified to iaa fcs following the 1981 season70 and plays a strict tengame schedule although it qualifies for an automatic bid the ivy league has not played any postseason games at all since 1956 citing academic concerns the southwestern athletic conference swac has its own championship game in middecember between the champions of its east and west divisions also three of its member schools traditionally do not finish their regular seasons until thanksgiving weekend grambling state and southern play each other in the bayou classic and alabama state plays tuskegee of division ii in the turkey day classic swac teams are eligible to accept atlarge bids if their schedule is not in conflict the last swac team to participate in the iaa playoffs was jackson state in 1997 the swac never achieved success in the tournament going winless in 19 games in twenty years 1978–97 it had greater success outside the conference while in division ii and the preceding college division from 2006 through 2009 the pioneer football league and northeast conference champions played in the gridiron classic if a league champion was invited to the national championship playoff as an atlarge bid something the pioneer league at least never received the secondplace team would play in the gridiron classic that game was scrapped after the 2009 season when its fouryear contract ran out this coincided with the ncaas announcement that the northeast conference would get an automatic bid to the tournament starting in 2010 the big south conference also received an automatic bid in the same season the pioneer football league earned an automatic bid beginning in 2013 the mideastern athletic conference meac began abstaining from the playoffs with the 2015 season like the swac its members are eligible for atlarge bids and the two conferences have faced off in the celebration bowl as an alternative postseason game since the 2015 season schools in a transition period after joining the fcs from a lower division or from the naia are also ineligible for the playoffs scholarshipsedit division i fcs schools are currently restricted to giving financial assistance amounting to 63 full scholarships as fcs football is an equivalency sport as opposed to the headcount status of fbs football championship subdivision schools may divide their allotment into partial scholarships however fcs schools may only have 85 players receiving any sort of athletic financial aid for football—the same numeric limit as fbs schools because of competitive forces however a substantial number of players in championship subdivision programs are on full scholarships another difference is that fcs schools no longer have a limit on the number of new players that can be provided with financial aid in a given season while fbs schools are limited to 25 such additions per season finally fcs schools are limited to 95 individuals participating in preseason practices as opposed to 105 at fbs schools the three service academies that play fbs football are exempt from preseason practice player limits by ncaa rule a few championship subdivision conferences are composed of schools that offer no athletic scholarships at all most notably the ivy league and the pioneer football league pfl a footballonly conference the ivy league allows no athletic scholarships at all while the pfl consists of schools that offer scholarships in other sports but choose not to take on the expense of a scholarship football program the northeast conference also sponsored nonscholarship football but began offering a maximum of 30 full scholarship equivalents in 2006 which grew to 40 in 2011 after a later vote of the leagues school presidents and athletic directors the patriot league only began awarding football scholarships in the 2013 season with the first scholarships awarded only to incoming freshmen before the conference began its transition to scholarship football athletes receiving scholarships in other sports were ineligible to play football for member schools since the completion of the transition with the 2016 season member schools have been allowed up to 60 full scholarship equivalents71 conferencesedit conference nickname founded full members sports headquarters fcs tournament

the sun belt conference in 2014 division i in ice hockeyedit some sports most notably ice hockey74 and mens volleyball have completely different conference structures that operate outside of the normal ncaa sports conference structure as ice hockey is limited to a much smaller number of almost exclusively northern schools there is a completely different conference structure for teams74 these conferences feature a mix of teams that play their other sports in various division i conferences and even division ii and division iii schools for most of the early 21st century there was no correlation between a teams ice hockey affiliation and its affiliation for other sports with the exception of the ivy leagues hockeyplaying schools all being members of the ecac for example before 2013 the hockey east mens conference consisted of one acc school one big east school four schools from the america east one from the a10 one caa school and two schools from the dii northeast ten conference while the central collegiate hockey association ccha and western collegiate hockey association wcha both had some big ten representation plus division ii and iii schools also the divisional structure is truncated with the division ii championship abolished in 1999 the metro atlantic athletic conference ceased its sponsorship of the sport in 200375 with the remaining members forming atlantic hockey for the next decade no regular allsport conferences sponsored ice hockey starting with the 2013–14 season division i mens hockey experienced a major realignment the big ten conference began to sponsor ice hockey and their institutions withdrew their membership from the wcha and ccha76 additionally six other schools from those conferences withdrew to form the new national collegiate hockey conference at the same time77 the fallout from these moves led to the demise of the ccha two more teams entering the nchc and further membership turnover in the mens side of the wcha womens hockey was largely unaffected by this realignment the big ten still has only four members with varsity womens hockey with six teams required under conference bylaws for official sponsorship as a result the only changes in womens hockey affiliations in the 2010–14 period occurred in college hockey america which saw two schools drop the sport and three new members join conferencesedit

of founding play began in 2013–14 classification debateedit in the early 21st century a controversy arose in the ncaa over whether schools will continue to be allowed to have one showcased program in division i with the remainder of the athletic program in a lower division as is the case of notably johns hopkins university lacrosse as well as colorado college and university of alabama in huntsville in ice hockey this is an especially important issue in hockey which has no division ii national championship and has several schools whose other athletic programs compete in division ii and division iii this controversy was resolved at the 2004 ncaa convention in nashville tennessee when the members supported proposal 651 the amended legislation cosponsored by colorado college clarkson university hartwick college the johns hopkins university rensselaer polytechnic institute rutgers university–newark st lawrence university and suny oneonta7879 each school affected by this debate is allowed to grant financial aid to studentathletes who compete in division i programs in one mens sport and one womens sport it is still permitted for other schools to place one mens and one womens sport in division i going forward but they cannot offer scholarships without bringing the whole program into compliance with division i rules in addition schools in divisions ii and iii are allowed to play up in any sport that does not have a championship for the schools own division but only division ii programs and any division iii programs covered by the exemption can offer scholarships in those sports the division i programs at each of the eight waiver schools which were grandfathered with the passing of proposal 651 were clarkson university – mens and womens ice hockey colorado college – mens ice hockey womens soccer hartwick college – mens soccer womens water polo johns hopkins university – mens and womens lacrosse rensselaer polytechnic institute – mens ice hockey womens ice hockey
