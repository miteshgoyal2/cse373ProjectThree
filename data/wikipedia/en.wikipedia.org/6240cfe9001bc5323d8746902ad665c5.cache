sign with the upstart company toward the end of his playing career other nba players to wear the brand were karl malone and hakeem olajuwon san francisco 49ers quarterback joe montana signed an endorsement deal with la gear in 1990 after working with mizuno for most of his career and quickly became the companys feature athlete hockey star wayne gretzky was also signed as an endorser while he was still playing with the los angeles kings and eventually would have his own line of street hockey shoes before his endorsement contract expired in addition to abduljabbar several other nba stars wore la gear shoes perhaps the most notable being karl malone who appeared in several commercials for the brand beginning in the early 1990s hakeem olajuwon was another la gearendorsed basketball player who after being signed stayed with the brand until 1994 when he was contracted by spalding to endorse a line of basketball shoes with his name and number unlike other athletic shoe companies of the day la gear was not averse to going outside of sports to find endorsement contracts one of the earliest celebrities to sign an endorsement deal with the company was singer belinda carlisle who appeared in a series of print ads for la gear when the brand first began to become popular as seen in this ad two of the most notable celebrities to endorse the shoes were michael jackson who promoted shoes for both men and women and paula abdul who was signed away from reebok in 1991 and whose shoe 1 became one of the biggest sellers of the early 1990s234 1990sedit as the 1990s began la gears popularity continued to rise although its original lines were typically featured in highend department stores such as macys as the decade turned la gear shoes became easier to find in other stores discount retailer caldor began carrying la gear shoes designed specifically for the store and its clientele the improved accessibility helped la gears sales and the company responded by coming out with more shoe lines to accommodate buyers as the decade continued la gear began aggressively promoting its performance athletic shoe line for the newer shoes some of the designs included catapult the la gear equivalent of air jordans a highend basketball shoe and training shoe line the original spokesman for the line was karl malone as noted above regulator the inflatable shoe craze of the early 1990s spawned this shoe la gears answer to the reebok pump56 the shoe featured a large pumping button on the tongue much larger than the reebok pumps was and a switch on top that deflated the shoe when pushed to the right7 la lights was one of la gears most successful lines which came out in 1992 the line of kids la lights was launched at foot locker and kids foot locker at 50 retail by la gear national account manager jim stroesser working closely with new yorkbased bbc international who owned the original patent for the light technology la gear was selling over 5 million pairs of kids la lights per year in the 1990s despite other brands selling lighted technology in the lower distribution channels light technology for kids has been one of the most successful launches in the athletic shoe industry with over a 100 million pairs sold in all distribution channels the shoes were also used as survival gear to locate stranded individuals and children during blizzards leading to increased demand prior to storms8 la techstep la gear went further in 1993 by introducing the leap gear line of performance basketball shoes which would light up when the player would jump off the ground la techs lighted technology was launched at foot locker by la gear national account manager jim stroesser and at champs by account manager kyle coburn the programs success led to an exclusive national television advertising campaign with over 2000 doors at foot locker inc flak a brand similar to popular nike and adidas products during the mid1990s although they had deemphasized them by this time la gear continued to market shoes towards women one of la gears more popular lines during this time for women was the dancer line which was a hightop shoe almost identical to the reebok freestyle in design in addition la gear consolidated one of its other sneaker designs into a complete womens design and renamed it street shots featuring both high top and low top sneakers sold primarily in white with silver trim although other colors were featured as part of this change la gear once again changed their logo for their womens line using a gray diamond shape with the company name inside it popularity fadesedit by 1993 la gears popularity was beginning to wane within a year the company began restricting access to the shoes returning to higherend department stores to market the brand by doing this la gear hoped to gain a more upscale clientele for their shoes however in doing so the company was so desperate to sell the remaining inventory that la gear shoes began showing up at flea markets swap meets and supermarkets in 1994 la gear abandoned their mens performance footwear line and began marketing the lifestyle brands for women and children more aggressively they also tried to acquire the rykä brand of womens shoes but the deal failed as ryka which was struggling as much as la gear was continued its downward decline in 1995 walmart and la gear agreed to a threeyear contract where the shoe company would design lowervalued and specifictostore shoes for walmart since walmart was such a large retailer la gear felt they could not pass up an opportunity that lucrative despite an apparent contradiction in strategy but the venture failed as sales for la gear shoes at walmart had declined the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1998 in the process greatly reducing the lines of shoes it was selling comebackedit since the bankruptcy filing la gear has made three concerted attempts at coming back the first was in 1999 with an emphasis on casual shoes for men and women and the return of the popular la lights line for children however the brand failed to catch on after shaw declined to back them in 2003 la gear again went through a relaunch this time with an emphasis on mens performance footwear as the catapult line was reintroduced los angeles laker rookie luke walton was signed on as the brands spokesman and appeared in several print ads his contract eventually ran out ron artest also was endorsed by la gear for a brief period in 2004 and 2005 in conjunction with his tru warrier persona but the company dropped him as spokesman following the infamous pacers–pistons brawl la gear primarily marketed fashion athletic shoes for women and continues to do so to this day although a recent relaunch of the brand has result in the deemphasis of these lines with la gear discontinuing the new catapult line for men altogether in 2008 la gear rereleased its unstoppable retro range which saw sneaker lines such as the kaj and starshooter high available in a variety of fashionable and brash colour schemes chris brown even wore a pair of black white kaj in one of his music videos and later the movie pain gain also featured subtle product placement of them la gear rereleased its stardust womens fashion line in 2009 and later released a new version of the popular la lights9 la gear also joined the rocker bottom shoe craze that year by releasing the walk n tone sneaker line for women10 la gear released its hollywood mens sneaker in 2012 alongside the unstoppable range in october 2014 la gear underwent another revamp of some of its product lines and announced its 2015 springsummer launch with new sneakers such as the la lights liquid gold edition and the t raww runner endorsed by us rapper tyga11121314 referencesedit
