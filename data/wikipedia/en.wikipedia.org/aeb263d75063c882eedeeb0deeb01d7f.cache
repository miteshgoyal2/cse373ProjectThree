hickey is of irish descent the last name carey was adopted by her venezuelan grandfather francisco núñez after immigrating to new york7 patricia was an occasional opera singer and vocal coach before she met alfred in 19606 as he began earning a living as an aeronautical engineer the couple wed later that year and moved into a small suburb in new york7 after their elopement patricias family disowned her due to her marrying a black man carey later explained that growing up she felt a notion of neglect from her maternal family a mark that affected her greatly7 during the years between the births of careys older sister alison and herself the carey family struggled within the community due to their ethnicity7 careys name was derived from the song they call the wind maria originally from the 1951 broadway musical paint your wagon89 when carey was three her parents divorced10 its been difficult for me moving around so much having to grow up by myself my parents divorced and i always felt kind of different from everybody else in my neighborhoods i was a different person ethnically and sometimes that can be a problem if you look a certain way everybody goes white girl and id go no thats not what i am —carey on her childhood11 after their separation alison moved in with her father while the other two children mariah and brother morgan remained with their mother carey would grow apart from her father and would later stop seeing him altogether1012 by the age of four carey recalled that she had begun to sneak the radio under her covers at night and just sing and try to find peace within the music12 during elementary school she excelled in subjects that she enjoyed such as music art and literature but did not find interest in others after several years of financial struggles patricia earned enough money to move her family into a stable and more affluent sector in new york13 carey had begun writing poems and adding melodies to them thus starting as a singersongwriter while attending harborfields high school in greenlawn new york14 where she graduated in 198715 carey excelled in her music and demonstrated usage of the whistle register though only beginning to master and control it through her training with her mother though introducing her daughter to classical opera patricia never pressured her to pursue a career in it as she never seemed interested carey recalled that she kept her singersongwriter works a secret and noted that patricia had never been a pushy mom she never said give it more of an operatic feel i respect opera like crazy but it didnt influence me1416 while in high school carey began writing songs with gavin christopher they needed an assistant who could play the keyboard we called someone and he couldnt come so by accident we stumbled upon ben margulies ben came to the studio and he really couldnt play the keyboards very well – he was really more of a drummer – but after that day we kept in touch and we sort of clicked as writers16 carey and christopher began writing and composing songs in the basement of his fathers store during careys senior year after composing their first song together here we go round again which carey described as having a motown vibe they continued writing material for a fulllength demo17 she began living in a onebedroom apartment in manhattan which she shared with four other female students1819 carey worked as a waitress for various restaurants usually getting fired after two weeks20 while requiring work to pay for her rent carey still had musical ambitions as she continued working late into the night with margulies in hopes of completing a demo20 after completing her four song demo tape carey attempted to pass it to music labels but failed each time21 shortly thereafter she was introduced to rising pop singer brenda k starr2122 career 1988–1992 mariah carey and emotions carey exiting shepherds bush empire after promoting her single vision of love on wogan in 1990 as starrs friendship with carey grew so did her interest in helping carey succeed in the industry in december 1988 carey accompanied starr to a record executives gala where she handed her demo tape to the head of columbia records tommy mottola who listened to it on his way back home2324 after the first two songs he was interested in her later after searching for carey for two weeks he immediately signed her and began mapping out her commercial debut23 while she maintained that she wanted to continue working with margulies mottola enlisted top producers of the time including ric wake narada michael walden and rhett lawrence23 mottola and the staff at columbia had planned to market carey as their main female pop artist competing with whitney houston and madonna signed to arista and sire records respectively25 after the completion of her debut album mariah carey columbia spent more than 1 million promoting it26 despite a weak start the album eventually reached the top of the billboard 200 after careys exposure at the 33rd annual grammy awards27 mariah carey stayed atop the charts for eleven consecutive weeks28 and she won the best new artist and best female pop vocal performance awards for her single vision of love29 in addition to vision of love the album yielded the billboard hot 100 number one singles love takes time someday and i dont wanna cry30 carey became the first artist since the jackson 5 to have its first four singles reach number one31 mariah carey finished as the bestselling album in the united states in 199132 while totaling sales of over 15 million copies33 carey began recording her second studio album emotions in 19913435 she described it as an homage to motown soul music as she felt the need to pay tribute to the type of music that had influenced her as a child35 for the project carey worked with walter afanasieff who only had a small role on her debut as well as robert clivillés and david cole from the dance group cc music factory36 careys relationship with margulies deteriorated over a personal contract carey had signed with him before signing the record deal with columbia agreeing to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs but half of her earnings as well however when the time came to write music for emotions sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to cowriters on an album margulies later filed a lawsuit against sony which ultimately led to their parting of ways35 emotions was released on september 17 1991 and was accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor37 while praised for careys improved songwriting production and new sound the album was criticized for its material thought weaker than that of her debut38 though the album managed sales of over eight million copies globally emotions failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor39 as after the release of her debut critics again questioned whether carey would embark on a world tour to promote her material40 although carey explained that stage fright and the style of her songs made a tour very daunting speculation grew that carey was a studio worm and that she was incapable of producing the perfect pitch and 5octave vocal range for which she was known4142 in hopes of putting to rest any claims of her being a manufactured artist carey and walter afanasieff decided to book an appearance on mtv unplugged a television program aired by mtv43 the show presented name artists unplugged or stripped of studio equipment43 while carey favored her more soulful and powerful songs it was decided that her most popular content would be included days before the shows taping carey and afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song in order to provide something different and unexpected44 they chose ill be there a song made popular by the jackson 5 in 1970 on march 16 1992 carey recorded a sevenpiece setlist at kaufman astoria studios in queens new york45 the revue was met with critical acclaim leading to it being aired more than three times as often as an average episode would46 the success tempted sony officials to market it47 sony decided to release it as an ep priced low because it was short the ep proved to be a success contrary to critics and speculations that carey was just a studio artist48 and was given a tripleplatinum certification by the recording industry association of america riaa49 and managed gold and platinum certifications in several european markets47 1993–1996 music box and daydream during early 1993 carey began working on her third studio album music box50 after emotions failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album carey and columbia came to the agreement that the next album would contain a more pop influenced sound in order to appeal to a wider audience50 during careys writing sessions she began working mostly with afanasieff with whom she cowrote and produced most of music box51 on august 31 music box was released around the world debuting at numberone on the billboard 20052 the album was met with mixed reception from music critics while many praised the albums pop influence and strong content others felt that carey made less usage of her acclaimed vocal range53 ron wynn from allmusic described careys different form of singing on the album it was wise for carey to display other elements of her approach but sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion54 the albums second single hero would eventually come to be one of careys most popular and inspirational songs of her career55 the song became careys eighth chart topper in the united states55 and began expanding careys popularity throughout europe with the release of the albums third single carey achieved several career milestones her cover of badfingers without you became her first number one single in germany sweden56 and the united kingdom57 music box spent prolonged periods at number one on the album charts of several countries58 and eventually became one of the bestselling albums of all time with worldwide sales of over 28 million copies59 after declining to tour for her past two albums carey agreed to embark on a short stateside string of concerts titled the music box tour60 spanning only six dates across north america60 the short but successful tour was a large step for carey who dreaded the hassle of touring61 following music box carey took a relatively large period of time away from the public eye and began working on an unknown project throughout 199462 in october 1994 billboard announced that carey would release a holiday album later that year62 that 1994 carey recorded a duet with luther vandross a cover of lionel richie and diana rosss endless love63 careys album merry christmas was released on november 1 1994 on the same day that the albums first single all i want for christmas is you was released64 the album eventually became the bestselling christmas album of all time with global sales reaching over 15 million copies656667 additionally all i want for christmas is you was critically lauded and is considered one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon65 rolling stone described it as a holiday standard and ranked it fourth on its greatest rock and roll christmas songs list68 commercially it became the bestselling holiday ringtone of all time69 and the bestselling single by a nonasian artist in japan70 selling over 21 million units both ringtone and digital download7172 by the end of the holiday season of 1994 carey and afanasieff had already begun writing material for her next studio album which would be released late the following year73 carey performing one sweet day alongside boyz ii men during a taping at madison square garden in october 1995 released on october 3 1995 daydream combined the pop sensibilities of music box with downbeat rb and hip hop influences74 the albums second single one sweet day was inspired by the death of david cole75 the song remained atop the hot 100 for a recordholding 16 weeks and became the longestrunning numberone song in history76 daydream became her biggestselling album in the united states77 and became her second album to be certified diamond by the riaa following music box49 the album again was the bestseller by an international artist in japan shipping over 22 million copies78 and eventually reaching global sales of over 20 million copies79 critically the album was heralded as careys best to date the new york times named it one of 1995s

overseas artist of the year in japan85 1997–2000 new image and independence butterfly and rainbow with her following albums carey began to take more initiative and control with her music and started infusing more genres into her work8687 for butterfly she sought to work with other producers and writers other than afanasieff such as sean combs kamaal fareed missy elliott and jean claude oliver and samuel barnes from trackmasters87 during the albums recording carey and mottola separated with carey citing it as her way of achieving freedom and a new lease on life88 aside from the albums different approach critics took notice of careys altered style of singing which she described as breathy vocals89 her newfound style of singing was met with mixed reception some critics felt this was a sign of maturity that she did not feel the need to always show off her upper range90 while others felt it was a sign of her weakening and waning voice9192 the albums lead single honey and its accompanying music video introduced a more overtly sexual image than carey had ever demonstrated and furthered reports of her freedom from mottola93 carey believed that her image was not that much of a departure from what ive done in the past its not like i went psycho and thought i would be a rapper personally this album is about doing whatever the hell i wanted to do93 reviews for butterfly were generally positive rolling stone wrote its not as if carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine houstonstyle balladry but the predominant mood of butterfly is one of coolly erotic reverie94 allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine described careys vocals as sultrier and more controlled than ever and heralded butterfly as one of her best records and illustrates that carey continues to improve and refine her music which makes her a rarity among her 90s peers95 the album was a commercial success although not to the degree of her previous albums mariah carey music box and daydream96 carey at the edwards air force base during the making of the i still believe music video in december 1998 carey began developing other projects during the late 1990s97 on april 14 1998 carey partook in the vh1 divas benefit concert where she sang alongside aretha franklin celine dion shania twain gloria estefan and carole king98 carey had begun developing a film project all that glitters later retitled to simply glitter99 and wrote songs for other projects such as men in black 1997 and how the grinch stole christmas 200097 after glitter fell into developmental hell carey postponed the project and began writing material for a new album97 sony music executives wanted her to prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the holiday season100 they wanted to release an album that featured her number one singles in the united states and her international chart toppers on the european versions without any new material while carey felt that a compilation album should reflect on her most personal songs not just her most commercial101 the album titled 1s 1998 featured a duet with whitney houston when you believe which was included on the soundtrack for the prince of egypt 1998101 1s became a phenomenon in japan selling over one million copies in its opening week making carey as the only international artist to accomplish this feat102 it sold over 325 million copies in japan after only the first three months and holds the record as the bestselling album by a nonasian artist102 during the spring of 1999 carey began working on the final album per her record contract with sony103 but due to the pressure and the awkward relationship carey had developed with sony she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999 quicker than any of her other albums104 titled rainbow 1999 the album found carey once again working with a new array of music producers and songwriters such as jayz and dj clue105 carey also wrote two ballads with david foster and diane warren whom she used to replace afanasieff105 rainbow was released on november 2 1999 to the highest first week sales of her career at the time however debuting at number two on the billboard 200106 in the meantime careys troubled relationship with columbia grew as they halted promotion after the albums first two singles106 they felt rainbow didnt have any strong single to be released whereas carey wanted to release a ballad106 this led to a very public feud as carey began posting messages on her website telling fans inside information on the dispute as well as instructing them to request cant take that away mariahs theme on radio stations107 the song was ultimately released but carey found out that the song had only been given a very limited and lowpromotion release which made it commercially nonviable108 critical reception of rainbow was generally enthusiastic with the sunday herald saying that the album sees her impressively tottering between soul ballads and collaborations with rb heavyweights like snoop doggy dogg and usher its a polished collection of popsoul109 though a commercial success rainbow became careys lowest selling album to that point in her career110 2001–2004 personal and professional struggles glitter and charmbracelet after she received billboards artist of the decade award and the world music award for bestselling female artist of the millennium111 carey parted from columbia and signed an estimated 100 million fivealbum recording contract with virgin records america emi records in april 2001112113 carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project113 she opted to record an album partly mixed with 1980s influenced disco and other similar genres in order to go handinhand with the films setting114 she often stated that columbia had regarded her as a commodity with her separation from mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives just a few months later in july 2001 it was widely reported that carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown she had left messages on her website that complained of being overworked115 and her threeyear relationship with the singer luis miguel ended116 in an interview the following year she said i was with people who didnt really know me and i had no personal assistant id do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night if that117 due to the pressure from the media her heavy work schedule and the split from miguel carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings118 on july 19 2001 carey made a surprise appearance on the mtv program total request live trl119 as the shows host carson daly began taping following a commercial break carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large mens shirt and began a striptease in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble119 while she later revealed that daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance careys appearance on trl garnered strong media attention118 only days later carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website im trying to understand things in life right now and so i really dont feel that i should be doing music right now what id like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video all i really want is to just be me and thats what i should have done in the first place i dont say this much but guess what i dont take care of myself119 following the quick removal of the messages berger commented that carey had been obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly when she posted the letters120 carey performing hero during her charmbracelet world tour in september 2003 on july 26 she was suddenly hospitalized citing extreme exhaustion and a physical and emotional breakdown121 carey was inducted at an undisclosed hospital in connecticut and remained hospitalized and under doctors care for two weeks followed by an extended absence from the public121 following the heavy media coverage surrounding careys publicized breakdown and hospitalization virgin records america and 20th century fox delayed the release of both glitter as well as its soundtrack of the same name120122 when discussing the projects weak commercial reaction carey blamed both her frame of mind during the time of its release its postponement as well as the soundtrack having been released on september 11123 critics panned glitter as well as its accompanying soundtrack both were unsuccessful commercially124 the accompanying soundtrack album glitter became careys lowestselling album to that point the st louis postdispatch dismissed it as an absolute mess thatll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that while not always critically heralded was at least nearly consistently successful125 following the negative cloud that was enveloping careys personal life at the time as well as the projects poor reception her 100 million fivealbum record deal with virgin records america emi records was bought out for 50 million113126 soon after carey flew to capri italy for a period of five months in which she began writing material for her new album stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year118 carey later said that her time at virgin was a complete and total stressfest i made a total snap decision which was based on money and i never make decisions based on money i learned a big lesson from that127 later that year she signed a contract with island records valued at more than 24 million128 and launched the record label monarc to add further to careys emotional burdens her

american national anthem to rave reviews at the super bowl xxxvi at the louisiana superdome in new orleans louisiana131 towards the end of 2002 carey released her next studio album charmbracelet which she said marked a new lease on life for her117 though released in the wake of glitter and careys return to the music scene sales of charmbracelet were moderate and the quality of careys vocals came under criticism joan anderson from the boston globe declared the album the worst of her career and revealed a voice that is no longer capable of either gravitydefying gymnastics or soft coos132 while allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine expressed similar sentiments and wrote what is a greater problem is that mariahs voice is shot sounding in tatters throughout the record she can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravitydefying vocal runs133 in april 2003 carey announced she would be touring later in the year134 the charmbracelet world tour an intimate evening

considered careys centerless ballads writing careys strawberry shortcake soul still provides the template with which teenpop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless diane warren ballads its largely because of blige that the new rb demands a greater range of emotional expression smarter poetry more fromthegut testifying and less sic unnecessary notes than the squeakyclean and just plain squeaky mariah era nowadays its the christina aguileras and jessica simpsons who awkwardly oversing while the women with roofraising lung power keep it in check when tune or lyric demands288 careys

breathiness307 while usa todays elysa gardner wrote its impossible to deny the impact her vocal style a florid blend of breathy riffing and resonant belting has had on todays young pop and rb stars308 sasha frerejones of the new yorker adds her timbre possesses various colors saying careys sound changes with nearly every line mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid breathy coo her wide vocal range allows carey to take melodies from alto bottom notes to coloratura soprano upper register65 carey also possesses a whisper register in an interview with the singer ron givens of entertainment weekly described it this way first a rippling soulful ooh comes rolling effortlessly from her throat alto then after a quick breath she goes for the stratosphere with a sound that nearly changes the barometric pressure in the room in one brief swoop she seems to squeal and roar at the same time309 her sense of pitch is admired306 and jon pareles adds she can linger over sensual turns growl with playful confidence syncopate like a scat singer with startlingly exact pitch306 legacy carey performing hero live during the neighborhood inaugural ball for president obama careys vocal style and singing ability have significantly impacted popular and contemporary music as music critic g brown from the denver post wrote for better or worse mariah careys fiveoctave range and melismatic style have influenced a generation of pop singers310 according to rolling stone her mastery of melisma the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like vision of love inspired the entire american idol vocal school for better or worse and virtually every other female rb singer since the nineties311 jody rosen of slate wrote of careys influence in modern music calling her the most influential vocal stylist of the last two decades the person who made rococo melismatic singing312 rosen further exemplified careys influence by drawing parallel with american idol which to her often played out as a clash of melismamad mariah wannabes and today nearly 20 years after careys debut major labels continue to bet the farm on young stars such as the winner of britains x factor show leona lewis with her generation next gloss on mariahs big voice and big hair312 sean daly of st petersburg times wrote depending on how you feel about public humiliation the bestworst parts of american idol are the audition shows which normally break down into three distinct parts1 the talented kids2 the weird kids3 the mariahs daly further commented the mariahs are the hardest ones to watch mainly because most of them think theyre reeeaaally good the poor disillusioned hopefuls plant themselves in front of judges simon cowell paula abdul and randy jackson – then proceed to stretch break and mutilate every note of a song often mariahs hero a tune that has ruined more throats than smokers cough313 new york magazines editor roger deckker said that in regarding carey as an influential artist in music he commented that whitney houston may have introduced melisma the vocally acrobatic style of lending a word an extra syllable or twenty to the charts but it was mariah—with her jawdropping range—who made it into americas default sound deckker also added that every time you turn on american idol you are watching her children314 despite her vocal prowess careys vocal technique particularly with the use of melisma and belting has been subject to public scrutiny mainly because of young singers such as from talent shows have been overly imitating her singing technique in which critics commented mariah carey is without a doubt the worst thing to happen to amateur singing since the karaoke machine313 as professor katherine l meizel noted in her book the mediation of identity politics in american idol careys influence not just stops in the emulation of melisma or her singing amongst the wannabes its also her persona her diva her stardom which inspires them a prefame conic look315 among the hip hop pop and rb artists who have cited carey as an influence are aneeka316 ariana grande317 britney spears318 beyoncé65 katy perry319 lady gaga320 bridgit mendler321 christina aguilera322 jessica simpson308 rihanna323 grimes324 kelly clarkson325 nelly furtado326 bonnie mckee327 leona lewis328 brandy norwood311 pink329 mary j blige330 melanie fiona331 missy elliott65 sam smith332333 hikaru utada334 regine velasquez sarah geronimo charice335 jordin sparks336 justin bieber337 and jessica sanchez338 according to stevie wonder when people talk about the great influential singers they talk about aretha whitney and mariah thats a testament to her talent her range is that amazing339 beyoncé credits careys singing and her song vision of love as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child as well as helping her pursue a career as a musician65 rihanna has stated that carey is one of her major influences and idol323 christina aguilera said in the early stages of her career that carey was a big influence in her singing career and one of her idols322 according to pier dominguez author of christina aguilera a star is made aguilera has stated how she loved listening to whitney houston but it was carey who had the biggest influence on her vocal styling careys carefully choreographed image of a grown woman struck a chord with aguilera her influence on aguilera also grew from the fact that both are of mixed heritage340 philip brasor editor of the japan times expressed how careys vocal and melismatic style even influenced asian singers he wrote that japanese singer hikaru utada sang what she heard from the diaphragm and with her own take on the kind of melisma that became de rigueur in american pop after the ascendance of mariah carey334 in an article titled out with mariahs melisma in with keshas kick writer david browne of the new york times discusses how the once ubiquitous melisma pop style suddenly lost in favor of the now ubiquitous autotune in which the former was heavily popularized by the likes of mariah carey and whitney houston browne had commented but beginning two decades ago melisma overtook pop in a way it hadnt before mariah careys debut hit from 1990 vision of love followed two years later by whitney houstons version of i will always love you set the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard browne further added a subsequent generation of singers including ms aguilera jennifer hudson and beyoncé built their careers around melisma men like brian mcknight and tyrese also indulged in it but women tended to dominate the form341 carey is also credited for introducing rb and hip hop into mainstream pop culture and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post1995 songs sasha frerejones editor of the new yorker commented it became standard for rbhiphop stars like missy elliott and beyoncé to combine melodies with rapped verses and young white pop stars—including britney spears jessica simpson christina aguilera and n sync—have spent much of the past ten years making pop music that is unmistakably rb moreover jones concludes that careys idea of pairing a female songbird with the leading male mcs of hiphop changed rb and eventually all of pop although now anyone is free to use this idea the success of the emancipation of mimi suggests that it still belongs to carey65 judnick mayard writer of the fader wrote that in regarding of rb and hip hop collaboration the champion of this movement is mariah carey mayard also expressed that to this day odb and mariah may still be the best and most random hip hop collaboration of all time citing that due to the record fantasy rb and hiphop were the best of step siblings342 kelefa sanneh of the new york times wrote in the mid1990s ms carey pioneered a subgenre that some people call the thuglove duet nowadays cleancut pop stars are expected to collaborate with roughneck rappers but when ms carey teamed up with ol dirty bastard of the wutang clan for the 1995 hit fantasy remix it was a surprise and a smash343 aside from her pop
