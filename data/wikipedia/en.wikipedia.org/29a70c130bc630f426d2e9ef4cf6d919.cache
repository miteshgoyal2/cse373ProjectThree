intergovernmental organisation of 52 member states that are mostly former territories of the british empire4 the commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states organised through the commonwealth secretariat and nongovernmental organisations organised through the commonwealth foundation5 the commonwealth dates back to the mid20th century with the decolonisation of the british empire through increased selfgovernance of its territories it was formally constituted by the london declaration in 1949 which established the member states as free and equal6 the symbol of this free association is queen elizabeth ii who is the head of the commonwealth but this role does not carry any power with it while there are over 31 republics and five monarchies who have a different monarch the queen is the ceremonial head of state and reigning constitutional monarch of 16 members of the commonwealth known as commonwealth realms but retains a crown legally distinct from the other realms with the position as monarch being separate from that of head of the commonwealth member states have no legal obligation to one another instead they are united by language history culture and their shared values of democracy free speech human rights and the rule of law5 these values are enshrined in the commonwealth charter7 and promoted by the quadrennial commonwealth games the commonwealth covers more than 29958050 km2 11566870 sq mi 20 of the worlds land area and spans all six inhabited continents if all commonwealth member states were to be united as a single land mass with an estimated population of 2419 billion people nearly a third of the world population8 the commonwealth in 2014 produced a nominal gross domestic product gdp of 1045 trillion representing 14

lr mackenzie king canada jan smuts south africa winston churchill united kingdom peter fraser new zealand john curtin australia queen elizabeth ii in her address to canada on dominion day in 1959 pointed out that the confederation of canada on 1 july 1867 had been the birth of the first independent country within the british empire she declared so it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the commonwealth of nations9 as long ago as 1884 however lord rosebery while visiting australia had described the changing british empire—as some of its colonies became more independent—as a commonwealth of nations10 conferences of british and colonial prime ministers occurred periodically from the first one in 1887 leading to the creation of the imperial conferences in 191111 the commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences a specific proposal was presented by jan smuts in 1917 when he coined the term the british commonwealth of nations and envisioned the future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence at the paris peace conference of 1919 by delegates from the dominions as well as britain1213 the term first received imperial statutory recognition in the angloirish treaty of 1921 when the term british commonwealth of nations was substituted for british empire in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the irish free state14 dominionsedit in the balfour declaration at the 1926 imperial conference britain and its dominions agreed they were equal in status in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs though united by common allegiance to the crown and freely associated as members of the british commonwealth of nations these aspects to the relationship were formalised by the statute of westminster in 1931 which applied to canada without the need for ratification but australia new zealand and newfoundland had to ratify the statute for it to take effect newfoundland never did as on 16 february 1934 with the consent of its parliament the government of newfoundland voluntarily ended and governance reverted to direct control from london newfoundland later joined canada as its 10th province in 194915 australia and new zealand ratified the statute in 1942 and 1947 respectively1617 although the union of south africa was not among the dominions that needed to adopt the statute of westminster for it to take effect two laws—the status of the union act 1934 and the royal executive functions and seals act of 1934—were passed to confirm south africas status as a sovereign state18 decolonisationedit after world war ii ended the british empire was gradually dismantled most of its components have become independent countries whether commonwealth realms or republics and members of the commonwealth there remain the 14 british overseas territories still held by the united kingdom in april 1949 following the london declaration the word british was dropped from the title of the commonwealth to reflect its changing nature19 burma also known as myanmar 1948 and aden 1967 are the only states that were british colonies at the time of the war not to have joined the commonwealth upon independence former british protectorates and mandates that did not become members of the commonwealth are egypt independent in 1922 iraq 1932

broadcast where she envisioned the commonwealth as an entirely new conception – built on the highest qualities of the spirit of man friendship loyalty and the desire for freedom and peace21 hoped for success was reinforced by such achievements as climbing mount everest in 1953 breaking the four minute mile in 1954 and in 1966 a solo circumnavigation of the globe22 however the humiliation of the suez crisis of 1956 badly hurt morale of britain and the commonwealth as a whole more broadly there was the loss of a central role of the british empire the defence of the empire that role was no longer militarily or financially feasible as britains withdrawal from greece in 1947 had painfully demonstrated britain itself was now just one part of the nato military alliance in which the commonwealth had no role apart from canada the anzus treaty of 1955 linked australia new zealand and the united states in a defensive alliance with britain and the commonwealth left out the second major function of the empire made london the financial centre of the system after the second world war the british treasury was so weak that it could not operate independently of the united states the loss of defence and financial roles furthermore undermined joseph chamberlains early 20th century vision of a world empire that could combine imperial preference mutual defence and social growth arm furthermore britains cosmopolitan role in world affairs became increasingly limited especially with the losses of india and singapore23 while british elites at first hoped the commonwealth would preserve and project british influence they gradually lost their enthusiasm argues krishnan srinivasan early enthusiasm waned as british policies came under fire in commonwealth meetings public opinion became troubled as immigration from nonwhite member states became largescale24 republicsedit on 18 april 1949 ireland formally became a republic in accordance with the irish republic of ireland act 1948 because it did this it was automatically excluded from the commonwealth while ireland had not actively participated in the commonwealth since the early 1930s and was content to leave the commonwealth other dominions wished to become republics without losing commonwealth ties the issue came to a head in april 1949 at a commonwealth prime ministers meeting in london under the london declaration india agreed that when it became a republic in january 1950 it would accept the british sovereign as a symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the head of the commonwealth upon hearing this king george vi told the indian politician krishna menon so ive become as such25 the other commonwealth countries recognised indias continuing membership of the association at pakistans insistence india was not regarded as an exceptional case and it was assumed that other states would be accorded the same treatment as indiacitation needed the london declaration is often seen as marking the beginning of the modern commonwealth following indias precedent other nations became republics or constitutional monarchies with their own monarchs while some countries retained the same monarch as the united kingdom but their monarchies developed differently and soon became fully independent of the british monarchy the monarch is regarded as a separate legal personality in each realm even though the same person is monarch of each realmcitation needed new commonwealthedit planners in the interwar period like lord davies who had also taken a prominent part in building up the league of nations union in the united kingdom in 1932 founded the new commonwealth society of which british section winston churchill became the president26 this new society

in great britain especially in the 1960s and 1970s to refer to recently decolonised countries predominantly nonwhite and developing it was often used in debates about immigration from these countries27 britain and the pre1945 dominions became informally known as the old commonwealth or more pointedly as the white commonwealth28 plan g and inviting europe to joinedit at a time when germany and france together with belgium italy luxembourg and the netherlands were planning for what later became the european union and newly independent african countries were joining the commonwealth new ideas were floated to prevent britain from becoming isolated in economic affairs british trade with the commonwealth was four times larger than trade with europe the british government under prime minister anthony eden considered in 1956 and 1957 a plan g to create a european free trade zone while also protecting the favoured status of the commonwealth293031 britain also considered inviting scandinavian and other european countries to join the commonwealth so it would become a major economic common market at one point in october 1956 eden and french prime minister guy

technical extent of this concept varies in different countries for example in australia for the purpose of considering certain constitutional and legal provisions no distinction is made between commonwealth and foreign countries in the high court case of sue v hill other commonwealth countries were held to be foreign powers similarly in nolan v minister for immigration and ethnic affairs the nationals of other commonwealth realms were held to be aliens nevertheless the closer association amongst commonwealth countries is reflected at least in the diplomatic protocols of the commonwealth countries for example when engaging bilaterally with one another commonwealth governments exchange high commissioners instead of ambassadors between two commonwealth realms they represent the head of government rather than the head of statecitation needed in addition some members treat resident citizens of other commonwealth countries preferentially to citizens of noncommonwealth countries britain and several others mostly in the caribbean grant the right to vote to commonwealth citizens who reside in those countries in noncommonwealth countries in which their own country is not represented

displayed in green criteriaedit main article commonwealth of nations membership criteria the criteria for membership of the commonwealth of nations have developed over time from a series of separate documents the statute of westminster 1931 as a fundamental founding document of the organisation laid out that membership required dominionhood the 1949 london declaration ended this allowing republican and indigenous monarchic members on the condition that they recognised the british monarch as the head of the commonwealth43 in the wake of the wave of decolonisation in the 1960s these constitutional principles were augmented by political economic and social principles the first of these was set out in 1961 when it was decided that respect for racial equality would be a requirement for membership leading directly to the withdrawal of south africas reapplication which they were required to make under the formula of the london declaration upon becoming a republic the 14 points of the 1971 singapore declaration dedicated all members to the principles of world peace liberty human rights equality and free trade44 these criteria were unenforceable for two decades45 until in 1991 the harare declaration was issued dedicating the leaders to applying the singapore principles to the completion of decolonisation the end of the cold war and the end of apartheid in south africa46 the mechanisms by which these principles would be applied were created and the manner clarified by the 1995 millbrook commonwealth action programme which created the commonwealth ministerial action group cmag which has the power to rule on whether members meet the requirements for membership under the harare declaration47 also in 1995 an intergovernmental group was created to finalise and codify the full requirements for membership upon reporting in 1997 as adopted under the edinburgh declaration the intergovernmental group ruled that any future members would have to have a direct constitutional link with an existing member48 in addition to this new rule the former rules were consolidated into a single document these requirements are that members must accept and comply with the harare principles be fully sovereign states recognise the monarch of the commonwealth realms as the head of the commonwealth accept the english language as the means of commonwealth communication and respect the wishes of the general population with regard to commonwealth membership48 these requirements had undergone review and a report on potential amendments was presented by the committee on commonwealth membership at the 2007 commonwealth heads of government meeting49 new members were not admitted at this meeting though applications for admission were considered at the 2009 chogm50 new members must as a general rule have a direct constitutional link to an existing member in most cases this is due to being a former colony of the united kingdom but some have links to other countries either exclusively or more directly eg samoa to new zealand papua new guinea to australia and namibia to south africa the first member to be admitted without having any constitutional link to the british empire or a commonwealth member was mozambique a former portuguese colony in 1995 following its first democratic elections and south africas readmission in 1994 mozambiques controversial entry led to the edinburgh declaration and the current membership guidelines51 in 2009 rwanda became the second commonwealth member admitted not to have any such constitutional links it was a belgian trust

application to rejoin66 other eligible applicants could be any of the remaining inhabited british overseas territories crown dependencies australian external territories and the associated states of new zealand if they become fully independent67 many such jurisdictions are already directly represented within the commonwealth particularly through the commonwealth family68 there are also former british possessions that have not become independent for example hong kong which still participates in some of the institutions within the commonwealth family all three crown dependencies regard the existing situation as unsatisfactory and have lobbied for change the states of jersey have called on the uk foreign secretary to request that the commonwealth heads of government consider granting associate membership to jersey and the other crown dependencies as well as any other territories at a similarly advanced stage of autonomy jersey has proposed that it be accorded selfrepresentation in all commonwealth meetings full participation in debates and procedures with a right to speak where relevant and the opportunity to enter into discussions with those who are full members and no right to vote in the ministerial or heads of government meetings which is reserved for full members69 the states of guernsey and the government of the isle of man have made calls of a similar nature for a more integrated relationship with the commonwealth70 including more direct representation and enhanced participation in commonwealth organisations and meetings including commonwealth heads of government meetings71 the chief minister of the isle of man has said a closer connection with the commonwealth itself would be a welcome further development of the islands international relationships72 at the time of the suez crisis in 1956 in the face of colonial unrest and international tensions french premier guy mollet proposed to british prime minister anthony eden that their two countries be joined in a union when that proposal was turned down mollet suggested that france joined the commonwealth possibly with a common citizenship arrangement on the irish basis talks regarding a form of union faded away with the end of the suez crisis73 suspensionedit main article suspension from the commonwealth of nations in recent years the commonwealth has suspended several members from the councils of the commonwealth for serious or persistent violations of the harare declaration particularly in abrogating their responsibility to have democratic government74 this is done by the commonwealth ministerial action group cmag which meets regularly to address potential breaches of the harare declaration suspended members are not represented at meetings of commonwealth leaders and ministers although they remain members of the organisation currently there are no suspended memberscitation needed nigeria was suspended between 11 november 1995 and 29 may 199975 following its execution of ken sarowiwa on the eve of the 1995 chogm76 pakistan was the second country to be suspended on 18 october 1999 following the military coup by pervez musharraf77 the commonwealths longest suspension came to an end on 22 may 2004 when pakistans suspension was lifted following the restoration of the countrys constitution78 pakistan was suspended for a second time far more briefly for six months from 22 november 2007 when musharraf called a state of emergency79 zimbabwe was suspended in 2002 over concerns regarding the electoral and land reform policies of robert mugabes zanupf government80 before it withdrew from the organisation in 200381 the declaration of a republic in fiji in 1987 after military coups designed to deny indofijians political power

reapplication for membership made8283 fiji has since been suspended twice with the first imposed from 6 june 200084 to 20 december 2001 after another coup80 fiji was suspended yet again in december 2006 following the most recent coup at first the suspension applied only to membership on the councils of the commonwealth8285 after failing to meet a commonwealth deadline for setting a date for national elections by 2010 fiji was fully suspended on 1 september 20098285 the secretarygeneral of the commonwealth kamalesh sharma confirmed that full suspension meant that fiji would be excluded from commonwealth meetings sporting events and the technical assistance programme with an exception for assistance in reestablishing democracy sharma stated that fiji would remain a member of the commonwealth during its suspension but would be excluded from emblematic representation by the secretariat82 on 19 march 2014 fijis full suspension was amended to a suspension from councils of the commonwealth by the commonwealth ministerial action group permitting fiji to join a number of commonwealth activities including the commonwealth games86 fijis suspension was lifted in september 201487 the commonwealth ministerial action group fully reinstated fiji as a member following elections in september 201488 most recently during 2013 and 2014 international pressure mounted to suspend sri lanka from the commonwealth citing grave human rights violations by the government of president mahinda rajapaksa there were also calls to change the commonwealth heads of government meeting 2013 from sri lanka to another member country canadian prime minister stephen harper threatened to boycott the event but was instead represented at the meeting by deepak obhrai the uk foreign affairs committee called upon prime minister david cameron to boycott the event however he chose to attend8990 these concerns were rendered moot by the election of opposition leader maithripala sirisena as president in

of breakaway bangladesh but rejoined on 2 august 1989 zimbabwes membership was suspended in 2002 on the grounds of alleged human rights violations and deliberate misgovernment and zimbabwes government terminated its membership in 200391 the gambia left the commonwealth on 3 october 201364 maldives withdrew from the commonwealth on 13 october 201692 the maldivian ministry of foreign affairs stated that the commonwealth has not recognised the progress and achievements that the maldives accomplished in cultivating a culture of democracy in the country and in building and strengthening democratic institutions93 the ministry also cited the commonwealths punitive actions against the maldives since 2012 after the allegedly forced resignation of maldivian president mohamed nasheed among the reasons for withdrawal93 the ministry characterized the decision to withdraw as difficult but inevitable93 although heads of government have the power to suspend member states from active participation the commonwealth has no provision for the expulsion of members until 2007 commonwealth realms that became republics automatically ceased to be members until like india in 1950 they obtained the permission of other members to remain in the organisation this policy has been changed so if any current commonwealth realms were to become republics they would not have to go through this process94 ireland had withdrawn its participation in the commonwealth in the 1930s attending its last commonwealth governmental heads meeting in 1932 however it continued to be regarded by the commonwealth as a commonwealth member until it declared itself a republic on 18 april 1949 it is the only country whose membership terminated without any declaration withdrawing from the organisation instead it was with its own tacit support excluded from the organisation under the rules then applicablecitation needed south africa was barred from continuing as a member after it became a republic in 1961 due to hostility from many members particularly those in africa and asia as well as canada to its policy of racial apartheid the south african government withdrew its application to remain in the organisation as a republic when it became clear at the 1961 commonwealth prime ministers conference that any such application would be rejected south africa was readmitted to the commonwealth in 1994 following its first multiracial elections that yearcitation needed the transfer of sovereignty over hong kong in 1997 ended the colonys ties to the commonwealth through the united kingdom the government of hong kong as a special administrative region of china did not pursue membership hong kong has nevertheless continued to participate in some of the organisations of the commonwealth family such as the commonwealth lawyers association hosted the commonwealth lawyers conference in 1983 and 2009 the commonwealth parliamentary association and the westminster seminar on parliamentary practice and procedures the association of commonwealth universities and the commonwealth association of legislative counsel9596 politicsedit objectives and activitiesedit the commonwealths objectives were first outlined in the 1971 singapore declaration which committed the commonwealth to the institution of world peace promotion of representative democracy and individual liberty the pursuit of equality and opposition to racism the fight against poverty ignorance and disease and free trade97 to these were added opposition to discrimination on the basis of gender by the lusaka declaration of 197944 and environmental sustainability by the langkawi declaration of 198998 these objectives were reinforced by the harare declaration in 199199 the commonwealths current highestpriority aims are on the promotion of democracy and development as outlined in the 2003 aso rock declaration100 which built on those in singapore and harare and clarified their terms of reference stating we are committed to democracy good governance human rights gender equality and a more equitable sharing of the benefits of globalisation101 the commonwealth website lists its areas of work as democracy economics

been accused of not being vocal enough on its core values allegations of a leaked memo from the secretary general instructing staff not to speak out on human rights were published in october 2010103 the commonwealth heads of government meeting 2011 considered a report by a commonwealth eminent persons group epg panel which asserted that the organisation had lost its relevance and was decaying due to the lack of a mechanism to censure member countries when they violated human rights or democratic norms104 the panel made 106 urgent recommendations including the adoption of a charter of the commonwealth the creation of a new commissioner on the rule of law democracy and human rights to track persistent human rights abuses and allegations of political repression by commonwealth member states recommendations for the repeal of laws against homosexuality in 41 commonwealth states and a ban on forced marriage105106 the failure to release the report or accept its recommendations for reforms in the area of human rights democracy and the rule of law was decried as a disgrace by former british foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind a member of the epg who told a press conference the commonwealth faces a very significant problem its not a problem of hostility or antagonism its more of a problem of indifference its purpose is being questioned its relevance is being questioned and part of that is because its commitment to enforce the values for which it stands is becoming ambiguous in the eyes of many member states the commonwealth is not a private club of the governments or the secretariat it belongs to the people of the commonwealth106 in the end twothirds of the epgs 106 urgently recommended reforms were referred to study groups an act described by one epg member as having them kicked into the long grass there was no agreement to create the recommended position of human rights commissioner instead a ministerial management group was empowered with enforcement the group includes alleged human rights offenders it was agreed to develop a charter of values for the commonwealth without any decision on how compliance with its principles would be enforced104 the result of the effort was that a new charter of the commonwealth was signed by queen elizabeth on 11 march 2013 at marlborough house which opposes all forms of discrimination whether rooted in gender race colour creed political belief or other grounds107108 proposed free movement policyedit in march 2015 the commonwealth freedom of movement organisation proposed that the national governments of the united kingdom australia new zealand and canada should advocate for freedom of movement between citizens of their countries similar to the current arrangement existing between australia and new zealand through the transtasman travel arrangement109 in may 2016 australian high commissioner to the united kingdom alexander downer expressed support for freer movement between australia and the

note figures are in us dollars when tradeedit further information commonwealth free trade although the commonwealth does not have a multilateral trade agreement research by the royal commonwealth society has shown that trade with another commonwealth member is up to 50 more than with a nonmember on average with smaller and less wealthy states having a higher propensity to trade within the commonwealth116 at the 2005 summit in malta the heads of government endorsed pursuing free trade among commonwealth members on a bilateral basis117 there have been various proposals for a commonwealth free trade zone118 however none have so far come to pass following its vote in june 2016 to leave the eu some politicians in the united kingdom have suggested the idea as an alternative to its membership in the european union119120 however it is far from clear that this would either offer sufficient economic benefit to replace the impact of leaving the eu or be acceptable to other member states 121 although the eu is already in the process of negotiating free trade agreements with many commonwealth countries such as india and canada it took the eu almost ten years to come to an agreement with canada122123 due to the challenge associated with achieving the necessary euwide approvals commonwealth familyedit main article commonwealth family commonwealth countries share many links outside government with over a hundred commonwealthwide nongovernmental organisations notably for sport culture education law and charity the association of commonwealth universities is an

games include sports particularly popular in the commonwealth such as bowls netball and rugby sevens started in 1930 as the empire games the games were founded on the olympic model of amateurism but were deliberately designed to be the friendly games125 with the goal of promoting relations between commonwealth countries and celebrating their shared sporting and cultural heritage126 the games are the commonwealths most visible activity125 and interest in the operation of the commonwealth increases greatly when the games are held127 there is controversy over whether the games—and sport generally—should be involved in the commonwealths wider political concerns126 the 1977 gleneagles agreement was signed to commit commonwealth countries to combat apartheid through discouraging sporting contact with south africa which was not then a member whilst the 1986 games were boycotted by most african asian and caribbean countries for the failure of other countries to enforce the

quintessentially british in character rooted in and developed under british rule or hegemony including football cricket rugby and netball133 this has led to the development of friendly national rivalries between the main sporting nations that have often defined their relations with each another indeed said rivalries preserved close ties by providing a constant in international relationships even as the empire transformed into the commonwealth134 externally playing these sports is seen to be a sign of sharing a certain commonwealth culture the adoption of cricket at schools in rwanda is seen as symbolic of the countrys move towards commonwealth membership135136 besides the commonwealth games other sporting competitions are organised on a commonwealth basis through championship tournaments such as the commonwealth taekwondo championships commonwealth fencing championships commonwealth judo championships commonwealth rowing championships commonwealth sailing championships
