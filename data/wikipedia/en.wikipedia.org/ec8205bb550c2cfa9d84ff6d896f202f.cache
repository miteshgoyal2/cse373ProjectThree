former german and ottoman colonies the british empire reached its greatest extent covering a fifth of the worlds land surface and a quarter of its population101 however britain had suffered 25 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt100 the rise of irish nationalism and disputes within ireland over the terms of irish home rule led eventually to the partition of the island

strike of 1926 britain had still not recovered from the effects of the war when the great depression 1929–1932 occurred this led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas

industries and public utilities were nationalised a welfare state was established and a comprehensive publicly funded healthcare system the national health service was created109 the rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with britains now muchdiminished economic position so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable independence was granted to india and pakistan in 1947110 over the next three decades most colonies of the british empire gained their independence many became members of the commonwealth of nations111 although the uk was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal with its first atomic bomb test in 1952 the new postwar limits of britains international role were illustrated by the suez crisis of 1956 the international spread of the english language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture112113 as a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s the government encouraged immigration from

1970s the conservative government of the 1980s under margaret thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism deregulation particularly of the financial sector for example big bang in 1986 and labour markets the sale of stateowned companies privatisation and the withdrawal of subsidies to others120 this resulted in high unemployment and social unrest but ultimately also economic growth particularly in the services sector from 1984 the economy was helped by the inflow of substantial north sea oil revenues121 around the end of the 20th century there were major changes to the governance of the uk with the establishment of devolved administrations for scotland wales and northern ireland122 the statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the european convention on human rights the uk is still a key global player diplomatically and militarily it plays leading roles in the eu un and nato however controversy surrounds some of britains overseas military deployments

minister since 2016 the united kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy queen elizabeth ii is the monarch and head of state of the uk as well as queen of fifteen other independent commonwealth countries the monarch has the right to be consulted the right to encourage and the right to warn170 the constitution of the united kingdom is uncodified and consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources including statutes judgemade case law and international treaties together with constitutional conventions171 as there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and constitutional law the uk parliament can perform constitutional reform simply by passing acts of parliament and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution however no parliament can pass laws that future parliaments cannot change172 government main article government of the united kingdom the uk has a parliamentary government based on the westminster system that has been emulated around the world a legacy of the british empire the parliament of the united kingdom meets in the palace of westminster and has two houses an elected house of commons and an appointed house of lords all bills passed are given royal assent before becoming law the position of prime ministernote 15 the uks head of government173 belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of the house of commons this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber the prime minister chooses a cabinet and its members are formally appointed by the monarch to form her majestys government by convention the monarch respects the prime ministers decisions of government174 the palace of westminster seat of both houses of the parliament of the united kingdom the cabinet is traditionally drawn from members of the prime ministers party or coalition and mostly from the house of commons but always from both legislative houses the cabinet being responsible to both executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet all of whom are sworn into the privy council of the united kingdom and become ministers of the crown the current prime minister is theresa may who has been in office since 13 july 2016 may is also the leader of the conservative party for elections to the house of commons the uk is divided into 650 constituencies175 each electing a single member of parliament mp by simple plurality general elections are called by the monarch when the prime minister so advises prior to the fixedterm parliaments act 2011 the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 required that a new election must be called no later than five years after the previous general election176 the conservative party the labour party and the liberal democrats formerly as the liberal party have in modern times been considered the uks three major political parties177 representing the british traditions of conservatism socialism and liberalism respectively178 however in the 2017 general election the scottish national party was the thirdlargest party by number of seats won ahead of the liberal democrats most of the remaining seats were won by parties that contest elections only in one part of the uk plaid cymru wales only and the democratic unionist party and sinn féin northern ireland onlynote 16 in accordance with party policy no elected sinn féin members of parliament have ever attended the house of commons to speak on behalf of their constituents because of the requirement to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch179 devolved administrations main articles devolution in the united kingdom northern ireland executive scottish government and welsh government the scottish parliament building in holyrood is the seat of the scottish parliament scotland wales and northern ireland each have their own government or executive led by a first minister or in the case of northern ireland a diarchal first minister and deputy first minister and a devolved unicameral legislature england the largest country of the united kingdom has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the uks government and parliament on all issues this situation has given rise to the socalled west lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from scotland wales and northern ireland can vote sometimes decisively180 on matters that only affect england181 the mckay commission reported on this matter in march 2013 recommending that laws affecting only england should need support from a majority of english members of parliament182 the scottish government and parliament have wideranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the uk parliament including education healthcare scots law and local government183 at the 2011 elections the scottish national party won reelection and achieved an overall majority in the scottish parliament with its leader alex salmond as first minister of scotland184185 in 2012 the uk and scottish governments signed the edinburgh agreement setting out the terms for a referendum on scottish independence in 2014 which was defeated 553 to 447186 the welsh government and the national assembly for wales have more limited powers than those devolved to scotland187 the assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through acts of the assembly which require no prior consent from westminster the 2011 elections resulted in a minority labour administration led by carwyn jones188 the northern ireland executive and assembly have powers similar to those devolved to scotland the executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the assembly arlene foster democratic unionist party and martin mcguinness sinn féin were first minister and deputy first minister respectively until 2017189 devolution to northern ireland is contingent on participation by the northern ireland administration in the northsouth ministerial council where the northern ireland executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the government of ireland the british and irish governments cooperate on nondevolved matters affecting northern ireland through the british–irish intergovernmental conference which assumes the responsibilities of the northern ireland administration in the event of its nonoperation the uk does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to scotland wales or northern ireland under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty the uk parliament could in theory therefore abolish the scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly190191 indeed in 1972 the uk parliament unilaterally prorogued the parliament of northern ireland setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions192 in practice it would be politically difficult for the uk parliament to abolish devolution to the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions193 the political constraints placed upon the uk parliaments power to interfere with devolution in northern ireland are even greater than in relation to scotland and wales given that devolution in northern ireland rests upon an international agreement with the government of ireland194 law and criminal justice main article law of the united kingdom the royal courts of justice of england and wales the united kingdom does not have a single legal system as article 19 of the 1706 treaty of union provided for the continuation of scotlands separate legal

commonwealth countries the british overseas territories and the crown dependencies198 both english law which applies in england and wales and northern ireland law are based on commonlaw principles199

relevant legal principles which are reported and binding in future similar cases stare decisis200 the courts of england and wales are headed by the senior courts of england and wales consisting of the court of appeal the high court of justice for civil cases and the crown court for criminal cases the supreme court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in england wales and northern ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions201 the high court of justiciary—the supreme criminal court of scotland scots law is a hybrid system based on both commonlaw and civillaw principles the chief courts are the court of session for civil cases202 and the high court of justiciary for criminal cases203 the supreme court of the united kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under scots law204 sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury known as sheriff solemn court or with a sheriff and no jury known as sheriff summary court205 the scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial guilty not guilty and not proven both not guilty and not proven result in an acquittal206 crime in england and wales increased in the period between 1981

scottish parliament is subordinate the white paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation the scottish parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority following the logic of this argument the power of the scottish parliament to

notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes an important common factor is that the uk parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned for example the scottish parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied  but this power to legislate on what may be termed devolved matters is concurrent with the westminster parliaments general power to legislate for scotland on any matter at all including devolved matters  in theory therefore westminster may legislate on scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses  walker g 2010 scotland northern ireland and devolution 1945–1979 journal of british studies 39 1 124 133 doi101086644536  gamble a 2006 the

governments in the northern irish problem means that northern irelands new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement if this can be equated with a treaty it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between westminster and belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states although the agreement makes the general proviso that westminsters powers to make legislation for northern ireland remains unaffected without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters it may be more difficult than in scotland or wales for devolved powers to be repatriated the retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in northern ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary
