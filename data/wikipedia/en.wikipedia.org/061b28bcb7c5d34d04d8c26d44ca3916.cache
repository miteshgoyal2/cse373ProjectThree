substantial fraction of a population in order to monitor that group of citizens1 the surveillance is often carried out by governments or governmental organisations but may also be carried out by corporations either on behalf of governments or at their own initiative depending on each nations laws and judicial systems the legality of and the permission required to engage in mass surveillance varies it is often distinguished from targeted surveillance mass surveillance has often been cited as necessary to fight terrorism to prevent social unrest to protect national security to fight child pornography and protect children and to control the population conversely mass surveillance has equally often been criticized for violating privacy rights limiting civil and political rights and freedoms and being illegal under some legal or constitutional systems another criticism is that increasing mass surveillance could lead to the development of a surveillance state or an electronic police state where civil liberties are infringed or political dissent is undermined by cointelprolike programs such a state could also be referred to as a totalitarian state in 2013 the practice of mass surveillance by world2 governments was called into question after edward snowden‘s 2013 global surveillance disclosure reporting based on documents snowden leaked to various media outlets triggered a debate about civil liberties and the right to privacy in the digital age3 mass surveillance is considered a global issue4567 contents 1 by country 11 australia 12 bahrain 13 canada 14

survey covering 47 countries indicated that there had been an increase in surveillance and a decline in the performance of privacy safeguards compared to the previous year balancing these factors eight countries were rated as being endemic surveillance societies of these eight china malaysia and russia scored lowest followed jointly by singapore and the united kingdom then jointly by taiwan thailand and the united states the best ranking was given to greece which was judged to have adequate safeguards against abuse8 many countries throughout the world have already been adding thousands of surveillance cameras to their urban suburban and even rural areas910 for example in september 2007 the american civil liberties union aclu stated that we are in danger of tipping into a genuine surveillance society completely alien to american values with the potential for a dark future where our every move our every transaction our every communication is recorded compiled and stored away ready to be examined and used against us by the authorities whenever they want11 on 12 march 2013 reporters without borders published a special report on internet surveillance the report included a list of state enemies of the internet countries whose governments are involved in active intrusive surveillance of news providers resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human

of the internet countries whose governments are involved in active intrusive surveillance of news providers resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights all internet access in china is owned or controlled by the state or the communist party many foreign journalists in china have said that they take for granted that their telephones are tapped and their email is monitored12 the tools put in place to filter and monitor the internet are collectively known as the great firewall of china besides the usual routing regulations that allow access to an ip address or a particular domain name to be blocked the great firewall makes largescale use of deep packet inspection dpi technology to monitor and block access based on keyword detection the great firewall has the ability to dynamically block encrypted connections one of the country’s main isps china unicom automatically cuts a connection as soon as it is used to transmit encrypted content12 the monitoring system developed by china is not confined to the great firewall monitoring is also built into social networks chat services and voip private companies are directly responsible to the chinese authorities for surveillance of their networks to ensure banned messages are not circulated the qq application owned by the firm tencent allows the authorities to monitor in detail exchanges between internet users by seeking certain keywords and expressions the author of each message can be identified by his or her user number the qq application is effectively a giant trojan horse and since march 2012 new legislation requires all new users of microblogging sites to register using their own name and telephone number12 skype one of the world’s most popular internet telephone platforms is closely monitored skype services in china are available through a local partner the tom media group the chineselanguage version of skype known as tomskype is slightly different from the downloadable versions in other countries a report by opennet initiative asia13 says everyday conversations are captured on servers interception and storage of a conversation may be triggered by a sender’s or recipient’s name or by keywords that occur in the conversation14 on 30 january the new york times reported that it had been the target of attacks by the chinese government the first breach took place on 13 september 2012 when the newspaper was preparing to publish an article about the fortune amassed by the family of outgoing prime minister wen jiabao the newspaper said the purpose of attacks was to identify the sources that supplied the newspaper with information about corruption among the prime minister’s entourage the wall street journal and cnn also said they had been the targets of cyber attacks from china in february twitter disclosed that the accounts of some 250000 subscribers had been the victims of attacks from china similar to those carried out on the new york times mandiant the company engaged by the nyt to secure its network identified the source of the attacks as a group of hackers it called advanced persistent threat 1 a unit of the people’s liberation army operating from a 12storey building in the suburbs of shanghai that had hundreds possibly thousands of staff and the direct support of the chinese government12 east germanyedit main article mass surveillance in east germany before the digital revolution one of the worlds biggest mass surveillance operations was carried out by the stasi the secret police of the former east germany by the time the state collapsed in 1989 the stasi had built up an estimated civilian network of 300000 informants approximately one in fifty of the population who monitored even minute hints of political dissent among other citizens many west germans visiting friends and family in east germany were also subject to stasi spying as well as many highranking west german politicians and persons in the public eye most east german citizens were well aware that their government was spying on them which led to a culture of mistrust touchy political issues were only discussed in the comfort of their own four walls and only with the closest of friends and family members while widely maintaining a façade of unquestioning followership in public european unionedit the right to privacy is a highly developed area of law in europe the data protection directive regulates the processing of personal data within the european union for comparison the us has no data protection law that is comparable to this instead the us regulates data protection on a sectoral basis15 since early 2012 the european union has been working on a general data protection regulation to replace the data protection directive and harmonise data protection and privacy law on 20 october 2013 a committee at the european parliament backed the measure which if it is enacted could require american companies to seek clearance from european officials before complying with united states warrants seeking private data the vote is part of efforts in europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of revelations about a farreaching spying program by the us national security agency16 european union justice and rights commissioner viviane reding said the question has arisen whether the largescale collection and processing of personal information under us surveillance programmes is necessary and proportionate to meet the interests of national security the eu is also asking the us for changes to us legislation to match the legal redress offered in europe american citizens in europe can go to the courts if they feel their rights are infringed but europeans without right of residence in america cannot17 when the eu us arrangement to implement international safe harbor privacy principles were struck down by the european court of justice a new framework for transatlantic data flows called the euus privacy shield was adopted in july 20161819 in april 2014 the european court of justice declared invalid the eu data retention directive the court said it violates two basic rights respect for private life and protection of personal data20 the legislative body of the european union passed the data retention directive on 15 december 2005 it requires that telecommunication operators retain metadata for telephone internet and other telecommunication services for periods of not less than six months and not more than two years from the date of the communication as determined by each eu member state and upon request to make the data available to various governmental bodies access to this information is not limited to investigation of serious crimes nor is a warrant required for access2122 undertaken

united kingdom has formed part of the public consciousness since the 19th century the postal espionage crisis of 1844 sparked the first panic over the privacy of citizens56 however in the 20th century electronic surveillance capabilities grew out of wartime signal intelligence and pioneering code breaking57 in 1946 the government communications headquarters gchq was formed the united kingdom and the united states signed the bilateral ukusa agreement in 1948 it was later broadened to include canada australia and new zealand as well as cooperation with several thirdparty nations this became the cornerstone of western intelligence gathering and the special relationship between the uk and the usa58 after the growth of the internet and development of the world wide web a series of media reports in 2013 revealed more recent programs and techniques involving gchq such as tempora59 the use of these capabilities is controlled by laws made in the uk parliament in particular access to the content of private messages that is interception of a communication must be authorized by a warrant signed by a secretary of state606162 in addition european union data privacy law applies in uk law the uk exhibits governance and safeguards as well as use of electronic surveillance636465 the investigatory powers tribunal a judicial oversight body for the intelligence agencies ruled in december 2014 that the legislative framework in the united kingdom does not breach the european convention on human rights666768 however the tribunal stated in february 2015 that one particular aspect the datasharing arrangement that allowed uk intelligence services to request data from the us surveillance programs prism and upstream had been in contravention of human rights law prior to this until two paragraphs of additional information providing details about the procedures and safeguards were disclosed to the public in december 2014697071 in its december 2014 ruling the investigatory powers tribunal found that the legislative framework in the united kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while gchq collects and analyses data in bulk it does not practice mass surveillance666768 a report on privacy and security published by the intelligence and security committee of parliament also came to this view although it found past shortcomings in oversight and said the legal framework should be simplified to improve transparency727374 this view is supported by independent reports from the interception of communications commissioner75 however notable civil liberties groups continue to express strong views to the contrary and plan to appeal the ruling to the european court of human rights76 while others have criticised these viewpoints in turn77 raf menwith hill a large site in the united kingdom part of echelon and the ukusa agreement the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 rip or ripa is a significant piece of legislation that granted and regulated the powers of public bodies to carry out surveillance and investigation78 in 2002 the uk government announced plans to extend the regulation of investigatory powers act so that at least 28 government departments would be given powers to access metadata about citizens web email telephone and fax records without a warrant and without a subjects knowledge79 the protection of freedoms act 2012 includes several provisions related to controlling and restricting the collection storage retention and use of information in government databases80 supported by all three major political parties the uk parliament passed the data retention and investigatory powers act in july 2014 to ensure police and security services retain existing powers to access phone and internet records8182 this was superseded by the investigatory powers act 2016 a comprehensive statute which made public a number of previously secret powers equipment interference bulk retention of metadata intelligence agency use of bulk personal datasets and enables the government to require internet service providers and mobile phone companies to maintain records of but not the content of customers internet connections for 12 months in addition it

anderson qc the uks independent reviewer of terrorism legislation a question of trust 201585 and the report of his bulk powers review 201686 which contains a detailed appraisal with 60 case studies of the operational case for the powers often characterised as mass surveillance it may yet require amendment as a consequence of legal cases brought before the court of justice of the european union87 and the european court of human rights88 many advanced nationstates have implemented laws that partially protect citizens from unwarranted intrusion such as the human rights act 1998 and data protection act 1998 in the united kingdom and laws that require a formal warrant before private data may be gathered by a government the uk is a member of the european union participates in its programs and is subject to eu policies and directives on surveillance the vast majority of video surveillance cameras in the uk are not operated by government bodies but by private individuals or companies especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses according to 2011 freedom of information act requests the total number of local government operated cctv cameras was around 52000 over the entirety of the uk89 the prevalence of video surveillance in the uk is often overstated due to unreliable estimates being requoted90 for example one report in 2002 extrapolated from a very small sample to estimate the number of cameras in the uk at 42 million of which 500000 in london91 more reliable estimates put the number of private and local government operated cameras in the united

cointelpro projects conducted by the us federal bureau of investigation fbi between 1956 and 1971 targeted various subversive organizations including peaceful antiwar and racial equality activists such as albert einstein and martin luther king jr billions of dollars per year are spent by agencies such as the national security agency nsa and the federal bureau of investigation fbi to develop purchase implement and operate systems such as carnivore echelon and narusinsight to intercept and analyze the immense amount of data that traverses the internet and telephone system every day94 since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks a vast domestic intelligence apparatus has been built to collect information using the nsa fbi local police state homeland security offices and military criminal investigators the intelligence apparatus collects analyzes and stores information about millions of if not all american citizens many of whom have not been accused of any wrongdoing9596 under the mail isolation control and tracking program the us postal service photographs the exterior of every piece of paper mail that is processed in the united states — about 160 billion pieces in 2012 the us postmaster general stated that the system is primarily used for mail sorting but the images are available for possible use by law enforcement agencies97 created in 2001 following the anthrax attacks that killed five people it is a sweeping expansion of a 100yearold program called mail cover which targets people suspected of crimes98 the fbi developed the computer programs magic lantern and cipav which they can remotely install on a computer system in order to monitor a persons computer activity99 the nsa has been gathering information on financial records internet surfing habits and monitoring emails they have also performed extensive analysis of social networks such as myspace100 the prism special source operation system legally immunized private companies that cooperate voluntarily with us intelligence collection according to the register the fisa amendments act of 2008 specifically authorizes intelligence agencies to monitor the phone email and other communications of us citizens for up to a week without obtaining a warrant when one of the parties is outside the us101 prism was first publicly revealed on 6 june 2013 after classified documents about the program were leaked to the washington post and the guardian by american edward snowden the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea requires that all us telecommunications and internet service providers modify their networks to allow easy wiretapping of telephone voip and broadband internet traffic102103104 in early 2006 usa today reported that several major telephone companies were providing the telephone call records of us citizens to the national security agency nsa which is storing them in a large database known as the nsa call database this report came on the heels of allegations that the us government had been conducting electronic surveillance of domestic telephone calls without warrants105 in 2013 the existence of the hemisphere project through which att provides telephone call data to federal agencies became publicly known traffic cameras which were meant to help enforce traffic laws at intersections may be used by law enforcement agencies for purposes unrelated to traffic violations106 some cameras allow for the identification of individuals inside a vehicle and license plate data to be collected and time stamped for cross reference with other data used by police107 the department of homeland security is funding networks of surveillance cameras in cities and towns as part of its efforts to combat terrorism108 the new york city police

telecommunications group which controls 74 per cent of the market is stateowned so is viettel an enterprise of the vietnamese armed forces fpt telecom is a private firm but is accountable to the party and depends on the market leaders for bandwidth12 service providers are the major instruments of control and surveillance bloggers monitored by the government frequently undergo maninthemiddle attacks these are designed to intercept data meant to be sent to secure https sites allowing passwords and other communication to be intercepted12 according to a july 2012 freedom house report 91 percent of survey respondents connected to the internet on their mobile devices and the government monitors conversations and tracks the calls of activists or reactionaries110 commercial mass surveillanceedit further information mass surveillance industry as a result of the digital revolution many aspects of life are now captured and stored in digital form concern has been expressed that governments may use this information to conduct mass surveillance on their populations commercial mass surveillance often makes use of copyright laws and user agreements to obtain typically uninformed consent to surveillance from consumers who use their software or other related materials this allows gathering of information which would be technically illegal if performed by government agencies this data is then often shared with government agencies thereby in practice defeating the purpose of such privacy protections one of the most common forms of mass surveillance is carried out by commercial organizations many people are willing to join supermarket and grocery loyalty card programs trading their personal information and surveillance of their shopping habits in exchange for a discount on their groceries although base prices might be increased to encourage participation in the program since a significant proportion of purchases are carried out by credit or debit cards which can also be easily tracked it is questionable whether loyalty cards provide any significant additional privacy threat through programs like googles adsense opensocial and their increasing pool of socalled web gadgets social gadgets and other googlehosted services many web sites on the internet are effectively feeding user information about sites visited by the users and now also their social connections to google facebook also keep this information although its acquisition is limited to page views within facebook this data is valuable for authorities advertisers and others interested in profiling users trends and web site marketing performance google facebook and others are increasingly becoming more guarded about this data as their reach increases and the data becomes more all inclusive making it more valuable111 new features like geolocation give an even increased admission of monitoring capabilities to large service providers like google where they also are enabled to track ones physical movements while users are using mobile devices especially those which are syncing without any user interaction googles gmail service is increasingly employing features to work as a standalone application which also might activate while a web browser is not even active for synchronizing a feature mentioned on the google io 2009 developer conference while showing the upcoming html5 features which google and others are actively defining and promoting112 in 2008 at the world economic forum in davos google ceo eric schmidt said the arrival of a truly mobile web offering a new generation of locationbased advertising is set to unleash a huge revolution113 at the mobile world congress in barcelona on 16 february 2010 google presented their vision of a new business model for mobile operators and trying to convince mobile operators to embrace locationbased services and advertising with google as the advertising provider it would mean that every mobile operator using their locationbased advertising service would be revealing the location of their mobile customers to google114 “ google will also know more about the customer because it benefits the customer to tell google more about them the more we know about the customer the better the quality of searches the better the quality of the apps the operator one is required if you will and the google one will be optional and today i would say a minority choose to do that but i think over time a majority will because of the stored values in the servers and so forth and so on ” — 2010 mobile world congress keynote speech google ceo eric schmidt115 organizations like the electronic frontier foundation are constantly informing users on the importance of privacy and considerations about technologies like geolocation computer company microsoft patented in 2011 a product distribution system with a camera or capture device that monitors the viewers that consume the product allowing the provider to take remedial action if the actual viewers do not match the distribution license116 reporters without borders march 2013 special report on internet surveillance contained a list of corporate enemies of the internet companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information the five companies on the initial list were amesys france blue coat

country where the government engages in pervasive surveillance of large numbers of its citizens and visitors such widespread surveillance is usually justified as being necessary to prevent crime or acts of terrorism but may also be used to stifle criticism of and opposition to the government germans protesting against the nsa surveillance program prism at checkpoint charlie in berlin examples of early surveillance states include the former soviet union and the former east germany which had a large network of informers and an advanced technology base in computing and spycamera technology117 but these states did not have todays technologies for mass surveillance such as the use of databases and pattern recognition software to crosscorrelate information obtained by wire tapping including speech recognition and telecommunications traffic analysis monitoring of financial transactions automatic number plate recognition the tracking of the position of mobile telephones and facial

urban environment the implementation of such technology by a number of cities has resulted in increased efficiencies in urban infrastructure as well as improved community participation the development of smart city technology has also led to increased potential for unwarranted intrusions into privacy and restrictions upon autonomy the widespread incorporation of information and communication technologies within the daily life of urban residents results in increases in the surveillance capacity of states to the extent that individuals may be unaware of what information is being accessed
