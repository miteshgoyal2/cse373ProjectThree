song informationedit the song written and composed by michael jackson and teddy riley is about keeping a relationship secret between lovers in the closet is an english idiom used when one is not open about an aspect of their life particularly in regard to sexual orientation despite the songs suggestive name its lyrics do not allude to hidden sexual orientation but rather a concealed relationship dont hide our love woman to man the new york times stated only jackson would use that title for a heterosexual love song5 the songs female vocal was originally labeled mystery girl but was later revealed to be princess stéphanie of monaco6 the song with its heavy industrialsounding percussion and uptempo arrangement is typical of producer teddy rileys style the unique easterninfluenced backing vocals reaching crescendo at middle eight imbue the song with an erotic edge usually missing from jacksons music with mostly whispered and subdued vocals embellished with gasps moans and shudders along with lyrics that include and if its aching you have to rub it it is generally considered one of jacksons most provocative songs the song was not performed during jacksons dangerous world tour however during his concert in toulouse the band played a short instrumental before man in the mirror but a short version with the intro of she drives me wild was the third song of a medley including scream and they dont care about us during the history world tour princess stéphanies spoken lines were replaced with jacksons live speech for the sequence critical receptionedit allmusic wrote that this song is fine and theres a lot to be said for professional craftsmanship at its peak and he highlighted it7 robert christgau praised and described hes hawking the most credible sexandromance of his career in the closet implores his mystery woman to keep their—get thislust behind closed doors soon hes going wild or fabricating desperate nostalgia for their usedtobe8 alan light of rolling stone called this song repressed lust in the titillatingly titled and determinedly heterosexual and he wrote that this song has a snaky unexpected bridge9 collaboration with madonnaedit in the closet was originally conceived as a duet between jackson and madonna according to a 1992 interview with british journalist jonathan ross madonna said she worked on some lyrical ideas for the song but when she presented them to michael he decided they were too provocative and they decided not to continue with the project10 music videoedit the sepia colored music video was directed by herb ritts and features jackson performing sensual dance routines with supermodel naomi campbell the spoken vocals by princess stéphanie of monaco were rerecorded by campbell for the video the clip was filmed in late march 1992 in salton sea california and premiered on april 23 19921112 it was jacksons most sexually provocative piece and was even banned in south africa because of its imagery13 the video is featured on the dvds dangerous the short films and michael jacksons vision clips from the music video were used in jacksons posthumous music video for his song a place with no name which was released as the second single from his posthumous compilation album xscape in 2014 formats and track listingsedit in the closet uk single in the closet 7 edit – 449 in the closet club
