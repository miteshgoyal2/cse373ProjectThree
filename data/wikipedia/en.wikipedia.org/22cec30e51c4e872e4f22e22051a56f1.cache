of iran signed by 47 of the senates 54 republicans attempting to cast doubt on the obama administrations authority to engage in nuclearproliferation negotiations with iran65 the open letter was released in english as well as a poorlytranslated farsi version which read like a middle schooler wrote it according to foreign policy66 within hours commentators suggested that the letter prepared by cotton constituted a violation of the logan act6768 questions also were raised as to whether it reflected a flawed interpretation of the treaty clause of the united states constitution69 president barack obama mocked the letter referring to it as an unusual coalition with irans hardliners as well as an interference with the thenongoing negotiations of a comprehensive agreement on the iranian nuclear program70 in addition during a vice news interview president barack obama said im embarrassed for them for them to address a letter to the ayatollah – the supreme leader of iran who they claim is our mortal enemy – and their basic argument to them is dont deal with our president cause you cant trust him to follow through on an agreement thats close to unprecedented71 irans foreign minister javad zarif responded to the letter by saying the senators letter in fact undermines the credibility of thousands of such mere executive agreements that have been or will be entered into by the us with various other governments zarif pointed out that the nuclear deal is not supposed to be an iran–us deal but an international one saying that change of administration does not in any way relieve the next administration from international obligations undertaken by its predecessor in a possible agreement about irans peaceful nuclear program he continued i wish to enlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with the stroke of a pen as they boast it will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law72 cotton on march 15 2015 defended the letter he and fellow senate republicans sent to iranian leaders about their nuclear negotiations with the united states amid criticism that it undermined the presidents efforts its so important we communicated this message straight to iran he told cbs news face the nation no regrets at all and they already control tehran increasingly they control damascus and beirut and baghdad and now sanaa as well737475 he continued to defend his action in an interview with msnbc by saying there are nothing but hardliners in iran theyve been killing americans for 35 years they kill hundreds of troops in iraq now they control five capitals in the middle east therere nothing but hardliners in tehran and if they do all those things without a nuclear weapon imagine what theyll do with a nuclear weapon76 military action against iranedit cotton accused obama of holding up a false choice between his framework deal on irans nuclear program and war cotton also seemed to underestimate what military action against iran would entail77 stating the president is trying to make you think it would be 150000 heavy mechanized troops on the ground in the middle east again as we saw in iraq thats simply not the case drawing a comparison to president bill clintons actions in 1998 during operation desert fox he elaborated several days air and naval bombing against iraqs weapons of mass destruction facilities for exactly the same kind of behavior for interfering with weapons inspectors and for disobeying security council resolutions7778 iran side dealsedit on july 21 2015 cotton and mike pompeo announced the existence of side agreements between iran and the iaea on procedures for inspection and verification of irans nuclear activities under the iran nuclear deal these side deals have since become a flashpoint in the debate over the iran deal in part because their contents have not been publicly disclosed cotton described the side deals as secret though the obama administration disputed it noting that the iaea always has a duty of confidentiality798081 heavy water amendmentedit in may 2016 the senate voted down cotton’s amendment to an energy spending bill that would have prohibited the us

cotton compared the immigration policy of norway favorably to that of sweden he maintained that the norwegian government had to a greater extent than that of sweden listened to the concerns of its citizens in contrast to the dominant swedish major parties which did not listen to its constituents85 he proceeded to compare the differing results in scandinavia to that of the united states where immigrationfriendly elites have been held in check by immigrationsceptical constituents85 cotton supported president donald trumps 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail muslim immigration until better screening methods are devised he stated that “it’s simply wrong to call the president’s executive order concerning immigration and refugees ‘a religious test’ of any kind i doubt many arkansans or americans more broadly object to taking a harder look at foreigners coming into our country from wartorn nations with known terror networks i think they’re wondering why we don’t do that already”86

the family route or “chain” migration the bill would set a limit on the number of refugees offered residency at 50000 a year and would remove the diversity lottery senators lindsey graham and john
