the approval of the dc gop election to the dc gop requires nomination by an existing dc gop member and confirmation by the dc gop membership recruitment committee electoral strategyedit according to the district of columbia home rule act dc code 1221d2 at no time shall there be more than three members including the chairman serving at large on the council who are affiliated with the same political party3 this gives the dc republicans their largest opportunity and their main efforts are usually directed at this race rather than defeat the democrats a republican candidate for an atlarge seat need only defeat any independents libertarians and dc statehood green party candidates in the race recent historyedit the most successful and highprofile republican in elected office of recent years is former councilwoman carol schwartz atlarge first elected in 1984 she served one term before deciding not to seek reelection in 1988 voters returned her to the atlarge seat in 1996 she was reelected in 2000 and 2004 but lost the republican primary election in 2008 schwartz ran for mayor of the district of columbia as a republican four times 1986 1994 1998 and 2002 all unsuccessfully in 2008 patrick mara defeated schwartz for the republican nomination mara was backed by an endorsement from the washington post and anger from the business community at schwartzs support of a mandatory sickleave bill45 schwartz continued to run as a writein candidate and both received approximately 10 of the vote this was not enough to stop democratturnedindependent michael a brown from collecting the largest vote share of the nondemocrats up for election leaving the council with no republican members since 20096 allegations raised by tim day former ward 5 dc council candidate and paul craney former executive director helped initiate an investigation into councilmember harry thomas who defeated day in a 2010 race7 thomas resigned in january 2012 thomas agreed to 2 federal felony charges
