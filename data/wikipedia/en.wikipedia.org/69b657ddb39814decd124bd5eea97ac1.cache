highest   whistle   falsetto   modal   vocal fry lowest v t e falsetto falˈsetto italian diminutive of falso false is the vocal register occupying the frequency range just above the modal voice register and overlapping with it by approximately one octave it is produced by the vibration of the ligamentous edges of the vocal cords in whole or in part commonly cited in the context of singing falsetto a characteristic of phonation by all genders is also one of four main spoken vocal registers recognized by speech pathology the term falsetto is most often used in the context of singing to refer to a type of vocal phonation that enables the singer to sing notes beyond the vocal range of the normal or modal voice1 the typical tone of falsetto register or m2 has usually a characteristic breathy23 and flutelike sound relatively free of overtones45—which is more limited than its modal counterpart in both dynamic variation and tone quality6 however william vennard points out that while most untrained people can sound comparatively breathy or hooty when using falsetto production there are in rarer cases individuals who have developed a much stronger falsetto sound production which has more ring to it7 contents 1 physiological process 2 female falsetto 3 musical history 4 use in singing 5 use in speech 6 see also 7 references 8 further reading 9 external links physiological processedit the modal voice or modal register and falsetto register differ primarily in the action of the vocal cords production of the normal voice involves vibration of the entire vocal cord with the glottis opening first at the bottom and then at the top production of falsetto on the other hand vibrates only the ligamentous edges of the vocal folds while leaving each folds body relatively relaxed8 transition from modal voice to falsetto occurs when each vocal cords main body or vocalis muscle relaxes enabling the cricothyroid muscles to stretch the vocal ligaments6 william vennard describes this process as follows with the vocalis muscles relaxed it is possible for the cricothyroids to place great longitudinal tension upon the vocal ligaments the tension can be increased in order to raise the pitch even after the maximum length of the cords has been reached this makes the vocal folds thin so that there is negligible vertical phase difference the vocalis muscles fall to the sides of the larynx and the vibration take place almost entirely in the ligaments9 in the modal register the vocal folds when viewed with a stroboscope are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration closing the gap between them fully if just for a very short time this closure cuts off the escaping air when the air pressure in the trachea rises as a result of this closure the folds are blown apart while the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages remain in apposition this creates an ovalshaped gap between the folds and some air escapes lowering the pressure inside the trachea rhythmic repetition of this movement creates the note1 vocal fold scheme glottal cycle falsetto in falsetto however the vocal folds are seen to be blown apart and in untrained falsetto singers a permanent oval orifice is left in the middle between the edges of the two folds through which a certain volume of air escapes continuously as long as the register is engaged the singer is singing using the voice in skilled countertenors however the mucous membrane of the vocal folds contact with each other completely during each vibration cycle the arytenoid cartilages are held in firm apposition in this voice register also the length or size of the oval orifice or separation between the folds can vary but it is known to get bigger in size as the pressure of air pushed out is increased1 the folds are made up of elastic and fatty tissue the folds are covered on the surface by laryngeal mucous membrane which is supported deeper down underneath by the innermost fibres of the thyroarytenoid muscle in falsetto the extreme membranous edges ie the edges furthest away from the middle of the gap between the folds appear to be the only parts vibrating the mass corresponding to the innermost part of the thyroarytenoid muscle remains still and motionless1 some singers feel a sense of muscular relief when they change from the modal register to the falsetto register1 research has revealed that not all speakers and singers produce falsetto in exactly the same way some speakers and singers leave the cartilaginous portion of the glottis open sometimes called mutational chink and only the front twothirds of the vocal ligaments enter the vibration the resulting sound which is typical of many adolescents may be pure and flutelike but is usually soft and anemic in quality in others the full length of the glottis opens and closes in each cycle in still others a phenomenon known as damping appears with the amount of glottal opening becoming less and less as the pitch rises until only a tiny slit appears on the highest pitches the mutational chink type of falsetto is considered inefficient and weak but there is little information available about the relative strengths and weaknesses of the other two types6 female falsettoedit both sexes are physically capable of phonating in the falsetto register prior to research done by scientists in the 1950s and 1960s it was widely believed that only men were able to produce falsetto one possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female falsetto sooner is that when men phonate in the falsetto register there is a much more pronounced change in timbre and dynamic level between the modal and falsetto registers than there is in female voices this is due in part to the difference in the length and mass of the vocal folds and to the difference in frequency ranges10 however motion picture and video studies of laryngeal action prove that women can and do produce falsetto and electromyographic studies by several leading speech pathologists and vocal pedagogists provide further confirmation9 while scientific evidence has proven that women have a falsetto register the issue of female falsetto has been met with controversy among teachers of singing6 this controversy does not exist within the sciences and arguments against the existence of female falsetto do not align with current physiological evidence some pioneers in vocal pedagogy like margaret green and william vennard were quick to adopt current scientific research in the 1950s and pursued capturing the biological process of female falsetto on film they went further to incorporate their research into their pedagogical method of teaching female singers10 others refused to accept the idea and opposition to the concept of female falsetto has continued among some teachers of singing long after scientific evidence had proven the existence of female falsetto6 celebrated opera singer and voice teacher richard miller pointed out in his 1997 publication national schools of singing english french german and italian that while the german school of voice teachers had largely embraced the idea of a female falsetto into pedagogical practice there is division within the french and english schools and a complete rejection of the idea of female falsetto in the italian school of singing11 in his 2004 book solutions for singers tools for performers and teachers miller said it is illogical to speak of a female falsetto because the female is incapable of producing a timbre in the upper range that is radically different from its mezza voce or voce piena in testa qualities12 however other writers of singing have warned about the dangers of failing to recognize that women have a falsetto register mckinney who expressed alarm that many books on the art of singing completely ignore or gloss over the issue of female falsetto or insist that women do not have falsetto argues that many young female singers substitute falsetto for the upper portion of the modal voice6 he believes that this failure to recognize the female falsetto voice has led to the misidentification of young contraltos and mezzosopranos as sopranos as it is easier for these lower voice types to sing in the soprano tessitura using their falsetto register6 musical historyedit use of falsetto voice in western music is very old its origins are difficult to trace because of ambiguities in terminology possibly when 13th century writers distinguished between chest throat and head registers pectoris guttoris capitis they meant capitis to refer to what would be later called falsetto1 by the 16th century the term falsetto was common in italy the physician giovanni camillo maffei in his book discorso della voce e del modo dapparare di cantar di garganta in 1562 explained that when a bass singer sang in the soprano range the voice was called falsetto1 in a book by gb mancini called pensieri e riflessioni written in 1774 falsetto is equated with voce di testa translated as head voice1 the falsetto register is used by male countertenors to sing in the alto and occasionally the soprano range and was the standard before women sang in choirs falsetto is occasionally used by early music specialists today and regularly in british cathedral choirs by men who sing the alto line13 there is a difference between the modern usage of the head voice term and its previous meaning in the renaissance as a type of falsetto according to many singing professionals these days head voice is typically defined as a mix of chest and head voice therefore created a stronger sound than falsetto14 the falsetto can be coloured or changed to sound different it can be given classical styling to sound as male classical countertenors make it sound or be sung in more contemporary musical styles15 in opera it is believed that the chest voice middle voice and head voice occur in women16 the head voice of a man is according to david a clippinger most likely equivalent to the middle voice of a woman17 this may mean the head voice of a woman is a mans falsetto equivalent although in contemporary teaching some teachers no longer talk of the middle voice choosing to call it the head voice as with men falsetto is not generally counted by classical purists as a part of the vocal range of anyone except countertenors there are exceptions however such as the barytonmartin which uses falsetto see baritone article18 falsetto has been used in mexican songs for many generations in mexico one of the greatest singers of falsete was miguel aceves mejía a singer and actor in the golden age of mexican cinema known as the rey de falsete or falsetto king he sang over a thousand songs such as la malagueña el jinete la noche y tú and la del rebozo blanco many of which utilized falsetto19 many hawaiian songs feature falsetto in hawaiianstyle falsetto called ka leo kiekie the singer usually male emphasizes the break between registers sometimes the singer exaggerates the break through repetition as a yodel as with other aspects of hawaiian music falsetto developed from a combination of sources including preeuropean hawaiian chanting early christian hymn singing and the songs and yodeling of immigrant cowboys called paniolos in the hawaiian language during the kamehameha reign in the 1800s when cowboys were brought from mexico to teach hawaiians how to care for cattle20 falsetto is also common in african folk music especially the south african style called mbube traditionally performed by an allmale a cappella chorus21 use in singingedit falsetto is more limited in dynamic variation and tone quality than the modal voicecitation needed falsetto does not connect to modal voice except at very low volumes leading to vocal breaks when transitioning from modal voicecitation needed most trained singers have at least an octave of range that they can sing in either modal voice or falsettocitation needed in the absence of modern vocal training to hold back the volume of modal voice in this overlapping area a given pitch in modal voice will be louder than the same pitch sung in falsetto22 the type of vocal cord vibration that produces the falsetto voice precludes loud singing except in the highest tones of that register it also limits the available tone colors because of the simplicity of its waveformcitation needed modal voice is capable of producing much more complex waveforms and infinite varieties of tone colorcitation needed falsetto however does involve less physical effort by the singer than the modal voice and when properly used can make possible some desirable tonal effects6 the falsetto voice has a number of highly specialized uses within a musical context the following list includes the most common ones6 in rock music in female and male rb by some lyric irish tenors folk singers and so forth in barbershop music for the tenor voice not always necessary and occasionally with the lead and baritone voices in certain arrangements in yodeling for comic effect in both operas and musicals by falsettists sopranists male altos or countertenors in a male choir to enable the first tenor to maintain the very demanding tessitura for pitches which are above the range of the modal register for pianissimo tones that would be difficult to execute in the modal register for vocal development as an alternative to excess weight or strain to the voice use in speechedit the ability to speak within the falsetto register is possible for almost all men and women the use of falsetto is considered uncommon in normal western speech and is most often employed within the context of humor23 however the use of falsetto speech varies by culture and its use has been studied in african americans24 and gay men25 in certain contexts its use has also been noted in the us south26 pitch changes ranging to falsetto are also characteristic of british english27 some people who speak frequently or entirely in the falsetto register are identified by speech pathologists as suffering from a functional dysphonia23 falsetto also describes the momentary but often repeated fluctuations in pitch emitted by both sexes while undergoing voice change during adolescence these changes however are more apparent and occur with greater frequency in boys than they do in girls28 failure to undergo proper voicechange is called puberphonia see alsoedit creaky voice human voice referencesedit a b c d e f g h the new grove dictionary of music musicians edited by stanley
