formation of interest groups and as of march 29 2012 there are 1248019 such groups whose membership varies from 1 to 7446629192 the majority of the largest groups are employment related although a very wide range of topics are covered mainly around professional and career issues and there are currentlywhen 128000 groups for both academic and corporate alumnicitation needed groups support a limited form of discussion area moderated by the group owners and managers93 since groups offer the functionality to reach a wide audience without so easily falling foul of antispam solutions there is a constant stream of spam postings and there now exist a range of firms who offer a spamming service for this very purpose linkedin has devised a few mechanisms to reduce the volume of spam94 but recentlywhen took the decision to remove the ability of group owners to inspect the email address of new members in order to determine if they were spammerscitation needed groups also keep their members informed through emails with updates to the group including most talked about discussions within your professional circles9195 groups may be private accessible to members only or may be open

to efficiently provide commentary on other users profiles – network building is reinforced however there is no way of flagging anything other than positive content102 linkedin solicits endorsements

premium users and with both the desktop version and the mobile version of the site dropped features in 2013edit in january 2013 linkedin dropped support for linkedin answers and cited a new focus on

techrepublic as having become the de facto tool for professional networking127 linkedin has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships128 linkedin is far and away the

book or that you have had email conversation with when the members email address book is opened it is opened with all email addresses selected and the member is advised invitations will be sent to

invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial authorized invitation in november 2014 linkedin lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of peoples names and images without authorization130131132133 the lawsuit was eventually settled in 2015 in favor of linkedin members68 changing the description below a members name is seen as a change in a job title even if it is just a wording change or even a change to unemployed unless a member opts to turn off activity updates an update is sent to all of that persons contacts telling them to congratulate the member on the new job134 the feature that allows linkedin members to endorse each others skills and experience has been criticized as meaningless since the endorsements are not necessarily accurate or given by people who have familiarity with the members skills135 in october 2016 linkedin acknowledged that it really does matter who endorsed you and began highlighting endorsements from coworkers and other mutual connections to address the criticism136 in 2014 the catalan language advocacy organization fundació puntcat launched an online campaign asking linkedin to support the language both in the platforms interface and as cv language it gained more than 3000 online signatures137 in 2016 plataforma per la llengua started another campaign asking for such a change138 linkedin has inspired the creation of specialised professional networking opportunities

linkedin was being blocked in china after calls for a jasmine revolution it was speculated to have been blocked because it is an easy way for dissidents to access twitter which had been blocked

leading elite officially extending their service in china143144 linkedin ceo jeff weiner acknowledged in a blog post that they would have to censor some of the content that users post on its website in order to comply with chinese rules but he also said the benefits of providing its online service to people in china outweighed those concerns143145 on 4 august 2016 a moscow court ruled that linkedin must be blocked in russia for violating a new data retention law which requires the user data of russian citizens to be stored on servers within the country this ban was upheld on 10 november
