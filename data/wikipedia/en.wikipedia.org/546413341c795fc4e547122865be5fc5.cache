outofcourt settlement of a civil suit filed by the family the boy was to receive a payment of more than 10 million according to mr jackson’s associates jackson was angered by the allegations his

and produced by jackson and includes a guitar solo by slash it is a rock song that conveys themes such as bitterness mistrust and corruption within law enforcement there was no major critical analysis

projects that made coded references to sneddon and the 1993 investigation contents 1 background 2 themes and genre 3 critical reaction 4 other works and aftermath 5 personnel 6 notes 7 references backgroundedit history past present and future book i its album tracks such as ds and corresponding music videos are heavily influenced by the 1993 child sexual abuse accusations made against jackson the reaction to the allegations and the effect they had on the singer the album acts as jacksons response to the media and the public in 1993 evan chandler and his son jordan chandler accused jackson of child sexual abuse1 jackson agreed to a strip search of his body at neverland ranch the strip search was ordered by thomas w sneddon jr the district attorney of santa barbara county california sneddon was in charge of the investigation as a whole23 the accuser gave a detailed description of what he alleges were jacksons genitals also giving details on patches of vitiligo on the singers body but eventually the description was proved wrong in an emotional state jackson stood on a platform in the middle of the room took off all his clothes and was examined for approximately twentyfive minutes he was never physically touched34 the media coverage of the allegations was criticized for using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline5 for accepting stories of jacksons alleged criminal activity in return for money6 for accepting confidential leaked material from the police investigation in return for money7 for deliberately using pictures of jacksons appearance at its worst8 for a lack of objectivity8 and for using headlines that strongly implied jacksons guilt8 at the time jackson said of the media reaction i will say i am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible terrible mass media at every opportunity the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions9 a few months after the allegations became news jackson had lost approximately 10 pounds in weight and had stopped eating10 jacksons health had deteriorated to the extent that he cancelled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation1112 jackson booked the whole fourth floor of the clinic and was put on valium iv to wean him from painkillers111213 the singers spokesperson told reporters that jackson was barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level12 while in the clinic jackson took part in group and oneonone therapy sessions1112 jackson was not charged with a crime and the police closed their criminal investigation citing lack of evidence11415 with his health improving jackson then began work on a new album called history and commenced recording in 1994 the song ds included in the album contains lyrics about a cold man called dom s sheldon which when sung sounds similar to thomas sneddon some media sources and sneddon himself believe the song is directed at him41617 themes and genreedit ds has very similar themes to the rest of history18 the albums content focuses on the hardships and public struggles jackson went through just prior to its production in the new jack swingfunk rock efforts scream and tabloid junkie along with the rb ballad you are not alone jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels and directs much of his anger at the media19 ds contains an excerpt from the yes hit single owner of a lonely heart composed by trevor rabin jon anderson chris squire and trevor horn20 the lyrics describe the subject of the song as a man who wants him dead or alive and really tried to take me downby surprise17 the track ends with the sound of a gunshot21 the song has a distinct rock feel to it with a guitar solo performed by guns n roses guitarist slash who had previously worked with jackson on his dangerous album20 jackson screams the name slash immediately before slashs part in the song jackson has previously made a number of successful rock songs including beat it dirty diana give in to me and scream18192223 in his history album review entertainment weeklys david browne musically defines ds as a hard rock song24 critical reactionedit although the album history was nominated for the grammy award for album of the year and had additional related grammy nominations hardly any mainstream music reviewers provided a critical analysis of ds in their reviews of the album analysis of the song usually only covered the connection to tom sneddon and the songs genre13181925 however fred shuster of the daily news of los angeles described ds as a superb slice of organic funk that will fuel many of the summers busiest dance floors26 many news organizations reviewed the piece in connection to sneddon fox news channel and cnn expressed the opinion that the cold man of this songs lyrics is sneddon as when sung dom s sheldon sounds very close to thomas sneddon416 the bbc suggested that the lyrics reference to a bsta sounds similar to sbda meaning santa barbara district attorney the guardian and the new york times expressed the view that jackson suggests sheldon has links to the cia and the ku klux klan and he just wants your vote1327 sneddons own work website indicates that he believes he is the subject of the song stating hes the only da in the nation to have an angry song written about him by pop megastar michael jackson of the song he said i have not—shall we say—done him the honor of listening to it but i’ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot21 other works and aftermathedit although there was no music video made for ds the songs subject was referenced in the short film ghosts released in 1997 and premiering at the 1996 cannes film festival it was written by jackson and stephen king and directed by stan winston the story was loosely based on the events and isolation jackson felt after he was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993 in the plot the maestro played by jackson is nearly chased out of his town by the mayor who deliberately looks very similar to sneddon and the residents because they believe him to be a freak it features many special effects and dance moves to original music composed and choreographed by jackson the film includes several songs and music videos from the albums history and blood on the dance floor history in the mix the video for ghosts is over thirtyeight minutes long and holds the guinness world record as the worlds longest music video28293031 the child sexual abuse allegations of 2003 resulted in a long trial two years later sneddon was the lead investigator again as well as the trial prosecutor the trial ended with jackson being acquitted on all counts32 the two investigations being controlled by sneddon have led to complaints that he was motivated by a vendetta against jackson evidence to support these claims include sneddon joking about jacksons greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest and sarcastically saying like the sheriff and i really are into that kind of music he then preceded to call jackson wacko jacko and shouting we got him we finally got him to the media when he had only just begun an investigation and had gathered limited information or evidence3233 ds was sung outside the courtroom by a group of jacksons fans every day the trial took place34
