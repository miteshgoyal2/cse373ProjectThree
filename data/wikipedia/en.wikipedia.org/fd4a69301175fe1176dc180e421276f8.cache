father11 he is the son grandson and greatgrandson of church of the nazarene ministers12 although he does not speak for the denomination in any capacity his father james dobson sr 1911–1977 never went to college he was a traveling evangelist chiefly in the southwest the parents took their young son along to watch his father preach like most nazarenes they forbade dancing and going to movies young jimmie lee as he was called concentrated on his studies13 dobson studied academic psychology which most evangelical christians in the 1950s and 1960s did not look upon favorably he came to believe

publication of dare to discipline 1970 which encouraged parents to use corporal punishment in disciplining their children19 dobsons social and political opinions are widely read among many evangelical church congregations in the united states20 dobson publishes monthly bulletins also called focus on the family which are dispensed as inserts in some sunday churchservice bulletins21 dobson interviewed serial killer ted bundy oncamera the day before bundys execution on january 24 1989 the interview became controversial because bundy was given an opportunity to attempt to explain his actions the rape and murder of 30 young women bundy claimed in the interview in a reversal of his previous stance that violent pornography played a significant role in molding and crystallizing his fantasies in may 1989 during an interview with john tanner a republican florida prosecutor dobson called for bundy to be forgiven the bundy tapes gave focus on the family revenues of over 1 million 600000 of which it donated to antipornography groups and to antiabortion groups2223 dobson stepped down as president and ceo of focus on the family in 2003 and resigned from the position of chairman of the board in february 200924 dobson explained his departure as a result of significant philosophical differences with successor jim daly25 in 2010 dobson founded family talk26 a nonprofit organization that produces his radio program “dr james dobson’s family talk” dobson frequently appears as a guest on the fox news channel27 personal lifeedit dobson married the former shirley deere on august 26 1960 the couple has two children danae and ryan ryan dobson born in california in 1970 graduated from biola university in la mirada california he is a public speaker with specialization on issues relating to youth and the prolife movement he was adopted by the dobsons and is an ardent supporter of adoption especially adoption of troubled children5 degrees positions and awardsedit dobson attended point loma nazarene university where he was team captain of the tennis team most valuable player in 1956 and 1958 and later returned to coach in 1968196928 dobson earned a phd in child development from the university of southern california in 1967 he was an associate clinical professor of pediatrics at the university of southern california school of medicine for 14 years he spent 17

1988 in 2005 dobson received an honorary doctorate his 16th30 from indiana wesleyan university and was inducted into iwus society of world changers while speaking at the universitys academic convocation7 in 2008 dobsons focus on the family program was nominated for induction into the national radio hall of fame31 nominations were made by the 157 members of the hall of fame and voting on inductees was handed over to the public using online voting32 the nomination drew the ire of gay rights activists who launched efforts to have the program removed from the nominee list and to vote for other nominees to prevent it from being approved3334 however the program garnered enough votes and was subsequently inducted into the radio hall of fame35 social viewsedit views on marriageedit james dobson is a strong proponent of traditional marriage which he defines as one where husband and wife are lawfully married are committed to each other for life and have a homemaker mother and breadwinner father36 according to his view women are not deemed inferior to men because both are created in gods image but each gender has biblicallymandated roles37 he recommends that married women with children under the age of 18 focus on mothering rather than work outside the home38 in the 2004 book marriage under fire dobson suggests that heterosexual marriage rates in denmark norway and sweden have been falling and that this is due to the recognition of samesex relationships by those countries during the 1990s he remarks that the institution of marriage in those countries is rapidly dying as a result with most young people cohabiting or choosing to remain single living alone and illegitimacy rates rising in some norwegian counties up to 8039 dobson writes that every civilization in the world has been built upon marriage40 he also believes that homosexuality is neither a choice nor genetic but is caused by external factors during early childhood41 he anecdotally cites as evidence the life of actress anne heche4243 who was previously in a relationship with ellen degeneres criticizing the realities of judicial tyranny dobson has written that there is no issue today that is more significant to our culture than the defense of the family not even the war on terror eclipses itcitation needed critics have stated that dobsons views on homosexuality do not represent the mainstream views of the mental health community with dan gilgoff noting the positions of the american psychiatric association and the american psychological association on homosexuality4445 views on schoolingedit focus on the family supports9 private school vouchers and tax credits for religious schools according to focus on the family website dobson believes that parents are ultimately responsible for their childrens education and encourages parents to visit their childrens schools to ask questions and to join the pta so that they may voice their opinions46 dobson opposes sex education curricula that are not abstinenceonly according to people for the american way focus on the family material has been used to challenge a book or curriculum taught in public schools8 critics such as people for the american way allege that focus on the family encourages christian teachers to establish prayer groups in public schools847 dobson supports studentled prayer in public schools8 and believes that allowing studentled christian prayer in schools does not violate the first amendment to the united states constitution48 views on discipline within the familyedit in his book dare to discipline dobson advocated the spanking of children up to eight years old when they misbehave but warns that corporal punishment should not be a frequent occurrence and that discipline must not be harsh and destructive to the childs spirit he warns against harsh spanking because it is not necessary to beat the child into submission a little bit of pain goes a long way for a young child however the spanking should be of sufficient magnitude to cause the child to cry genuinely49 dobson has called disciplining children to be a necessary but unpleasant part of raising children that should only be carried out by qualified parents anyone who has ever abused a child — or has ever felt himself losing control during a spanking — should not expose the child to that tragedy anyone who has a violent temper that at times becomes unmanageable should not use that approach anyone who secretly enjoys the administration of corporal punishment should not be the one to implement it50 in his book the strongwilled child dobson suggests that if authority is portrayed correctly to a child the child will understand how to interact with other authority figures by learning to yield to the loving authority of his parents a child learns to submit to other forms of authority which will confront him later in his life — his teachers school principal police neighbors and employers51 in dobsons opinion parents must uphold their authority and do so consistently when you are defiantly challenged win decisively49 in the strongwilled child dobson draws an analogy between the defiance of a family pet and that of a small child and concludes that just as surely as a dog will occasionally challenge the authority of his leaders so will a little child — only more so49 emphasis in original when asked how long do you think a child should be allowed to cry after being punished is there a limit dobson responded yes i believe there should be a limit as long as the tears represent a genuine release of emotion they should be permitted to fall but crying quickly changes from inner sobbing to an expression of protest real crying usually lasts two minutes or less but may continue for five after that point the child is merely complaining and the change can be recognized in the tone and intensity of his voice i would require him to stop the protest crying usually by offering him a little more of whatever caused the original tears in younger children crying can easily be stopped by getting them interested in something else52 sociologists john bartkowski and christopher ellison have stated that dobsons views diverge sharply from those recommended by contemporary mainstream experts and are not based on any sort of empirical testing but rather are nothing more than expressions of his religious doctrines of biblical literalism and authoritymindedness53 views on tolerance and diversityedit in the winter of 20042005 the we are family foundation sent american elementary schools approximately 60000 copies of a free dvd using popular cartoon characters most notably spongebob squarepants to promote tolerance and diversity54 dobson contended that tolerance and diversity are buzzwords that the we are family foundation misused as part of a hidden agenda to promote homosexuality55 kate zernik noted dobson asserting tolerance and its first cousin diversity are almost always buzzwords for homosexual advocacy56 he stated on the focus on the family website that childhood symbols are apparently being hijacked to promote an agenda that involves teaching homosexual propaganda to children57 he offered as evidence the association of many leading lgbt rights organizations including glaad glsen hrc and pflag with the we are family foundation as shown by links which he claims once existed on their website58 the we are family foundation countered that dobson had mistaken their organization with an unrelated web site belonging to another group called we are family which supports gay youth59 dobson countered i want to be clear the we are family foundation — the organization that sponsored the video featuring spongebob and the other characters was until this flap occurred making available a variety of explicitly prohomosexual materials on its web site it has since endeavored to hide that fact but my concerns are as legitimate today as they were when i first expressed them in january58 in september 2005 toleranceorg published a followup message advertising the dvds continued availability including we are family foundation president nancy hunts speculation that many of the dvds may be still sitting in boxes unused because of dobsons vitriolic attack55 views on homosexualityedit dobson believes that god defines marriage as between one man and one woman only and describes this as the central stabilizing institution of society dobson believes that any sexual activity outside of such a union — including homosexuality — cannot be approved by god in dobsons view homosexuality results from influences in a childs environment rather than an inborn trait he states that homosexual behavior specifically unwanted samesex attraction has been and can be overcome through understanding developmental models for homosexuality and choosing to heal the complex developmental issues which led to samesex attraction4360 focus on the family ministry sponsors9 the monthly conference love won out where participants hear powerful stories of exgay men and women41 parents families and friends of lesbians and gays pflag has protested against the conference in orlando questioning both its methodology and supposed success61 in regards to the conference dobson has stated that gay activists come with preconceived notions about who we are and what we believe and about the hate that boils from within which is simply not true regardless of what the media might say focus on the family has no interest in promoting hatred toward homosexuals or anyone else we also dont wish to deprive them of their basic constitutional rights the constitution applies to all of us62 dobson strongly opposes the movement to legitimize samesex relationships in his book bringing up boys dobson states the disorder is not typically chosen homosexuals deeply resent being told that they selected this samesex inclination in pursuit of sexual excitement or some other motive it is unfair and i dont blame them for being irritated by that assumption who among us would knowingly choose a path that would result in alienation from family rejection by friends disdain from the heterosexual world exposure to sexually transmitted diseases such as aids and tuberculosis and even a shorter lifespan63 sociologist judith stacey criticized dobson for claiming that sociological studies show that gay couples do not make good parents she stated that dobsons claim is a direct misrepresentation of my research64 in response to dobsons claim that there have been more than ten thousand studies that have showed that children do best when they are raised with a mother and a father who are committed to each other stacey replied that all of those studies that dobson is referring to are studies that did not include gay or lesbian parents as part of the research base65 dobson objected to a bill expanding the prohibition of sexual orientationbased discrimination in the areas of public accommodation housing practices family planning services and twenty other areas he said that were such a bill passed public businesses could no longer separate locker rooms and bathrooms by gender which he claimed would lead to a situation where every woman and little girl will have to fear that a predator bisexual crossdresser or even a homosexual or heterosexual male might walk in and relieve himself in their presence6667 political and social influenceedit although dobson initially remained somewhat distant from washington politics in 1981 he founded the family research council as a political arm through which social conservative causes could achieve greater political influence68 in 1996 he cast a vote for us taxpayers party presidential candidate howard phillips69 in late 2004 dobson led a campaign to block the appointment of arlen specter to head of the senate judiciary committee because of specters prochoice stance on abortion70 responding to a question by fox news personality alan colmes on whether he wanted the republican party to be known as a bigtent party he replied i dont want to be in the big tent i think the party ought to stand for something27 in 2006 focus on the family spent more than a half million dollars to promote a constitutional amendment to ban samesex marriage in its home state of colorado71 a may 2005 article by hedges in harpers magazine described dobson as perhaps the most powerful figure in the dominionist movement and a crucial player in getting out the christian vote for george w bush72 discernment ministries a site that describes dominionism as a heresy characterized dobson as belonging to the patriotic american brand of dominionism calling him one of its most powerful leaders73 in november 2004 dobson was described by the online magazine slate as americas most influential evangelical leader4 the article explained forget jerry falwell and pat robertson who in their dotage have marginalized themselves with gaffes dobson is now americas most influential evangelical leader with a following reportedly greater than that of either falwell or robertson at his peak dobson may have delivered bush his victories in ohio and florida4 further hes already leveraging his new power when a thankyou call came from the white house dobson issued the staffer a blunt warning that bush needs to be more aggressive about pressing the religious rights prolife antigay rights agenda or it would pay a price in four years dobson has sometimes complained that the republican party may take the votes of social conservatives for granted and has suggested that evangelicals may withhold support from the gop if the party does not more strongly support conservative family issues does the republican party want our votes no string attached — to court us every two years and then to say dont call me ill call you — and not to care about the moral law of the universe is that what they want is that the way the system works is this the way its going to be if it is im gone and if i go i will do everything i can to take as many people with me as possible8 however in 2006 dobson said that while there is disillusionment out there with republicans and that worries me greatly he nonetheless suggested voters turn out and vote republican in 2006 my first inclination was to sit this one out but according to the new york times dobson then added that he had changed his mind when he looked at who would become the leaders of congressional committees if the democrats took over68 dobson garnered national media attention once again in february 2008 after releasing a statement in the wake of senator john mccains expected success in the socalled super tuesday republican primary elections in his statement dobson said i cannot and will not vote for senator john mccain as a matter of conscience and indicated that he would refrain from voting altogether if mccain were to become the republican candidate echoing other conservative commentators concerns about the senators conservatism74 he endorsed mike huckabee for president after mccain selected a prolife candidate sarah palin as his running mate dobson said that he was more enthusiastic in his support for the republican ticket75 when palins 17yearold daughters pregnancy was revealed dobson issued a press release commending palins stance saying we have always encouraged the parents to love and support their children and always advised the girls to see their pregnancies through even though there will of course be challenges along the way that is what the palins are doing and they should be commended once again for not just talking about their prolife and profamily values but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances76 on june 24 2008 dobson publicly criticized statements made by us presidential candidate barack obama in obamas 2006 call to renewal77 address dobson stated that obama was distorting the traditional understanding of the bible to fit his own world view78 on october 23 2008 dobson published a letter from 2012 in obamas america that proposed that an obama presidency could lead to mandated homosexual teachings across all schools the banning of firearms in entire states the end of the boy scouts home schooling christian school groups christian adoption agencies and talk radio pornography on primetime and daytime television mandatory bonuses for gay soldiers terrorist attacks across america the nuclear bombing of tel aviv the conquering of most of eastern europe by russia the end of health care for americans over 80 outofcontrol gasoline prices and complete economic disaster in the united states among other catastrophes79 in the days after the 2008 presidential election dobson stated on his radio program that he was mourning the obama election claiming that obama supported infanticide would be responsible for the deaths of millions of unborn children and was going to appoint the most liberal justices to the supreme court perhaps that weve ever had80 dobson is an intelligent design supporter and has spoken at conferences supporting the subject and frequently criticizes evolution81 in 2007 dobson was one of 25 evangelicals who called for the ouster of rev richard cizik from his position at the national association of evangelicals because cizik had taken a stance urging evangelicals to take global warming seriously82 on june 13 2007 the national right to life committee ousted colorado right to life after the latter ran a fullpage ad criticizing dobson8384 on may 30 2010 dobson delivered the prerace invocation at the nascar cocacola 600 automobile race raising criticism about his association with a sport associated with sponsors and activities which would not meet his definition of familyfriendly8586 at a national day of prayer event in the us capitol dobson called barack obama the abortion president he said president obama before he was elected made it very clear that he wanted to be the abortion president he didn’t make any bones about it this is something that he really was going to promote and support and he has done that and in a sense he is the abortion president among others rep janice hahn complained because dobson used the national day of prayer for partisan purposes she said dobson just blew a hole into this idea of being a nonpartisan national day of prayer it was very disturbing to meand really a shame james dobson hijacked the national day of prayer — this nonpartisan nonpolitical national day of prayer — to promote his own distorted political agenda87 ecumenical relationsedit dobson and charles colson were two participants in a 2000 conference at the vatican on the global economys impact on families during the conference the two protestants met with pope john paul ii dobson later told catholic news service that though he has theological differences with roman catholicism when it comes to the family there is far more agreement than disagreement and with regard to moral issues from abortion to premarital sex safesex ideology and homosexuality i find more in common with catholics than with some of my evangelical brothers and sisters88 in november 2009 dobson signed an ecumenical statement known as the manhattan declaration calling on evangelicals catholics and eastern orthodox christians not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion samesex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences89 publicationsedit dobson has authored or coauthored 36 books including books as sole authoredit
