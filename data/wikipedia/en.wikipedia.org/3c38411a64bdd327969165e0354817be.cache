pronunciationedit the quartzite of the prospect mountain formation on top of jeff davis peak in great basin national park a topographic map of nevada the name nevada comes from the spanish nevada neˈβaða meaning snowcovered16 after the sierra nevada snowcovered mountain range most nevadans pronounce the second syllable of their state name using the vowel of trap nɪˈvædə many from outside the western united states pronounce it with the vowel of father nɪˈvɑːdə although the latter pronunciation is closer to the spanish pronunciation it is not the pronunciation preferred by most nevadans state assemblyman harry mortenson proposed a bill to recognize the alternate quasispanish pronunciation of nevada17 though the bill was not supported by most legislators and never received a vote the nevadan pronunciation is the de facto official one since it is the one used by the state legislature at one time the states official tourism organization travelnevada stylized the name of the state as nevăda with a breve mark over the a indicating the locally preferred pronunciation18 which is also available as a license plate design geographyedit mountains west of las vegas in the mojave desert

organized list of topics about nevada broken hills a nevada ghost town notesedit the distinction of highest point in nevada goes to the summit of boundary peak so named because it is very near the nevadacalifornia border at the northern terminus of the white mountains however boundary peak can be considered a subsidiary summit of montgomery peak whose summit is in california since the topographic prominence of boundary peak is only 253 feet 77 m which falls under the often used 300foot 91 m cutoff for an independent peak also boundary peak is less than 1 mile 16 km away from its higher neighbor hence boundary peak can be described as not being wholly within nevada by contrast the prominence of wheeler peak 13063 feet 3982 m is quite large and in fact it is the twelfth largest in the contiguous united states wheeler peak is the highest point in a radius of more than 200 square miles 520 km2 and is entirely within the state of nevada referencesedit population and housing
