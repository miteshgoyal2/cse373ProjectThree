and recorded by michael jackson in january 1987 for his seventh studio album of the same name and produced by quincy jones with jackson serving as coproducer bad was originally intended to be a duet between jackson and musician prince although the plans were not fruitful2 in jacksons 1988 autobiography moonwalk jackson discussed the concept of bad elaborating that bad is a song about the street its about this kid from a bad neighborhood who gets to go away to a private school he comes back to the old neighborhood when hes on a break from school and the kids from the neighborhood start giving him trouble he sings im bad youre bad whos bad whos the best hes saying when youre strong and good then youre bad3 in a 1988 interview with ebony and jet magazines jackson said that he had gotten the idea for the song from a true story that he had read about in time or newsweek magazine4 jackson stated that the story said that a student that went to school in upstate new york who was from the ghetto had tried to make something of his life and planned to leave all of his friends behind when he returned from thanksgiving break4 he added that the students friends jealousy resulted in them killing the student jackson stated that the students death was not included in the music video4 the only case that fits these details is that of edmund perry however perry was not killed by kids in his neighborhood he was killed by a plainclothes police officer when perry and his brother allegedly attacked and badly beat the officer in a mugging attempt56 compositionedit the song is written in the key of a minor with a time signature in common time7 jacksons vocal range spans from g3 to c67 the track has a tempo of 114 beats per minute7 bad was viewed as a rived hit the road jack progression8 davitt sigerson a writer for rolling stone magazine commented on the tracks lyrical content while reviewing bad when jackson declares that the whole world has to answer right now he is not boasting but making a statement of fact regarding his extraordinary stardom if anything he is scorning the selfcoronation of lesser funk royals and inviting his fickle public to spurn him if it dare8 sigerson compared the track to material by james brown whose its a mans mans mans world is openly referenced by the four chromatic note brass introduction to the song8 lyrically bad pertains to proving to people that you are tough boasting with jackson asking whos bad8 in a repeating lyric in the songs chorus critical receptionedit bad was well received by contemporary music critics some critics noted that the song helped jacksons image become more edgy during the badera davitt sigerson a writer for rolling stone magazine commented that the track needs no defense and he generally praised jacksons vocal performance in the song8 stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic listed bad along with two other songs from the album as being top picks from the albums eleven tracks9 in separate review of the song erlewine commented that jacksons vocals sounded like he was the love child of james brown and mavis staples and added that musically speaking in this case bad is very good10 he also noted that the tracks authority and boasting helped to humanize jackson and changed his image remarking that it was fun hearing him talking trash and being his own bigger booster10 jennifer clay of yahoo music noted that while jacksons new edgier image was a little hard to swallow the image worked musically on the albums songs bad man in the mirror and dirty diana11 chart performanceedit bad

an 18minute short film written by novelist and screenwriter richard price and directed by martin scorsese in a 6week period during november and december 19864748 the video has many references to the 1961 film west side story especially the cool sequence49 the music video to the song used a different version of the song as opposed to the commercially released version this version using a different organ solo in the middle hasnt been commercially released as of yet in the video jackson portrays a teenager named darryl who has just completed a term at an expensive private school he returns to the city and takes the subway back to his neglected neighborhood darryl finds his home is empty where he is greeted by his old friends the leader of the group is mini max an emerging wesley snipes at first relations are friendly but slightly awkward then the situation begins to deteriorate as the gang starts to realize how much darryl has changed they especially notice how uncomfortable he has become with their criminal activities darryl takes the gang to the subway station hoyt–schermerhorn streets in brooklyn in an attempt to show his friends he is still bad by robbing an elderly man he has a change of heart at the last minute and mini max chastises him telling darryl hes no longer bad after more disrespect from mini max the video cuts to darryl and a group of street kids dancing while darryl is seen performing bad darryl insists that max is headed for a fall which is nearly darryls undoing eventually mini max accepts that and after a final handshake leaves darryl in peace at the end of the video darryl is left alone watching his gang leave the video was not commercially released until it was included in the video albums video greatest hits history long version on dvd and short version in vhs number ones short version michael jacksons vision long version and the target version dvd of bad 25 short version the full video was introduced in a tv special michael jackson the magic returns on primetime a cbs television show on august 31 198750 the full video won awards at various prestigious award ceremonies including favorite single soulrb at the american music awards and biggest selling album by a male soloist in the uk from the guinness book of world records after jacksons death in june 2009 letitia james of the new york city council began trying to convince the agency to rename or coname the hoyt–schermerhorn streets station or to hang a plaque at the station in jacksons honor however her request was denied by the metropolitan transportation authority in september 20095152 james commented having michael jackson visit and moonwalk at this station was a huge deal not only for brooklyn but all of new york in the 80s and renaming this station in his honor would put it on the map and help ensure that people dont forget5152 a source from the mta commented that no subway stations in the mta system are named or conamed after individuals mostly because it could confuse riders5152 the mta also declined to put a plaque in the station due to mta guidelines banning such a thing5253 choreographyedit the choreographer gregg burge confirmed the influence although they intended to do a more contemporary version of it49 assistant choreographer jeffrey daniel commented its like a train coming across the screen and thats the effect i was looking for and it worked49 the videos choreographers jeffrey daniel and gregg burge were influenced by west side story when designing the dance routines but wanted to keep the scene more contemporary and incorporated the moonwalk into the movements54 the music video received a nomination for choreography at the 1988 mtv video music awards ceremony55 the video for bad and michael jacksons the way you make me feel video were both nominated for best choreography however janet jacksons video the pleasure principle55 won the award live performancesedit bad was performed during jacksons bad world tour
