road and rail vehicles surface and underwater vessels electric aircraft and electric spacecraft evs first came into existence in the mid19th century when electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time modern internal combustion engines have been the dominant propulsion method for motor vehicles for almost 100 years but electric power has remained commonplace in other vehicle types such as trains and smaller vehicles of all types in the 21st century evs

ányos jedlik built the first crude but viable electric motor provided with stator rotor and commutator and the year after he used it to power a tiny car4 a few years later in 1835 professor sibrandus stratingh of university of groningen the netherlands built a small scale electric car and a robert anderson of scotland is reported to have made a crude electric carriage sometime between the years of 1832 and 1839 around the same period early experimental electrical cars were moving on rails too american blacksmith and inventor thomas davenport built a toy electric locomotive powered by a primitive electric motor in 1835 in 1838 a scotsman named robert davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour 6 kmh in england a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of electric current and similar american patents were issued to lilley and colten in 18475 between 1832 and 1839 the exact year is uncertain robert anderson of scotland invented the first crude electric carriage powered by nonrechargeable primary cells6 by the 20th century electric cars and rail transport were commonplace with commercial electric automobiles having the majority of the market over time their generalpurpose commercial use reduced to specialist roles as platform trucks forklift trucks ambulances7 tow tractors and urban delivery vehicles such as the iconic british milk float for most of the 20th century the uk was the worlds largest user of electric road vehicles8 electrified trains were used for coal transport as the motors did not use precious oxygen in the mines switzerlands lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of their rail network one of the earliest rechargeable batteries the nickeliron battery was favored by edison for use in electric cars evs were among the earliest automobiles and before the preeminence of light powerful internal combustion engines electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early 1900s they were produced by baker electric columbia electric detroit electric and others and at one point in history outsold gasolinepowered vehicles in fact in 1900 28 percent of the cars on the road in the usa were electric evs were so popular that even president woodrow wilson and his secret service agents toured washington dc in their milburn electrics which covered 60–70 mi 100–110 km per charge9 a number of developments contributed to decline of electric cars10 improved road infrastructure required a greater range than that offered by electric cars and the discovery of large reserves of petroleum in texas oklahoma and california led to the wide availability of affordable gasolinepetrol making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances11 also internal combustion powered cars became ever easier to operate thanks to the invention of the electric starter by charles kettering in 191212 which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine and the noise emitted by ice cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the muffler which hiram percy maxim had invented in 1897 as roads were improved outside urban areas electric vehicle range could not compete with the ice finally the initiation of mass production of gasolinepowered vehicles by henry ford in 1913 reduced significantly the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars13 in the 1930s national city lines which was a partnership of general motors firestone and standard oil of california purchased many electric tram networks across the country to dismantle them and replace them with gm buses the partnership was convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary companies but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of transportation services experimentationedit this 1973 photo of a charging station in seattle shows an amc gremlin modified to take electric power it had a

production of the citroën berlingo electrique stopped in september 2005 reintroductionedit during the last few decades environmental impact of the petroleumbased transportation infrastructure along with the fear of peak oil has led to renewed interest in an electric transportation infrastructure15 evs differ from fossil fuelpowered vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated from a wide range of sources including fossil fuels nuclear power and renewable sources such as tidal power solar power and wind power or any combination of those the carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles varies depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation1617 the electricity may then be stored on board the vehicle using a battery flywheel or supercapacitors vehicles making use of engines working on the principle of combustion can usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources usually nonrenewable fossil fuels a key advantage of hybrid or plugin electric vehicles is regenerative braking due to their capability to recover energy normally lost during braking as electricity is stored in the onboard battery the

provide electric current supply and return to the power source an electric bus at lucerne battery electric bus by byd in the netherlands most large electric transport systems are powered by stationary sources of electricity that are directly connected to the vehicles through wires electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of usually a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines this system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required for those ascending this regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to utilise the power generated by descending vehicles in the systems above motion is provided by a rotary electric motor however it is possible to unroll the motor to drive directly against a special matched track these linear motors are used in maglev trains which float above the rails supported by magnetic levitation this allows for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of the train or track in addition to the highperformance control systems needed switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors which to date has restricted their operations to highspeed point to point services propertiesedit componentsedit the type of battery the type of traction motor and the motor controller design vary according to the size power and proposed application which can be as small as a motorized shopping cart or wheelchair through pedelecs electric motorcycles and scooters neighborhood electric vehicles industrial forklift trucks and including many hybrid vehicles energy sourcesedit although evs have few direct emissions all rely on energy created through electricity generation and will usually emit pollution and generate waste unless it is generated by renewable source power plants since evs use whatever electricity is delivered by their electrical utilitygrid operator evs can be made more or less efficient polluting and expensive to run by modifying the electrical generating stations this would be done by an electrical utility under a government energy policy in a timescale negotiated between utilities and government fossil fuel vehicle efficiency and pollution standards take years to filter through a nations fleet of vehicles new efficiency and pollution standards rely on the purchase of new vehicles often as the current vehicles already on the road reach their endoflife only a few nations set a retirement age for old vehicles such as japan or singapore forcing periodic upgrading of all vehicles already on the road evs will take advantage of whatever environmental gains happen when a renewable energy generation station comes online a fossilfuel power station is decommissioned or upgraded conversely if government policy or economic conditions shifts generators back to use more polluting fossil fuels and internal combustion engine vehicles icevs or more inefficient sources the reverse can happen even in such a situation electrical vehicles are still more efficient than a comparable amount of fossil fuel vehicles in areas with a deregulated electrical energy market an electrical vehicle owner can choose whether to run his electrical vehicle off conventional electrical energy sources or strictly from renewable electrical energy sources presumably at an additional cost pushing other consumers onto conventional sources and switch at any time between the two issues with batteriesedit main article electric vehicle battery old banks of conventional leadacid car batteries are still commonly used for ev propulsion lithium ion polymer battery prototypes newer lipoly cells provide up to 130 whkg and last through thousands of charging cycles efficiencyedit because of the different methods of charging possible the emissions produced have been quantified in different ways67 plugin allelectric and hybrid vehicles also have different consumption characteristics68 electromagnetic radiationedit electromagnetic radiation from high performance electrical motors has been claimed to be associated with some human ailments but such claims are largely unsubstantiated except for extremely high exposures69 electric motors can be shielded within a metallic faraday cage but this reduces efficiency by adding weight to the vehicle while it is not conclusive that all electromagnetic radiation can be contained chargingedit grid capacityedit if a large proportion of private vehicles were to convert to grid electricity it would increase the demand for generation and transmission and consequent emissions70 however overall energy consumption and emissions would diminish because of the higher efficiency of evs over the entire cycle in the usa it has been estimated there is already nearly sufficient existing power plant and transmission infrastructure assuming that most charging would occur overnight using the most efficient offpeak base load sources71 in the uk however things are different while national grid’s highvoltage electricity transmission system can currently manage the demand of 1 million electric cars steve holliday ceo national grid plc said “penetration up and above that becomes a real issue

charge from conventional power outlets or dedicated charging stations a process that typically takes hours but can be done overnight and often gives a charge that is sufficient for normal everyday usage however with the widespread implementation of electric vehicle networks within large cities in the uk and europe ev users can plug in their cars whilst at work and leave them to charge throughout the day extending the possible range of commutes and eliminating range anxiety a recharging system that avoids the need for a cable is curb connect patented in 201272 by dr gordon dower in this system electrical contacts are fitted into curbs such as angle parking spaces on city streets when a suitably authorized vehicle is parked so that its front end overhangs the curb the curb contacts become energized and charging occurs another proposed solution for daily recharging is a standardized inductive charging system such as evatrans plugless power benefits are the convenience of parking over the charge station and minimized cabling and connection infrastructure737475 qualcomm is trialling such a system in london in early 20127677 yet another proposed solution for the

charging stations and has partnered with nissan on several installations battery replacement is also proposed as an alternative although no oems including nissanrenault have any production vehicle plans swapping requires standardization across platforms models and manufacturers swapping also requires many times more battery packs to be in the system one type of battery replacement proposed vanadium redox battery is much simpler while the latest generation of vanadium redox battery only has an energy density similar to leadacid the charge is stored solely in a vanadiumbased electrolyte which can be pumped out and replaced with charged fluidcitation needed the vanadium battery system is also a potential candidate for intermediate energy storage in quick charging stations because of its high power density and extremely good endurance in daily usecitation needed system cost however is still prohibitive as vanadium battery systems are estimated to range between 350–600 per kwh a battery that can service one hundred customers in a 24hour period at 50 kwh per charge would cost 183 millioncitation needed according to department of energy research conducted at pacific northwest

batteries could be mechanically replaced on special stations in a couple of minutes battery swapping batteries with greatest energy density such as metalair fuel cells usually cannot be recharged in purely electric way instead some kind of metallurgical process is needed such as aluminum smelting and similar siliconair aluminumair and other metalair fuel cells look promising candidates for swap batteries8182 any source of energy renewable or nonrenewable could be used to remake used metalair fuel cells with relatively high efficiency investment in infrastructure will be needed the cost of such batteries could be an issue although they could be made with replaceable anodes and electrolyte chassis swappingedit instead of replacing batteries it is possible to replace the entire chassis

technical standards for vehicles87 there is a growing concern about the safety of evs given the demonstrated tendency of the lithiumion battery most promising for ev use because of its high energy density to overheat possibly leading to fire or explosion especially when damaged in a crash the us national highway traffic safety administration opened a defect investigation of the chevy volt on november 25 2011 amid concerns over the risk of battery fires in a crash at that time automotive consulting firm cnw marketing research reported a decline in consumer interest in the volt citing the

brake pad dust and reduce the total energy requirement of a trip regenerative braking is especially effective for startandstop city use they can be finely controlled and provide high torque from rest unlike internal combustion engines and do not need multiple gears to match power curves this removes the need for gearboxes and torque converters evs provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and vibration than internal combustion engines91 while this is a desirable attribute it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind elderly and very young pedestrians to mitigate this situation automakers and individual companies are developing systems that produce warning sounds when evs are moving slowly up to a speed when normal motion and rotation road suspension electric motor etc noises become audible97 energy resilienceedit electricity can be produced from a variety of sources therefore it

an efficient gasoline or diesel in most countries where electricity generation relies on fossil fuels99100101 welltowheel efficiency of an ev has less to do with the vehicle itself and more to do with the method of electricity production a particular ev would instantly become twice as efficient if electricity production were switched from fossil fuel to a wind or tidal primary source of energy thus when welltowheels is cited one should keep in mind that the discussion is no longer about the vehicle but rather about the entire energy supply infrastructure in the case of fossil fuels this should also include energy spent on exploration mining refining and distribution cost of rechargeedit according to general motors as reported by cnn money the gm volt will cost less than purchasing a cup of your favorite coffee to recharge the volt should cost less than 2 cents per mile to drive on electricity compared with 12 cents a mile on gasoline at a price of 360 a gallon this means a trip from los angeles to new york would cost 56 on electricity and 336 with gasoline this would be the equivalent to paying 60 cents a gallon of gas102 the reality is that the cost of operating an ev varies wildly depending on the part of the world in which the owner lives in some locations an ev costs less to drive than a comparable gaspowered vehicle as long as the higher initial purchaseprice is not factored in ie a pure comparison of gasoline cost to electricity cost in the usa however in states which have a tiered electricity rate schedule fuel for evs today costs owners significantly more than fuel for a comparable gaspowered vehicle a 2011 study done by purdue university found that in california most users already reach the third pricing tier for electricity each month and adding an ev could push them into the fourth or fifth highest most expensive tier meaning that they will be paying in excess of 45 cents per kwh for electricity to recharge their vehicle at this price which is higher than the average electricity price in the us it is dramatically more expensive to drive a pureev than it is to drive a traditional puregas powered vehicle the objective of a tiered pricing system is to discourage consumption its meant to get you to think about turning off your lights and conserving electricity in california the unintended consequence is that plugin hybrid cars wont be economical under this system said tyner the author whose findings were published in the online version of the journal energy policy103 stabilization of the gridedit since evs can be plugged into the electric grid when not in use there is a potential for battery powered vehicles to even cut the demand for electricity by feeding electricity into the grid from their batteries during peak use periods such as midafternoon air conditioning use while doing most of their charging at night when there is unused generating capacity10470 this vehicletogrid v2g connection has the potential to reduce the need for new power plants as long as vehicle owners do not mind reducing the life of their batteries by being drained by the power company during peak demand furthermore our current electricity infrastructure may need to cope with increasing shares of variableoutput power sources such as windmills and pv solar panels this variability could be addressed by adjusting the speed at which ev batteries are charged or possibly even discharged some concepts see battery exchanges and battery charging stations much like gaspetrol stations today clearly these will require enormous storage and charging potentials which could be manipulated to vary the rate of charging and to output power during shortage periods much as diesel generators are used for short periods to stabilize some national grids105106 rangeedit many electric designs have limited range due to the low energy density of batteries compared to the fuel of internal combustion engined vehicles evs also often have long recharge times compared to the relatively fast process of refueling a tank this is further complicated by the current scarcity of public charging stations range anxiety is a label for consumer concern about ev range heating of evsedit in cold climates considerable energy is needed to heat the interior of a vehicle and to defrost the windows with internal combustion engines this heat already exists as waste combustion heat diverted from the engine cooling circuit this process offsets the greenhouse gases external costs if this is done with battery evs the interior heating requires extra energy from the vehicles batteries although some heat could be harvested from the motor or motors and battery their greater efficiency means there is not as much waste heat available as from a combustion engine however for vehicles which are connected to the grid battery evs can be preheated or cooled with little or no need for battery energy especially for short trips newer designs are focused on using superinsulated cabins which can heat the vehicle using the body heat of the passengers this is not enough however in colder climates as a driver delivers only about 100 w of heating power a heat pump system capable of cooling the cabin during summer and heating it during winter seems to be the most practical and promising way of solving the thermal management of the ev ricardo arboix107 introduced 2008 a new concept based on the principle of combining the thermalmanagement of the evbattery with the thermalmanagement of the cabin using a heat pump system this is done by adding a third heatexchanger thermally connected with the batterycore to the traditional heat pumpair conditioning system used in previous evmodels like the gm ev1 and toyota rav4 ev the concept has proven to bring several benefits such as prolonging the lifespan of the battery as well as improving the performance and overall energyefficiency of the ev108109110111 electric public transit efficiencyedit shifts from private to public transport train trolleybus personal rapid transit or tram have the potential for large gains in efficiency in terms of an individuals distance traveled per kwh research shows people do prefer trams112 because they are quieter and more comfortable and perceived as having higher status113 therefore it may be possible to cut liquid fossil fuel consumption in cities through the use of electric trams trams may be the most energyefficient form of public transportation with rubber wheeled vehicles using 23 more energy than the equivalent tram and run on electricity rather than fossil fuels in terms of net present value they are also the cheapest—blackpool trams are still running after 100yearscitation needed but combustion buses only last about 15years incentives and promotionedit main article government incentives for plugin electric vehicles see also electric car use by country many governments offer incentives to promote the use of electric vehicles with the goals of reducing air pollution and oil consumption some incentives intend to increase purchases of electric vehicles by offsetting the purchase price with a grant other incentives include lower tax rates or exemption from certain taxes and investment in charging infrastructure futureedit rimac concept one electric supercar since 2013 0 to 100 kmh in 28 seconds 1088 hp tesla model s since 2012 0 to 100 kmh in 25 seconds recharging in 30 minutes to 80 percent range 600 km ferdinand dudenhoeffer head of the centre of automotive research at the gelsenkirchen university of applied sciences in germany said that by 2025 all passenger cars sold in europe will be electric or hybrid electric114 improved batteriesedit first advances in lithium ion batteries in large part driven by the consumer electronics industry allow fullsized highwaycapable evs to be propelled as far on a single charge as conventional cars go on a single tank of gasoline lithium batteries have been made safe can be recharged in minutes instead of hours see recharging time and now last longer than the typical vehicle see lifespan the production cost of these lighter highercapacity lithium batteries is gradually decreasing as the technology matures and production volumes increase see price history toyota motors corporation is trying to replace the current lithium ion battery with solidstate battery technology by 2020 the solidstate battery replaces the liquid electrolyte with a solid electrolyte115116 rechargeable lithiumair batteries potentially offer increased range over other types and are a current topic of research117 battery management and intermediate storageedit another improvement is to decouple the electric motor from the battery through electronic control employing supercapacitors to buffer large but short power demands and regenerative braking energy the development of new cell types combined with intelligent cell management improved both weak points mentioned above the cell management involves not only monitoring the health of the cells but also a redundant cell configuration one more cell than needed with sophisticated switched wiring it is possible to condition one
