singles runaround sue the wanderer ruby baby and lovers who wander among his other hits dions popularity waned in the mid1960s toward the end of the decade he shifted his style and produced songs with a more mature contemplative feeling such as abraham martin and john he became popular again in the late 1960s and into the mid1970s and he has continued making music ever since critics who had dismissed his early work pegging him as merely a teen idol praised his later work and noted the influence he has had on other musicians1 dion was inducted into the rock roll hall of fame in 1989

5 references 6 external links early yearsedit dion was born to an italianamerican family in the bronx new york2 as a child he accompanied his father pasquale dimucci a vaudeville entertainer on tour and developed a love of country music – particularly the work of hank williams he also developed a fondness for the blues and doowop musicians he heard performing in local bars and on the radio his singing was honed on the street corners and local clubs of the bronx where he and other neighborhood singers created a cappella riffs in early 1957 he auditioned for bob and gene schwartz who had just formed mohawk records they recorded dion singing lead on a song which had been arranged by hugo montenegro and prerecorded with everything but the lead vocals the backing vocals were by a group called the timberlanes whom dion had never met3 the resulting single the chosen few was released under the name dion and the timberlanes and became a minor regional hit writing about this experience later in his autobiography the wanderer dion said that he had never met the timberlanes and didnt even know who they were the vocal group was so white bread i went back to my neighborhood and i recruited a bunch of guys – three guys – and we called ourselves dion and the belmonts4 careeredit with the belmonts 1957–1960edit main article dion and the belmonts bob and gene schwartz also signed dions friends the belmonts carlo mastrangelo fred milano and angelo daleo a vocal group named for nearby belmont avenue and teamed them with dion singing lead the new groups breakthrough came in early 1958 when i wonder why on their newly formed laurie label made no 22 on the us charts dion said of the belmonts id give em sounds id give em parts and stuff thats what i wonder why was about we kind of invented this percussive rhythmic sound if you listen to that song everybody was doing something different theres four guys one guy was doing bass i was singing lead one guys going ooh wah ooh and another guys doing tenor it was totally amazing when i listen to it today oftentimes i think man those kids are talented4 their initial hit was followed by no one knows and dont pity me which also charted the billboard top 100 this success won a place for dion and the belmonts on the illfated the winter dance party tour with buddy holly ritchie valens the big bopper jp richardson frankie sardo and other performers on february 3 1959 after a concert stop in clear lake iowa holly and others decided to charter a flight to the next venue rather than travel on the tour bus dion was invited to accompany the group but decided that he did not want to spend 36 for the flight as it was the same monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment and he couldnt justify the indulgence56 the plane crashed killing all on board holly valens richardson and the pilot roger peterson dion and the belmonts continued on the tour along with frankie sardo while bobby vee then an unknown artist performed in hollys place at the very next concert later jimmy clanton frankie avalon and fabian were added to replace the other nowdeceased headliners dion and the belmonts next single a teenager in love was released in march 1959 eventually hitting no 5 on the us pop charts and no 28 in the uk7 the groups biggest hit where or when was released in november of that year and reached no 3 on the us charts however in early 1960 dion checked into hospital for heroin addiction a problem he had had since his midteens8 further single releases for the group that year were less successful there were musical personal and financial differences between dion and members of the belmonts and in october 1960 dion decided to quit for a solo career by the time of their breakup all eight laurie releases had charted on the hot 100 solo stardom 1960–1964edit by the end of 1960 dion had released his first solo album on laurie alone with dion and the single lonely teenager which rose to no 12 in the us charts the name on his solo releases was simply dion followups havin fun and kissin game had less success and the signs were that dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit however he then recorded with a new vocal group the delsatins an uptempo number cowritten with ernie maresca the record runaround sue stormed up the us charts reaching no 1 in october 1961 and no 11 in the uk7 where he also toured runaround sue sold over a million copies achieving gold disc status9 for the next single laurie promoted the aside the majestic but it was the bside marescas the wanderer which received more radio play and climbed swiftly up the charts to reach no 2 in the us in february 1962 and no 10 in the uk the 1976 rerelease made the uk top 207 the wanderer has been used in the postapocalyptic roleplaying game fallout 4 in a trailer of the same name released in 2015 by the end of 1961 dion had become a major star touring worldwide and making an appearance in the columbia pictures musical film twist around the clock he followed with a string of singles – lovers who wander no 3 little diane no 8 love came to me no 10 – in 1962 several of which he wrote or cowrote he also had successful albums with runaround sue and lovers who wander at the end of 1962 dion moved from laurie to columbia records he was the first rock and roll artist signed to the label which was an anomaly considering that its thenar director mitch miller passionately loathed that particular genre of music the first columbia single leiber and stollers ruby baby originally a hit for the drifters reached no 2 while donna the prima donna and drip drop another remake of a drifters hit both reached no 6 in late 1963 dion also recorded an italian version of donna the prima donna using the identical backup vocals his other columbia releases were less successful and problems with his addiction and changing public tastes especially the british invasion saw a period of commercial decline changing fortunes 1965–1968edit following a european tour dion returned to the us and was introduced to classic blues by columbia’s john hammond to the consternation of his management he began recording more bluesoriented material including willie dixons hoochie coochie man and spoonful but these releases – some produced by tom wilson with al kooper on keyboards – were not commercially successful in 1965 still with columbia dion formed a new group to back him the wanderers composed of john falbo on guitar pete baron pete falciglia on bass and carlo mastrangelo of the belmonts on drums they made national appearances on dick clarks where the action is and the lloyd thaxton show a number of selfpenned tracks were recorded and released unsuccessfully as singles and did not appear in album format until years later in june 1965 he recorded fellow columbia recordss contemporary bob dylans composition its all over now baby blue a halfyear before them featuring van morrisons hit version in 1966–67 dion briefly reunited with the belmonts recording the lp together again for abc records the album was unsuccessful despite one classic selfpenned song my girl the month of may two singles were released from the lp while neither charted in the united states they fared better in the uk my girl the month of may entered the radio london fab 40 top ten at no 9 the week of december 25 1966 one reviewer stated some british radio djs gave it a lot of airplay at the time the follow up movin man reached no 17 on the radio london charts on easter sunday march 26 1967 my girl the month of may was later covered by english artists alan bown in 1967 and the bunch featuring sandy denny of fairport convention in april 1972 during their brief mid 60s reunion dion and the belmonts appeared on the popular clay cole show performing berimbau and my girl the month of may and occasionally performed at local new york city clubs such as the mardi gras on staten island april 29 1967 before disbanding while dions career appeared to be nearing an end he still retained enough credibility to be along with bob dylan one of only two rock artists featured on the album cover of the beatles sgt peppers lonely hearts club band in 1967 in april 1968 dion experienced what he identified as a powerful religious experience after getting clean once again from heroin addiction an experience he documented in his 1970 song your own backyard he approached laurie records for a new contract they agreed on condition that he record the song abraham martin john written by dick holler also the writer of the royal guardsmens snoopy vs the red baron in response to the assassination of john f kennedy on november 22 1963 and those of martin luther king and robert f kennedy during the spring of 1968 the success of this song – released by dion in august 1968 and later recorded by many others including marvin gaye – which reached no 4 in the us charts and no 1 in canada resuscitated dions career it sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc10 mature and christian period 1969–1986edit for the next few years dions music became radically different moving to more contemplative and mature material he released several albums essentially as a singersongwriter to moderate sales moving to the warner brothers label in 1969 there followed a live reunion show with the belmonts at madison square garden on june 2 1972 which was recorded and released as a live album by warner a year later in 1973 dion and the original belmonts performed once more doing a sold out concert at the nassau coliseum on long island new york however no recording of the 1973 reunion was ever released this was followed in 1975 by the album born to be with you produced by phil spector the album was a commercial failure but has been subsequently praised by such artists as jason pierce of spiritualized and pete townshend of the who and the track only you know was sampled by pulp frontman jarvis cocker for his single dont let him waste your time from his 2006 solo album jarvis in 1978 dion released an album drawing on many of his teenage influences return of the wanderer another commercial failure in december 1979 there was a radical spiritual change in dion who had become a bornagain christian11 thereafter his recordings for several years were in a contemporary christian vein in which he released five albums on the dayspring records label a division of word records in waco texas these albums reflecting his evangelical christian convictions were inside job 1980 only jesus 1981 i put away my idols 1983 which charted at no 37 seasons 1984 kingdom in the streets 1985 and velvet steel 1986 several singles were successfully released to christian radio notably still in the spirit from kingdom in the streets in 1984 dion won the gma dove award christian music award for the album i put away my idols he was also nominated for grammy award for best gospel vocal performance male for the same album on september 24 1985 dion was a guest on 100 huntley street return to secular music and rock roll hall of fame induction and controversy 1987–1999edit in 1987 dion agreed to do a concert of his old hits at radio city music hall in new york the two disc cd of this concert was released in 2005 featuring concert photos by dions friend michael j friedman this concert helped free him to celebrate both his past and his future and led to a series of special appearances including a fundraiser for homeless medical relief there he shared the stage with fans such as bruce springsteen paul simon and lou reed all of whom cited dion as one of their prime influences in 1988 dions autobiography coauthored by davin seay titled the wanderer dions story was published in 1989 dimucci returned to rock music with the contemporary album yo frankie which included appearances by paul simon lou reed kd lang patty smyth and bryan adams12 produced by dave edmunds who also played guitar on the album yo frankie has a sharp sound while never losing sight of dions soulful doowop voice13 overall the relevant and nostalgic statement from an artist who helped forge rock rolls first wave found his way back on radio and
