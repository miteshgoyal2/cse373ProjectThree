times before succeeding his antic speaking style diminutive stature and pugnacious manner were his trademarks the newspapers frequently lampooned him as a colorful rube uncle joe as he was known often

convention in chicago speaker cannon presides over the house of representatives during the 59th congress 1906 cannon was chairman to the committee on appropriations fiftyfourth through fiftyseventh congresses committee on rules fiftyeighth through sixtyfirst congresses and speaker of the house of representatives fiftyeighth through sixtyfirst congresses he received fiftyeight votes for the presidential nomination at the republican national convention at chicago in 1908 speaker of the houseedit cannon wielded the office of speaker with unprecedented power at the time of cannons election the speaker of the house concurrently held the chair of the rules committee which determined under what rules and restrictions bills could be debated amended and voted on and in some cases whether they would be allowed on the floor at all as such cannon effectively controlled every aspect of the houses agenda bills reached the floor of the house only if cannon approved of them and then in whatever form he determined — with cannon himself deciding whether and to what extent the measures could be debated and amended cannon also reserved to himself the right to appoint not only the chairs of the various house committees but also all of the committees members and despite the seniority system that had begun to develop used that power to appoint his allies and proteges to leadership positions while punishing those who opposed his legislation crucially cannon exercised these powers to maintain discipline within the ranks of his own party the republicans were divided into the conservative old guard led by cannon and the progressives led by president theodore roosevelt his committee assignment privileges ensured that the partys progressive element had little influence in the house and his control over the legislative process obstructed progressive legislation revoltedit on march 17 1910 after two failed attempts to curb cannons absolute power in the house nebraska representative george norris led a coalition of 42 progressive republicans and the entire delegation of 149 democrats in a revolt with many of cannons most powerful allies absent from the chamber but enough members on hand for a quorum norris introduced a resolution that would remove the speaker from the rules committee and strip him of his power to assign committees while his lieutenants and the house sergeantatarms left the chamber to collect absent members in an attempt to rally enough votes for cannon the speakers allies initiated a legislative block in the form of a point of order debate when cannon supporters proved difficult to find many of the staunchest were irish and spent the day at various st patricks day celebrations the filibuster continued for 26 hours with cannons present friends making repeated motions for recess and adjournment when cannon finally ruled the resolution out of order at noon on march 19 norris appealed the resolution to the full house which voted to overrule cannon and then to adopt the norris resolution cannon managed to save some face by promptly requesting a vote to remove him as speaker which he won handily since the republican majority would not risk a democratic speaker replacing him however his iron rule of the house was broken and cannon lost the speakership when the democrats won a majority later that same year woodrow wilson warren g harding cannon and philander chase knox on march 4 1921 cannon on time magazines first cover on march 3 1923 postspeakeredit cannons residence in danville illinois circa 1913 cannon was defeated in
