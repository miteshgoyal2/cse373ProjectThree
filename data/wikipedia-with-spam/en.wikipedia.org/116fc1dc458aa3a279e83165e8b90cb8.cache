seeing the group audition33 he then sent them to a local radio station to record a demo session where they performed their own composition please please please which was inspired when little richard wrote the words of the title on a napkin and brown was determined to make a song out of it333435 the famous flames eventually signed with king records federal subsidiary in cincinnati ohio and issued a rerecorded version of please please please in march 1956 the song became the groups first rb hit selling over a million copies36 none of their followups gained similar success by 1957 brown had

1962 brown financed a live recording of a performance at the apollo and convinced syd nathan to release the album despite nathans belief that no one would buy a live album due to the fact that browns singles had already been bought and that live albums were usually bad sellers brown middle and the famous flames far left to right bobby bennett lloyd stallworth and bobby byrd performing live at the apollo theater in new york city 1964 live at the apollo was released the following june and became an immediate hit eventually reaching number two on the top lps chart and selling over a million

included recordings by the likes of tammy montgomery later to be famous as tammi terrell johnny bill famous flames associates johnny terry and bill hollings and the poets which was another name used for browns backing band26 during this time brown began an illfated two year relationship with 17yearold tammi terrell when she sang in his revue terrell ended their personal and professional relationship because of his abusive behavior42 in 1964 seeking bigger commercial success brown and bobby byrd formed the production company fair deal linking the operation to the mercury imprint smash records2643 king records however fought against this and was granted an injunction preventing brown from releasing any recordings for the label prior to the injunction brown had released three vocal singles including the bluesoriented hit out of sight which further indicated the direction his music was going to take44 touring throughout the year brown and the famous flames grabbed more national attention after giving an explosive showstopping performance on the live concert film the tami show the flames dynamic gospeltinged vocals polished choreography and timing as well as browns energetic dance moves and highoctane singing upstaged the proposed closing act the rolling stones having signed a new deal with king brown released his song papas got a brand new bag which became his first top ten pop hit and won him his first grammy award45 later in 1965 he issued i got you which became his second single in a row to reach numberone on the rb chart and top ten on the pop chart brown followed that up with the ballad its a mans mans mans world which confirmed his stance as a topranking performer especially with rb audiences from that point on45 1967–70 soul brother no 1edit by 1967 browns emerging sound had begun to be defined as funk music that year he released what some critics cited as the first true funk song cold sweat which hit numberone on the rb chart top 10 pop and became one of his first recordings to contain a drum break and also the first that featured a harmony that was reduced to a single chord4647 the instrumental arrangements on tracks such as give it up or turnit a loose and licking sticklicking stick both recorded in 1968 and funky drummer recorded in 1969 featured a more developed version of browns mid1960s style with the horn section guitars bass and drums meshed together in intricate rhythmic patterns based on multiple interlocking riffs changes in browns style that started with cold sweat also established the musical foundation for browns later hits such as i got the feelin 1968 and mother popcorn 1969 by this time browns vocals frequently took the form of a kind of rhythmic declamation not quite sung but not quite spoken that only intermittently featured traces of pitch or melody this would become a major influence on the techniques of rapping which would come to maturity along with hip hop music in the coming decades browns style of funk in the late 1960s was based on interlocking syncopated parts struttin bass lines syncopated drum patterns and iconic percusive guitar riffs48 the main guitar ostinatos for aint it funky and give it up or turn it loose both 1969 are examples of browns refinement of new orleans funk irresistibly danceable riffs stripped down to their rhythmic essence on both recordings the tonal structure is bare bones the pattern of attackpoints is the emphasis not the pattern of pitches its as if the guitar is an african drum or idiophone alexander stewart states that this popular feel was passed along from new orleans—through james browns music to the popular music of the 1970s49 those same tracks were later resurrected by countless hiphop musicians from the 1970s onward as a result james brown remains to this day the worlds most sampled recording artist50 bring it up has an afrocuban guajeolike structure in fact on a 1976 version cuban bongos are used all three of these guitar riffs are based on an onbeatoffbeat structure stewart states this model it should be noted is different from a time line such as clave and tresillo in that it is not an exact pattern but more of a loose organizing principle51 it was around this time as the musicians popularity increased that he acquired the nickname soul brother no 1 after failing to win the title king of soul from solomon burke during a chicago gig two years prior52 browns recordings during this period influenced musicians across the industry most notably groups such as sly and the family stone funkadelic charles wright the watts 103rd street rhythm band booker t the mgs as well as vocalists such as edwin starr david ruffin and dennis edwards from the temptations and michael jackson who throughout his career cited brown as his ultimate idol53 browns band during this period employed musicians and arrangers who had come up through the jazz tradition he was noted for his ability as a bandleader and songwriter to blend the simplicity and drive of rb with the rhythmic complexity and precision of jazz trumpeter lewis hamlin and saxophonistkeyboardist alfred pee wee ellis the successor to previous bandleader nat jones led the band guitarist jimmy nolen provided percussive deceptively simple riffs for each song and maceo parkers prominent saxophone solos provided a focal point for many performances other members of browns band included stalwart famous flames singer and sideman bobby byrd trombonist fred wesley drummers john jabo starks clyde stubblefield and melvin parker saxophonist st clair pinckney guitarist alphonso country kellum and bassist bernard odum in addition to a torrent of singles and studio albums browns output during this period included two more successful live albums live at the garden 1967 and live at the apollo volume ii 1968 and a 1968 television special james brown man to man his music empire expanded along with his influence on the music scene as browns music empire grew his desire for financial and artistic independence grew as well brown bought radio stations during the late 1960s including wrdw in his native augusta where he shined shoes as a boy45 in november 1967 james brown purchased radio station wgyw in knoxville tennessee for a reported 75000 according to the january 20 1968 record world magazine the call letters were changed to wjbe reflecting his initials wjbe began on january 15 1968 and broadcast a rhythm blues format the station slogan was wjbe 1430 raw soul brown also bought webb in baltimore in 1970 brown performing in 1973 brown branched out to make several recordings with musicians outside his own band in an attempt to appeal to the older more affluent and predominantly white adult contemporary audience brown recorded gettin down to it 1969 and soul on top 1970—two albums consisting mostly of romantic ballads jazz standards and homologous reinterpretations of his earlier hits—with the dee felice trio and the louie bellson orchestra in 1968 he recorded a number of funkoriented tracks with the dapps a white cincinnati band including the hit i cant stand myself he also released three albums of christmas music with his own band 1970–75 godfather of souledit main article the jbs in march 1970 most of browns midtolate 1960s road band walked out on him due to money disputes a development augured by the prior disbandment of the famous flames singing group for the same reason in 1968 brown and erstwhile famous flames singer bobby byrd who chose to remain in the band during this tumultuous period subsequently recruited several members of the cincinnatibased the pacemakers which included bootsy collins and his brother phelps catfish collins augmented by the remaining members of the 1960s road band including fred wesley who rejoined browns outfit in december 1970 and other newer musicians they would form the nucleus of the jbs browns new backing ensemble shortly following their first performance together the band entered the studio to record the brownbyrd composition get up i feel like being a sex machine the song and other contemporaneous singles would further cement browns influence in the nascent genre of funk music this iteration of the jbs dissolved after a march 1971 european tour documented on the 1991 archival release love power peace due to additional money disputes and bootsy collins use of lsd the collins brothers would soon become integral members of parliamentfunkadelic while a new lineup of the jbs coalesced around wesley st clair pinckney and drummer john starks in 1971 brown began recording for polydor records which also took over distribution of browns king records catalog many of his sidemen and supporting players including fred wesley the jbs bobby byrd lyn collins vicki anderson and former rival hank ballard released records on the people label an imprint founded by brown that was purchased by polydor as part of browns new contract the recordings on the people label almost all of which were produced by brown himself exemplified his house style songs such as i know you got soul by bobby byrd think by lyn collins and doing it to death by fred wesley the jbs are considered as much a part of browns recorded legacy as the recordings released under his own name that year he also began touring african countries and was received well by audiences there during the 1972 presidential election james brown openly proclaimed his support of richard nixon for reelection of the presidency over democratic candidate george mcgovern54 the decision led to a boycott of his performances and according to brown cost him a big portion of his black audience55 as a result browns record sales and concerts in the united states reached a lull in 1973 as he failed to land a numberone rb single that year brown relied more on touring outside the united states where he continued to perform for soldout crowds in cities such as london paris and lausanne that year he also faced problems with the irs for failure to pay back taxes charging he hadnt paid upwards of 45 million five years earlier the irs had claimed he owed nearly 2 million56 in 1973 brown provided the score for the blaxploitation film black caesar he also recorded another soundtrack for the film slaughters big ripoff following the release of these soundtracks brown acquired a selfstyled nickname the godfather of soul which remains his most popular nickname in 1974 he returned to the no 1 spot on the rb charts with the payback with the parent album reaching the same spot on the album charts he would reach no 1 two more times in 1974 with my thang and papa dont take no mess later that year he returned to africa and performed in kinshasa as part of the buildup to the rumble in the jungle fight between muhammad ali and george foreman admirers of browns music including miles davis and other jazz musicians began to cite him as a major influence on their own styles however brown like others who were influenced by his music also borrowed from other musicians his 1976 single hot i need to be loved loved loved loved rb 31 used the main riff from fame by david bowie not the other way around as was often believed the riff was provided to fame cowriters john lennon and bowie by guitarist carlos alomar who had briefly been a member of browns band in the late 1960s57 browns papa dont take no mess would be his final single to reach the no 1 spot on the rb charts and his final top 40 pop single of the 1970s though he continued to occasionally have top 10 rb recordings among his top ten rb hits during this latter period included funky president and get up offa that thing the latter song released in 1976 and aimed at musical rivals such as barry white the ohio players and kc and the sunshine band brown credited his thenwife and two of their children as writers of the song to avoid concurrent tax problems with the irs starting in october 1975 brown produced directed and hosted future shock an atlantabased television variety show that ran for three years 1975–91 decline and resurgenceedit although his records were mainstays of the vanguard new york underground disco scene exemplified by djs such as david mancuso and francis grasso from 1969 onwards brown did not consciously yield to the trend until 1975s sex machine today by 1977 he was no longer a dominant force in rb after get up offa that thing thirteen of browns late 1970s recordings for polydor failed to reach the top 10 of the rb chart with only bodyheat in 1976 and the discooriented its too funky in here in 1979 reaching the rb top 15 and the ballad kiss in 77 reaching the top 20 after 1976s bodyheat he also failed to appear on the billboard hot 100 as a result browns concert attendance began dropping and his reported disputes with the irs caused his business empire to collapse in addition browns former bandmates including fred wesley maceo parker and the collins brothers had found bigger success as members of george clintons parliamentfunkadelic collective the emergence of disco also stopped browns success on the rb charts because its slicker more commercial style had superseded his more raw funk productions by the release of 1979s the original disco man brown was not providing much production or writing leaving most of it to producer brad shapiro resulting in the song its too funky in here becoming browns most successful single in this period after two more albums failed to chart brown left polydor in 1981 it was around this time that brown changed the name of his band from the jbs to the soul generals or soul gs the band retained that name until his death despite the decline in his record sales brown enjoyed something of a resurgence in this period starting with appearances in the feature films the blues brothers doctor detroit and rocky iv as well as gueststarring in the miami vice episode missing hours 1987 in 1984 he teamed with rap musician afrika bambaattaa on the song unity a year later he signed with scotti brothers records and issued the moderately successful album gravity in 1986 it included browns final top

1988 brown worked with the production team full force on the new jack swinginfluenced album im real it spawned his final two top 10 rb hits im real and static which peaked at no 2 and no 5 respectively on the rb charts meanwhile the drum break from the second version of the original 1969 hit give it up or turnit a loose the recording included on the compilation album in the jungle groove became so popular at hip hop dance parties especially for breakdance during the early 1980s that hip hop founding father kurtis blow called the song the national anthem of hip hop58 1991–2006

brown revue and members of the revue traveled with him in a bus to cities and towns all over the country performing upwards of 330 shows a year with almost all of the shows as onenighters8990 concert introductionedit before james brown appeared on stage his personal mc gave him an elaborate introduction accompanied by drumrolls as the mc worked in browns various sobriquets along with the names of many of his hit songs the introduction by fats gonder captured on browns 1963 album live at the apollo album is a representative example so now ladies and gentlemen it is star time are you ready for

man that sings ill go crazy try me youve got the power think if you want me i dont mind bewildered the million dollar seller lost someone the very latest release night train lets everybody shout and shimmy mr dynamite the amazing mr please please himself the star of the show james brown and the famous flames91 concert repertoire and formatedit brown and mc danny ray during cape routine bbc electric proms 06 concert james browns performances were famous for their intensity and length his own stated goal was to give people more than what they came for — make them tired cause thats what they came for92 browns concert repertoire consisted mostly of his own hits and recent songs with a few rb covers mixed in brown danced vigorously as he sang working popular dance steps such as the mashed potato into his routine along with dramatic leaps splits and slides in addition his horn players and singing group the famous flames typically performed choreographed dance routines and later incarnations of the revue included backup dancers male performers in the revue were required to wear tuxedoes and cummerbunds long after more casual concert wear became the norm among the younger musical acts browns own extravagant outfits and his elaborate processed hairdo completed the visual impression a james brown concert typically included a performance by a featured vocalist such as vicki anderson or marva whitney and an instrumental feature for the band which sometimes served as the opening act for the show cape routineedit a trademark feature of browns stage shows usually during the song please please please involved brown dropping to his knees while clutching the microphone stand in his hands prompting the shows longtime mc danny ray to come out drape a cape over browns shoulders and escort him off the stage after he had worked himself to exhaustion during his performance as brown was escorted off the stage by the mc browns vocal group the famous flames continued singing the background vocals please please dont gooh93 brown would then shake off the cape and stagger back to the microphone to perform an encore browns routine was inspired by a similar one used by the professional wrestler gorgeous george as well as little richard919495 brown performs a version of the cape routine over the closing credits of the film blues brothers 2000 and in the film of the tami show 1964 in which he and the famous flames upstaged the rolling stones the police refer to james brown on the tami show in their 1980 song when the world is running down you make the best of whats still around as band leaderedit brown demanded extreme discipline perfection and precision from his musicians and dancers – performers in his revue showed up for rehearsals and members wore the right uniform or costume for concert performances96 during an interview conducted by terri gross during the npr segment fresh air with maceo parker a former saxophonist in browns band for most of the 1960s and part of the 1970s and 1980s parker offered his experience with the discipline that brown demanded of the band you gotta be on time you gotta have your uniform your stuffs got to be intact you gotta have the bow tie you got to have it you cant come up without the bow tie you cannot come up without a cummerbund the patent leather shoes we were wearing at the time gotta be greased you just gotta have this stuff this is what brown expected brown bought the costumes he bought the shoes and if for some reason the band member decided to leave the group brown told the person to please leave my uniforms — maceo parker97 brown also had a practice of directing correcting and assessing fines on members of his band who broke his rules such as wearing unshined shoes dancing out of sync or showing up late on stage98 during some of his concert performances brown danced in front of his band with his back to the audience as he slid across the floor flashing hand signals and splaying his pulsating fingers to the beat of the music although audiences thought browns dance routine was part of his act this practice was actually his way of pointing to the offending member of his troupe who played or sang the wrong note or committed some other infraction brown used his splayed fingers and hand signals to alert the offending person of the fine that person must pay to him for breaking his rules99 browns demands of his support acts were meanwhile quite the reverse as fred wesley recalled of his time as musical director of the jbs if brown felt intimidated by a support act he would try to undermine their performances by shortening their sets without notice demanding that they not do certain showstopping songs and even insisting on doing the unthinkable playing drums on some of their songs a sure set killer100 social activismedit education advocacy and humanitarianismedit browns main social activism was in preserving the need for education among youths influenced by his own troubled childhood and his forced dropping out of the seventh grade for wearing insufficient clothes due to heavy dropout rates in the 1960s brown released the proeducation song dont be a dropout royalties of the song were donated to charity used for dropout prevention programs the success of this led to brown meeting with president lyndon b johnson at the white house johnson cited brown for being a positive role model to the youth a lifelong republican like his best friend ray charles james brown gained the confidence of president richard nixon to whom he found he had to explain the plight of black americans101 he was also harassed by j edgar hoover and the irs probably because hoover thought it dangerous that a young black radical had the ear of the president101 throughout the remainder of his life brown made public speeches in schools and continued to advocate the importance of education in school upon filing his will in 2002 brown advised that most of the money in his estate go into creating the i feel good inc trust to benefit disadvantaged children and provide scholarships for his grandchildren his final single killing is out school is in advocated against murders of young children in the streets brown often gave out money and other items to children while traveling to his childhood hometown of augusta a week before his death while looking gravely ill brown gave out toys and turkeys to kids at an atlanta orphanage something he had done several times over the years civil rights and selfrelianceedit though brown performed at benefit rallies for civil rights organizations in the mid1960s brown often shied away from discussing civil rights in his songs in 1968 in response to a growing urge of antiwar advocacy during the vietnam war brown recorded the song america is my home in the song brown performed a rap advocating patriotism and exhorting listeners to stop pitying yourselves and get up and fight at the time of the songs release brown had been participating in performing for troops stationed in vietnam on april 5 1968 a day after the assassination of martin luther king jr in memphis tennessee brown provided a free citywide televised concert at the boston garden to maintain public order and calm concerned boston relatives over the objections of the police chief who wanted to call off the concert which he thought would incite violence45 the show was later released on dvd as live at the boston garden april 5 1968 according to the documentary the night james brown saved boston thenmayor kevin white had strongly restrained the boston police from cracking down on minor violence and protests after the assassination while religious and community leaders worked to keep tempers from flaring102 white arranged to have browns performance broadcast multiple times on bostons public television station wgbh thus keeping potential rioters off the streets watching the concert for free102 angered by not being told of this brown demanded 60000 for gate fees money he thought would be lost from ticket sales on account of the concert being broadcast for free and then threatened to go public about the secret arrangement when the city balked at paying up afterwards news of which would have been a political death blow to white and spark riots of its own102 white eventually lobbied the behindthescenes powerbrokering group known as the vault to come up with money for browns gate fee and other social programs contributing 100000 brown received 15000 from them via the city white also persuaded management at the garden to give up their share of receipts to make up the differences102 following this successful performance brown was cautioned by president johnson to visit cities ravaged from riots following kings assassination to not resort to violence telling them to cool it theres another way103 responding to pressure from black activists including h rap brown to take a bigger stance on their issues and from footage of black on black crime committed in inner cities brown wrote the lyrics to the song say it loud – im black and im proud which his bandleader alfred pee wee ellis accompanied with a musical composition released late that summer the songs lyrics helped to make it an anthem for the civil rights movement brown only performed the song sporadically following its initial release and later stated he had regrets recording it saying in 1984 now say it loud – im black and im proud has done more for the black race than any other record but if i had my choice i wouldnt have done it because i dont like defining anyone by race to teach race is to teach separatism104 in his autobiography he stated the song is obsolete now but it was necessary to teach pride then and i think the song did a lot of good for a lot of people people called black and proud militant and angry – maybe because of the line about dying on your feet instead of living on your knees but really if you listen to it it sounds like a childrens song thats why i had children in it so children who heard it could grow up feeling pride the song cost me a lot of my crossover audience the racial makeup at my concerts was mostly black after that i dont regret it though even if it was misunderstood105 in 1969 brown recorded two more songs of social commentary world and i dont want nobody to give me nothing the latter song pleading for equal opportunity and selfreliance rather than entitlement in 1970 in response to some black leaders for not being outspoken enough he recorded get up get into it get involved and talkin loud and sayin nothing in 1971 he began touring africa including zambia and nigeria he was made freeman of the city in lagos nigeria by oba adeyinka oyekan for his influence on black people all over the world106107 with his company james brown enterprises brown helped to provide jobs for blacks in business in the communities108 as the 1970s continued brown continued to record songs of social commentary most prominently 1972s king heroin and the twopart ballad public enemy which dealt with drug addiction political viewsedit during the 1968 presidential campaign brown endorsed democratic presidential candidate hubert humphrey and appeared with humphrey at political rallies brown began supporting republican president richard nixon after being invited to perform at nixons inaugural ball in january 1969109 browns endorsement of nixon during the 1972 presidential election negatively impacted his career during that period with several national black organizations boycotting his records and protesting at his concert shows110 brown stated he was neither democratic nor republican despite his support of republican presidents such as nixon and ronald reagan111 in 1999 when being interviewed by rolling stone the magazine asked him to name a hero in the 20th century brown mentioned john f kennedy and 96yearold former dixiecrat senator strom thurmond stating when the young whippersnappers get out of line whether democratic or republican an old man can walk up and say wait a minute son it goes this way and thats great for our country hes like a grandfather to me112 in 2003 brown was the featured attraction of a washington dc fundraiser for the national republican senatorial committee113 following the deaths of ronald reagan and his friend ray charles brown said to cnn im kind of in an uproar i love the country and i got – you know ive been around a long time through many presidents and everything so after losing mr reagan who i knew very well then mr ray charles who i worked with and lived with like all our life we had a show together in oakland many many years ago and its like you found the placard114 personal lifeedit at the

relationship that continued until she escaped his abuse117 bobby bennett former member of the famous flames told rolling stone about the abuse he witnessed he beat tammi terrell terrible says bennett she was bleeding shedding blood terrell who died in 1970 was browns girlfriend before she became famous as marvin gayes singing partner in the midsixties tammi left him because she didnt want her butt

provide king with court records pointing to an annulment of her marriage to him or to ahmed120 according to dallas brown was angry and hurt that hynie had concealed her prior marriage from him and brown moved to file for annulment from hynie121 dallas added that though hynies marriage to ahmed was annulled after she married brown the brownhynie marriage was not valid under south carolina law because brown and hynie did not remarry after the annulment120122 in august 2003 brown took out a fullpage public notice in variety featuring hynie james ii and himself on vacation at disney world to

collins intentionally took lsd during a concert gig in 1971 causing brown to fire them after the show because he had suspected them to be on drugs all along130 however by the mid1980s it was alleged
