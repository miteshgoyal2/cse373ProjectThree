the 2010 census although newcastle was not incorporated until 1994 it has been an important settlement and town since the late 19th century and played a major role in the development of seattle and the seattle region5 newcastle was one of the regions earliest coal mining areas and its railroad link to seattle was the first in king county timber also played a role in the early history of newcastle coal delivered by rail from newcastles mines to seattle fueled the growth of the port of seattle and attracted railroads most notably the great northern railway the newcastle coal mine began producing coal by the 1870s more than 13 million tons of coal had been extracted by the time the mine closed in 1963 the history of newcastles coal mining industry and the legacy of the mines many chinese laborers are memorialized in place names such as coal creek coal creek parkway and the coal creek and china creek golf courses based on per capita income newcastle ranks 11th of 522 areas in

it was originally a coal mining town founded in the 1870s coal was discovered along coal creek in 1863 the surveyors philip h lewis and edwin richardson made the discovery while surveying the area for the general land office6 by 1872 75100 tons of coal per day were being produced at newcastle about 60 men worked at the mines7 the seattle and walla walla railroad the first railroad in king county was built from seattle to newcastle in the late 19th century coal mining ended in 1963 the area was an unincorporated area within king county until it incorporated as a city on september 30 1994 currently the city is a suburban community based on newcastles location north of renton south of bellevue and across lake washington from seattle these are the communities in which most of the residents of newcastle work east of southeast lake washington is a large quantity of hilly terrain which creates opportunities for view properties this created the impetus for the location of the newcastle golf course along with many high value homes at higher elevations with views of downtown bellevue seattle and mercer island as well as the olympic mountains notable attractions of the area include the golf club at newcastle a brand new family ymca lake boren park a well developed trail system and nearby cougar mountain in the east of newcastle newcastle trailsedit the city has an active trail building community creating a system of trails that are being integrated into new housing developments and parks most of the trailwork has been completed by volunteers and the washington conservation corps or wcc sponsored by the city of newcastle the trail system will eventually lead all the way to lake washington to the west in conjunction with renton and is already connected to cougar mountain regional wildland park to the east which is in unincorporated king county zip code controversyedit the city has not obtained its own zip code even though based on the zip code designation some sales taxes paid by newcastle residents go to renton instead of newcastle as tax revenues among other perceived detrimental impacts related to mail service insurance rates property values and credit ratings891011 this is all the more troubling considering the small size of newcastle with a small commercial district which does not create as much property tax or sales tax revenue for the city compared to neighboring cities like renton to the south bellevue to the north or issaquah to the east view from the golf club of newcastle the skyscrapers of both seattle and bellevue are
