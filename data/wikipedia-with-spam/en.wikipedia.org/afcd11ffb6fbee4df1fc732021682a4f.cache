school and even before cimon enclosed its precincts with a wall1 it contained a sacred grove of olive trees dedicated to athena the goddess of wisdom outside the city walls of ancient athens2 the archaic name for the site was hekademia which by classical times evolved into akademia and was explained at least as early as the beginning of the 6th century bc by linking it to an athenian hero a legendary akademos the site of akademia was sacred to athena and other immortals platos immediate successors as scholarch of akademia were speusippus 347–339 bc xenocrates 339–314 bc polemon 314–269 bc crates ca 269–266 bc and arcesilaus ca 266–240 bc later scholarchs include lacydes of cyrene carneades clitomachus and philo of larissa the last undisputed head of the academy34 other notable members of akademia include aristotle heraclides ponticus eudoxus of cnidus philip of opus crantor and antiochus of ascalon the neoplatonic academy of late antiquityedit further information end of hellenic religion after a lapse during the early roman occupation akademia was refounded5 as a new institution of some outstanding platonists of late antiquity who called themselves successors diadochoi but of plato and presented themselves as an uninterrupted tradition reaching back to plato however there cannot have actually been any geographical institutional economic or personal continuity with the original academy in the new organizational entity6 the last greek philosophers of the revived akademia in the 6th century were drawn from various parts of the hellenistic cultural world and suggest the broad syncretism of the common culture see koine five of the seven akademia philosophers mentioned by agathias were syriac in their cultural origin hermias and diogenes both from phoenicia isidorus of gaza damascius of syria iamblichus of coelesyria and perhaps even simplicius of cilicia6 the emperor justinian closed the school in ad 529 a date that is often cited as the end of antiquity according to the sole witness the historian agathias its remaining members looked for protection under the rule of sassanid king khosrau i in his capital at ctesiphon carrying with them precious scrolls of literature and philosophy and to a lesser degree of science after a peace treaty between the persian and the byzantine empire in 532 guaranteed their personal security an early document in the history of freedom of religion some members found sanctuary in the pagan stronghold of harran near edessa one of the last leading figures of this group was simplicius a pupil of damascius the last head of the athenian school it has been speculated that akademia did not altogether disappear67 after his exile simplicius and perhaps some others may have travelled to harran near edessa from there the students of an academyinexile could have survived into the 9th century long enough to facilitate the arabic revival of the neoplatonist commentary tradition in baghdad7 ancient

in italyedit with the neoplatonist revival that accompanied the revival of humanist studies accademia took on newly vivid connotations 15th century accademieedit during the florentine renaissance cosimo de medici took a personal interest in the new platonic academy that he determined to reestablish in 1439 centered on the marvellous promise shown by the young marsilio ficino cosimo had been inspired by the arrival at the otherwise ineffective council of florence of gemistos plethon who seemed a dazzling figure to the florentine intellectualscitation needed in 1462 cosimo gave ficino a villa at careggi for the academys use situated where cosimo could see it from his own villa and drop by for visits the academy remained a wholly informal group but one which had a great influence on renaissance neoplatonism main article roman academies in rome after unity was restored following the western schism humanist circles cultivating philosophy and searching out and sharing ancient texts tended to gather where there was access to a library the vatican library was not coordinated until 1475 and was never catalogued or widely accessible not all popes looked with satisfaction at gatherings of unsupervised intellectuals at the head of this movement for renewal in rome was cardinal bessarion whose house from the midcentury was the centre of a flourishing academy of neoplatonic philosophy and a varied intellectual culture his valuable greek as well as latin library eventually bequeathed to the city of venice after he withdrew from rome was at the disposal of the academicians bessarion in the latter years of his life retired from rome to ravenna but he left behind him ardent adherents of the classic philosophy the next generation of humanists were bolder admirers of pagan culture especially in the highly personal academy of pomponius leto the natural son of a nobleman of the sanseverino family born in calabria but known by his academic name who devoted his energies to the enthusiastic study of classical antiquity and attracted a great number of disciples and admirers he was a worshipper not merely of the literary and artistic form but also of the ideas and spirit of classic paganism which made him appear a condemner of christianity and an enemy of the church in his academy every member assumed a classical name its principal members were humanists like bessarions protégé giovanni antonio campani campanus bartolomeo platina the papal librarian and filippo buonaccorsi and young visitors who received polish in the academic circle like publio fausto andrelini of bologna who took the new learning to the university of paris to the discomfiture of his friend erasmus in their selfconfidence these first intellectual neopagans compromised themselves politically at a time when rome was full of conspiracies fomented by the roman barons and the neighbouring princes paul ii 1464–71 caused pomponio and the leaders of the academy to be arrested on charges of irreligion immorality and conspiracy against the pope the prisoners begged so earnestly for mercy and with such protestations of repentance that they were pardoned the letonian academy however collapsed8 in naples the quattrocento academy founded by alfonso of aragon and guided by antonio beccadelli was the porticus antoniana later known as the accademia pontaniana after giovanni pontano 16thcentury literaryaesthetic academiesedit the 16th century saw at rome a great increase of literary and aesthetic academies more or less inspired by the renaissance all of which assumed as was the fashion odd and fantastic names we learn from various sources the names of many such institutes as a rule they soon perished and left no trace in the 1520s came the accademia degli intronati for the encouragement of theatrical representations there were also the academy of the vignaiuoli or vinegrowers 1530 and the accademia della virtù it 1542 founded by claudio tolomei under the patronage of cardinal ippolito de medici these were followed by a new academy in the orti or farnese gardens there were also the academies of the intrepidi 1560 the animosi 1576 and the illuminati 1598 this last founded by the marchesa isabella aldobrandini pallavicino towards the middle of the 16th century there were also the academy of the notti vaticane or vatican nights founded by st charles borromeo an accademia di diritto civile e canonico and another of the university scholars and students of philosophy accademia eustachiana as a rule these academies all very much alike were merely circles of friends or clients gathered around a learned man or wealthy patron and were dedicated to literary pastimes rather than methodical study they fitted in nevertheless with the general situation and were in their own way one element of the historical development despite their empirical and fugitive character they helped to keep up the general esteem for literary and other studies cardinals prelates and the clergy in general were most favourable to this movement and assisted it by patronage and collaboration in florence the medici again took the lead in establishing the accademia e compagnia delle arti del disegno in 1563 the first of the more formally organised art academies that gradually displaced the medieval artists guilds usually known as the guild of saint luke as the bodies responsible for training and often regulating artists a change with great implications for the development of art leading to the styles known as academic art the private accademia degli incamminati set up later in the century in bologna by the carracci brothers was also extremely influential and with the accademia di san luca of rome founded 1593 helped to confirm the use of the term for these institutions 17th and 18thcentury academies in europeedit gradually academies began to specialize on particular topics arts language sciences and began to be founded and funded by the kings and other sovereigns few republics had an academy and mainly since 17th century academies spread throughout europe literaryphilosophical academiesedit in the 17th century the tradition of literaryphilosophical academies as circles of friends gathering around learned patrons was continued in italy the umoristi 1611 the fantastici 1625 and the ordinati founded by cardinal dati and giulio strozzi about 1700 were founded the academies of the infecondi the occulti the deboli the aborigini the immobili the accademia esquilina and others during the 18th century many italian cities established similar philosophical and scientific academies in the first half of the 19th century some of these became the national academies of preunitarian states the academy of accesi became the panomitan academy of buon gusto trento the academy of timidi became the royal academy of mantua the accademia dei ricovrati became the galileiana academy of arts and science padova the academy of dissonanti became the royal academy of modena and the academy of oscuri became the royal academy of lucca academies of the artsedit the académie de peinture et de sculpture in paris established by the monarchy in 1648 later renamed was the most significant of the artistic academies running the famous salon exhibitions from 1725 artistic academies were established all over europe by the end of the 18th century and many like the akademie der künste in berlin founded 1696 the real academia de bellas artes de san fernando in madrid founded 1744 the imperial academy of arts in saint petersburg 1757 the royal academy in london 1768 and the accademia di belle arti di brera in milan 1776 still run art schools and hold large exhibitions although their influence on taste greatly declined from the late 19th century a fundamental feature of academic discipline in the artistic academies was regular practice in making accurate drawings from antiquities or from casts of antiquities on the one hand and on the other in deriving inspiration from the other fount the human form students assembled in sessions drawing the draped and undraped human form and such drawings which survive in the tens of thousands from the 17th through the 19th century are termed académies in french similar institutions were often established for other arts rome had the accademia di santa cecilia for music from 1585 paris had the académie royale de musique from 1669 and the académie royale darchitecture from 1671 linguistic academiesedit main article list of language regulators the accademia degli infiammati of padova and the accademia degli umidi soon renamed the accademia fiorentina of florence were both founded in 1540 and were both initially concerned with the proper basis for literary use of the volgare or vernacular language of italy which would later become the italian language in 1582 five florentine literati gathered and founded the accademia della crusca to demonstrate and conserve the beauty of the florentine vernacular tongue modelled upon the authors of the trecento the main instrument to do so was the vocabolario degli accademici della crusca the crusca long remained a private institution criticizing and opposing the official accademia fiorentina the first institution inspired by the crusca was the fruitbearing society for german language which existed from 1617 to 1680 the crusca inspired richelieu to found in 1634 the analogous académie française with the task of acting as an official authority on the french language charged with publishing the official dictionary of that language the following year the académie received letters patent from the king louis xiii as the only recognized academy for french language in its turn the state established académie was the model for the real academia española founded in 1713 and the swedish academy 1786 which are the ruling bodies of their respective languages and editors of major dictionaries it also was the model for the russian academy founded in 1783 which afterwards merged into the russian academy of sciences academies of sciencesedit main article academy of sciences after the shortlived academia secretorum naturae of naples the first academy exclusively devoted to sciences was the accademia dei lincei founded in 1603 in rome particularly focused on natural sciences in 1657 some students of galileo founded the accademia del cimento academy of experiment in florence focused on physics and astronomy the foundation of academy was funded by prince leopoldo and grand duke ferdinando ii de medici this academy lasted after few decades in 1652 was founded the academia naturae curiosorum by four physicians9 in 1677 leopold i emperor of the holy roman empire recognised the society and in 1687 he gave it the epithet leopoldina with which is internationally famous10 p 7–8 11 so it became the academy of sciences for the whole holy roman empire on 28 november 1660 a group of scientists from and influenced by the invisible college gathering approximately since 1645 met at gresham college and announced the formation of a college for the promoting of physicomathematical experimental learning which would meet weekly to discuss science and run experiments in 1662 charles ii of england signed a royal charter which created the royal society of london then royal society of london for the improvement of natural knowledge in 1666 colbert gathered a small group of scholars to found a scientific society in paris the first 30 years of the academys existence were relatively informal since no statutes had as yet been laid down for the institution in contrast to royal society the academy was founded as an organ of government in 1699 louis xiv gave the academy its first rules and named it académie royale des sciences although prussia was a member of holy roman empire in 1700 princeelector frederick iii of brandenburg founded its own prussian academy of sciences upon the advice of gottfried leibniz who was appointed president during the 18th century many european kings followed and founded their own academy of sciences in 1714 the academy of sciences of the institute of bologna in 1724 the russian academy of sciences in 1731 the royal dublin society in 1735 in tuscany in 1739 the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1742 the royal danish academy of sciences and letters in 1751 the gottingen academy of sciences in 1754 in erfurt in 1759 the bavarian academy of sciences and humanities in 1763 the academia theodoropalatina in heidelberg in 1779 the sciences academy of lisbon in 1783 the royal society of edinburgh in 1782 the accademia dei quaranta in rome in 1784 in turin this kind of academy lost importance after the university reform begun with the foundation of the university of berlin when universities were provided with laboratories and clinics and were charged with doing experimental research military academiesedit at first such institutions only trained the artillery and military engineering officiers like the aula da artilharia founded in 1641 and the aula de fortificação 1647 in lisbon the real accademia di savoia in turin opened in 1678 the imperial artillery military academy of saint petersburg 1698 the royal military academy woolwich 1741 the real colegio de artilleria in segovia 1764 starting at the end of the 16th century in the holy roman empire france poland and denmark many knight academies were established to prepare the aristocratic youth for state and military service many of them lately turned into gymnasiums but some of them were transformed into true military academies the royal danish military academy began to educate all officers for the royal danish army by request of king frederick iv in 1713 the école militaire was founded by louis xv of france in 1750 with the aim of creating an academic college for cadet officers from poor families the construction began in 1752 but the school did not open until 1760 the theresian military academy was founded on 14 december 1751 by maria theresa of austria per year the academy accepted 100 noblemen and 100 commoners to start their education there12 these were the model for the subsequent military academies throughout europe like the reale accademia militare of naples in 1787 and the military academy karlberg in 1792 modern use of the term academyedit the modern academy of athens next to the university of athens and the national library forming the trilogy designed by schinkels danish pupil theofil hansen 1885 in greek ionic academically correct even to the polychrome sculpture national academies are bodies for scientists artists or writers that are usually statefunded and often are given the role of controlling much of the state funding for research into their areas or other forms of funding some use different terms in their name the british royal society for example the membership typically comprises distinguished individuals in the relevant field who may be elected by the other members or appointed by the government they are essentially not schools or colleges though some may operate teaching arms the académie française was the most influential pattern for these the academy of motion picture arts and sciences which presents the annual academy awards is an example of a purely industry body using the name collegetype specialized academies include the royal academy of music of the united kingdom the united states military academy at west point new york the united states naval academy united states air force academy and the australian defence force academy in emulation of the military academies police in the united states are trained in police academies because of the tradition of intellectual brilliance associated with this institution many groups have chosen to use the word academy in their name especially specialized tertiary educational institutions in the early 19th century academy took the connotations that gymnasium was acquiring in germanspeaking lands of school that was less advanced than a college for which it might prepare students but considerably more than elementary early american examples are the prestigious preparatory schools of phillips andover academy phillips exeter academy and deerfield academy in england academy had a specialized meaning for schools but the edinburgh academy was more like the american examples academy was also used very loosely for various commercial training schools for dancing and the like mozart organized public subscription performances of his music in vienna in the 1780s and 1790s he called the concerts academies this usage in musical terms survives in the concert orchestra academy of st martin in the fields and in the brixton academy a concert hall in brixton south london academies proliferated in the 20th century until even a threeweek series of lectures and discussions would be termed an academy in addition the generic term the academy is sometimes used to refer to all of academia which is sometimes considered a global successor to the academy of athens french regional academies overseeing educationedit a map outlining the academies overseeing education in france in france regional academic councils called academies are responsible for supervising all aspects of education in their region the academy regions are similar to but not identical to the standard french administrative regions the rector of each academy is a revocable nominee of the ministry of education these academies main responsibility is overseeing primary and secondary education but public universities are in some respects also answerable to the academy for their region however french private universities are independent of the state and therefore independent of the regional academies russian research academiesedit in imperial russia and soviet union the term academy or academy of sciences was reserved to denote a state research establishment see russian academy of sciences the latter one still exists in russia although other types of academies study and honorary appeared as well english school typesedit tertiary educationedit main article dissenting academies from the midseventeenth to the 19th centuries educational institutions in england run by nonconformist groups that did not agree with the church of england teachings were collectively known as the dissenting academies as a place at an english public school or university generally required conformity to the church of england these institutions provided an alternative for those with different religious views and formed a significant part of england’s educational system university college london ucl was founded in 1826 as the first publicly funded english university to admit anyone regardless of religious adherence and the test and corporation acts which had imposed a wide range of restrictions on citizens who were not in conformity to the church of england were abolished shortly afterwards by the catholic relief act of 1829 primary and secondary educationedit main article academy english school in 2000 a form of independent state schools called academies were introduced in england they have been compared to us charter schools13 they are directly funded from central government rather than through local councils and are partly privately sponsored often the sponsors are from business but some are sponsored by universities and charities these schools have greater autonomy than schools run by the local councils they are usually a type of secondary school but some are all through schools with an integral primary school some of the early ones were briefly known as city academies—the first such school opening on 10 september 2002 at the business academy bexley14 the queens speech which followed the 2010 general election included proposals for a bill to allow the secretary of state for education to approve schools both primary and secondary that have been graded outstanding by ofsted to become academies this will be through a simplified streamlined process which will not require the sponsors to provide capital funding15 in 2012 the uk government began forcing some schools which had been graded satisfactory or lower into becoming academies unilaterally removing existing governing bodies and head teachers in some cases an example was downhills primary school in haringey where the head teacher refused to turn the school into an academy ofsted were called in to assess the school failed it and both the head and the governing body were removed and replaced with a governmentappointed board despite opposition from the school and parents1617 see alsoedit academician ibn sina academy of
