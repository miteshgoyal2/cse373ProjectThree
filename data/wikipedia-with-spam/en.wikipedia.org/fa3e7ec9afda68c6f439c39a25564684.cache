his new radio show in new york39 la radio is really hip compared to new york here the scene is very provincial and ethnic and liberal being a conservative i am referred to by most of my callers as the house rightwinger or fascist actually it gets pretty funny because they do more yelling at me than engaging in useful debate the audience in los angeles was much more sophisticated” “since wmca started dialog radio it’s really shot up in the ratings we’ve gone from around 12th to third in the market grant was distinctively out of fashion with both the times and with some countercultural wmca personalities including alex bennett his offbeat but combative style along with fairness doctrine requirements of the era won him seven years on wmca with a growing and loyal audience grant became

only for minorities44 on march 8 1973 grant had scheduled new york rep benjamin s rosenthal who was leading a boycott of meat grant later learned that rosenthal would not appear on his show and in a discussion with a caller grant referred to rosenthal as a coward rosenthal then filed a complaint with the fcc and the issue went all the way up to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in straus communications v federal communications commission united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit january 16 1976 wright j454647 the appeals court ultimately ruled in favor of wmca and grant due to the fact that grant offered the congressman an invitation to appear on his show granting rosenthal equal time47 grant did an early shock jock stunt while at wmca a female listener had called in and was curious about pornographic films grant decided to take women who listened to him on a trip to a times square porno theater to view a porn film37 about 100 women showed up for the trip followed by a roundtable discussion on grants show grant would have two more listener trips to see a porn film after this one of grants most memorable regular callers was ms trivia who aired her beef of the week a series of seemingly trivial complaints ms trivia was grants guest at a halloween festival dinner held at lauritanos restaurant in the bronx where a young ms trivia not long out of her teens revealed herself for the first time to a startled radio audience many who had expected and assumed based upon her articulation and intonation that she would be an elderly prudish woman instead a statuesque and fashionable ms trivia wearing an elaborate victorian costume was the surprise guest seated next to grant at the dais table along with several political figures from new york the following day the majority of calls to the show were for the purpose of obtaining information about the mysterious mm trivia with grant in his typical manner finally in exasperation hanging up on the callers shouting this is not mm trivias show48 grant popularized the gry word puzzle on his wmca show in 1975 stating some version of the question there are three words in the english language that end in gry two of them are angry and hungry what is the third this has no conclusive answer and spread following grants broadcast while at wmca grant attracted

“ i had done my nightly show on wor and a caller phoned in to the show saying he was upset with a woman who was blaming the police for what happened to her sons i had read the story the man was referring to and noted that the woman who was very angry with the police was the public relations director or community relations director of wcbs newsradio i stupidly asked the caller if he knew how she got that job the caller said he didn’t know and i promptly and arrogantly said “i will tell you how she passed the gynecological and pigmentation test—that’s how” not only did that turn off roger ailes but wor was forced to fire me even though i had given the radio giant the biggest overnight ratings they ever had53 ” after being fired from wor grant worked at wwdb 965 fm in philadelphia for a

sociopolitical viewsedit grant was widely considered a political conservative in later life he commented that i certainly had many beliefs youd call conservative but on some social issues like abortion or gay marriage i was more what youd call libertarian77 in 1995 the progressive media watchdog fairness and accuracy in reporting accused grant of racism and homophobia as evidence they highlighted his repeated use of the word savages when referring to africanamericans and statements such as minorities are the big apples majority you dont need the papers to tell you that walk around and you know it to me thats a bad thing im a white person78 they highlighted his description of haitian refugees as swine and subhuman infiltrators who multiply like maggots on a hot day and his comment that ideally it would have been nice to have a few phalanxes of policemen with machine guns and mow gay pride paraders down78 grant was highly critical of us president barack obama asserting his view that obama truly believes in socialism  which has the same effect as communism79 grant distinguished himself from other conservative talk show hosts by calling for obama to release his long form birth certificate prior to obama releasing it80 he described the tea party movement as continuing the finest tradition of americanism79 although grant was generally known as being a conservative he was a critic of hardline conservative advocates in primary races including the tea party movements candidates this was a frequent debate topic between grant and his callers over the past few years

florida senate primary on a may 8 2011 broadcast grant informed his audience that he supported the moderate jon huntsman jr for the republican nomination for president although he would later go on to support mitt romney81 fillin hostsedit grant was in favor of engaging hosts substituting for him while he was away on vacation to maintain his ratings in the cases of g gordon liddy82 and curtis sliwa83 who guest hosted along with his wife lisa evers this led to them being hired for their own shows other popular fillins included bill oreilly during the 1990s roger ailes alan burke joe scarborough tom marr ann coulter in 2002 tom snyder in 200284 mike gallagher barry farber and comedian pat cooper in the early 1990s influences and legacyedit being largely the innovator of his own particular talk radio style grant previously worked with the likes of barry gray and joe pyne pyne would often end each broadcast with straight ahead which is something grant picked up leading many to believe that grant was the first host to frequently use that line over the years national radio talk personality howard stern has made differing remarks on his admiration for grant as an early influence upon sterns arrival in new york he cited grant as an influence85 but as sterns stardom rose grant became the subject of occasional ridicule on sterns show during sterns prime he denied being influenced by grant or having respect for him86 stern also criticized grant for changing his act to appease management86 grant told paul d colford author of the 1996 stern bio howard stern king of all media about being approached at a public appearance by ben stern howards father with a teenage howard in tow father introduced son to grant and told him of howards desire to go into radio i looked at this big gawky kid and i said to him just be yourself grant recalled stern has denied grants version of the story86 soon after grants firing from wabc and before his first wor show grant appeared as a callin guest on sterns radio show in more recent years stern has praised grants legacy in 2006 stern called in to grants final wor broadcast and lauded him on the air on his january 6 2014 siriusxm broadcast while discussing grants death and career for the first halfhour of his show stern said i consider him to be the best broadcaster ive ever heard stern said bob was just this really wellinformed conservative who would often become liberal on social issues but he had such a flair he was such a broadcaster he could hold your attention for hours before concluding goodbye bob you are the greatest broadcaster that has ever lived878889 glenn beck now uses the catchphrase get off my phone as a spinoff of grants earlier callin talk show style as do tom scharpling and mark levin similarly sean hannity often uses grants phrase straight ahead rush limbaugh early on acknowledged that bob grant paved the way for his success nationwide in 2002 industry magazine talkers ranked grant as the 16th greatest radio talk show host of all time90 on march 28 2007 bob grant was nominated for induction into the national radio hall of fame91 radio records had planned to issue a lifetime achievement award to grant during its annual convention in march 2008 however the award was revoked in january 2008 for past comments by him that contradict our values and the respect we have for all members of our community92 several talk radio hosts have spoken out against the decision neal boortz has stated “ i usually try not to miss the radio records talk radio convention not this year maybe never again rr has succumbed to political correctness i dont call for boycotts but i do think it would be wonderful to see talk show hosts refuse to appear at this convention what we have seen here in this revocation of the award to bob grant is simple pandering to political correctness nothing more nothing less93 ” sean hannity opie and anthony comedian jim norton lars larson rush limbaugh mark levin lionel and howard stern opposed the move as well with levin stating i am disgusted with the mistreatment of bob grant i am fed up with the censors intimidators and cowards in this

referred to grant as a legendary broadcaster95 tributes to bob grant poured in after his death was announced washington post senior editor marc fisher wrote tribute to grant on his facebook page saying that his most creative and influential period was from the 1960s when he captured and reflected the rage of new yorkers seeing their city change around them to the 70s when he almost
