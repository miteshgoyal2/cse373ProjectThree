prize in economic sciences for his research on consumption analysis monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy4 with george stigler and others friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the second generation of chicago price theory a methodological movement at the university of chicagos department of economics law school and graduate school of business from the 1940s onward several students and young professors that were recruited or mentored by friedman at chicago went on to become leading economists they include gary becker robert fogel thomas sowell5 and robert lucas jr6 friedmans challenges to what he later called naive keynesian theory7 began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the consumption function in the 1960s he became the main advocate opposing keynesian government policies8 and described his approach along with mainstream economics as using keynesian language and apparatus yet rejecting its initial conclusions9 he theorized that there existed a natural rate of unemployment and argued that employment above this rate would cause inflation to accelerate10 he argued that the phillips curve was in the long run vertical at the natural rate and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation11 friedman promoted an alternative macroeconomic viewpoint known as monetarism and argued that a steady small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy12 his ideas concerning monetary policy taxation privatization and deregulation influenced government policies especially during the 1980s his monetary theory influenced the federal reserves response to the global financial crisis of 2007–0813 friedman was an advisor to republican us president ronald reagan14 and conservative british prime minister margaret thatcher15 his political philosophy extolled the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal intervention he once stated that his role in eliminating us conscription was his proudest accomplishment in his 1962 book capitalism and freedom friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military freely floating exchange rates abolition of medical licenses a negative income tax and school vouchers16 his support for school choice led him to found the friedman foundation for educational choice later renamed edchoice17 milton friedmans works include monographs books scholarly articles papers magazine columns television programs and lectures and cover a broad range of economic topics and public policy issues18 his books and essays have had global influence including in former communist states19202122 a survey of economists ranked friedman as the secondmost popular economist of the twentieth century after john maynard keynes23 and the economist described him as the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century  possibly of all of it24 contents 1 early life 2 public service 3 academic career 31 early years 32 university of chicago 321

ethel née landau and jenő saul friedman25 were jewish immigrants from beregszász in carpathian ruthenia kingdom of hungary now berehove in ukraine they both worked as dry goods merchants shortly after miltons birth the family relocated to rahway new jersey in his early teens friedman was injured in a car accident which scarred his upper lip2627 a talented student friedman graduated from rahway high school in 1928 just before his 16th birthday2829 in 1932 friedman graduated from rutgers university where he specialized in mathematics and economics and initially intended to become an actuary during his time at rutgers friedman became influenced by two economics professors arthur f burns and homer jones who convinced him that modern economics could help end the great depression after graduating from rutgers friedman was offered two scholarships to do graduate work—one in mathematics at brown university and the other in economics at the university of chicago30 friedman chose the latter thus earning a master of arts degree in 1933 he was strongly influenced by jacob viner frank knight and henry simons it was at chicago that friedman met his future wife economist rose director during the 1933–1934 academic year he had a fellowship at columbia university where he studied statistics with renowned statistician and economist harold hotelling he was back in chicago for the 1934–1935 academic year working as a research assistant for henry schultz who was then working on theory and measurement of demand that year friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with george stigler and w allen wallis31 public serviceedit friedman was initially unable to find academic employment so in 1935 he followed his friend w allen wallis to washington dc where franklin d roosevelts new deal was a lifesaver for many young economists32 at this stage friedman said that he and his wife regarded the jobcreation programs such as the wpa ccc and pwa appropriate responses to the critical situation but not the price and wagefixing measures of the national recovery administration and the agricultural adjustment administration33 foreshadowing his later ideas he believed price controls interfered with an essential signaling mechanism to help resources be used where they were most valued indeed friedman later concluded that all government intervention associated with the new deal was the wrong cure for the wrong disease arguing that the money supply should simply have been expanded instead of contracted34 later friedman and his colleague anna schwartz wrote a monetary history of the united states 1867–1960 which argued that the great depression was caused by a severe monetary contraction due to banking crises and poor policy on the part of the federal reserve35 during 1935 he began work for the national resources planning board36 which was then working on a large consumer budget survey ideas from this project later became a part of his theory of the consumption function friedman began employment with the national bureau of economic research during autumn 1937 to assist simon kuznets in his work on professional income this work resulted in their jointly authored publication incomes from independent professional practice which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income a major component of the permanent income hypothesis that friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s the book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices during 1940 friedman was appointed an assistant professor teaching economics at the university of wisconsin–madison but encountered antisemitism in the economics department and decided to return to government service3738 from 1941 to 1943 friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government as an advisor to senior officials of the united states department of the treasury as a treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a keynesian policy of taxation he helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the war39 he later said i have no apologies for it but i really wish we hadnt found it necessary and i wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now40 academic careeredit early yearsedit in 1940 friedman accepted a position at the university of wisconsin–madison but left because of differences with faculty regarding united states involvement in world war ii friedman believed the united states should enter the war41 in 1943 friedman joined the division of war research at columbia university headed by w allen wallis and harold hotelling where he spent the rest of world war ii working as a mathematical statistician focusing on problems of weapons design military tactics and metallurgical experiments4142 in 1945 friedman submitted incomes from independent professional practice coauthored with kuznets and completed during 1940 to columbia as his doctoral dissertation the university awarded him a phd in 1946 friedman spent the 1945–1946 academic year teaching at the university of minnesota where his friend george stigler was employed on february 12 1945 his son david d friedman was born university of chicagoedit university of chicago in 1946 friedman accepted an offer to teach economic theory at the university of chicago a position opened by departure of his former professor jacob viner to princeton university friedman would work for the university of chicago for the next 30 years there he contributed to the establishment of an intellectual community that produced a number of nobel prize winners known collectively as the chicago school of economics at that time arthur f burns who was then the head of the national bureau of economic research asked friedman to rejoin the bureaus staff he accepted the invitation and assumed responsibility for the bureaus inquiry into the role of money in the business cycle as a result he initiated the workshop in money and banking the chicago workshop which promoted a revival of monetary studies during the latter half of the 1940s friedman began a collaboration with anna schwartz an economic historian at the bureau that would ultimately result in the 1963 publication of a book coauthored by friedman and schwartz a monetary history of the united states 1867–1960 friedman spent the 1954–1955 academic year as a fulbright visiting fellow at gonville and caius college cambridge at the time the cambridge economics faculty was divided into a keynesian majority including joan robinson and richard kahn and an antikeynesian minority headed by dennis robertson friedman speculated that he was invited to the fellowship because his views were unacceptable to both of the cambridge factions later his weekly columns for newsweek magazine 1966–84 were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people43 from 1968 to 1978 he and paul samuelson participated in the economics cassette series a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days issues for about a halfhour at a time4445 friedman was an economic adviser to republican presidential candidate barry goldwater during 1964 capitalism and freedomedit his capitalism and freedom brought him national and international attention outside academe it was published in 1962 by the university of chicago press and consists of essays that used nonmathematical economic models to explore issues of public policy46 it sold over 400000 copies in the first eighteen years47 and more than half a million since 1962 it has been translated into eighteen languages friedman talks about the need to move to a classically liberal society that free markets would help nations and individuals in the longrun and fix the efficiency problems currently faced by the united states and other major countries of the 1950s and 1960s he goes through the chapters specifying a specific issue in each respective chapter from the role of government and money supply to social welfare programs to a special chapter on occupational licensure friedman concludes capitalism and freedom with his classical liberal stance that government should stay out of matters that do not need and should only involve itself when absolutely necessary for the survival of its people and the country he recounts how the best of a countrys abilities come from its free markets while its failures come from government intervention48 personal lifeedit retirementedit in 1977 at the age of 65 friedman retired from the university of chicago after teaching there for 30 years he and his wife moved to san francisco where he became a visiting scholar at the federal reserve bank of san francisco from 1977 on he was affiliated with the hoover institution at stanford university during the same year friedman was approached by the free to choose network and asked to create a television program presenting his economic and social philosophy the friedmans worked on this project for the next three years and during 1980 the tenpart series titled free to choose was broadcast by the public broadcasting service pbs the companion book to the series coauthored by milton and his wife rose friedman also titled free to choose was the bestselling nonfiction book of 1980 and has since been translated into 14 foreign languages friedman served as an unofficial adviser to ronald reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign and then served on the presidents economic policy advisory board for the rest of the reagan administration ebenstein says friedman was the guru of the reagan administration49 in 1988 he received the national medal of science and reagan honored him with the presidential medal of freedom milton friedman is known now as one of the most influential economists of the 20th century5051 throughout the 1980s and 1990s friedman continued to write editorials and appear on television he made several visits to eastern europe and to china where he also advised governments he was also for many years a trustee of the philadelphia society525354 later lifeedit according to a 2007 article in commentary magazine his parents were moderately observant jews but friedman after an intense burst of childhood piety rejected religion altogether55 he described himself as an agnostic56 friedman wrote extensively of his life and experiences especially in 1998 in his memoirs with his wife rose titled two lucky people deathedit friedman died of heart failure at the age of 94 years in san francisco on november 16 200657 he was still a working economist performing original economic research his last column was published in the wall street journal the day after his death58 he was survived by his wife who died on august 18 2009 and their two children david known for the anarchocapitalist book the machinery of freedom and bridge expert jan martel scholarly contributionsedit see also friedman–savage utility function friedman rule friedmans kpercent rule and friedman test economicsedit friedman was best known for reviving interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output that is the quantity theory of money monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory its origins can be traced back to the 16thcentury school of salamanca or even further however friedmans contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization he coauthored with anna schwartz a monetary history of the united states 1867–1960 1963 which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the us history a striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations several regression studies with david meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output these challenged a prevailing but largely untested view on their relative importance friedmans empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the shortrun effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longerrun effect was primarily on the price level friedman was the main proponent of the monetarist school of economics he maintained that there is a close and stable association between inflation and the money supply mainly that inflation could be avoided with proper regulation of the monetary bases growth rate he famously used the analogy of dropping money out of a helicopter59 in order to avoid dealing with money injection mechanisms and other factors that would overcomplicate his models friedmans arguments were designed to counter the popular concept of costpush inflation that the increased general price level at the time was the result of increases in the price of oil or increases in wages as he wrote inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon — milton friedman 196360 friedman rejected the use of fiscal policy as a tool of demand management and he held that the governments role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely friedman wrote extensively on the great depression which he termed the great contraction arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the federal reserve the fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a gardenvariety recession although perhaps a fairly severe one into a major catastrophe instead of using its powers to offset the depression it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by onethird from 1929 to 1933  far from the depression being a failure of the freeenterprise system it was a tragic failure of government — milton friedman two lucky people 23361 friedman also argued for the cessation of government intervention in currency markets thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject as well as promoting the practice of freely floating exchange rates his close friend george stigler explained as is customary in science he did not win a full victory in part because research was directed along different lines by the theory of rational expectations a newer approach developed by robert lucas also at the university of chicago62 the relationship between friedman and lucas or new classical macroeconomics as a whole was highly complex the friedmanian phillips curve was an interesting starting point for lucas but he soon realized that the solution provided by friedman was not quite satisfactory lucas elaborated a new approach in which rational expectations were presumed instead of the friedmanian adaptive expectations due to this reformulation the story in which the theory of the new classical phillips curve was embedded radically changed this modification however had a significant effect on friedman’s own approach so as a result the theory of the friedmanian phillips curve also changed63 moreover new classical neil wallace who was a graduate student at the university of chicago between 1960 and 1963 regarded friedman’s theoretical courses as a mess64 this evaluation clearly indicates the broken relationship between friedmanian monetarism and new classical macroeconomics friedman was also known for his work on the consumption function the permanent income hypothesis 1957 which friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work65 this work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income windfall gains would mostly be saved tax reductions likewise as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances other important contributions include his critique of the phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment 1968 this critique associated his name together with that of edmund phelps with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so unemployment may be temporarily lower if the inflation is a surprise but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market friedmans essay the methodology of positive economics 1953 provided the epistemological pattern for his own subsequent research and to a degree that of the chicago school there he argued that economics as science should be free of value judgments for it to be objective moreover a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction that is students should measure the accuracy of its predictions rather than the soundness of its assumptions his argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as jerzy neyman leonard savage and ronald fisher66 statisticsedit one of his most famous contributions to statistics is sequential sampling friedman did statistical work at the division of war research at columbia where he and his colleagues came up with the technique it later became in the words of the new palgrave dictionary of economics the standard analysis of quality control inspection the dictionary adds like many of friedman’s contributions in retrospect it seems remarkably simple and obvious to apply basic economic ideas to quality control that however is a measure of his genius67 public policy positionsedit part of a series on libertarianism origins age of enlightenment

public choice theory small government technolibertarianism outline of libertarianism libertarianism portal v t e federal reserveedit due to its poor performance68 friedman believed that the federal reserve board should be abolished6970 friedman was deeply critical about federal reserve policies even during the socalled volcker shock that was labelled monetarist71 he further believed that if the money supply was to be centrally controlled as by the federal reserve system that the preferable way to do it would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate exchange ratesedit friedman was a strong advocate for floating exchange rates throughout the entire brettonwoods period he argued that a flexible exchange rate would make external adjustment possible and allow countries to avoid balance of payments crises he saw fixed exchange rates as an undesirable form of government intervention the case was articulated in an influential 1953 paper the case for flexible exchange rates at a time when most commentators regarded the possibility of floating exchange rates as a fantasy7273 school choiceedit in his 1955 article the role of government in education74 friedman proposed supplementing publicly operated schools with privately run but publicly funded schools through a system of school vouchers75 reforms similar to those proposed in the article were implemented in for example chile in 1981 and sweden in 199276 in 1996 friedman together with his wife founded the friedman foundation for educational choice to advocate school choice and vouchers in 2016 the friedman foundation changed its name to edchoice to honor the friedmans desire to have the educational choice movement live on without their names attached to it after their deaths17 conscriptionedit while walter oi is credited with establishing the economic basis for a volunteer military milton friedman was a proponent stating that the draft was inconsistent with a free society7778 in capitalism and freedom he argued that conscription is inequitable and arbitrary preventing young men from shaping their lives as they see fit79 during the nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paidvolunteer armed force he would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the united states was his proudest accomplishment12 friedman did however believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time79 foreign policyedit biographer lanny ebenstein noted a drift over time in friedmans views from an interventionist to a more cautious foreign policy80 he supported us involvement in the second world war and initially supported a hard line against communism but moderated over time80 however friedman did state in a 1995 interview that he is an antiinterventionist81 he opposed the gulf war and the iraq war80 in a spring 2006 interview friedman said that the usas stature in the world had been eroded by the iraq war but that it might be improved if iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country82 libertarianism and the republican partyedit friedman was a supporter of the candidacy of barry goldwater against lyndon johnson following kennedy in 196483 later he served as a member of president reagans economic policy advisory board starting at 1981 in 1988 he received the presidential medal of freedom and the national medal of science he said that he was a libertarian philosophically but a member of the us republican party for the sake of expediency i am a libertarian with a small l and a republican with a capital r and i am a republican with a capital r on grounds of expediency not on principle but he said i think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable i dont really care very much what im called im much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas rather than the person84 public goods and monopolyedit friedman was supportive of the state provision of some public goods that private businesses are not considered as being able to provide however he argued that many of the services performed by government could be performed better by the private sector above all if some public goods are provided by the state he believed that they should not be a legal monopoly where private competition is prohibited for example he wrote there is no way to justify our present public monopoly of the post office it may be argued that the carrying of mail is a technical monopoly and that a government monopoly is the least of evils along these lines one could perhaps justify a government post office but not the present law which makes it illegal for anybody else to carry the mail if the delivery of mail is a technical monopoly no one else will be able to succeed in competition with the government if it is not there is no reason why the government should be engaged in it the only way to find out is to leave other people free to enter — milton friedman friedman milton rose d capitalism and freedom university of chicago press 1982 p 29 social security welfare programs and negative income taxedit in 1962 friedman criticized social security in his book capitalism and freedom arguing that it had created welfare dependency85 however in the penultimate chapter of the same book friedman argued that while capitalism had greatly reduced the extent of poverty in absolute terms poverty is in part a relative matter and even in wealthy western countries there are clearly many people living under conditions that the rest of us label as poverty friedman noted that while private charity could be one recourse for alleviating poverty and cited late 19th century britain and the united states as exemplary periods of extensive private charity and eleemosynary activity friedman also noted that it can be argued that private charity is insufficient because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts— a neighborhood effect i am distressed by the sight of poverty i am benefited by its alleviation but i am benefited equally whether i or someone else pays for its alleviation the benefits of other peoples charity therefore partly accrue to me to put it differently we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty provided everyone else did we might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance in small communities public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity in the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society it is much more difficult for it to do so suppose one accepts as i do this line of reasoning as justifying governmental action to alleviate poverty to set as it were a floor under the standard of life of every person in the community while there are questions of how much should be spent and how the arrangement that recommends itself on purely mechanical grounds is a negative income tax the advantages of this arrangement are clear it is directed specifically at the problem of poverty it gives help in the form most useful to the individual namely cash it is general and could be substituted for the host of special measures now in effect it makes explicit the cost borne by society it operates outside the market like any other measures to alleviate poverty it reduces the incentives of those helped to help themselves but it does not eliminate that incentive entirely as a system of supplementing incomes up to some fixed minimum would an extra dollar earned always means more money available for expenditure friedman argued further that other advantages of the negative income tax were that it could fit directly into the tax system would be less costly and would reduce the administrative burden of implementing a social safety net86 friedman reiterated these arguments 18 years later in free to choose with the additional proviso that such a reform would only be satisfactory if it replaced the current system of welfare programs rather than augment it87 according to economist robert h frank writing in the new york times friedmans views in this regard were grounded in a belief that while market forces  accomplish wonderful things they cannot ensure a distribution of income that enables all citizens to meet basic economic needs88 drug policyedit friedman also supported libertarian policies such as legalization of drugs and prostitution during 2005 friedman and more than 500 other economists advocated discussions regarding the economic benefits of the legalization of marijuana89 gay rightsedit friedman was also a supporter of gay rights90 he never specifically supported samesex marriage instead saying i do not believe there should be any discrimination against gays91 economic freedomedit michael walker of the fraser institute and friedman hosted a series of conferences from 1986 to 1994 the goal was to create a clear definition of economic freedom and a method for measuring it eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide economic freedom economic freedom in the world92 this annual report has since provided data for numerous peerreviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations along with sixteen other distinguished economists he opposed the copyright term extension act and filed an amicus brief in eldred v ashcroft93 he supported the inclusion of the word nobrainer in the brief94 friedman argued for stronger basic legal constitutional protection of economic rights and freedoms to further promote industrialcommercial growth and prosperity and buttress democracy and freedom and the rule of law generally in society95 honors recognition and influenceedit friedman in 1976 george h nash a leading historian of american conservatism says that by the end of the 1960s he was probably the most highly regarded and influential conservative scholar in the country and one of the few with an international reputation96 friedman allowed the libertarian cato institute to use his name for its biannual milton friedman prize for advancing liberty beginning in 2001 a friedman prize was given to the late british economist peter bauer in 2002 peruvian economist hernando de soto in 2004 mart laar former estonian prime minister in 2006 and a young venezuelan student yon goicoechea in 2008 his wife rose sister of aaron director with whom he initiated the friedman foundation for educational choice served on the international selection committee9798 friedman was also a recipient of the nobel prize in economics upon friedmans death harvard president lawrence summers called him the great liberator saying  any honest democrat will admit that we are now all friedmanites he said friedmans great popular contribution was in convincing people of the importance of allowing free markets to operate99 in 2013 stephen moore a member of the editorial forward of the wall street journal said quoting the mostrevered champion of freemarket economics since adam smith has become a little like quoting the bible he adds there are sometimes multiple and conflicting interpretations100 nobel memorial prize in economic sciencesedit friedman won the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences the sole recipient for 1976 for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy4 hong kongedit friedman once said if you want to see capitalism in action go to hong kong101 he wrote in 1990 that the hong kong economy was perhaps the best example of a free market economy102 one month before his death he wrote the article hong kong wrong – what would cowperthwaite say in the wall street journal criticizing donald tsang the chief executive of hong kong for abandoning positive noninterventionism103 tsang later said he was merely changing the slogan to big market small government where small government is defined as less than 20 of gdp in a debate between tsang and his rival alan leong before the 2007 chief executive election leong introduced the topic and jokingly accused tsang of angering friedman to death chileedit main articles miracle of chile and chicago boys during 1975 two years after the military coup that brought military dictator president augusto pinochet to power and ended the government of salvador allende the economy of chile experienced a severe crisis friedman and arnold harberger accepted an invitation of a private chilean foundation to visit chile and speak on principles of economic freedom104 he spent seven days in chile giving a series of lectures at the universidad católica de chile and the national university of chile one of the lectures was entitled the fragility of freedom and according to friedman dealt with precisely the threat to freedom from a centralized military government105 in an april 21 1975 letter to pinochet friedman considered the key economic problems of chile are clearly  inflation and the promotion of a healthy social market economy106 he stated that there is only one way to end inflation by drastically reducing the rate of increase of the quantity of money  and that  cutting government spending is by far and away the most desirable way to reduce the fiscal deficit because it  strengthens the private sector thereby laying the foundations for healthy economic growth106 as to how rapidly inflation should be ended friedman felt that for chile where inflation is raging at 10–20 a month  gradualism is not feasible it would involve so painful an operation over so long a period that the patient would not survive choosing a brief period of higher unemployment was the lesser evil and that the experience of germany  of brazil  of the postwar adjustment in the us  all argue for shock treatment in the letter friedman recommended to deliver the shock approach with  a package to eliminate the surprise and to relieve acute distress and  for definiteness let me sketch the contents of a package proposal  to be taken as illustrative although his knowledge of chile was too limited to enable him to be precise or comprehensive he listed a sample proposal of 8 monetary and fiscal measures including the removal of as many as obstacles as possible that now hinder the private market for example suspend  the present law against discharging employees he closed stating such a shock program could end inflation in months his letter suggested that cutting spending to reduce the fiscal deficit would result in less transitional unemployment than raising taxes sergio de castro a chilean chicago school graduate became the nations minister of finance in 1975 during his sixyear tenure foreign investment increased restrictions were placed on striking and labor unions and gdp rose yearly107 a foreign exchange program was created between the catholic university of chile and the university of chicago many other chicago school alumni were appointed government posts during and after the pinochet years others taught its economic doctrine at chilean universities they became known as the chicago boys108 friedman did not criticize pinochets dictatorship at the time nor the assassinations illegal imprisonments torture or other atrocities that were well known by then109 in 1976 friedman defended his unofficial adviser position with i do not consider it as evil for an economist to render technical economic advice to the chilean government any more than i would regard it as evil for a physician to give technical medical advice to the chilean government to help end a medical plague110 friedman defended his activity in chile on the grounds that in his opinion the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of chile but also contributed to the amelioration of pinochets rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990 that idea is included in capitalism and freedom in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom in his 1980 documentary free to choose he said the following chile is not a politically free system and i do not condone the system but the people there are freer than the people in communist societies because government plays a smaller role  the conditions of the people in the past few years has been getting better and not worse they would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system111112 in 1984 friedman stated that he has never refrained from criticizing the political system in chile105 in 1991 he said i have nothing good to say about the political regime that pinochet imposed it was a terrible political regime the real miracle of chile is not how well it has done economically the real miracle of chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market in chile the drive for political freedom that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy now at long last chile has all three things political freedom human freedom and economic freedom chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether now that it has political freedom that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom113 he stressed that the lectures he gave in chile were the same lectures he later gave in china and other socialist states114 during the 2000 pbs documentary the commanding heights based on the book friedman continued to argue that free markets would undermine pinochets political centralization and political control115116 and that criticism over his role in chile missed his main contention that freer markets resulted in freer people and that chiles unfree economy had caused the military government friedman advocated for free markets which undermined political centralization and political control117 icelandedit friedman visited iceland during the autumn of 1984 met with important icelanders and gave a lecture at the university of iceland on the tyranny of the status quo he participated in a lively television debate on august 31 1984 with socialist intellectuals including ólafur ragnar grímsson who later became the president of iceland118 when they complained that a fee was charged for attending his lecture at the university and that hitherto lectures by visiting scholars had been freeofcharge friedman replied that previous lectures had not been freeofcharge in a meaningful sense lectures always have related costs what mattered was whether attendees or nonattendees covered those costs friedman thought that it was fairer that only those who attended paid in this discussion friedman also stated that he did not receive any money for delivering that lecture estoniaedit although friedman never visited estonia his book free to choose exercised a great influence on that nations then 32yearold prime minister mart laar who has claimed that it was the only book on economics he had read before taking office laars reforms are often credited with responsibility for transforming estonia from an impoverished soviet republic to the baltic tiger a prime element of laars program was introduction of the flat tax laar won the 2006 milton friedman prize for advancing liberty awarded by the cato institute119 united kingdomedit after 1950 friedman was frequently invited to lecture in britain and by the 1970s his ideas had gained widespread attention in conservative circles for example he was a regular speaker at the institute of economic affairs iea a libertarian think tank conservative politician margaret thatcher closely followed iea programs and ideas and met friedman there in 1978 he also strongly influenced keith joseph who became thatchers senior advisor on economic affairs as well as alan walters and patrick minford two other key advisers major newspapers including the daily telegraph the times and the financial times all promulgated friedmans monetarist ideas to british decisionmakers friedmans ideas strongly influenced thatcher and her allies when she became prime minister in 1979120121 criticismedit econometrician david hendry criticized part of friedmans and anna schwartzs 1982 monetary trends122 when asked about it during an interview with icelandic tv in 1984123 friedman said that the criticism referred to a different problem from that which he and schwartz had tackled and hence was irrelevant124 and pointed out the lack of consequential peer review amongst econometricians on hendrys work125 in 2006 hendry said that friedman was guilty of serious errors of misunderstanding that meant the tratios he reported for uk money demand were overstated by nearly 100 per cent and said that in a paper published in 1991 with neil ericsson126 he had refuted almost every empirical claim … made about uk money demand by friedman and schwartz127 a 2004 paper updated and confirmed the validity of the hendry–ericsson findings through 2000128 although keynesian nobel laureate paul krugman praised friedman as a great economist and a great man after friedmans death in 2006 and acknowledged his many widely accepted contributions to empirical economics krugman had been and remains a prominent critic of friedman krugman has written that he slipped all too easily into claiming both that markets always work and that only markets work its extremely hard to find cases in which friedman acknowledged the possibility that markets could go wrong or that government intervention could serve a useful purpose129 in her book the shock doctrine author and social activist naomi klein criticized friedmans economic liberalism identifying it with the principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups in countries such as chile and argentina based on their assessments of the extent to which what she describes as neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality both klein and noam chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations130 visit to chileedit because of his involvement with the pinochet government there were international protests when friedman was awarded the nobel prize in 1976131 friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in chile because of the relation of economists of the university of chicago to pinochet and a controversial sevenday trip132 he took to chile during march 1975 less than two years after the coup that deposed president salvador allende friedman answered that he never was an adviser to the dictatorship but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation and met with officials including augusto pinochet while in chile133 chilean economist orlando letelier asserted that pinochets dictatorship resorted to oppression because of popular opposition to chicago school policies in chile134 after a 1991 speech on drug legalisation friedman answered a question on his involvement with the pinochet regime saying that he was never an advisor to pinochet also mentioned in his 1984 iceland interview105 but that a group of his students at the university of chicago were involved in chiles economic reforms friedman credited these reforms with high levels of economic growth and with the establishment of democracy that has subsequently occurred in chile135136 in october 1988 after returning from a lecture tour of china during which he had met with zhao ziyang friedman wrote to the stanford daily asking if he should anticipate a similar avalanche of protests for having been willing to give advice to so evil a government and if not why not137 selected bibliographyedit main article milton friedman bibliography a theory of the
