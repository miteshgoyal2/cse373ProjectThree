seminomadic basis as many as several hundred farmed the harlem flatlands18 between 1637 and 1639 a few settlements were established1920 during the american revolution the british burned harlem to the ground21 it took a long time to rebuild as harlem grew more slowly than the rest of manhattan during the late 18th century22 after the american civil war harlem experienced an economic boom starting in 1868 the neighborhood continued to serve as a refuge for new yorkers but increasingly those coming north were poor and jewish or italian23 the new york and harlem railroad24 as well as the interborough rapid transit and elevated railway lines25 helped harlems economic growth as they connected harlem to lower and midtown manhattan rowhouse built for the africanamerican population of harlem in the 1930s a condemned building in harlem after the 1970s the jewish and italian demographic decreased while the black and puerto rican population increased in this time26 the early 20thcentury great migration of blacks to northern industrial cities was fueled by their desire to leave behind the jim crow south seek better jobs and education for their children and escape a culture of lynching violence during world war i expanding industries recruited black laborers to fill new jobs thinly staffed after the draft began to take young men27 in 1910 central harlem was about 10 black by 1930 it had reached 7028 starting around the time of the end of world war i harlem became associated with the new negro movement and then the artistic outpouring known as the harlem renaissance which extended to poetry novels theater and the visual arts so many blacks came that it threatened the very existence of some of the leading industries of georgia florida tennessee and alabama29 many settled in harlem by 1920 central harlem was 3243 black the 1930 census revealed that 7018 of central harlems residents were black and lived as far south as central park at 110th street30 however by the 1930s the neighborhood was hit hard by job losses in the great depression in the early 1930s 25 of harlemites were out of work and employment prospects for harlemites stayed bad for decades employment among black new yorkers fell as some traditionally black businesses including domestic service and some types of manual labor were taken over by other ethnic groups major industries left new york city altogether especially after 1950 several riots happened in this period including in 1935 and 1943 there were major changes following world war ii in the late 1950s and early 1960s harlem was the scene of a series of rent strikes by neighborhood tenants led by local activist jesse gray together with the congress of racial equality harlem youth opportunities unlimited haryou and other groups these groups wanted the city to force landlords to improve the quality of housing by bringing them up to code to take action against rats and roaches to provide heat during the winter and to keep prices in line with existing rent control regulations31 the largest public works projects in harlem in these years were public housing with the largest concentration built in east harlem32 typically existing structures were torn down and replaced with citydesigned and managed properties that would in theory present a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private landlords ultimately community objections halted the construction of new projects33 from the mid20th century the low quality of education in harlem has been a source of distress in the 1960s about 75 of harlem students tested under grade levels in reading skills and 80 tested under grade level in math34 in 1964 residents of harlem staged two school boycotts to call attention to the problem in central harlem 92 of students stayed home35 in the postworld war ii era harlem ceased to be home to a majority of the citys blacks36 but it remained the cultural and political capital of black new york and possibly black america3738 by the 1970s many of those harlemites who were able to escape from poverty left the neighborhood in search of safer streets better schools and homes those who remained were the poorest and least skilled with the fewest opportunities for success though the federal governments model cities program spent 100 million on job training health care education public safety sanitation housing and other projects over a tenyear period harlem showed no improvement39 the city began auctioning its enormous portfolio of harlem properties to the public in 1985 this was intended to improve the community by placing property in the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them in many cases the city would even pay to completely renovate a property before selling it by lottery below market value40 after the 1990s harlem began to grow again between 1990 and 2006 the neighborhoods population grew by 169 with the percentage of blacks decreasing

ameliorate them during the great depression unemployment in harlem went past 20 and people were being evicted from their homes75 in the 1960s uneducated blacks could find jobs more easily than educated ones could confounding efforts to improve the lives of people who lived in the neighborhood through education76 land owners took advantage of the neighborhood and offered apartments to the

neighborhood changed black criminals began to organize themselves similarly however rather than compete with the established mobs gangs concentrated on the policy racket also called the numbers game or bolita in east harlem this was a gambling scheme similar to a lottery that could be played illegally from countless locations around harlem according to francis ianni by 1925 there were thirty black policy banks in harlem several of them large enough to collect bets in an area of twenty city blocks and across three or four avenues81 by the early 1950s the total money at play amounted to billions of dollars and the police force had been thoroughly corrupted by bribes from numbers bosses82 these bosses became financial powerhouses providing capital for loans for those who could not qualify for them from traditional financial institutions and investing in legitimate businesses and real estate one of the powerful early numbers bosses was a woman madame stephanie st clair who fought gun battles with mobster dutch schultz over control of the lucrative trade83 the popularity of playing the numbers waned with the introduction of the state lottery which is legal but has lower payouts and has taxes collected on winnings84 the practice continues on a smaller scale among those who prefer the numbers tradition or who prefer to trust their local numbers bank to the state

city as a whole86 injecting heroin grew in popularity in harlem through the 1950s and 1960s though the use of this drug then leveled off in the 1980s use of crack cocaine became widespread which produced collateral crime as addicts stole to finance their purchasing of additional drugs and as dealers fought for the right to sell in particular regions or over deals gone bad87 with the end of the crack wars in the mid1990s and with the initiation of aggressive policing under mayors david dinkins and subsequently rudolph giuliani crime in harlem plummeted in 1981 6500 robberies were
