worlds tony bradley wrote that the value of a rival platform such as google apps hinges on how compatible it is with microsoft office formatting conventions and file types praising google for having gone to great lengths to improve fidelity with microsoft office but it hasnt gone far enough criticizing many features for being reformatted including tables of contents footnotes or inserted images bradley praised googles collaborative apps writing that it was besting what microsoft offers in office 365 regarding the price he wrote that googles package is the best value the annual pricing of 50 per user per year makes it about a third less per user per year than office 365 yet it boasts equivalent functionality sufficient for most small and medium organizations92 gary marshall of techradar commented in 2016 that where office tries to do everything imaginable googles suite is much more basic that said its much more powerful than it was when the package debuted in 2006 but the emphasis on simplicity and speed remains marshall wrote that we wouldnt want to craft a massive complicated manuscript in docs but then that isnt what docs is designed to do its a fast and userfriendly way to create everyday documents and to share them with colleagues and clients and that fellow service google sheets covers the most common excel functions but doesnt have the power of microsofts offering marshall praised collaboration for being effortless and praised importing of external file formats and making those editable and collaborative for being a big selling point93 pc magazines eric grevstad wrote that whats online is what you get adding that configuring them to work offline is a rigmarole he stated that the package was an illustration of softwares version of the 8020 rule 80 percent of users will never need more than 20 percent of the features he stated that comparing g suite to office 2016 is like bringing a handgun to a cannon fight microsofts pcbased suite is designed to have almost every feature anyone might ever need googles online suite is designed to have most features most people use daily94 toms hardwares james gaskin wrote that like most google products it can claim the cleanest and most minimal interface in the market and no other suite except office 365 can get close to the ease of collaboration google provides and even microsofts product trails by a wide margin as changes only appear in realtime in word 2016 not the other apps conclusively he wrote the progress made between the first google app release and now has been considerable as the world moves to more and more mobile computing google has a distinct advantage but tradition dies hard and those who build more than basic documents spreadsheets and presentations will remain tied to their desktops and laptops for the time being95 after google was launched many articles were published that emphasized that having a presence on google helped with the business google search result rankings particularly publicfacing pages and 1 buttons were pushed as effective marketing strategies96979899 however writing for the new york times quentin hardy said that the sour grapes version is that google plus isn’t getting anything like the buzz or traffic of facebook so google is figuring out other ways to make the service relevant however hardy did note that the integration between google and other more popular google services including hangouts meant it’s still early on but it’s easy to see how this could be an efficient way to bring workers to a virtual meeting collaborate during it and embed in a calendar the future work commitments and followup that result100 competitorsedit the key competitor to the google suite is microsoft office 365 microsofts cloudbased offering for businesses that includes similar products the key differences are in the pricing plans storage space and number of features as noted by techrepublic in 2013 pricing plans differ in that google apps has a quick and easy pricing plan for their standard google apps for business package 5 per user per month or 50 per user per year in contrast office 365 has a multitude of plans six as of september 2013 which can be both good and bad since it provides flexibility but also involves some complexity to figure out the best choice storage space varies because office 365 gives users 50 gb of space in outlook and 25 gb in skydrive google apps provides 30 gb of space which is spread among gmail drive and picasa and regarding features it states that office 365 has the advantage for plenty of users who have been familiar with word excel and the rest of the gang for years there is less of a learning curve than with google apps if the latter represents a brand new experience however its also true that office is notorious for being loaded with complex unused features which can cause confusion so the familiarity many will embrace also comes with something of a price especially if companies are paying for advanced packages not all employees will use by contrast google apps programs are fairly easy to learn and intuitive but may feel too awkward for those who are hardcoded to work in office101 stephen shankland of cnet wrote in 2014 that its hard to compare google apps success to that of microsoft office since google doesnt release revenue or user figures102 as of march 2016update microsoft has 60 million commercial customers signed up for its office 365 product offering with 50000 small business customers added to office 365 each month103 see alsoedit google cloud platform google drive for
