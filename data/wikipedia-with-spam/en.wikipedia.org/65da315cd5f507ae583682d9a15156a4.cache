in 195210 the accordion times and musical express was bought by london music promoter maurice kinn for the sum of £1000 just 15 minutes before it was due to be officially closed11 it was relaunched as the new musical express and was initially published in a nonglossy tabloid format on standard newsprint on 14 november 1952 taking its cue from the us magazine billboard it created the first uk singles chart a list of the top twelve bestselling singles the first of these was in contrast to more recent charts a top twelve sourced by the magazine itself from sales in regional stores around the uk the first number one was here in my heart by al martino 1960sedit during the 1960s the paper championed the new british groups emerging at the time the nme circulation peaked under andy gray editor 1957–1972 with a figure of 306881 for the period from january to june 19641213 the beatles and the rolling stones were frequently featured on the front cover these and other artists also appeared at the nme poll winners concert an awards event that featured artists voted as most popular by the papers readers the concert also featured a ceremony where the poll winners would collect their awards the nme poll winners concerts took place between 1959 and 1972 from 1964 onwards they were filmed edited and transmitted on british television a few weeks after they had taken place in the mid 1960s the nme was primarily dedicated to pop while its older rival melody maker was known for its more serious coverage of music other competing titles included record mirror which led the way in championing american rhythm and blues and disc which focused on chart news14 the latter part of the decade saw the paper chart the rise of psychedelia and the continued dominance of british groups of the time during this period some sections of pop music began to be designated as rock the paper became engaged in a sometimes tense rivalry with melody maker however nme sales were healthy with the paper selling as many as 200000 issues per week making it one of the uks biggest sellers at the time 1970sedit cover featuring patti smith for the week of 21 february 1976 by the early 1970s nme had lost ground to melody maker as its coverage of music had failed to keep pace with the development of rock music particularly during the early years of psychedelia and progressive rock in early 1972 the paper found itself on the verge of closure by its owner ipc which had bought the paper from kinn in 1963 according to nick kent soon to play a prominent part in the papers revival after sales had plummeted to 60000 and a review of guitar instrumentalist duane eddy had been printed which began with the immortal words on this his 35th album we find duane in as good as voice as ever the nme had been told to rethink its policies or die on the vine15 alan smith was made editor and in 1972 was told by ipc to turn things around quickly or face closure16 to achieve this smith and his assistant editor nick logan raided the underground press for writers such as charles shaar murray and nick kent and recruited other writers such as tony tyler ian macdonald and californian danny hollowaycitation needed according to the economist the new musical express started to champion underground upandcoming musicnme became the gateway to a more rebellious world first came glamrock and bands such as t rex and then came punkby 1977 it had become the place to keep in touch with a cultural revolution that was enthralling the nations listless youth bands such as sex pistols xray spex and generation x were regular cover stars eulogised by writers such as julie burchill and tony parsons whose nihilistic tone narrated the punk years perfectly17 by the time smith handed the editors chair to logan in mid1973 the paper was selling nearly 300000 copies per week and was outstripping melody maker disc record mirror and soundscitation needed according to macdonald18 i think all the other papers knew by 1974 that nme had become the best music paper in britain we had most of the best writers and photographers the best layouts that sense of style of humour and a feeling of real adventure we also set out to beat melody maker on its strong suit being the serious responsible journal of record we did looking back and consumer guide features that beat the competition out of sight and we did this not just to surpass our rivals but because we reckoned that rock had finished its first wind around 196970 and deserved to be treated as history as a canon of work we wanted to see where wed got to sort out this huge amount of stuff that had poured out since the mid 60s everyone on the paper was into this led zeppelin topped the nme pop poll for three consecutive years 1974–76 under the category of the best vocal group19 in 1976 nme lambasted german pioneer electronic band kraftwerk with this title this is what your fathers fought to save you from the article said that the electronic melodies flowed as slowly as a piece of garbage floating down the polluted rhine20 the year 1976 also saw punk rock arrive on what some people perceived to be a stagnant music scene the nme gave the sex pistols their first music press coverage in a live review of their performance at the marquee in february that year but overall it was slow to cover this new phenomenon in comparison to sounds and melody maker where jonh ingham and caroline coon respectively were early champions of punk although articles by the likes of mick farren whose article the titanic sails at dawn called for a new streetled rock movement in response to stadium rock were published by the nme that summer it was felt that younger writing was needed to credibly cover the emerging punk movement and the paper advertised for a pair of hip young gunslingers to join their editorial staff this resulted in the recruitment of tony parsons and julie burchill the pair rapidly became champions of the punk scene and created a new tone for the paper parsons time at nme is reflected in his 2005 novel stories we could tell about the misadventures of three young musicpaper journalists on the night of 16 august 1977 – the night elvis presley died the logo which with slight variation has been used since 1978 in 1978 logan moved on and his deputy neil spencer was made editor one of his earliest tasks was to oversee a redesign of the paper by barney bubbles which included the logo still used on the papers masthead today albeit in a modified form – this made its first appearance towards the end of 1978 spencers time as editor also coincided with the emergence of postpunk acts such as joy division and gang of four this development was reflected in the writing of ian penman and paul morley danny baker who began as an nme writer around this time had a more straightforward and populist style the paper also became more openly political during the time of punk its cover would sometimes feature youthorientated issues rather than a musical act it took an editorial stance against political parties like the national front with the election of margaret thatcher in 1979 the paper took a broadly socialist stance for much of the following decade 1980sedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be

in conjunction with rough trade records available to readers by mail order at a low price the tape featured a number of then upandcoming bands including aztec camera orange juice linx and scritti politti as well as a number of more established artists such as robert wyatt pere ubu the buzzcocks and ian dury a second tape c86 was released in 1986 the nme responded to the thatcher era by espousing socialism through movements such as red wedgecitation needed in the week of the 1987 election the paper featured an interview with the leader of the labour party neil kinnock who appeared on the papers cover he had appeared on the cover once two years before in april 1985 writers at this time included don watson mat snow barney hoskyns paolo hewitt danny kelly chris bohn known in his later years at the paper as biba kopf steven wells and david quantick however sales were dropping and by the mid1980s nme had hit a rough patch and was in danger of closing during this period now under the editorship of ian pye who replaced neil spencer in 1985 they were split between those who wanted to write about hip hop a genre that was relatively new to the uk and those who wanted to stick to rock music sales were apparently lower when photos of hip hop artists appeared on the front and this led to the paper suffering as the lack of direction became even more apparent to readers a number of features entirely unrelated to music appeared on the cover in this era including a piece by william leith on computer crime and articles by stuart cosgrove on such subjects as the politics of sport and the presence of american troops in britain with elvis presley appearing on the cover not for musical reasons but as a political symbol the nme was generally thought to be rudderless at this time with staff pulling simultaneously in a number of directions in what came to be known as the hiphop wars it was haemorrhaging readers who were deserting nme in favour of nick logans two creations the face and smash hits this was brought to a head when the paper was about to publish a poster of an insert contained in the dead kennedys album frankenchrist consisting of a painting by hr giger called penis landscape then a subject of an obscenity lawsuit in the us in the summer and autumn of 1987 three senior editorial staff were sacked including pye media editor stuart cosgrove and art editor joe ewart former sounds editor alan lewis was brought in to rescue the paper mirroring alan smiths revival a decade and a half before some commented at this time that the nme had become less intellectual in its writing style and less inventive musically initially nme writers themselves were ill at ease with the new regime with most signing a letter of no confidence in alan lewis shortly after he took over however this new direction for the nme proved to be a commercial success and the paper brought in new writers such as andrew collins stuart maconie mary anne hobbs and steve lamacq to give it a stronger identity and sense of direction although mark sinker left in 1988 after the paper refused to publish a negative review he wrote of u2s rattle and hum initially many of the bands on the c86 tape were championed as well as the rise of gothic rock bands but new bands such as the happy mondays and the stone roses were coming out of manchester one scene over these years was acid house which spawned madchester which helped give the paper a new lease of life by the end of the decade danny kelly had replaced alan lewis as editor 1990sedit this section needs additional

template message blur vs oasis august 1995 nme started 1990 in the thick of the madchester scene covering the new british indie bands and shoegazers björk april 1995 the magazine heavily championed björks breakthrough in the 1990s by the end of 1990 the madchester scene was dying off and nme had started to report on new bands coming from the us mainly from seattle these bands would form a new movement called grunge and by far the most popular bands were nirvana and pearl jam the nme took to grunge very slowly sounds was the first british music paper to write about grunge with john robb being the first to interview nirvana21 melody maker was more enthusiastic early on largely through the efforts of everett true who had previously written for nme under the name the legend for the most part nme only became interested in grunge after nevermind became popular although it still supported new british bands the paper was dominated by american bands as was the music scene in general although the period from 1991 to 1993 was dominated by american bands like nirvana british bands were not ignored the nme still covered the indie scene and was involved with a war of words with a new band called manic street preachers who were criticising the nme for what they saw as an elitist view of bands they would champion this came to a head in 1991 when during an interview with steve lamacq richey edwards would confirm the bands position by carving 4real into his arm with a razor blade by 1992 the madchester scene had died and along with the manics some new british bands were beginning to appear suede were quickly hailed by the paper as an alternative to the heavy grunge sound and hailed as the start of a new british music scene grunge however was still the dominant force but the rise of new british bands would become something the paper would focus on more and more in 1992 the nme also had a very public dispute with morrissey due to allegations that he had used racist lyrics and imagery this erupted after a concert at finsbury park where morrissey was seen to drape himself in a union flag the series of articles which followed in the next edition of nme22 soured morrisseys relationship with the paper and this led to morrisseys not speaking to the paper again for over a decade later in 1992 steve sutherland previously assistant editor of melody maker was brought in as the nmes editor to replace danny kelly andrew collins stuart maconie steve lamacq and mary anne hobbs all left the nme in protest and moved to select collins maconie and lamacq would all also write for q while lamacq would join melody maker in 1997 kelly collins maconie lamacq and hobbs would all subsequently become prominent broadcasters with bbc radio 1 as it reinvented itself under matthew bannister in april 1994 nirvana frontman kurt cobain was found dead a story which affected not only his fans and readers of the nme but would see a massive change in british music grunge was about to be replaced by britpop23 a new form of music influenced by british music of the 1960s and british culture the term was coined by nmecitation needed after the band blur released their album parklife in the month of cobains death britpop began to fill the musical and cultural void left after cobains demise and with blurs success and the rise of a new group from manchester called oasis britpop would continue its rise for the rest of 1994 by the end of the year blur and oasis were the two biggest bands in the uk and sales of the nme were increasing thanks to the britpop effect in 1995 nme covered many of these new bands and many of the bands played the nme stage at that years glastonbury festival where the paper had been sponsoring the second stage at the festival since 1993 this would be its last year sponsoring the stage subsequently the stage would be known as the other stage in august 1995 blur and oasis planned to release singles on the same day in a mass of media publicity steve sutherland put the story on the front page of the paper he was criticised for playing up the duel between the bands blur won the race for the top of the charts and the resulting fallout from the publicity led to the paper enjoying increased sales during the 1990s as britpop became the dominant musical genre after this peak the paper experienced a slow decline as britpop burned itself out fairly rapidly over the next few years this left the paper directionless again and attempts to embrace the rise of dj culture in the late 1990s only led to the paper being criticised for not supporting rock or indie music the paper did attempt to return to its highly politicised 1980s incarnation by running a cover story in march 1998 condemning tony blair who had previously associated himself with britpop bands such as oasis and this received a certain level of attention in the wider mediacitation needed sutherland did attempt to cover newer bands but one cover feature on godspeed you black emperor in 1999 saw the paper dip to a sales low and sutherland later stated in his weekly editorial that he regretted putting them on the cover for many this was seen as an affront to the principles of the paper and sales reached a low point at the turn of the millennium 2000sedit from the issue of 21 march 1998 the paper was no longer printed on newsprint and more recently it has shifted to tabloid size with glossy colour covers in 2000 steve sutherland left to become brand director of the nme and was replaced as editor by 26yearold melody maker writer ben knowles in the same year melody maker officially merged with the nme and many speculated the nme would be next to close as the weekly musicmagazine market was shrinking  the monthly magazine select which had thrived especially during britpop was closed down within a week of melody maker in the early 2000s the nme also attempted somewhat to broaden its coverage again running cover stories on hiphop acts such as jayz and missy elliott electronic music pioneer aphex twin popstars winners hearsay and rb groups like destinys child but as in the 1980s these proved unpopular with much of the papers readership and were soon dropped in 2001 the nme reasserted its position as an influence in new music and helped to introduce bands including the strokes the vines and the white stripes in 2002 conor mcnicholas was appointed editor with a new wave of photographers including dean chalkley andrew kendall james looker and pieter van hattem and a high turnover of young writers it focused on new british bands such as the libertines franz ferdinand bloc party and the kaiser chiefs which had emerged as indie music continued to grow in commercial success later arctic monkeys became the standardbearers of the postlibertines crop of indie bands being both successfully championed by the nme and receiving widespread commercial and critical success in december 2005 accusations were made that the nme endofyear poll had been edited for commercial and political reasons24 these criticisms were rebutted by mcnicholas who claimed that webzine londonistcom had got hold of an early draft of the poll in october 2006 nme launched an irish version of the magazine called nme ireland25 this coincided with the launch of club nme in dublin dublinbased band humanzi was first to appear on the cover of nme ireland the irish edition of the magazine could not compete with local competitors such as hot press therefore it was discontinued after its fourth issue in february 200726 after the 2008 nme award nominations caroline sullivan of the guardian criticised the magazines lack of diversity saying27 nme bands fall within very narrow parameters in the 80s the paper prided itself on its coverage of hip hop rb and the emerging dance scene which it took seriously and featured prominently – alongside the usual peelendorsed indie fare now though its range of approved bands has dramatically shrunk to a strand embodied by the arctic monkeys babyshambles and muse – bands who you dont need specialist knowledge to write about and who are just indie enough to make readers feel theyre part of a club like everything else in publishing this particular direction must be in response to reader demand but it doesnt half make for a selflimiting magazine in may 2008 the magazine received a redesign aimed at an older readership with a less poppy more authoritative tone the first issue of the redesign featured a free seveninch coldplay vinyl single 2010sedit krissi murison was appointed editor in june 2009
