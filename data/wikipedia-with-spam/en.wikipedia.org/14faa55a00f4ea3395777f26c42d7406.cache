theme park opened on october 1 19821 the dedication plaque near the entrance states to all who come to this place of joy hope and friendship welcome epcot center is inspired by walt disneys creative genius here human achievements are celebrated through imagination the wonders of enterprise and concepts of a future that promises new and exciting benefits for all may epcot center entertain inform and inspire and above all may it instill a new sense of belief and pride in mans ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere — e cardon walker october 24 198217 historyedit epcots varied landscaping the landscape which includes much water grassy slopes and trees the parks name epcot is an acronym for experimental prototype community of tomorrow a utopian city of the future planned by walt disney often interchanging city and community in walt disneys words epcot will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of american industry it will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed but will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating new materials and new systems and epcot will always be a showcase to the world of the ingenuity and imagination of american free enterprise8 his original vision was for a model community which would have been home to twenty thousand residents and a test bed for city planning as well as organization it was to have been built in the shape of a circle with businesses and commercial areas at its center with community buildings schools and recreational complexes around it while residential neighborhoods would line the perimeter this radial plan concept is strongly influenced by british planner ebenezer howard and his garden cities of tomorrow transportation would have been provided by monorails and peoplemovers like that in magic kingdoms tomorrowland automobile traffic would be kept underground leaving pedestrians safe above ground the original model of epcot can still be seen by passengers riding the tomorrowland transit authority attraction in the magic kingdom park when the peoplemover enters the showhouse for stitchs great escape the remaining portion of the model is visible on the left when facing forward behind glass walt disney was not able to obtain funding and permission to start work on his florida property until he agreed to first build magic kingdom he died nearly five years before magic kingdom opened after disneys death walt disney productions decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city without walts guidance the model community of celebration florida has been mentioned as a realization of disneys original vision but celebration is based on concepts of new urbanism which is radically different from disneys modernist and futurist visions however the idea of epcot was instrumental in prompting the state of florida to create the reedy creek improvement district rcid and the cities of bay lake and reedy creek now lake buena vista a legislative mechanism allowing disney to exercise governmental powers over walt disney world control over the rcid is vested in the landowners of the district and the promise of an actual city in the district would have meant that the powers of the rcid would have been distributed among the landowners in epcot because the idea of epcot was never implemented disney remained almost the sole landowner in the district allowing it to maintain control of the rcid and the cities of bay lake and lake buena vista disney further cemented this control by deannexing celebration from the rcid the original plans for the park showed indecision over the parks purpose some imagineers wanted it to represent the cutting edge of technology while others wanted it to showcase international cultures and customs at one point a model of the futuristic park was pushed together against a model of a worlds fair international theme and the two were combined the park was originally named epcot center to reflect the ideals and values of the city it was constructed for an estimated 800 million to 14 billion and took three years to build at the time the largest construction project on earth9 the parking lot serving the park is 141 acres 57 ha including bus area and can accommodate 11211 vehicles grass areas hold additional 500 vehicles before it opened on october 1 1982 walt disney world ambassador genie field introduced e cardon walker disneys chairman and ceo who dedicated epcot center walker also presented a family with lifetime passes for the two walt disney world theme parks his remarks were followed by florida governor bob graham and william ellinghaus president of att as part of the openingday ceremony dancers and band members
