designed to search for information on the world wide web the search results are generally presented in a line of results often referred to as search engine results pages serps the information may be a mix of web pages images and other types of files some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories unlike web directories which are maintained only by human editors search

engine internet search engines themselves predate the debut of the web in december 1990 the who is user search dates back to 1982 1 and the knowbot information service multinetwork user search was first implemented in 19892 the first well documented search engine that searched content files namely ftp files was archie which debuted on 10 september 1990citation needed prior to september 1993 the world wide web was entirely indexed by hand there was a list of webservers edited by tim bernerslee and hosted on the cern webserver one historical snapshot of the list in 1992 remains3 but as more and more web servers went online the central list could no longer keep up on the ncsa site new servers were announced under the title whats new4 the first tool used for searching content as opposed to users on the internet was archie5 the name stands for archive without the v it was created by alan emtage bill heelan and j peter deutsch computer science students at mcgill university in montreal the program downloaded the directory listings of all the files located on public anonymous ftp file transfer protocol sites creating a searchable database of file names however archie search engine did not index the contents of these sites since the amount of data was so limited it could be readily searched manually the rise of gopher created in 1991 by mark mccahill at the university of minnesota led to two new search programs veronica and jughead like archie they searched the file names and titles stored in gopher index systems veronica very easy rodentoriented netwide index to computerized archives provided a keyword search of most gopher menu titles in the entire gopher listings jughead jonzys universal gopher hierarchy excavation and display was a tool for obtaining menu information from specific gopher servers while the name of the search engine archie search engine was not a reference to the archie comic book series veronica and jughead are characters in the series thus referencing their predecessor in the summer of 1993 no search engine existed for the web though numerous specialized catalogues were maintained by hand oscar nierstrasz at the university of geneva wrote a series of perl scripts that periodically mirrored these pages and rewrote them into a standard format this formed the basis for w3catalog the webs first primitive search engine released on september 2 19936 in june 1993 matthew gray then at mit produced what was probably the first web robot the perlbased world wide web wanderer and used it to generate an index called wandex the purpose of the wanderer was to measure the size of the world wide web which it did until late 1995 the webs second search engine aliweb appeared in november 1993 aliweb did not use a web robot but instead depended on being notified by website administrators of the existence at each site of an index file in a particular format ncsas mosaic™ mosaic web browser wasnt the first web browser but it was the first to make a major splash in november 1993 mosaic v 10 broke away from the small pack of existing browsers by including features—like icons bookmarks a more attractive interface and pictures—that made the software easy to use and appealing to nongeeks jumpstation created in december 19937 by jonathon fletcher used a web robot to find web pages and to build its index and used a web form as the interface to its query program it was thus the first www resourcediscovery tool to combine the three essential features of a web search engine crawling indexing and searching as described below because of the limited resources available on the platform it ran on its indexing and hence searching were limited to the titles and headings found in the web pages the crawler encountered one of the first all text crawlerbased search engines was webcrawler which came out in 1994 unlike its predecessors it allowed users to search for any word in any webpage which has become the standard for all major search engines since it was also the first one widely known by the public also in 1994 lycos which started at carnegie mellon university was launched and became a major commercial endeavor soon after many search engines appeared and vied for popularity these included magellan excite infoseek inktomi northern light and altavista yahoo was among the most popular ways for people to find web pages of interest but its search function operated on its web directory rather than its fulltext copies of web pages information seekers could also browse the directory instead of doing a keywordbased search in 1996 netscape was looking to give a single search engine an exclusive deal as the featured search engine on netscapes web browser there was so much interest that instead netscape struck deals with five of the major search engines for 5 million a year each search engine would be in rotation on the netscape search engine page the five engines were yahoo magellan lycos infoseek and excite89 google adopted the idea of selling search terms in 1998 from a small search engine company named gotocom this move had a significant effect on the se business which went from struggling to one of the most profitable businesses in the internetcitation needed search engines were also known as some of the brightest stars in the internet investing frenzy that occurred in the late 1990s10 several companies entered the market spectacularly receiving record gains during their initial public offerings some have taken down their public search engine and are marketing enterpriseonly editions such as northern light many search engine companies were caught up in the dotcom bubble a speculationdriven market boom that peaked in 1999 and ended in 2001 around 2000 googles search engine rose to prominence11 the company achieved better results for many searches with an innovation called pagerank as was explained in the paper anatomy of a search engine written by sergey brin and larry page the later founders of google12 this iterative algorithm ranks web pages based on the number and pagerank of other web sites and pages that link there on the premise that good or desirable pages are linked to more than others google also maintained a minimalist interface to its search engine in contrast many of its competitors embedded a search engine in a web portal in fact google search engine became so popular that spoof engines emerged such as mystery seeker by 2000 yahoo was providing search services based on inktomis search engine yahoo acquired inktomi in 2002 and overture which owned alltheweb and altavista in 2003 yahoo switched to googles search engine until 2004 when it launched its own search engine based on the combined technologies of its acquisitions microsoft first launched msn search in the fall of 1998 using search results from inktomi in early 1999 the site began to display listings from looksmart blended with results from inktomi for a short time in 1999 msn search used results from altavista instead in 2004 microsoft began a transition to its own search technology powered by its own web crawler called msnbot microsofts rebranded search engine bing was launched on june 1 2009 on july 29 2009 yahoo and microsoft finalized a deal in which yahoo search would be powered by microsoft bing technology how web search engines workedit this article has

get their information by web crawling from site to site the spider checks for the standard filename robotstxt addressed to it before sending certain information back to be indexed depending on many factors such as the titles page content javascript cascading style sheets css headings as evidenced by the standard html markup of the informational content or its metadata in html meta tags indexing means associating words and other definable tokens found on web pages to their domain names and htmlbased fields the associations are made in a public database made available for web search queries a query from a user can be a single word the index helps find information relating to the query as quickly as possible13 some of the techniques for indexing and caching are trade secrets whereas web crawling is a straightforward process of visiting all sites on a systematic basis between visits by the spider the cached version of page some or all the content needed to render it stored in the search engine working memory is quickly sent to an inquirer if a visit is overdue the search engine can just act as a web proxy instead in this case the page may differ from the search terms indexed13 the cached page holds the appearance of the version whose words were indexed so a cached version of a page can be useful to the web site when the actual page has been lost but this problem is also considered a mild form of linkrot highlevel architecture of a standard web crawler typically when a user enters a query into a search engine it is a few keywords14 the index already has the names of the sites containing the keywords and these are instantly obtained from the index the real processing load is in generating the web pages that are the search results list every page in the entire list must be weighted according to information in the indexes13 then the top search result item requires the lookup reconstruction and markup of the snippets showing the context of the keywords matched these are only part of the processing each search results web page requires and further pages next to the top require more of this post processing beyond simple keyword lookups search engines offer their own gui or commanddriven operators and search parameters to refine the search results these provide the necessary controls for the user engaged in the feedback loop users create by filtering and weighting while refining the search results given the initial pages of the first search results for example from 2007 the googlecom search engine has allowed one to filter by date by clicking show search tools in the leftmost column of the initial search results page and then selecting the desired date range15 its also possible to weight by date because each page has a modification time most search engines support the use of the boolean operators and or and not to help end users refine the search query boolean operators are for literal searches that allow the user to refine and extend the terms of the search the engine looks for the words or phrases exactly as entered some search engines provide an advanced feature called proximity search which allows users to define the distance between keywords13 there is also conceptbased searching where the research involves using statistical analysis on pages containing the words or phrases you search for as well natural language queries allow the user to type a question in the same form one would ask it to a human16 a site like this would be askcom17 the usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the result set it gives back while there may be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase some pages may be more relevant popular or authoritative than others most search engines employ methods to rank the results to provide the best results first how a search engine decides which pages are the best matches and what order the results should be shown in varies widely from one engine to another13 the methods also change over time as internet usage changes and new techniques evolve there are two main types of search engine that have evolved one is a system of predefined and hierarchically ordered keywords that humans have programmed extensively the other is a system that generates an inverted index by analyzing texts it locates this first form relies much more heavily on the computer itself to do the bulk of the work most web search engines are commercial ventures supported by advertising revenue and thus some of them allow advertisers to have their listings ranked higher in search results for a fee search engines that do not accept money for their search results make money by running search related ads alongside the regular search engine results the search engines make money every time someone clicks on one of these ads18 market shareedit google is the worlds most popular search engine with a market share of 8052 percent as of march 201719 the worlds most popular search engines with 1 market share are search engine market share in march 2017 google 8052 8052   bing 692 692   baidu 594 594   yahoo 535 535   east asia and russiaedit in some east asian countries and russia google is not the most popular search engine in russia yandex commands a marketshare of 619 percent compared to googles 283 percent20 in china baidu is the most popular search engine21 south koreas homegrown search portal naver is used for 70 percent of online searches in the country22 yahoo japan and yahoo taiwan are the most popular avenues for internet search in japan and taiwan respectively23 europeedit most countries markets in western europe are dominated by google except for czech republic where seznam is a strong competitor24 search engine biasedit although search engines are programmed to rank websites based on some combination of their popularity and relevancy empirical studies indicate various political economic and social biases in the information they provide2526 and the underlying assumptions about the technology27 these biases can be a direct result of economic and commercial processes eg companies that advertise with a search engine can become also more popular in its organic search results and political processes eg the removal of search results to comply with local laws28 for example google will not surface certain neonazi websites in france and germany where holocaust denial is illegal biases can also be a result of social processes as search engine algorithms are frequently designed to exclude nonnormative viewpoints in favor of more popular results29 indexing algorithms of major search engines skew towards coverage of usbased sites rather than websites from nonus countries26 google bombing is one example of an attempt to manipulate search results for political social or commercial reasons several scholars have studied the cultural changes triggered by search engines30 and the representation of certain controversial topics in their results such as terrorism in ireland31 and conspiracy theories32 customized results and filter bubblesedit many search engines such as google and bing provide customized results based on the users activity history this leads to an effect that has been called a filter bubble the term describes a phenomenon in which websites use algorithms to selectively guess what information a user would like to see based on information about the user such as location past click behaviour and search history as a result websites tend to show only information that agrees with the users past viewpoint effectively isolating the user in a bubble that tends to exclude contrary information prime examples are googles personalized search results and facebooks personalized news stream according to eli pariser who coined the term users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble pariser related an example in which one user searched google for bp and got investment news about british petroleum while another searcher got information about the deepwater horizon oil spill and that the two search results pages were strikingly different333435 the bubble effect may have negative implications for civic discourse according to pariser36 since this problem has been identified competing search engines have emerged that seek to avoid this problem by not tracking or bubbling users such as duckduckgo other scholars do not share parisers view finding the evidence in support of his thesis unconvincing37 christian islamic and jewish search enginesedit the global growth of the internet and electronic media in the arab and muslim world during the last decade has encouraged islamic adherents in the middle east and asian subcontinent to attempt their own search engines their own filtered search portals that would enable users to perform safe searches more than usual safe search filters these islamic web portals categorizing websites into being either halal or haram based on modern expert interpretation of the law of islam imhalal came online in september 2011 halalgoogling came online in july 2013 these use haram filters on the collections from google and bing and other38 while lack of investment and slow pace in technologies in the muslim world has hindered progress and thwarted success of an islamic search engine targeting as the main consumers islamic adherents projects like muxlim a muslim lifestyle site did receive millions of dollars from investors like rite internet ventures and it also faltered other religionoriented search engines are jewgle the jewish version of google and seekfindorg which is christian seekfind filters sites that attack or degrade their faith39 search engine submissionedit search engine submission is a process in which a webmaster submits a website directly to a search engine while search engine submission is sometimes presented as a way to promote a website it generally is not necessary because the major search engines use web crawlers that will eventually find most web sites on the internet without assistance they can either submit one web page at a time or they can submit the entire site using a sitemap but it is normally only necessary to submit the home page of a web site as search engines are able to crawl a well designed website there are two remaining reasons to submit a web site or web page to a search engine to add an entirely new web site without waiting for a search engine to discover it and to have a web sites record updated after a substantial redesign some search engine submission software not only submits websites to multiple search engines but also add links to websites from their own pages this could appear helpful in increasing a websites ranking because external links are one of the most important factors determining a websites ranking however john mueller of google has stated that this can lead to a tremendous number of unnatural links for your site with a negative impact on site ranking40 see alsoedit comparison of web search engines information retrieval list of search engines question
