right into the arms of st louis defensive back todd lyght a few plays later the half ended with the score still 53 despite the rams 159–75 advantage over the buccaneers in total yards just as in the first half tampa bay scored a field goal on their opening drive on the third quarter set up by a 32yard reception by jacquez green and a 15yard facemask penalty on taje allen meanwhile warner was

a 13yard loss after that his potential 11yard completion to bert emanuel was controversially overturned by a replay challenge the play led the nfl to adopt the bert emanuel rule3 after the season which still allows for a catch to be made if a receiver maintains possession and control of a ball even if the ball touches the ground then king threw two consecutive incompletions turning the ball
