vast array of secondary and tertiary characters the show includes an array of quirky supporting characters coworkers teachers family friends extended relatives townspeople and local celebrities the creators originally intended many of these characters as onetime jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town a number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes according to matt groening the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show sctv14 despite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing the characters do not age between episodes either physically or in stated age and generally appear just as they did when the series began the series uses a floating timeline in which episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced even though the characters do not age flashbacksforwards do occasionally depict the characters at other points in their lives with the timeline

development main articles history of the simpsons and the simpsons shorts james l brooks pictured asked matt groening to create a series of animated shorts for the tracey ullman show when producer james l brooks was working on the television variety show the tracey ullman show he decided to include small animated sketches before and after the commercial breaks having seen one of cartoonist matt groenings life in hell comic strips brooks asked groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts groening initially intended to present an animated version of his life in hell series22 however groening later realized that animating life in hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his lifes work he therefore chose another approach while waiting in the lobby of brookss office for the pitch meeting hurriedly formulating his version of a dysfunctional family that became the simpsons2223 he named the characters after his own family members substituting bart for his own name adopting an anagram of the word brat22 the simpson family first appeared as shorts in the tracey ullman show on april 19 198724 groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production however the animators merely retraced his drawings which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts22 the animation was produced domestically at klasky csupo2526 with wes archer david silverman and bill kopp being animators for the first season27 colorist gyorgyi peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow27 in 1989 a team of production companies adapted the simpsons into a halfhour series for the fox broadcasting company the team included the klasky csupo animation house brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the fox network that prevented fox from interfering with the shows content28 groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called the mainstream trash that they were watching29 the halfhour series premiered on december 17 1989 with simpsons roasting on an open fire30 some enchanted evening was the first fulllength episode produced but it did not broadcast until may 1990 as the last episode of the first season because of animation problems31 in 1992 tracey ullman filed a lawsuit against fox

until 200441 george meyer who had developed the show since the first season was active in these sessions according to longtime writer jon vitti meyer usually invented the best lines in a given episode even though other writers may receive script credits40 each episode takes six months to produce so the show rarely comments on current events42 part of the writing staff of the simpsons in 1992 back

cast and were given the parts so that new actors would not be needed49 cartwright voices bart simpson nelson muntz ralph wiggum and other children48 smith the voice of lisa simpson is the only cast member who regularly voices only one character although she occasionally plays other episodic characters48 the producers decided to hold casting for the roles of bart and lisa smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of bart but casting director bonita pietila believed her voice was too high50 so she was given the role of lisa instead51 cartwright was originally brought in to voice lisa but upon arriving at the audition she found that lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality cartwright became more interested in the role of bart who was described as devious underachieving schoolhating irreverent and clever52 groening let her try out for the part instead and upon hearing her read gave her the job on the spot53 cartwright is the only one of the six main simpsons cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show43 azaria and shearer do not voice members of the title family but

identities secret during the early seasons and therefore closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists57 however the network eventually revealed which roles each actor performed in the episode old money because the producers said the voice actors should receive credit for their work58 in 2003 the cast appeared in an episode of inside the actors

them with new actors even going as far as preparing for casting of new voices but series creator groening supported the actors in their action59 the issue was soon resolved and from 1998 to 2004 they were paid 125000 per episode the shows revenue continued to rise through syndication and dvd sales and in april 2004 the main cast stopped appearing for script readings demanding they be paid 360000 per episode6061 the strike was resolved a month later62 and their salaries were increased to something between 25000063 and 360000 per episode64 in 2008 production for the twentieth season was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors who wanted a healthy bump in salary to an amount close to 500000 per episode64 the negotiations were soon completed and the actors salary was raised to 400000 per episode65 three years later with fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut the cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut down to just over 300000

a television series71 the simpsons has been dubbed into several other languages including japanese german spanish and portuguese it is also one of the few programs dubbed in both standard french and quebec french72 the show has been broadcast in arabic but due to islamic customs numerous aspects of the show have been changed for example homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs because of such changes the arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the lifelong simpsons fans in the area73 animation animation director david silverman who helped define the look of the show27 several different us and international studios animate the simpsons throughout the run of the animated shorts on the tracey ullman show the animation was produced domestically at klasky csupo25 with the debut of the series because of an increased workload fox subcontracted production to several local and foreign studios25 these are akom74 anivision75 rough draft studios76 usanimation77 and toonzone entertainment78 for the first three seasons klasky csupo animated the simpsons in the united states in 1992 the shows production company gracie films switched domestic production to film roman79 who continue to animate the show until 2016 in season 14 production switched from traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint80 the first episode to experiment with digital coloring was radioactive man in 1995 animators used digital ink and paint during production of the season 12 episode tennis the menace but gracie films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later the already completed tennis the menace was broadcast as made81 the production staff at the us animation studio film roman draws storyboards designs new characters backgrounds props and draws character and background layouts which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at gracie films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas the overseas studios then draw the inbetweens ink and paint and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the united states to be delivered to fox three to four months later82 the series began highdefinition production in season 20 the first episode take my life please aired february 15 2009 the move to hdtv included a new opening sequence83 matt groening called it a complicated change because it affected the timing and composition of animation84 themes main articles media in the simpsons politics in the simpsons and religion in the simpsons the simpsons uses the standard setup of a situational comedy or sitcom as its premise the series centers on a family and their life in a typical american town11 serving as a satirical parody of a middle class american lifestyle85 however because of its animated nature the simpsons scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom the town of springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society by having homer work in a nuclear power plant the show can comment on the state of the environment86 through bart and lisas days at springfield elementary school the shows writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education the town features a vast array of media channels—from kids television programming to local news which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry87 some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a leftwing bias88 al jean admitted in an interview that we the show are of liberal bent89 the writers often evince an appreciation for liberal ideals but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum90 the show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker89 thus the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light in the simpsons politicians are corrupt ministers such as reverend lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers and the local police force is incompetent91 religion also figures as a recurring theme92 in times of crisis the family often turns to god and the show has dealt with most of the major religions93 hallmarks opening sequence main article the simpsons opening sequence the music played during the opening sequence this piece is also known as the simpsons theme the simpsons opening sequence is one of the shows most memorable hallmarks the standard opening has gone through three iterations a replacement of some shots at the start of the second season and a brand new sequence when the show switched to highdefinition in 200994 each has the same basic sequence of events the camera zooms through cumulus clouds through the shows title towards the town of springfield the camera then follows the members of the family on their way home upon entering their house the simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television the original opening was created by david silverman and was the first task he did when production began on the show95 the series distinctive theme song was composed by musician danny elfman in 1989 after groening approached him requesting a retro style piece this piece has been noted by elfman as the most popular of his career96 one of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode bart writes different things on the school chalkboard95 lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch97 halloween episodes main article treehouse of horror bart simpson introducing a segment of treehouse of horror iv in the manner of rod serlings night gallery the special halloween episode has become an annual tradition treehouse of horror first broadcast in 1990 as part of season two and established the pattern of three separate selfcontained stories in each halloween episode98 these pieces usually involve the family in some horror science fiction or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres99 they always take place outside the normal continuity of the show although the treehouse series is meant to be seen on halloween this changed by the 2000s when new installments have premiered after halloween due to foxs current contract with major league baseballs world series100 however since 2011 every treehouse of horror episode has aired during the month of october humor the shows humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show such references for example come from movies television music literature science and history101 the animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the shows background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs newspapers billboards and elsewhere the audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show102 kristin thompson argues that the simpsons uses a flurry of cultural references intentionally inconsistent characterization and considerable selfreflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show103 one of barts early hallmarks was his prank calls to moes tavern owner moe szyslak in which bart calls moe and asks for a gag name moe tries to find that person in the bar but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens bart these calls were apparently based on a series of prank calls known as the tube bar recordings though groening has denied any causal connection104 moe was based partly on tube bar owner louis red deutsch whose often profane responses inspired moes violent side105 as the series progressed it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write moes angry response and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season106107 the simpsons also often includes selfreferential humor108 the most common form is jokes about fox broadcasting109 for example the episode she used to be my girl included a scene in which a fox news channel van drove down the street while displaying a large bush cheney 2004 banner and playing queens we are the champions in reference to the 2004 us presidential election and claims of conservative bias in fox news110111 the show uses catchphrases and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each112 notable expressions include homers annoyed grunt doh mr burns excellent and nelson muntzs haha some of barts catchphrases such as ¡ay caramba dont have a cow man and eat my shorts appeared on tshirts in the shows early days113 however bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising the use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons the episode bart gets famous mocks catchphrasebased humor as bart achieves fame on the krusty the clown show solely for saying i didnt do it114 influence and legacy idioms a number of neologisms that originated on the simpsons have entered popular vernacular115116 mark liberman director of the linguistic data consortium remarked the simpsons has apparently taken over from shakespeare and the bible as our cultures greatest source of idioms catchphrases and sundry other textual allusions116 the most famous catchphrase is homers annoyed grunt doh so ubiquitous is the expression that it is now listed in the oxford english dictionary but without the apostrophe117 dan castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from james finlayson an actor in many laurel and hardy comedies who pronounced it in a more elongated and whining tone the staff of the simpsons told castellaneta to shorten the noise and it went on to become the wellknown exclamation in the television series118 groundskeeper willies description of the french as cheeseeating surrender monkeys was used by national review columnist jonah goldberg in 2003 after frances opposition to the proposed invasion of iraq the phrase quickly spread to other journalists116119 cromulent and embiggen words used in lisa the iconoclast have since appeared in the dictionarycoms 21st century lexicon120 and scientific journals respectively116121 kwyjibo a fake scrabble word invented by bart in bart the genius was used as one of the aliases of the creator of the melissa worm122 i for one welcome our new insect overlords was used by kent brockman in deep space homer and has become a common phrase123 variants of brockmans utterance are used to express obsequious submission it has been used in media such as new scientist magazine124 the dismissive term meh believed to have been popularized by the show116125126 entered the collins english dictionary in 2008127 other words credited as stemming from the show include yoink and craptacular116 the oxford dictionary of modern quotations includes several quotations from the show as well as cheeseeating surrender monkeys homers lines kids you tried your best and you failed miserably the lesson is never try from burns heir season five 1994 as well as kids are the best apu you can teach them to hate the things you hate and they practically raise themselves what with the internet and all from eight misbehavin season 11 1999 entered the dictionary in august 2007128 television the simpsons was the first successful animated program in american prime time since wait till your father gets home in the 1970s129 during most of the 1980s us pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for primetime television the simpsons changed this perception25 initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate primetime cartoon success with shows like capitol critters fish police and family dog which were expensive and unsuccessful130 the simpsons use of korean animation studios for tweening coloring and filming made the episodes cheaper the success of the simpsons and the lower production cost prompted us television networks to take chances on other animated series25 this development led us producers to a 1990s boom in new animated primetime shows such as south park family guy king of the hill futurama and the critic25 for family guy creator seth macfarlane the simpsons created an audience for primetime animation that had not been there for many many years  as far as im concerned they basically reinvented the wheel they created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium131 the simpsons has had crossovers with four other shows in the episode a star is burns marge invites jay sherman the main character of the critic to be a judge for a film festival in springfield matt groening had his name removed from the episode since he had no involvement with the critic132 south park later paid homage to the simpsons with the episode simpsons already did it133 in simpsorama the planet express crew from futurama come to springfield in the present to prevent the simpsons from destroying the future134 in the family guy episode the simpsons guy the griffins visit springfield and meet the simpsons135 the simpsons has also influenced liveaction shows like malcolm in the middle which featured the use of sight gags and did not use a laugh track unlike most sitcoms136137 malcolm in the middle debuted january 9 2000 in the time slot after the simpsons ricky gervais called the simpsons an influence on the office138 and fellow british sitcom spaced was according to its director edgar wright an attempt to do a liveaction the simpsons139 in georgia the animated television sitcom the samsonadzes launched in november 2009 has been noted for its very strong resemblance with the simpsons which its creator shalva ramishvili has acknowledged140141142 reception and achievements season no of episodes originally aired viewership season premiere

australia season six 1995 and brazil in blame it on lisa season 13 2002 and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries212 in the latter case rio de janeiros tourist board—which claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime kidnappings slums and monkey and rat infestations—went so far as to threaten fox with legal action213 groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode a star is burns season six 1995 which featured a crossover with the critic he felt that it was just an advertisement for the critic and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him when he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns openly criticizing james l brooks and saying the episode violates the simpsons universe in response brooks said i am furious with matt  hes allowed his opinion but airing this publicly in the press is going too far  his behavior right now is rotten132214 the principal and the pauper season nine 1997 is one of the most controversial episodes of the simpsons many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that seymour skinner a recurring character since the first season was an impostor the episode has been criticized by groening and by harry shearer who provides the voice of skinner in a 2001 interview shearer recalled that after reading the script he told the writers thats so wrong youre taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason for a story weve done before with other characters its so arbitrary and gratuitous and its disrespectful to the audience215 ban the show has reportedly been taken off the air in several countries china banned it from primetime television in august 2006 in an effort to protect chinas struggling animation studios216 in 2008 venezuela barred the show from airing on

showing the decline in quality of the show from season 1 season 28219 critics reviews of early simpsons episodes praised the show for its sassy humor wit realism and intelligence29220 however in the late 1990s around the airing of season 10 the tone and emphasis of the show began to change some critics started calling the show tired221 by 2000 some longterm fans had become disillusioned with the show and pointed to its shift from characterdriven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics222223224 jim schembri of the sydney morning herald attributed the decline in quality to an abandonment of characterdriven storylines in favor of and overuse of celebrity cameo appearances and references to popular culture schembri wrote the central tragedy of the simpsons is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attentionseeking it began by proving that cartoon characters dont have to be caricatures they can be invested with real emotions now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walkons and punchlinehungry dialogue225 in 2010 the bbc noted the common consensus is that the simpsons golden era ended after season nine6 and todd leopold of cnn in an article looking at its perceived decline stated for many fans  the glory days are long past224 similarly tyler wilson of coeur dalene press has referred to seasons one to nine as the shows golden age5 and ian nathan of empire described the shows classic era as being say the first ten seasons7 jon heacock of lucidworks stated that for the first ten years seasons the show was consistently at the top of its game with so many moments quotations and references – both epic and obscure – that helped turn the simpson family into the cultural icons that they remain to this day8 mike scully who was showrunner during seasons nine through twelve has been the subject of criticism226227 chris suellentrop of slate wrote that under scullys tenure the simpsons became well a cartoon  episodes that once would have ended with homer and marge bicycling into the sunset now end with homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into marges neck the shows still funny but it hasnt been touching in years226 when asked in 2007 how the series longevity is sustained scully joked lower your quality standards once youve done that you can go on forever228 al jean showrunner since season thirteen has also been the subject of criticism with some arguing that the show has continued to decline in quality under his tenure former writers have complained that under jean the show is on autopilot too sentimental and the episodes are just being cranked out some critics believe that the show has entered a steady decline under jean and is no longer really funny229 john ortved author of the simpsons an uncensored unauthorized history characterized the jean era as toothless230 and criticized what he perceived as the shows increase in social and political commentary231 jean responded well its possible that weve declined but honestly ive been here the whole time and i do remember in season two people saying its gone downhill if wed listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13 im glad we didnt232 in 2004 harry shearer criticized what he perceived as the shows declining quality i rate the last three seasons as among the worst so season four looks very good to me now233 dan castellaneta responded i dont agree  i think harrys issue is that the show isnt as grounded as it was in the first three or four seasons that its gotten crazy or a little more madcap i think it organically changes to stay fresh234 also in 2004 author douglas coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as hogwash saying the simpsons hasnt fumbled the ball in fourteen years its hardly likely to fumble it now235 in an april 2006 interview groening said i honestly dont see any end in sight i think its possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome  but right now the show is creatively i think as good or better than its ever been the animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative and the stories do things that we havent done before so creatively theres no reason to quit236 in 2016 popular culture writer anna leszkiewicz suggested that even though the simpsons still holds cultural relevance contemporary appeal is only for the first ten seasons with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is killed off or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters237 the series ratings have also declined while the first season enjoyed an average of 134 million viewing households per episode in the us150 the twentyfirst season had an average of 72 million viewers238 alan sepinwall and matt zoller seitz argued in their 2016 book titled tv the book that the peak of the simpsons are roughly seasons three through twelve and that despite the decline episodes from the later seasons such as eternal moonshine of the simpson mind and holidays of future passed could be considered on par with the earlier classic episodes further stating that even if you want to call the show today a thin shadow of its former self think about how mindboggingly great its former self had to be for sodiminished a version to be watchable at all239240 other media main article the simpsons franchise comic books main article list of the simpsons comics numerous simpsonrelated comic books have been
