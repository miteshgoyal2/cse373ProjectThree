frequency 1 of people3 edit on wikidata vitiligo is a long term skin condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment1 the patches of skin affected become white and usually have sharp margins1 the hair from the skin may also become white1 inside the mouth and nose may also be involved2 typically both sides of the body are affected1 often the patches begin on areas of skin that are exposed to the sun2 it is more noticeable in people with dark skin2 vitiligo may result in psychological stress and those affected may be stigmatized1 the cause is typically unknown1 it is believed to be due to genetic susceptibility that is triggered by an environmental factor such that an autoimmune disease occurs12 this results in the destruction of skin pigment cells2 risk factors include a family history of the condition or other autoimmune diseases such as hyperthyroidism alopecia areata and pernicious anemia2 it is not contagious4 vitiligo is classified into two main types segmental and nonsegmental1 most cases are nonsegmental meaning they affect both sides and in these cases the affected area of the skin typically expands with time1 about 10 of cases are segmental meaning they mostly involve one side of the body and in these cases the affected area of the skin typically does not expand with time1 diagnosis can be confirmed by tissue biopsy2 there is no known cure for vitiligo1 for those with light skin sunscreen and makeup are all that is typically recommended1 other treatment options may include steroid creams or phototherapy to darken the light patches2 alternatively efforts to lighten the unaffected skin such as with hydroquinone may be tried2 a number of surgical options are available for those who do not improve with other measures2 a combination of treatments generally has better outcomes3 counselling to provide emotional support may be useful1 globally about 1 of people are affected by vitiligo3 some populations have rates as high as 2–35 males and females are equally affected1 about half show the disorder before age 20 and most develop it before age 401 vitiligo has been described since ancient history1 contents 1 signs and symptoms 2

the only sign of vitiligo is the presence of pale patchy areas of depigmented skin which tend to occur on the extremities67 the patches are initially small but often grow and change shape68 when skin lesions occur they are most prominent on the face hands and wrists67 the loss of skin pigmentation is particularly noticeable around body orifices such as the mouth eyes nostrils genitalia and umbilicus67 some lesions have increased skin pigment around the edges9 those affected by vitiligo who are stigmatized for their condition may experience depression and similar mood disorders10 causesedit although multiple hypotheses have been suggested as potential triggers that cause vitiligo studies strongly imply that changes in the immune system are responsible for the condition111 vitiligo has been proposed to be a multifactorial disease with genetic susceptibility and environmental factors both thought to play a role1 the tyr gene encodes the protein tyrosinase which is not a component of the immune system but is an enzyme of the melanocyte that catalyzes melanin biosynthesis and a major autoantigen in generalized vitiligo1 the nih states that sunburns can cause the disease but there is not good evidence to support this12 preliminary evidence suggests a possible association with eating gluten13 immuneedit variations in genes that are part of the immune system or part of melanocytes have both been associated with vitiligo1 it is also thought to be caused by the immune system attacking and destroying the melanocytes of the skin14 a genomewide association study found approximately 36 independent susceptibility loci for generalized vitiligo15 autoimmune associationsedit vitiligo is sometimes associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as hashimotos thyroiditis scleroderma rheumatoid arthritis type 1 diabetes mellitus psoriasis addisons disease pernicious anemia alopecia areata systemic lupus erythematosus and celiac disease116 among the inflammatory products of nalp1 are caspase 1 and caspase 7 which activate the inflammatory cytokine interleukin1β interleukin1β and interleukin18 are expressed at high levels in patients with vitiligo17 in one of the mutations the amino acid leucine in the nalp1 protein was replaced by histidine leu155his the original protein and sequence is highly conserved in evolution and is found in humans chimpanzee rhesus monkey and the bush baby addisons disease typically an autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands may also be seen in individuals with vitiligo1819 diagnosisedit uv photograph of a hand with vitiligo uv photograph of a foot with vitiligo an ultraviolet light can be used in the early phase of this disease for identification and to determine the effectiveness of treatment skin with vitiligo when exposed to a blacklight will glow blue in contrast healthy skin will have no reaction classificationedit classification attempts to quantify vitiligo have been analyzed as being somewhat inconsistent20 while recent consensus have agreed to a system of segmental vitiligo sv and nonsegmental vitiligo nsv nsv is the most common type of vitiligo1 nonsegmentaledit eyelid vitiligo in nonsegmental vitiligo nsv there is usually some form of symmetry in the location of the patches of depigmentation new patches also appear over time and can be generalized over large portions of the body or localized to a particular area extreme cases of vitiligo to the extent that little pigmented skin remains are referred to as vitiligo universalis nsv can come about at any age unlike segmental vitiligo which is far more prevalent in teenage years9 classes of nonsegmental vitiligo include the following generalized vitiligo the most common pattern wide and randomly distributed areas of depigmentation21 universal vitiligo depigmentation encompasses most of the body21 focal vitiligo one or a few scattered macules in one area most common in children21 acrofacial vitiligo fingers and periorificial areas21 mucosal vitiligo depigmentation of only the mucous membranes21 segmentaledit segmental vitiligo sv differs in appearance cause and frequency of associated illnesses its treatment is different from that of nsv it tends to affect areas of skin that are associated with dorsal roots from the spinal cord and is most often unilateral122 it is much more stablestatic in course and its association with autoimmune diseases appears to be weaker than that of generalized vitiligo22 sv does not improve with topical therapies or uv light however surgical treatments such as cellular grafting can be effective9 differential diagnosisedit chemical leukoderma is a similar condition due to multiple exposures to chemicals23 vitiligo however is a risk factor23 triggers may include inflammatory skin conditions burns intralesional steroid injections and abrasions24 other conditions with similar symptoms include the following pityriasis alba tuberculoid leprosy postinflammatory hypopigmentation tinea versicolor21 albinism piebaldism21 idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis21 progressive macular hypomelanosis21 primary adrenal insufficiency treatmentedit there is no cure for vitiligo but several treatment options are available1 the best evidence is for applied steroids and the combination of ultraviolet light in combination with creams25 due to the higher risks of skin cancer the united kingdoms national health service suggests phototherapy only be used if primary treatments are ineffective26 lesions located on the hands feet and joints are the most difficult to repigment those on the face are easiest to return to the natural skin color as the skin is thinner in nature1 immune mediatorsedit topical preparations of immune suppressing medications including glucocorticoids such as 005 clobetasol or 010 betamethasone and calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus are considered to be firstline vitiligo treatments1 phototherapyedit phototherapy is considered a secondline treatment for vitiligo1 exposing the skin to light from uvb lamps is the most common treatment for vitiligo the treatments can be done at home with an uvb lamp or in a clinic the exposure time is managed so that the skin does not suffer overexposure treatment can take a few weeks if the spots are on the neck and face and if they existed not more than 3 years if the spots are on the hands and legs and have been there more than 3 years it can take a few months phototherapy sessions are done 2–3 times a week spots on a large area of the body may require full body treatment in a clinic or hospital uvb broadband and narrowband lamps can be used2728 but narrowband ultraviolet picked around 311 nm is the choice it has been constitutively reported that a combination of uvb phototherapy with other topical treatments improves repigmentation however some vitiligo patients may not see any changes to skin or repigmentation occurring a serious potential side effect involves the risk of developing skin cancer the same risk as an overexposure to natural sunlight ultraviolet light uva treatments are normally carried out in a hospital clinic psoralen and ultraviolet a light puva treatment involves taking a drug that increases the skins sensitivity to ultraviolet light then exposing the skin to high doses of uva light treatment is required twice a week for 6–12 months or longer because of the high doses of uva and psoralen puva may cause side effects such as sunburntype reactions or skin freckling26 narrowband ultraviolet b nbuvb phototherapy lacks the sideeffects caused by psoralens and is as effective as puva1 as with puva treatment is carried out twice weekly in a clinic or every day at home and there is no need to use psoralen26 skin camouflageedit in mild cases vitiligo patches can be hidden with makeup or other cosmetic camouflage solutions if the affected person is paleskinned the patches can be made less visible by avoiding tanning of unaffected skin21 depigmentingedit in cases of extensive vitiligo the option to depigment the unaffected skin with topical drugs like monobenzone mequinol or hydroquinone may be considered to render the skin an even colour the removal of all the skin pigment with monobenzone is permanent and vigorous sunsafety must be adhered to for life to avoid severe sunburn and melanomas depigmentation takes about a year to complete26 historyedit descriptions of a disease believed to be vitiligo date back to a passage in the medical text ebers papyrus circa 1500 bc in ancient egypt mentions of whitening of the skin were also present circa 1400 bc in sacred indian texts such as atharvaveda as well as shinto prayers in east asia circa 1200 bc the hebrew word tzaraath from the old testament book of leviticus29 dating to 1280 bce30 or 1312 bce31 described a group of skin disease associated with white spots and a subsequent translation to greek led to continued conflation of those with vitiligo with leprosy and spiritual uncleanliness29 medical sources in the ancient world such as hippocrates often did not differentiate between vitiligo and leprosy often grouping these diseases together in arabic literature the word alabras has been associated with vitiligo with this word found in the quran the name vitiligo was first used by the roman physician aulus cornelius celsus in his classic medical text de medicina29 etymologyedit the etymology of the term vitiligo is believed to be derived from vitium meaning defect or blemish29 notable casesedit pop music singer michael jackson revealed in an interview with oprah winfrey in february 1993 that he had vitiligo following his death in 2009 jacksons autopsy confirmed his claim and clarified that he specifically had vitiligo universalis32 canadian model chantelle brownyoung known by her stage name winnie harlow has a prominent form of vitiligo her participation in the americas next top model contest led to her being called a vitiligo spokesmodel33 p sathasivam who is the current governor of kerala in office since 2014 has vitiligo he previously served as the 40th chief justice of india from 2013 to 201434 former wbc interim middleweight boxing champion marco antonio rubio has vitiligo35 nfl assistant coach karl dunbar was diagnosed with the condition in the 7th grade36 michaela deprince a sierra leonean american ballet dancer is the only dancer of african origin in the dutch national ballet lived in a refugee camp as a child and was called devils child because of vitiligo37 bryan lloyd danielson an american retired professional wrestler best known for his tenure in wwe under the name daniel bryan stated on twitter that he has vitiligo38 scott jorgensen an american mixed martial arts fighter has publicly demonstrated all the stages of vitiligo from beginning to end39 michael jackson as photographed on the packaging of his 1979 album off the wall jackson in 1988 jackson in las vegas 2003 researchedit afamelanotide is in phase ii and iii clinical trials for vitiligo and other skin diseases40 a medication for rheumatoid arthritis tofacitinib has been tested for the treatment of vitiligo41 in october 1992 a scientific report was published of successfully transplanting melanocytes to vitiligo affected areas effectively repigmenting the region42 the procedure involved taking a thin layer of pigmented skin from the patients gluteal region melanocytes were then separated out to a cellular suspension that was expanded in culture the area to be treated was then denuded with a dermabrader and the melanocytes graft applied between 70 and 85 percent of patients experienced nearly complete repigmentation of their skin the longevity of the repigmentation differed from person to person43 by now several transplantation techniques have been developed including transplantation of melanocyte precursors derived from hair follicles transplantation procedures are frequently used to treat segmental vitiligo which is poorly responsive to other types of treatment in nonsegmental vitiligo success is achieved when treating patches that are not expanding so called stable vitiligo society and cultureedit the change in appearance caused by vitiligo can affect a persons emotional and psychological wellbeing and may create difficulty in getting or keeping a job people with this disorder can experience emotional stress particularly if vitiligo develops on visible areas of the body such as the face hands arms feet or on the genitals participating in a vitiligo support group may improve social coping skills and emotional fortitude see alsoedit albinism uniform absence of melanin alphos a noncontagious leprosy formerly referred to as vitiligo
