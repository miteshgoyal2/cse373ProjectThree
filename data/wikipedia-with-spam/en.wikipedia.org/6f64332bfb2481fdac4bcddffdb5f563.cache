served70 former police chief william j bratton made enlarging the department one of his top priorities bratton has been quoted as saying you give me 4000 more officers and ill give you the safest city in the world71 the los angeles police department has one officer for every 426 residents70 as a point of comparison new york city has one nypd officer for every 228 residents70 for los angeles to have the same ratio of officers to residents as new york city the lapd would need to have nearly 17000 officers further points of comparison include chicago which has a ratio of one officer per 216 citizens and philadelphia whose officer per citizen ratio is 1 to 21970 and the same ratio for londons metropolitan police is 1 to 15272 to make an international comparison in recent years the

join the cadet program a person must be between the ages of 13 and 21 meet certain academic requirements have no serious criminal record meet several other requirements and complete the cadet academy79 an lapd cadet conducting a hand cuffing drill the newer cadet program shifted focus from the old explorer program which tried to guide members to a career in law enforcement to a program that tries to give cadets a solid foundation in life and to help them prepare for whatever careers they choose by offering things like tutoring and college scholarships to different cadets in need of assistance80 the cadets complete courses not only on law enforcement but also on citizenship leadership financial literacy and other different skill sets80 cadets work different positions including ride alongs crowd control charity assistance working in stations and other tasks80 the cadet program has posts at all of the lapds regional divisions as well as specialized divisions including the metropolitan division and the communications division and as of 2014 there were 5000 cadets80 demographicsedit up to the gates administration the lapd was predominantly white 80 in 1980 and many officers had resided outside the city limits81 simi valley the ventura county suburb that later became infamous as the site of the state trial that immediately preceded the 1992 los angeles riots has long been home to a large concentration of lapd officers most of them white81 a 1994 aclu study of officers home zip codes concluded that over 80 of police officers resided outside the city limits81 hiring quotas began to change this during the 1980s but it was not until the christopher commission reforms that substantial numbers of black hispanic and asian officers began to be hired on to the force minority officers can be found in both rankandfile and leadership positions in virtually all divisions and the lapd is starting to reflect the general population the lapd was in 1910 to hire the first female police officer in the united states alice stebbins wells82 on the lapd through the early 1970s women were classified as policewomen83 through the 1950s their duties generally consisted as working as matrons in the jail system or dealing with troubled youths working in detective assignments83 rarely did they work any type of field assignment and they were not allowed to promote above the rank of sergeant83 a lawsuit by a policewoman fanchon blake from the 1980s instituted court ordered mandates that the department begin actively hiring and promoting women police officers in its ranks83 the department eliminated the rank of policeman from new hires at that time along with the rank of policewoman83 anyone already in those positions was grandfathered in but new hires were classified instead as police officers which continues to this day83 in 2002 women made up 189 of the force in 1886 the department hired its first two black officers robert william stewart and roy green7 the lapd was one of the first two police departments in the country to hire an africanamerican woman officer georgia ann robinson in 19198485 despite this the department was slow at integration during the 1965 watts riots only 5 of the 205 police assigned to south central los angeles were black despite the fact that it was the largest black community in los angeles los angeles first black mayor tom bradley was an expolice officer and quit the department after being unable to advance past the rank of lieutenant like other black police officers in the department when bradley was elected mayor in 1972 only 5 of lapd officers were black86 and there was only one black captain in the department homer broome broome would break down racial barriers on the force going on to become first black officer to obtain the rank of commander and the first black to command a police station the southwest division which included historically black neighborhoods of south central los angeles in

hispaniclatino 116 was african american 72 was asian 22 was filipino american and 08 indian and other ethnicities8889 languagesedit the lapd has grown over the years in the number of officers who speak languages in addition to english there were 483 bilingual or multilingual officers in 1974 and 1560 in 1998 and 2500 in 2001 that spoke at least one of 32 languages90 in 2001 a study was released that found that nonenglishspeaking callers to the 911 and nonemergency response lines often receive no language translation often receive incomplete information and sometimes receive rude responses from police employees90 the issue of a lack of multilingual officers led to reforms including bonuses and salary increases for officers who are certified in second languages90 currently over a third of lapd officers are certified in speaking one or more languages other than english91 the department also uses a device called the phraselator to translate and broadcast thousands of prerecorded phrases in a multitude of languages and is commonly used to broadcast messages in different languages from police vehicles91 work environment and payedit lapd officers during a march lapd patrol officers have a threeday 12hour and fourday 10hour work week schedule the department has over 250 types of job assignments and each officer is eligible for such assignments after two years on patrol lapd patrol officers almost always work with a partner unlike most suburban departments surrounding the city of los angeles which deploy officers in oneofficer units in order to maximize police presence and to allow a smaller number of officers to patrol a larger area lapd officers patrolling at the staples center the departments training division has three facilities throughout the city including elysian park ahmanson recruit training center westchester and the edward davis training center granada hills92 from spring 2007 through the spring of 2009 new recruits could earn money

their full salary on their first day of academy training95 in january 2010 the starting base salary for incoming police officers was lowered by 20 at the time if the applicant had graduated from high school their starting salary would be 45226 if they had at least 60 college units with an overall gpa of 20 or better their salary would start at 47043 and if the applicant had fully completed a college degree the salary would start at 48880 in 2014 after negotiations between the city and the police officers union reached an agreement on police officer pay that would give pay increases to nearly 1000 officers who joined the department since the salaries for incoming officers were cut96 the agreement also raised starting salaries for officers to 57420 with an additional increase to 60552 after 6 months which would become effective in the beginning of 201596 the agreement would also change the current overtime payment system from a deferred payment system which was implemented to cut costs to a payasyougo overtime system as well as increasing the overtime budget from 30 million to 70 million96 body camerasedit beginning in september 2013 the lapd started a trial program for the use of body worn cameras with 30 officers in the skid row area97 reports from the trial program indicated that the cameras functioned well and that they assisted in deescalating situations although there were some technical issues with the cameras along with slight issues with the cameras falling off of officers during movement9899 in november 2014 in a sign of body camera purchases to come the department chose taser international as the vendor for body cameras to be used by the lapd after their use in the trial program earlier in the year100101 on december 16 2014 mayor eric garcetti announced that the city would purchase 7000 body worn cameras from taser for use by the department102 patrol officers will be equipped with the cameras which will be purchased in the next fiscal year in order to outfit all patrol officers by the expected completion date in june 2016103 700 of the cameras will first be deployed to patrol officers in the central mission and newton patrol areas of the city beginning in january 2015103 155 million was raised from private donors to start the body camera program for the initial rollout phase in order to ease budget constraints for the city with another 1 million coming from the national institute of justice a branch of the department of justice103 in total the body cameras will most likely cost less than 10 million and will be included in garcettis proposed fiscal year 2016 budget104 before all of the cameras are deployed to patrol officers the police commission will create a policy that governs the use of the cameras and video footage while consulting with department and city officials along with outside organizations including other departments who already use body cameras104 while the commission has not created a policy yet as of december 2014 several guidelines were already outlined by the mayor including that officers would have to turn on the cameras whenever they arrest or detain someone for interrogation but many public interactions such as domestic violence interviews would not be recorded104 the cameras may also be turned off in situations where police use deadly force105 prior to the rollout of any body worn cameras officers were able to carry personally owned audio recording devices starting in 1994 if they file an application and obtain the requisite permission106 resourcesedit main article
