preservation of traditional values and beliefs hearkening back to values believed to be present at the american founding it focuses on a concern with moral and social values which proponents of the ideology see as degraded in modern society by social democracy and liberalism1 social conservatism while defined differently by many scholars is often conflated with the christian right religious conservatives push for a focus on judeochristian traditions as a guiding force for the country on social issues leading them to be considered social conservatives2 social conservatives are concerned with many social issues such as abortion sex education gun control the equal rights amendment school prayer samesex marriage and many others3 they oppose many of the cultural changes brought on by the culture wars and the sexual revolution summarily this branch of conservatism is concerned with moral and social issues within the united states and uses tradition strict morals and religion as solutions for these problems contents 1 views 11 accomodationism 12 abortion 13 samesex marriage 14 sex education 2 history 3 electoral politics 4 notable social conservative people and organizations 5 references viewsedit accomodationismedit social conservatives are accommodationists and hold that the establishment clause solely prevents the establishment of a state church not public acknowledgements of god nor developing policies that encourage general religious beliefs that do not favor a particular sect and are consistent with the secular governments goals45 abortionedit main article united states prolife movement social conservatives are generally prolife opposed to abortion on moral grounds these beliefs are often based on the argument of fetal personhood6 personhood arguments focus on giving a fetus the status of a person which then entitles them to the right to life7 social conservatives often support the repeal of roe v wade samesex marriageedit social conservatives are against the legalization of samesex marriage supporting instead laws such as the defense of marriage act doma which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman they oppose samesex marriage over concerns on parenting religious concerns concerns of continued changes to the definition of marriage and concerns about tradition8 conservatives are often opposed to homosexuality and therefore are concerned with normalizing homosexuality through the institution of marriage some republicans support samesex marriage equal rights and nondiscrimination laws these republicans are known as the log cabin republicans9 sex educationedit social conservatives concerned with the moral education and possibly ageinappropriate information children receive from sex education classes in public schools they prefer abstinenceonly sex education as opposed to comprehensive sex education9 this view stems from strong beliefs in parental authority and strict moral values historyedit 1960s this time period saw a surge in grassroots conservative activism in response to the successes of liberal politics in changing american culture democrats continued to put forward increasingly liberal policy ideas that ran counter to the beliefs of many conservative americans such as the new deal which mobilized them to protect their interests conservatives supported radical conservative candidates such as barry goldwater in the 1964 republican primary a rise of the radical right with social conservatives who believed in a strict moral code and religious authority10 1970s historians have pointed to the 1970s as a turning point where a vast shift toward social and political conservatism really began meg jacobs and julian zelizer argue that this period saw an increase an activism and concern with personal and social issues which lead to a growth of conservatism11 there are multiple theories on the growth of conservatism in this period some of the possible reasons or combination of reasons for this phenomenon are the backlash from the vietnam war the expanded conversation on civil rights the economic changes in the united states and the overall changes in culture in this period12 some scholars refer to social conservatism and renewed conservative grassroots activism as a reaction to the counterculture and cultural upheaval of the 1960s–1970s13 a notable event regarding social policy in the 1970s was the passage of roe v wade in 1973 which recognized a legal right to abortion14 1980s ronald reagan a prominent and wellsupported conservative republican exemplifies the rise of conservatives in mainstream politics reagan appealed to conservatives who felt marginalized by the growing liberalization of american culture calling on the forgotten man or moral majority1516 after the tumultuous period of political and cultural changes in the 1960s–70s reagans moderate traditionalism appeared as a source of needed stability for many americans17 1990s major conservative welfare reform took place in the 1990s in 1996 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act prwora was passed narrowing the benefits of welfare recipients and encouraging work temporary assistance for needy families tanf also came into effect during this period limiting the time benefits can be received18 2000s social conservatives again became powerful in american politics in 2001 with the election of socially conservative president george w bush it has been argued that many of bushs policy decisions were strongly influenced by his religious beliefs19 during his time in office bush would pass influential conservative social policies such as the defense of marriage act and support an increase in funding of abstinenceonly education20 while president bush did not strongly promote prolife policies he supported the movement through an emphasis on parental rights and focus on strict regulation of taxpayer funding21 electoral politicsedit in american politics the republican party is the largest political party with some socially conservative ideals incorporated into its platform social conservatives predominantly support the republican party although there are also socially conservative democrats who break ranks with the party platform despite this there have been instances where the republican partys nominee has been considered too socially progressive by social conservatives this has led to the support of third party candidates from parties such as the constitution party whose philosophies more closely parallel that of social conservatism22 while many social conservatives see third parties as a viable option in such a situation some highprofile social conservatives see the excessive support of them as dangerous this fear arises from the possibility of vote splitting23 social conservatives like any other interestgroup usually must find a balance between pragmatic electability and ideological principles when supporting candidates24 commentator randall hoven of the american thinker has remarked using the national journals ratings of senators in 2007 the correlation coefficient between economic scores and social scores is 90 that means they almost always go together financial conservatives are almost always social conservatives and vice versa25 the american tea party movement despite being mostly made up of stringent social conservatives is economically conservative but generally avoids social conservative issues26 the tea party patriots is officially neutral27 on social conservatism while social conservatism emphasizes faith and family as core values the tea party patriots identifies its core values as fiscal responsibility constitutionally limited government free markets28 some branches are opposed29 to social conservatism however independent polls have repeatedly shown that tea party supporters are nearly indistinguishable in their views from traditional republican social conservatives despite their choice to emphasize economic issues30313233 while not allying itself exclusively with the christian conservative movement34 members of the tea party movement identify with the christian conservative movement more strongly than the general american populace 4435 compared to 3436 of the population yet some social conservative leaders have denounced it for its libertarian and irreligious views37 nearly 80 of those in the tea party movement are members of the republican party38 notable social conservative people and organizationsedit people george
