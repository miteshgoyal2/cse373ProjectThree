july 2002 ashcroft proposed the creation of operation tips a domestic program in which workers and government employees would inform law enforcement agencies about suspicious behavior they encounter while performing their duties the program was widely criticized from the beginning with critics deriding the program as essentially a domestic informant network along the lines of the east german

of the ongoing war on terrorism but the proposal was eventually abandoned42 ashcroft proposed a draft of the domestic security enhancement act of 2003 legislation to expand the powers of the us

expressing the position that the second amendment expresses a right46 nra president sandra froman said when these bush administration officials affirmed that the second amendment protects an individual right the enemies of freedom were outraged because they fear the second amendment for what it really is– a shield against oppressioncitation needed in 2009 in ashcroft v alkidd the ninth circuit court of appeals in san francisco found that ashcroft could be sued and held personally responsible for the wrongful detention of abdullah alkidd the american citizen was arrested at dulles airport in march 2003 on his way to saudi arabia for study he was held for 15 days in maximum security in three states and 13 months in supervised release to be used as a material witness in the trial of sami omar alhussayen the latter was acquitted of all charges of supporting terrorism alkidd was never charged and was not called as a witness in the alhussayen case47 the panels court described the governments assertions under the usa patriot act 2001 as repugnant of the constitution in a detailed and at times passionate opinion judge milan smith likened allegations against alkidd as similar to the repressive practices of the british crown that sparked the american revolution he wrote that the government asserts it can detain american citizens not because there is evidence that they have committed a crime but merely because the government wishes to investigate them for possible wrongdoing48 he called it a painful reminder of some of the most ignominious chapters of our national history49 abdullah alkidd was held in a maximum security prison for 16 days and in supervised release for 13 months alkidd was born lavoni t kidd in 1973 in wichita kansas47 when he converted to islam

a terrorist and not allowed to consult an attorney alkidds lawyers say ashcroft as us attorney general encouraged authorities after 911 to arrest potential suspects as material witnesses when they lacked probable cause to believe the suspects had committed a crime50 the us supreme court agreed on october 18 2010 to hear the case on may 31 2011 the us supreme court unanimously overturned the lower courts decision saying that alkidd could not personally sue ashcroft as he was protected by limited immunity as a government official5152 a majority of the justices held that alkidd could not have won his case on the merits because ashcroft did not violate his fourth amendment rights53 ashcroft has been a proponent of the war on drugs54 in a 2001 interview on larry king live ashcroft
