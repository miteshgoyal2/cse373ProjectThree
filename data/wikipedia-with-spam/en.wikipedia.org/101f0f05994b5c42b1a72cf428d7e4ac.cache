united states by innercity african americans in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted4 it developed as part of hip hop culture a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements mcingrapping djingscratching with turntables break dancing and graffiti writing789 other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records or synthesized beats and sounds and rhythmic beatboxing while often used to refer solely to rapping hip hop more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture1011 the term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music412 though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture including djing turntablism scratching beatboxing and instrumental tracks1314 hip hop as both a musical genre and a culture was formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in new york city particularly among africanamerican youth residing in the bronx15 at block parties djs played percussive breaks of popular songs using two turntables and a dj mixer to be able to play breaks from two copies of the same record alternating from one to the other and extending the break16 hip hops early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum machines became widely available and affordable turntablist techniques such as scratching and beatmatching developed along with the breaks and jamaican toasting a chanting vocal style was used over the beats rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks or chants along rhythmically with an instrumental or synthesized beat notable artists at this time include dj kool herc grandmaster flash and the furious five fab five freddy marley marl afrika bambaataa kool moe dee kurtis blow doug e fresh whodini warp 9 the fat boys and spoonie gee the sugarhill gangs 1979 song rappers delight is widely regarded to be the first hip hop record to gain widespread popularity in the mainstream17 the 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles18 prior to the 1980s hip hop music was largely confined within the united states however during the 1980s it began to spread to music scenes in dozens of countries many of which mixed hip hop with local styles to create new subgenres new school hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music originating in 1983–84 with the early records of rundmc and ll cool j the golden age hip hop period was an innovative period between the mid1980s and the early 1990s notable artists from this era include the juice crew public enemy eric b rakim boogie down productions and krsone epmd slick rick beastie boys kool g rap big daddy kane ultramagnetic mcs de la soul and a tribe called quest gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that often focuses on the violent lifestyles and impoverished conditions of innercity africanamerican youth schoolly d nwa icet ice cube and the geto boys are key founding artists known for mixing the political and social commentary of political rap with the criminal elements and crime stories found in gangsta rap19 in the west coast hip hop style gfunk dominated mainstream hip hop for several years during the 1990s with artists such as dr dre and snoop dogg east coast hip hop in the early to mid 1990s was dominated by the afrocentric jazz rap and alternative hip hop of the native tongues posse as well as the hardcore rap of artists such as mobb deep wutang clan and onyx east coast hip hop also had gangsta rap musicians such as the notorious big and lil kim in the 1990s hip hop began to diversify with other regional styles emerging such as southern rap and atlanta hip hop at the same time hip hop continued to be assimilated into other genres of popular music examples being neo soul eg lauryn hill erykah badu and nu metal eg korn limp bizkit hip hop became a bestselling genre in the mid1990s and the top selling music genre by 1999 the popularity of hip hop music continued through the 2000s with hip hop influences also increasingly finding their way into mainstream pop the united states also saw the success of regional styles such as crunk eg lil jon the east side boys the ying yang twins a southern genre that emphasized the beats and music more than the lyrics starting in 2005 sales of hip hop music in the united states began to severely wane during the mid2000s alternative hip hop secured a place in the mainstream due in part to the crossover success of artists such as outkast and kanye west20 during the late 2000s and early 2010s rappers such as lil wayne soulja boy and bob were the most popular rappers during the 2010s rappers such as drake nicki

the furious five21 however lovebug starski keith cowboy and dj hollywood used the term when the music was still known as disco rap22 it is believed that cowboy created the term while teasing a friend who had just joined the us army by scat singing the words hiphophiphop in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of soldiers marching21 cowboy later worked the hip hop cadence into a part of his stage performance which was quickly used by other artists such as the sugarhill gang in rappers delight21 universal zulu nation founder afrika bambaataa is credited with first using the term to describe the subculture in which the music belonged although it is also suggested that it was a derogatory term to describe the type of music23 the first use of the term in print was in the village voice24 by steven hager later author of a 1984 history of hip hop25 1970s origins dj kool herc is recognized as one of the earliest hip hop djs and artists hip hop as music and culture formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in new york city particularly among africanamerican youth residing in the bronx15 block parties incorporated djs who played popular genres of music especially funk and soul music due to the positive reception djs began isolating the percussive breaks of popular songs this technique was then common in jamaican dub music26 and was largely introduced into new york by immigrants from jamaica and elsewhere in the caribbean including dj kool herc who has been called a founding father of hip hop2728 because the percussive breaks in funk soul and disco records were generally short herc and other djs began using two turntables to extend the breaks herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the jamaican tradition of impromptu toasting a spoken type of boastful poetry and speech over music29 on august 11 1973 dj kool herc was the dj at his sisters backtoschool party he extended the beat of a record by using two record players isolating the percussion breaks by using a mixer to switch between the two records hercs experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or scratching30 a second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing also called mcing or rapping emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes and wordplay delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat this spoken style was influenced by the african american style of capping a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners31 the basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps rival posses groups uptown throwdowns and political and social commentary—were all long present in african american music mcing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of toasting songs packed with a mix of boasting slackness and sexual innuendo and a more topical political socially conscious style the role of the mc originally was as a master of ceremonies for a dj dance event the mc would introduce the dj and try to pump up the audience the mc spoke between the djs songs urging everyone to get up and dance mcs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd eventually this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken rhythmic wordplay and rhyming which became rapping by 1979 hip hop music had become a mainstream genre it spread across the world in the 1990s with controversial gangsta rap32 herc also developed upon breakbeat deejaying33 where the breaks of funk songs—the part most suited to dance usually percussionbased—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of allnight dance parties this form of music playback using hard funk and rock formed the basis of hip hop music campbells announcements and exhortations to dancers would lead to the syncopated rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping he dubbed his dancers breakboys and breakgirls or simply bboys and bgirls according to herc breaking was also street slang for getting excited and acting energetically34 afrika bambaataa with dj yutaka of universal zulu nation in 2004 djs such as grand wizzard theodore grandmaster flash and jazzy jay refined and developed the use of breakbeats including cutting and scratching35 the approach used by herc was soon widely copied and by the late 1970s djs were releasing 12inch records where they would rap to the beat popular tunes included kurtis blows the breaks and the sugarhill gangs rappers delight36 herc and other djs would connect their equipment to power lines and perform at venues such as public basketball courts and at 1520 sedgwick avenue bronx new york now officially a historic building37 the equipment consisted of numerous speakers turntables and one or more microphones38 by using this technique djs could create a variety of music but according to rap attack by david toop at its worst the technique could turn the night into one endless and inevitably boring song39 kc the prince of soul a rapperlyricist with pete dj jones is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an mc40 street gangs were prevalent in the poverty of the south bronx and much of the graffiti rapping and bboying at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and oneupmanship of street gangs sensing that gang members often violent urges could be turned into creative ones afrika bambaataa founded the zulu nation a loose confederation of streetdance crews graffiti artists and rap musicians by the late 1970s the culture had gained media attention with billboard magazine printing an article titled b beats bombarding bronx commenting on the local phenomenon and mentioning influential figures such as kool herc41 the new york city blackout of 1977 saw widespread looting arson and other citywide disorders especially in the bronx42 where a number of looters stole dj equipment from electronics stores as a result the hip hop genre barely known outside of the bronx at the time grew at an astounding rate from 1977 onward43 dj kool hercs house parties gained popularity and later moved to outdoor venues in order to accommodate more people hosted in parks these outdoor parties became a means of expression and an outlet for teenagers where instead of getting into trouble on the streets teens now had a place to expend their pentup energy44 tony tone a member of the cold crush brothers stated that hip hop saved a lot of lives44 for innercity youth participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within america and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture mc kid lucky mentions that people used to breakdance against each other instead of fighting4546 inspired by dj kool herc afrika bambaataa created a street organization called universal zulu nation centered around hip hop as a means to draw teenagers out of gang life drugs and violence44 the lyrical content of many early rap groups focused on social issues most notably in the seminal track the message by grandmaster flash and the furious five which discussed the realities of life in the housing projects47 young black americans coming out of the civil rights movement have used hip hop culture in the 1980s and 1990s to show the limitations of the hip hop movement48 hip hop gave young african americans a voice to let their issues be heard like rockandroll hip hop is vigorously opposed by conservatives because it romanticises violence lawbreaking and gangs48 it also gave people a chance for financial gain by reducing the rest of the world to consumers of its social concerns48 in late 1979 debbie harry of blondie took nile rodgers of chic to such an event as the main backing track used was the break from chics good times36 the new style influenced harry and blondies later hit single from 1981 rapture became the first major single containing hip hop elements by a white group or artist to hit number one on the us billboard hot 100—the song itself is usually considered new wave and fuses heavy pop music elements but there is an extended rap by harry near the end 1520 sedgwick avenue the bronx a venue used by kool herc that is often considered the birthplace of hip hop in 197349 hip hops early evolution into a form distinct from rb also not coincidentally occurred around the time that sampling technology and drummachines became widely available to the general public at a cost that was affordable to the average consumer—not just professional studios drummachines and samplers were combined in machines that came to be known as mpcs or music production centers early examples of which would include the linn 9000 the first sampler that was broadly adopted to create this new kind of music was the mellotron used in combination with the tr808 drum machine mellotrons and linns were succeeded by the akai in the late 1980s50 turntablist techniques – such as rhythmic scratching pushing a record back and forth while the needle is in the groove to create new sounds and sound effects an approach attributed to grand wizzard theodore5152 beat mixing andor beatmatching and beat juggling – eventually developed along with the percussion breaks creating a musical accompaniment or base that could be rapped over in a manner similar to signifying as well the art of jamaican toasting a style of talking or chanting into a microphone often in a boastful style while beats play over a sound system was an important influence on the development of hip hop music toasting is another influence found in jamaican dub music2653 boxer muhammad ali as an influential africanamerican celebrity was widely covered in the media ali influenced several elements of hip hop music both in the boxing ring and in media interviews ali became known in the 1960s for being rhyming trickster in the 1960s ali used a funky delivery for his comments which included boasts comical trash talk and the endless quotable lines54 according to rolling stone his freestyle skills a reference to a type of vocal improvisation in which lyrics are recited with no particular subject or structure and his rhymes flow and braggadocio would one day become typical of old school mcs like run–dmc and ll cool j55 the latter citing ali as an influence54 hip hop music in its infancy has been described as an outlet and a voice for the disenfranchised youth of lowincome and marginalized economic areas56 as the hip hop culture reflected the social economic and political realities of their lives57 introduction of rapping rapping also referred to as mcing or emceeing is a vocal style in which the artist speaks lyrically and rhythmically in rhyme and verse generally to an instrumental or synthesized beat beats almost always in 44 time signature can be created by sampling andor sequencing portions of other songs by a producer58 they also incorporate synthesizers drum machines and live bands rappers may write memorize or improvise their lyrics and perform their works a cappella or to a beat hip hop music predates the introduction of rapping into hip hop culture and rap vocals are absent from many hip hop tracks such as hip hop be bop dont stop by man parrish chinese arithmetic by eric b rakim alnaafiysh the soul and were rocking the planet by hashim and destination earth by newcleus however the majority of the genre has been accompanied by rap vocals such as the scifi influenced electro hip hop group warp 959 female rappers appeared on the scene in the late 1970s and early 80s including bronx artist mc sha rock member of the funky four plus one credited with being the first female mc 60 and the sequence a hip hop trio signed to sugar hill records the first all female group to release a rap record funk you upcitation needed the roots of rapping are found in africanamerican music and ultimately african music particularly that of the griots of west african culture61 the africanamerican traditions of signifyin the dozens and jazz poetry all influence hip hop music as well as the call and response patterns of african and africanamerican religious ceremonies soul singer james brown and musical comedy acts such as rudy ray moore pigmeat markham and blowfly are often considered godfathers of hip hop musiccitation needed within new york city performances of spokenword poetry and music by artists such as the last poets gil scottheron62 and jalal mansur nuriddin had a significant impact on the postcivil rights era culture of the 1960s and 1970s and thus the social environment in which hip hop music was created dj kool herc and coke la rock provided an influence on the vocal style of rapping by delivering simple poetry verses over funk music breaks after partygoers showed little interest in their previous attempts to integrate reggaeinfused toasting into musical sets2663 djs and mcs would often add call and response chants often consisting of a basic chorus to allow the performer to gather his thoughts eg one two three yall to the beat later the mcs grew more varied in their vocal and rhythmic delivery incorporating brief rhymes often with a sexual or scatological theme in an effort to differentiate themselves and to entertain the audience these early raps incorporated the dozens a product of africanamerican culture kool herc the herculoids were the first hip hop group to gain recognition in new york63 but the number of mc teams increased over time grandmaster flash often these were collaborations between former gangs such as afrikaa bambaataas universal zulu nation—now an international organization melle mel a rapper with the furious five is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an mc64 during the early 1970s bboying arose during block parties as bboys and bgirls got in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive and frenetic style the style was documented for release to a worldwide audience for the first time in documentaries and movies such as style wars wild style and beat street the term bboy was coined by dj kool herc to describe the people who would wait for the break section of the song getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive frenetic style65 although there were many early mcs that recorded solo projects of note such as dj hollywood kurtis blow and spoonie gee the frequency of solo artists did not increase until later with the rise of soloists with stage presence and drama such as ll cool j most early hip hop was dominated by groups where collaboration between the members was integral to the show66 an example would be the early hip hop group funky four plus one who performed in such a manner on saturday night live in 198167 influence of disco the sugarhill gang used disco band chics good times as the source of beats for their 1979 hip hop hit rappers delight pictured is chic at a 2012 concert hip hop music was both influenced by disco music as disco also emphasized the key role of the dj in creating tracks and mixes for dancers as well hip hop from the late 1970s used disco tracks as beats at the same time hip hop music was also a backlash against certain subgenres of late 1970s disco while the early disco was africanamerican and italianamericancreated underground music developed by djs and producers for the dance club subculture by the late 1970s disco airwaves were dominated by mainstream expensively recorded music industryproduced disco songs according to kurtis blow the early days of hip hop were characterized by divisions between fans and detractors of disco music hip hop had largely emerged as a direct response to the watered down europeanised disco music that permeated the airwaves6869 the earliest hip hop was mainly based on hard funk loops sourced from vintage funk records however by 1979 disco instrumental loopstracks had become the basis of much hip hop music this genre was called disco rap ironically the rise of hip hop music also played a role in the eventual decline in discos popularity the disco sound had a strong influence on early hip hop music most of the early raphiphop songs were created by isolating existing disco bassguitar bass lines and dubbing over them with mc rhymes the sugarhill gang used chics good times as the foundation for their 1979 hit rappers delight generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the united states and around the world in 1982 afrika bambaataa released the single planet rock which incorporated electronica elements from kraftwerks transeurope express and numbers as well as ymos riot in lagos the planet rock sound also spawned a hiphop electronic dance trend electro music which included songs such as planet patrols play at your own risk 1982 c banks one more shot 1982 cerrones club underworld 1984 shannons let the music play 1983 freeezs iou 1983 midnight stars freakazoid 1983 chaka khans i feel for you 1984 dj pete jones eddie cheeba dj hollywood and love bug starski were discoinfluenced hip hop djs their styles differed from other hip hop musicians who focused on rapidfire rhymes and more complex rhythmic schemes afrika bambaataa paul winley grandmaster flash and bobby robinson were all members of third s latter group in washington dc gogo emerged as a reaction against disco and eventually incorporated characteristics of hip hop during the early 1980s the djbased genre of electronic music behaved similarly eventually evolving into underground styles known as house music in chicago and techno in detroit transition to recording dj marley marl the earliest hip hop music was performed live at house parties and block party events and it was not recorded prior to 1979 recorded hip hop music consisted mainly of pa system soundboard recordings of live party shows and early hip hop mixtapes by djs puerto rican dj disco wiz is credited as the first hip hop dj to create a mixed plate or mixed dub recording when in 1977 he combined sound bites special effects and paused beats to technically produce a sound recording70 the first hip hop record is widely regarded to be the sugarhill gangs rappers delight from 197917 however much controversy surrounds this assertion as some regard king tim iii personality jock by the fatback band which was released a few weeks before rappers delight as a rap record71 there are various other claimants for the title of first hip hop record by the early 1980s all the major elements and techniques of the hip hop genre were in place and by 1982 the electronic electro sound had become the trend on the street and in dance clubs new york city radio station wktu featured warp 9s nunk in a commercial to promote the stations signature sound of emerging hip hop 72 though not yet mainstream hip hop had begun to permeate the music scene outside of new york city it could be found in cities as diverse as atlanta los angeles chicago washington dc baltimore dallas kansas city san antonio miami seattle st louis new orleans houston and toronto indeed funk you up 1979 the first hip hop record released by a female group and the second single released by sugar hill records was performed by the sequence a group from columbia south carolina which featured angie stone73 despite the genres growing popularity philadelphia was for many years the only city whose contributions could be compared to new york citys hip hop music became popular in philadelphia in the late 1970s the first released record was titled rhythm talk by jocko henderson the new york times had dubbed philadelphia the graffiti capital of the world in 1971 philadelphia native dj lady b recorded to the beat yall in 1979 and became the first female solo hip hop artist to record music74 schoolly d starting in 1984 and also from philadelphia began creating a style that would later be known as gangsta rap 1980s dj jazzy jeff who is also a record producer manipulating a record turntable in england in 2005 the 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles18 new york city became a veritable laboratory for the creation of new hip hop sounds early examples of the diversification process can be heard in tracks such as grandmaster flashs the adventures of grandmaster flash on the wheels of steel 1981 a single consisting entirely of sampled tracks75 as well as afrika bambaataas planet rock 1982 and warp 9s nunk 198276 which signified the fusion of hip hop music with electro in addition rammellzee krobs beat bop 1983 was a slow jam which had a dub influence with its use of reverb and echo as texture and playful sound effects light years away by warp 9 1983 produced and written by lotti golden and richard scher described as a cornerstone of early 80s beatbox afrofuturism by the uk paper the guardian59 introduced social commentary from a scifi perspective in the 1970s hip hop music typically used samples from funk and later from disco the mid1980s marked a paradigm shift in the development of hip hop with the introduction of samples from rock music as demonstrated in the albums king of rock and licensed to ill hip hop prior to this shift is characterized as oldschool hip hop the roland tr808 rhythm composer an influential drum machine in hip hop music often nicknamed the 808 it was produced from 1980 to 1984 even in the 2010s hip hop producers still use 808 samples the proliferation of electro hip hop and hip hop records in the early 1980s can be attributed to the new beatmaking abilities that the newlyavailable roland tr808 drum machine provided to beatmakers and producers hitting the market in 1980 it became the drum machine of choice because of its affordability and the unique character of its analog synthesized drum sounds especially its bass drum sound which had a deep solid sound in club pa systems77 the new generation of drum machines such as the 808 and oberheim dmx were a defining characteristic of many 1980s songs allowing record companies to quickly produce new electro and electro hip hop records to meet the high demand on the street even in the 2010s the 808 kick drum sound is used by hip hop producers over time sampling technology became more advanced however earlier producers such as marley marl used drum machines to construct their beats from small excerpts of other beats in synchronisation in his case triggering three korg samplingdelay units through a roland 808 later samplers such as the emu sp1200 allowed not only more memory but more flexibility for creative production this allowed the filtration and layering different hits and with a possibility of resequencing them into a single piece with the emergence of a new generation of samplers such as the akai s900 in the late 1980s producers did not have to create complex timeconsuming tape loops public enemys first album was created with the help of large tape loops the process of looping a break into a breakbeat now became more commonly done with a sampler now doing the job which so far had been done manually by the djs using turntables in 1989 dj mark james under the moniker 45 king released the 900 number a breakbeat track created by synchronizing samplers and vinyl records66 the lyrical content and other instrumental accompaniment of hip hop developed as well the early lyrical styles in the 1970 which tended to be boasts and clichéd chants were replaced with metaphorical lyrics exploring a wider range of subjects as well the lyrics were performed over more complex multilayered instrumental accompaniment artists such as melle mel rakim chuck d krsone and warp 9 revolutionized hip hop by transforming it into a more mature art form with sophisticated arrangements often featuring gorgeous textures and multiple layers78 the influential single the message 1982 by grandmaster flash and the furious five is widely considered to be the pioneering force for conscious rap independent record labels like tommy boy prism records and profile records became successful in the early 1980s releasing records at a furious pace in response to the demand generated by local radio stations and club djs early 1980s electro music

of the 1980s by groups like nwa icet released 6 in the mornin which is often regarded as the first gangsta rap song in 1986 after the national attention and controversy that icet and nwa created in

matter inherent in gangsta rap more generally has caused controversy the white house administrations of both george bush senior and bill clinton criticized the genre95 the reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of american culture what started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in american politics the problem here is that the white house and wannabes like bill clinton represent a political system that never intends to deal with inner city urban chaos sister

disco—and that image stuck for years occasional records—including grandmaster flashs the message in 1982 and rundmcs its like that in 1984—won critical approval but rap mostly was dismissed as a passing fancy—too repetitious too one dimensional yet rap didnt go away and an explosion of energy and imagination in the late 1980s leaves rap today as arguably the most vital new streetoriented
