main article basketball association of america the basketball association of america was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the northeastern and midwestern united states and canada on november 1 1946 in toronto ontario canada the toronto huskies hosted the new york knickerbockers at maple leaf gardens in a game the nba now refers to as the first played game in nba history6 the first basket was made by ossie schectman of the knickerbockers although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues including the american basketball league and the nbl the baa was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities during its early years the quality of play in the baa was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the harlem globetrotters for instance the 1948 abl finalist baltimore bullets moved to the baa and won that leagues 1948 title and the 1948 nbl champion minneapolis lakers won the 1949 baa title prior to the 1948–49 season however nbl teams from fort wayne indianapolis minneapolis and rochester jumped to the baa which established the baa as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional7 on august 3 1949 the baa absorbed the remainder of the nbl syracuse anderson tricities sheboygan denver and waterloo in deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications the league name was changed from the baa to the national basketball association in spite of having the same baa governing body including podoloff7 the new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities8 as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories in 1950 the nba consolidated to eleven franchises a process that continued until 1953–54 when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises the new york knicks boston celtics philadelphia warriors minneapolis lakers rochester royals fort wayne pistons tricities blackhawks and syracuse nationals all of which remain in the league today the process of contraction saw the leagues smallercity franchises move to larger cities the hawks shifted from the tricities to milwaukee in 1951 and then to st louis in 1955 the rochester royals moved from rochester new york to cincinnati in 1957 and the pistons relocated from fort wayne indiana to detroit in 1957 japaneseamerican wataru misaka broke the nba color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the new york knicks he remained the only nonwhite player in league history prior to the first africanamerican harold hunter signing with the washington capitols in 1950910 hunter was cut from the team during training camp911 but several africanamerican players did play in the league later that year including chuck cooper with the celtics nathaniel sweetwater clifton with the knicks and earl lloyd with the washington capitols during this period the minneapolis lakers led by center george mikan won five nba championships and established themselves as the leagues first dynasty12 to encourage shooting and discourage stalling the league introduced the 24second shot clock in 195413 if a team does not attempt to score a field goal or the ball fails to make contact with the rim within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent celtics dominance league expansion and competition in 1957 rookie center bill russell joined the boston celtics which already featured guard bob cousy and coach red auerbach and went on to lead the club to eleven nba titles in thirteen seasons center wilt chamberlain entered the league with the warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s setting new single game records in scoring 100 and rebounding 55 russells rivalry with chamberlain became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of american team sports bill russell defending against wilt chamberlain in 1966 the 1960s were dominated by the celtics led by russell bob cousy and coach red auerbach boston won eight straight championships in the nba from 1959 to 1966 this championship streak is the longest in nba history they did not win the title in 1966–67 but regained it in the 1967–68 season and repeated in 1969 the domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s14 through this period the nba continued to evolve with the shift of the minneapolis lakers to los angeles the philadelphia warriors to san francisco the syracuse nationals to philadelphia to become the philadelphia 76ers and the st louis hawks moving to atlanta as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises the chicago packers now washington wizards became the ninth nba team in 1961 from 1966 to 1968 the

suns in 1967 the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the american basketball association aba the leagues engaged in a bidding war the nba landed the most important college star of the era kareem abduljabbar then known as lew alcindor however the nbas leading scorer rick barry jumped to the aba as did four veteran referees—norm drucker earl strom john vanak and joe gushue15 in 1969 alan siegel who oversaw the design of jerry diors major league baseball logo a year prior created the modern nba logo inspired by the mlbs it incorporates the silhouette of the legendary jerry west based on a photo by wen roberts although nba officials denied a particular player as being its influence because according to siegel they want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it its become such a ubiquitous classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they dont necessarily want to identify it with one player the iconic logo debuted in 1971 and would remain a fixture of the nba brand1617 the aba succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s including julius erving of the virginia squires in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates the nba expanded rapidly during this period one purpose being to tie up the most viable cities from 1966 to 1974 the nba grew from nine franchises to 18 in 1970 the portland trail blazers cleveland cavaliers and buffalo braves now the los angeles clippers all made their debuts expanding the league to 1718 the new orleans jazz now in utah came aboard in 1974

that time to 22 the franchises added were the san antonio spurs denver nuggets indiana pacers and new york nets now the brooklyn nets some of the biggest stars of this era were kareem abduljabbar rick barry dave cowens julius erving elvin hayes walt frazier moses malone artis gilmore george gervin dan issel and pete maravich the end of the decade however saw declining tv ratings low attendance and

finals between the los angeles lakers and sacramento kings although the refs increased the lakers chances of winning through foul calls during the game there was no collusion to fix the game on

league in 2004 regular season following the summer break teams begin training camps in late september training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players especially rookies scout the teams strengths and weaknesses prepare the players for the rigorous regular season and determine the 12man active roster and a 3man inactive list with which they will begin the regular season teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the nba g league after training camp a series of preseason exhibition games are held preseason matches are sometimes held in nonnba cities both in the united states and overseas the nba regular season begins in the last week of october during the regular season each team plays 82 games 41 each home and away a team faces opponents in its own division four times a year 16 games each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times 24 games and the remaining four teams three times 12 games finally each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece 30 games this asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams but not as significantly as the nfl or mlb over five seasons each team will have played 80 games against their division 20 games against each opponent 10 at home 10 on the road 180 games against the rest of their conference 18 games against each opponent 9 at home 9 on the road and 150 games against the other conference 10 games against each team 5 at home 5 on the road the nba is one of only two of the four major professional sports leagues in the united states and canada in which teams play every other team during the regular season the other being the national hockey league each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season from 2005 to 2008 the nba had the distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other team the nba is also the only league that regularly schedules games on christmas day51 the league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 194752 though the first christmas day games were not televised until 1983–8453 games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players515253 christmas is also notable for nba on television as the holiday is when the first nba games air on network television each season5253 games played on this day have been some of the highestrated games during a particular season in february the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual nba allstar game fans vote throughout the united states canada and on the internet and the top votegetters at each position in each conference are given a starting spot on their conferences allstar team coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 allstars then eastern conference players face the western conference players in the allstar game the player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a game mvp award other attractions of the allstar break include the rising stars challenge originally rookie challenge where the top rookies and secondyear players in the nba play in a 5on5 basketball game with the current format pitting us players against those from the rest of the world the skills challenge where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting passing and dribbling in the fastest time the three point contest where players compete to score the most amount of threepoint field goals in a given time and the nba slam dunk contest where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges these other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights shortly after the allstar break is the trade deadline which is set to fall on the 16th thursday of the season usually in february at 3pm eastern time54 after this date teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season although they may still sign and release players major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline making that day a hectic time for general managers around the middle of april the regular season ends it is during this time that voting begins for individual awards as well as the selection of the honorary leaguewide postseason teams the sixth man of the year award is given to the best player coming off the bench must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started the rookie of the year award is awarded to the most outstanding firstyear player the most improved player award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season the defensive player of the year award is awarded to the leagues best defender the coach of the year award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team the most valuable player award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for his team that season additionally sporting news awards an unofficial but widely recognized executive of the year award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise the postseason teams are the allnba team the alldefensive team and the allrookie team each consists of five players there are three allnba teams consisting of the top players at each position with firstteam status being the most desirable there are two alldefensive teams consisting of the top defenders at each position there are also two allrookie teams consisting of the top firstyear players regardless of position playoffs main article nba playoffs the nba playoffs begin in late april with the top eight teams in each conference regardless of divisional alignment competing for the championship seeds are awarded in strict order of regularseason record with a tiebreaker system used as needed having a higher seed offers several advantages since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed the second seed plays the seventh seed the third seed plays the sixth seed and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round the team in each series with the better record has home court advantage including the first round before the league changed its playoff determination format for the 2006–07 season this meant that for example if the team that received the 6 seed had a better record than the team with the 3 seed by virtue of a divisional championship the 6 seed would have home court advantage even though the other team had a higher seed therefore the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage in every series it plays for example in 2006 the denver nuggets won 44 games and captured the northwest division and the 3 seed their opponent was the 6 seed los angeles clippers who won 47 games and finished second in the pacific division although denver won its much weaker division the clippers had homecourt advantage and won the series in 5 the playoffs follow a tournament format each team plays an opponent in a bestofseven series with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs in the next round the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference all but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs since the nba does not reseed teams the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design with the winner of the series matching the 1st and 8th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 4th and 5th seeded teams and the winner of the series matching the 2nd and 7th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 3rd and 6th seeded teams in every round the bestof7 series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 homecourt pattern meaning that one team will have home court in games 1 2 5 and 7 while the other plays at home in games 3 4 and 6 from 1985 to 2013 the nba finals followed a 2–3–2 pattern meaning that one team had home court in games 1 2 6 and 7 while the other played at home in games 3 4 and 555 the final playoff round a bestofseven series between the victors of both conferences is known as the nba finals and is held annually in june the victor in the nba finals wins the larry obrien championship trophy each player and major contributor—including coaches and the general manager—on the winning team receive a championship ring in addition the league awards the bill russell nba finals most valuable player award to the best performing player of the series on august 2 2006 the nba announced a new playoff format the new format took the three division winners and the secondplace team with the best record in each conference and ranked them 1–4 by record the other slots in each conference were filled by the four remaining teams with the best records56 previously the top three seeds went to the division winners the league began using its current format with the top eight teams in each conference advancing regardless of divisional alignment in the 2015–16 season57 league championships main article list of nba champions the boston celtics have won the most championships with 17 nba finals wins the second most
