the most produced airliner in history first flying in 1936 it remains in active service today pictured on its maiden voyage in 1967 the boeing 737 is the most produced jet airliner in history an airliner is a type of aircraft for transporting passengers and air cargo such aircraft are most often operated by airlines although the definition of an airliner can vary from country to country an airliner is typically defined as an aircraft intended for carrying multiple passengers or cargo in commercial service the largest airliners are widebody jets these aircraft are frequently called twinaisle aircraft because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin these aircraft are usually used for longhaul flights between airline hubs and major cities with many passengers a smaller more common class of airliners is the narrowbody or single aisle aircraft these smaller airliners are generally used for short to mediumdistance flights with fewer passengers than their widebody counterparts regional airliners typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by turbofans or turboprops these airliners are the nonmainline counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers legacy carriers and flag carriers and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs these regional routes then form the spokes

wright brothers made the world’s first sustained heavierthanair flight they laid the foundation for what would become a major transport industry their flight in 1903 was just 11 years before what is often defined as the world’s first airliner1 these airliners would have a significant impact on global society economics and politics2 sikorsky ilya muromets while in use as a bomber by russia if an airliner is defined as an aircraft intended for carrying multiple passengers in commercial service the russian sikorsky ilya muromets was the first aircraft meeting that definitioncitation needed the ilya muromets was a luxurious aircraft with a separate passenger saloon wicker chairs bedroom lounge and a toilet the aircraft also had heating and electrical lighting the ilya muromets first flew on december 10 1913 on february 25 1914 it took off for its first demonstration flight with 16 passengers aboard from june 21 – june 23 it made a roundtrip from saint petersburg to kiev in 14 hours and 38 minutes with one intermediate landing however it was never used as a commercial airliner due to the onset of world war i in 1915 the very first airliner for commercial use was used by elliot air service the aircraft was a curtiss jn 4 a small biplane which was used mainly in world war i as a trainer later it was also used as a tour and familiarization flight aircraft in the early 1920s in 1919 after world war i the farman f60 goliath originally designed as a longrange heavy bomber was converted for commercial use into a passenger airliner it could seat 14 passengers from 1919 and approximately 60 were built initially several publicity flights were made including one on 8 february 1919 when the goliath flew 12 passengers from toussuslenoble to raf kenley near croydon despite having no permission from the british authorities to land another important airliner built in 1919 was the airco dh16 a redesigned airco dh9a with a wider fuselage to accommodate an enclosed cabin seating four passengers plus pilot in an open cockpit in march 1919 the prototype first flew at hendon aerodrome nine aircraft were built all but one being delivered to the nascent airline aircraft transport travel limited att att used the first aircraft for pleasure flying and on 25 august 1919 it inaugurated the first scheduled international airline service from london to paris3 one aircraft was sold to the river plate aviation company in argentina to operate a crossriver service between buenos aires and montevideo3 meanwhile the competing vickers converted its successful ww1 bomber the vickers vimy into a civilian version the vimy commercial it was redesigned with a larger diameter fuselage largely of spruce plywood and first flew from the joyce green airfield in kent on 13 april 191945 the worlds first allmetal transport aircraft was the junkers f13 also from 1919 with 322 built the dutch fokker company produced the fokker fii followed by its development the fiii these aircraft were used by the dutch airline klm when it reopened an amsterdamlondon service in 1921 the fokkers were soon flying to destinations across europe including bremen brussels hamburg and paris they proved to be very reliable aircraft the handley page company in britain produced the handley page type w as the companys first civil transport aircraft it housed two crew in an open cockpit and 15 passengers in an enclosed cabin powered by two 450 hp 340 kw napier lion engines the prototype first flew on 4 december 1919 shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 paris air show at le bourget it was the worlds first airliner to be designed with an onboard lavatory meanwhile in france the bleriotspad s33 was a great success throughout the 1920s initially serving the parislondon route and later on continental routes the enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit by 1921 it was becoming apparent that aircraft capacity needed to be larger for the economics to remain favourable the english company de havilland therefore built the tenpassenger dh29 monoplane while starting work on the design of the dh32 an eightseater biplane with a less powerful but more economical rollsroyce eagle engine owing to the urgent need for more capacity however work on the dh32 was stopped and the dh34 biplane was designed accommodating ten passengers the fokker trimotor was an important and popular transport manufactured under license in europe and america throughout the 1920s companies in britain and france were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry6 often considerably aided by government subsidies in america the ford trimotor was an important early airliner with two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose and a slabsided body it carried eight passengers and was produced from 1925 to 1933 it was used by the predecessor to trans world airlines and by other airlines long after production ceased pan am opened up transoceanic service in the late 1920s and early 30s based on a series of large seaplanes – the sikorsky s38 through sikorsky s42 by the 1930s the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe including imperial airways in britain lufthansa in germany klm in the netherlands and united airlines in america multiengined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort7 in britain the de havilland dragon was a successful aircraft during the 1930s its simple design used a plywood box fuselage it could carry six passengers each with 45 pounds 20 kg of luggage on the londonparis route on a fuel consumption of just 13 gal 49 l per hour the wing panels outboard of the engines could be folded for storage the type was attractive as a shorthaul low capacity airliner and was soon in service worldwide british production of the dh84 ended when it was replaced on the assembly line by the more powerful and elegant de havilland dragon rapide the first modernlooking sleek metal airliners also came into service in the 1930s in the united states the boeing 247 and the 14passenger douglas dc2 flew and in 1935 the more powerful faster 21–32 passenger douglas dc3 appeared dc3s were produced in quantity for world war ii and sold as surplus afterward the douglas dc3 was a particularly important airplane because it was the first airliner to be profitable without a government subsidy8 longhaul flights were expanded during the 1930s as both pan american airways and imperial airways competed in the provision of transatlantic travel using flying boats such as the british short empire and the american boeing 314 this prefigured the dramatic growth of transatlantic travel in the postwar period the postwar jet ageedit main article jet airliner united kingdomedit prototype of the de havilland comet in 1949 the first jet airliner in the world in the united kingdom the brabazon committee was formed in 1942 under john moorebrabazon 1st baron brabazon of tara to investigate the future needs of the british empires civilian airliner market the study was an attempt at defining in broad overview the impact of projected advances in aviation technology and to forecast the global needs of the post war british empire in south asia africa the near and far east and commonwealth australia canada new zealand in the area of air transport for passengers mail and cargo the crucial problem that the planners faced was that an agreement had been reached between the united states and the united kingdom in 1942 to split responsibility for building multiengine aircraft types for british use the us would concentrate on transport aircraft while the uk would concentrate on their heavy bombers this decision meant that the united kingdom would be left at the close of the war with little experience in the design manufacture and final assembly of transport aircraft the final report called for the construction of four general designs studied by the committee and members of the stateowned airlines british overseas airways corporation boac and later british european airways bea the first three designs were pistonpowered aircraft of varying sizes for different markets while the type iv design at the urging of geoffrey de havilland whose company was involved in development the first jet fighters was for a jetpowered 100seat design the type i design after a brief contest was given to the bristol aeroplane company building on submissions they had made during the war for a 100 ton bomber this evolved into the creation of the bristol brabazon the type ii process was complicated by the proposition of vickers that there should be a move to the newly developed turboprop power the specification was therefore split in two with the conventional piston design going to the eventual de havilland dove and airspeed ambassador the revolutionary vc2 viceroy first flown in 1948 was the first turboprop design anywhere the type iii requirement was developed as the avro tudor the type iv for the jetpowered aircraft went to de havilland and became in 1949 the worlds first jet airliner the comet it featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de havilland ghost turbojet engines buried in the wings a pressurised fuselage and large square windows for the era it offered a relatively quiet comfortable passenger cabin and showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut however a year after entering commercial service the comets began suffering problems with three of them breaking up during midflight in wellpublicised accidents this was later found to be due to catastrophic metal fatigue not well understood at the time in the airframes the comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the cause rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the comet while developing their own aircraft although sales never fully recovered the improved comet 2 and the prototype comet 3 culminated in the redesigned comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career of over 30 years this disaster coupled with the fact that the uks domestic market was much smaller than the uss meant that by the 1960s it was increasingly clear that the uk had lost the airliner market to the us and later designs like the bac 111 vickers vc10 and hawker siddeley trident although successful would be unable to win a substantial part of it back again another committee was formed to consider supersonic designs stac and worked with bristol to create the bristol 223 design for a 100passenger transatlantic airliner however this was going to be so expensive to produce that the effort was later merged with similar efforts in france to create the first supersonic airliner—the concorde910 united statesedit the united states conversely gained a huge advantage in design and production in the airline industry in the years leading up to the war but many of the developments would be put off until after the war as the manufacturing efforts were placed on the war effort the advancements that the united states would make in this industry were in large part due to the cooperation of the airlines discussing what they desired with the airliner manufacturers united airlines dc6 stapleton airport denver september 1966 soon after the war though douglas made a large advancement with the dc4 although this could not cross the atlantic at every point it was able to make a nonstop flight from new york to the united kingdom due to the war going on the first batch of these planes went to the us army and air forces and was named the c54 skymaster some of these that were used in the war would later be converted for the airline industry along with the passenger and cargo versions that were placed on the market once the war ended douglas would later develop a version of this plane that was pressurized and five feet longer this redesigned plane would become the dc6 these dc6s would be grounded for six months to rectify a few safety issues that were causing inflight fires soon after the dc4 lockheed developed the distinctive tripletail constellation an aviation breakthrough it was the first commercially successful pressurized airliner allowing it to fly higher than other airliners its fuselage was some 127 inches wider than the dc4s drafted by the military in world war ii it experienced a similar late entry into the civilian airline industry safety concerns grounded it for six months soon after it entered service while problems were investigated and repaired in 1947 the boeing 377 stratocruiser entered the industry with a completely different design than douglas and lockheed aircraft based on the c97 stratofreighter military transport it had a double deck and pressurized fuselage luxury and a 100passenger capacity distinguished it from its rivals while 900 c97s were supplied to the military only 55 were produced for civil aviation the american companies had done a great job of advancing the status of transcontinental travel but there was also the aging fleet of dc3s that had to be addressed convair decided that they were going to address this market and would begin producing the convair 240 which was a 40person fully pressurized plane there were 566 of these planes that would fly including two that were equipped with jetassisted take off units convair would later develop the convair 340 which was slightly larger and could accommodate between 44 and 52 passengers and 311 of this model plane were produced finally convair would create a convair 440 which had small modifications including much better soundproofing than the previous models convair would experience a little bit of competition from the martin 202 and martin 404 but in general convair was able to control this market as the 202 had safety concerns and was unpressurized and the 404 only sold around 100 units9 the united states was dominant in this industry for several reasons including a large domestic market for these planes the market would also work in the united states favor as the american companies began to build pressurized airliners during the postwar years engines became much larger and more powerful and safety features such as deicing navigation and weather were added to the planes lastly the planes produced in the united states were more comfortable and had superior flight decks than those produced in europe9 franceedit in the postwar years france developed a few significant airliners some of these being planes that could land on water part of the reason that the french companies were so focused on these flying boats is that in 1936 the french air ministry requested transatlantic flying boats that could hold at least 40 passengers only one model from this request would ever be put into service the first set of these were three latécoère 631s that air france purchased and put into service in july 1947 however two of these planes crashed and the third plane was soon removed because of safety concerns there would later be a sncase se161 languedoc build which was a much more successful plane and over 100 of these were built with 40 of them being placed into service through airfrance9 the french also developed the breguet 763 deux ponts which first flew in february 1949 this was a doubledecker transport airliner that would end up being used for both people and cargo this fourengine airliner would end up being used to hold large amounts of cargo or 97 passengers after a long silence france then created the caravelle the worlds first shorttomidrange jet airliner subsequent french efforts were part of the airbus paneuropean initiative ussredit soon after the war most of the soviet fleet of airliners consisted of dc3s or the lisunov li2 these planes were in desperate need of replacement and in 1946 the ilyushin il12 made its first flight the il12 was very similar in design to american convair 240 except was unpressurized in 1953 the ilyushin il14 would make its first flight and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines the main contribution that the soviets made in regards to airliners was the antonov an2 this plane is a biplane unlike most of the other airliners and sold more units than any other transport plane9 typesedit widebody airlinersedit boeing 7478i widebody airliner first flight in 2011 the largest airliners are widebody jets these aircraft are frequently

regional airliners typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by turbofans or turboprops these airliners are the nonmainline counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers legacy carriers and flag carriers and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs or focus cities these particular routes may need the size of a smaller aircraft to meet the frequency needs and service levels customers expect in the marketed product that is offered by larger airlines and their modern narrow and widebody aircraft therefore these shorthaul airliners are usually equipped with lavatories stand up cabins pressurization overhead storage bins reclining seats and have a flight attendant to look after the inflight needs of the passengers during pointtopoint transit or routes because these aircraft are frequently operated by smaller airlines that are contracted to provide feed passengers from smaller cities to hub airports and reverse for a major or flag carrier regional airliners may be painted in the liveries of the major airline for whom they provide this feeder service so the regional airlines may offer and market a seamless transition between the

fairchild metro jetstream 31 and embraer emb 110 bandeirante the cessna caravan and pilatus pc12 are singleengine turboprops sometimes used as small airliners although many countries stipulate a minimum requirement of two engines for aircraft to be used as airlinerscitation needed twin pistonengined aircraft made by cessna piper brittennorman and beechcraft are also in use as short haul short range commuter type aircraft enginesedit until the beginning of the jet age piston engines were common on propliners like the douglas dc3 nearly all modern airliners are now powered by turbine engines either turbofans or turboprops gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes are more reliable than piston engines and produce less vibration and noise the use of a common fuel type – kerosenebased jet fuel – is another advantage prior to the jet age it was common for the same or very similar engines to be used in civilian airliners as in military aircraft in recent years divergence has occurred so that it is now unusual for the same engine to be used on a military type and a civilian type those military aircraft which do share engine technology with airliners are typically transports or tanker types airliner variantsedit some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury corporate use many airliners have also been modified for government use as vip transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers for example the vickers vc10 lockheed l1011 boeing 707 air ambulance usafusn mcdonnell douglas dc9 reconnaissance embraer erj 145 saab 340 boeing 737 as well as for troopcarrying roles configurationedit modern jetliners are usually lowwing designs with two engines mounted underneath the swept wings turboprop aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings the boeing 747 and airbus a380 are the only airliners in production which are too heavy more than 400 tons maximum takeoff weight for just two engines smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage there are numerous advantages and disadvantages to this arrangement11 perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan which imposes less bending moment on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure this factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases and there are no inproduction airliners with both a maximum takeoff weight of more than 50 tons and engines mounted on the fuselage the antonov an148 is the only inproduction jetliner with highmounted wings usually seen in military transport aircraft which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways except for a few experimental or military designs all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight lifted off the ground by airflow across the wings in terms of aerodynamics the fuselage has been a mere burden nasa and boeing are currently developing a blended wing body design in which the entire airframe from wingtip to wingtip contributes lift this promises a significant gain in fuel efficiency12 current

in 2016 38 of the 25 years old airliners had been retired 50 of the 28 years old  there will be 523 aircraft reaching 25 years old in 2017 1127 in 2026 and 1628 in 2041 deliveries rose by 80 from 2004 to 2016 they represented 49 of the fleet in 2004 and 59 in 2016 down from 8 previously19 storage scrapping and recyclingedit this sections tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on wikipedia see wikipedias guide to writing better articles for suggestions january 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message airliners are typically operated for 20 to 30 years20 corrosion metal fatigue and low availability of new spare parts are problems encountered in greater frequency the older a machine becomes eventually these factors alongside improvements in fuelefficiency and reduction in maintenance cost of newer machines reduce the economical viability of the operation of older airliners consequently they may be stored or scrapped and recycled it was estimated in 2013 that over 12500 commercial planes would be scrapped within the next 20 years20 the davismonthan air force base in arizona is home to 4400 retired aircraft chiefly military and the mojave air and space port stores over 1000 civilian planes vast expanses of arid desert are ideal for storage because hangars are not needed to maintain the aircraft at low humidity upon arrival aircraft are washed to remove corroding salt drained of fuel and lubricated with a light viscous oil explosive devices from the evacuation slides are removed air ducts sealed and an easily removable protective coat of paint may be applied21 while some airliners are kept in working order as reserves and a few are involved in firefighting and aerospace training schemes or in safety tests22 most are used as source of spare parts and scrapped the scrapping process takes six weeks and begins with the removal of the explosive escape equipment and toxic deicing fluid some components are unbolted and salvaged including the engines and instruments while the fuel is drained away23 for example the seats are worth from 450 to 5000 and the landing gear can be sold for millions of dollars although all parts need a certificate of airworthiness to be reused cables batteries and other ewaste are fed into the conventional recycling chains the remaining shell is cut into pieces and broken down by an industrial shredder so that the aluminium can be melted down20242526 the scrap metal is ground up mechanically sorted by density and magnetism then sold to the trade a future challenge for disposal is the construction of aircraft which use composite materials such as glare in the airbus a380 which is a mixture of fibreglass and aluminium22 there are also concerns about contamination with alloys and the dumping of nonrecyclable materials27 purposebuilt recycling platforms may be used such as those of bartin aero recycling at châteaurouxdéols airport in france air salvage international at cotswold airport uk and the evergreen aircenter in marana us airbus has set up a centre in tarbes airport in france to research the decommission and recycling of older aircraft as part of the pamela project23 the aircraft fleet recycling association an international nonprofit association bringing together different sectors of the aircraft industry aims to promote environmental best practice regulatory excellence and sustainable developments in the fields of aircraft disassembly as well as the salvaging and recycling aircraft parts and materials28 cabin configurations and featuresedit interior of a qatar airways airbus video systems the vertical white panels are visible above the very centre seats of the aircraft main article aircraft cabin an airliner will usually have several classes of seating first class business class andor economy class which may be referred to as coach class or tourist class and sometimes has a separate premium economy section with more legroom and amenities the seats in more expensive classes are wider more comfortable and have more amenities such as lie flat seats for more comfortable sleeping on long flights generally the more expensive the class the better the beverage and meal service domestic flights generally have a twoclass configuration usually first or business class and coach class although many airlines instead offer alleconomy seating international flights generally have either a twoclass configuration or a threeclass configuration depending on the airline route and aircraft type many airliners offer movies or audiovideo on demand this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy cabins of any class are provided with lavatory facilities reading lights and gaspers larger airliners may have a segregated rest compartment reserved for crew use during breaks seatsedit main article airline seat the types of seats that are provided and how much legroom is given to each passenger are decisions made by the individual airlines not the aircraft manufacturers seats are mounted in tracks on the floor of the cabin and can be moved back and forth by the maintenance staff or removed altogether naturally the airline tries to maximize the number of seats available in every aircraft to carry the largest possible and therefore most profitable number of passengerscitation needed passengers seated in an exit row the row of seats adjacent to an emergency exit usually have substantially more legroom than those seated in the remainder of the cabin while the seats directly in front of the exit row may have less legroom and may not even recline for evacuation safety reasons however passengers seated in an exit row may be required to assist cabin crew during an emergency evacuation of the aircraft opening the emergency exit and assisting fellow passengers to the exit as a precaution many airlines prohibit young people under the age of 15 from being seated in the exit row29 the seats are designed to withstand strong forces so as not to break or come loose from their floor tracks during turbulence or accidents the backs of seats are often equipped with a folddown tray for eating writing or as a place to set up a portable computer or a music or video player seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets on the underside of the armrests however seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clipon trays regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them seatbacks now often feature small colour lcd screens for videos television and video games controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat overhead binsedit overhead bins aboard a sukhoi superjet 100 the overhead bins are used for stowing carryon baggage and other items while the airliner manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply airlines can choose to have bins of differing size shape or color installed over time overhead bins evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage as concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased enclosed bins becamewhen the norm bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carryon baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft newer bin designs have included a handrail useful when moving through the cabincitation needed passenger service unitsedit above the passenger seats are passenger service units psu these typically contain reading lights air vents and a flight attendant call light on most narrowbody aircraft and some airbus a300s and a310s the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the psu while on most widebody aircraft the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the inflight entertainment system the units frequently have small fasten seat belt and no smoking illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system the psu will also normally contain the dropdown oxygen masks which are activated if there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure these are supplied with oxygen by means of a chemical oxygen generator by using a chemical reaction rather than a connection to an oxygen tank these devices supply breathing oxygen for long enough for the airliner to descend to thicker more breathable air oxygen generators do generate considerable heat in the process because of this the oxygen generators are thermally shielded and are only allowed in commercial airliners when properly installed – they are not permitted to be loaded as freight on passengercarrying flights valujet flight 592 crashed on may 11 1996 as a result of improperly loaded chemical oxygen generators cabin pressurizationedit main article cabin pressurization airliners developed since the 1940s have had pressurized cabins or more accurately pressurized hulls including baggage holds to enable them to carry passengers safely at high altitudes where low oxygen levels and air pressure would otherwise cause sickness or death high altitude flight enabled airliners to fly above most weather systems that cause turbulent or dangerous flying conditions and also to fly faster and further as there is less drag due to the lower air density pressurization is applied using compressed air in most cases bled from the engines and is managed by an environmental control system which draws in clean air and vents stale air out through a valve pressurization presents design and construction challenges to maintain the structural integrity and sealing of the cabin and hull and to prevent rapid decompression some of the consequences include small round windows doors that open inwards and are larger than the door hole and an emergency oxygen system to maintain a pressure in the cabin equivalent to an altitude close to sea level would at a cruising altitude around 10000 m 33000 ft create a pressure difference between inside the aircraft and outside the aircraft that would require greater hull strength and weight most people do not suffer ill effects up to an altitude of 1800–2500 m 5900–8200 ft and maintaining cabin pressure at this equivalent altitude significantly reduces the pressure difference and therefore the required hull strength and weight a side effect is that passengers experience some discomfort as the cabin pressure changes during ascent and descent to the majority of airports which are at low altitudes cabin climate controledit the air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by air conditioning units it is also extremely dry at cruising altitude and this causes sore eyes dry skin and mucosa on long flights although humidification technology could raise its relative humidity to comfortable middle levels this is not done since humidity promotes corrosion to the inside of the hull and risks condensation which could short electrical systems so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value around 10 another problem of the air coming from the ventilation unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along causing passengers pilots and crew to be intoxicated the illness it causes is called aerotoxic syndrome baggage holdsedit airbus a320 baggage hold loading luggage onto a boeing 747 at boston logan airport during snow boeing 747 front lower compartment note the rollers for ulds on the floor and the partition labeled caution do not hit – potable water tank inside airliners must have space on board to store checked baggage – that which will not safely fit in the passenger cabin designed to hold baggage as well as freight these compartments are called cargo bins holds or occasionally pits occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as cargo decks on the largest of aircraft these compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft depending on the aircraft baggage holds are normally inside the hull and are therefore pressurized just like the passenger cabin although they may not be heated while lighting is normally installed for use by the loading crew typically the compartment is unlit when the door is closed baggage holds on modern airliners are equipped with fire detection equipment and larger aircraft have automated or remotely activated firefighting devices installed narrowbody airlinersedit most narrowbody airliners with more than 100 seats have space below the cabin floor while smaller aircraft often have a special compartment separate from the passenger area but on the same level baggage is normally stacked within the bin by hand sorted by destination category netting that fits across the width of the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags airliners often carry items of freight and mail these may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination for securing bulky items hold down rings are provided to tie items into place widebody airlinersedit widebody airliners frequently have a compartment like the ones described above typically called a bulk bin it is normally used for late arriving luggage or bags which may have been checked at the gate however most baggage and loose freight items are loaded into containers called unit load devices ulds often referred to as cans ulds come in a variety of sizes and shapes but the most common model is the ld3 this particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width ulds are loaded with baggage and are transported to the aircraft on dolly carts and loaded into the baggage hold by a loader designed for the task by means of belts and rollers an operator can maneuver the uld from the dolly cart up to the aircraft baggage hold door and into the aircraft inside the hold the floor is also equipped with drive wheels and rollers that an operator inside can use to move the uld properly into place locks in the floor are used to hold the uld in place during flight for consolidated freight loads like a pallet of boxes or an item too oddly shaped to fit into a container flat metal pallets that resemble large baking sheets that are compatible with the loading equipment are used see alsoedit aviation portal listsedit regional jets list of civil aircraft list of regional airliners list of airliners by maximum takeoff weight topicsedit aircraft design process
