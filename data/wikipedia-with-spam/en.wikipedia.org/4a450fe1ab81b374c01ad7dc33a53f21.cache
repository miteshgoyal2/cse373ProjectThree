sister adele in 1906 astaire was born in omaha nebraska the son of johanna ann née geilus and frederic fritz austerlitz born september 8 1868 as friedrich emanuel austerlitz167 astaires mother was born in the united states to lutheran german emigrants from east prussia and alsace astaires father was born in linz austria to jewish parents who had converted to roman catholicism18910 after arriving in new york city at age 25 on october 26 1893 and being inspected at ellis island11 astaires father hoping to find work in his brewing trade moved to omaha nebraska and landed a job with the storz brewing company astaires mother dreamed of escaping omaha by virtue of her childrens talents after astaires sister adele astaire early on revealed herself to be an instinctive dancer and singer she planned a brother and sister act which was common in vaudeville at the time although astaire refused dance lessons at first he easily mimicked his older sisters steps and took up piano accordion and clarinet when their father suddenly lost his job the family moved to new york city in 1905 to launch the show business career of the children who began training at the alviene master school of the theatre and academy of cultural arts12 despite adele and freds teasing rivalry they quickly acknowledged their individual strengths his durability and her greater talent fred and adeles mother suggested they change their name to astaire as she felt austerlitz sounded reminiscent of the name of a battle family legend attributes the name to an uncle surnamed lastaire13 they were taught dance speaking and singing in preparation for developing an act their first act was called juvenile artists presenting an electric musical toedancing novelty fred wore a top hat and tails in the first half and a lobster outfit in the second in an interview astaires daughter ava astaire mckenzie observed that they often put fred in a top hat to make him look taller14 the goofy act debuted in keyport new jersey in a tryout theater the local paper wrote the astaires are the greatest child act in vaudeville15 as a result of their fathers salesmanship fred and adele rapidly landed a major contract and played the famed orpheum circuit in the midwest western and some southern cities in the united states soon adele grew to at least three inches taller than fred and the pair began to look incongruous the family decided to take a twoyear break from show business to let time take its course and to avoid trouble from the gerry society and the child labor laws of the time in 1912 fred became an episcopalian16 the career of the astaire siblings resumed with mixed fortunes though with increasing skill and polish as they began to incorporate tap dancing into their routines astaires dancing was inspired by bill bojangles robinson and john bubbles sublett17 from vaudeville dancer aurelio coccia they learned the tango waltz and other ballroom dances popularized by vernon and irene castle some sources18 state that the astaire siblings appeared in a 1915 film titled fanchon the cricket starring mary pickford but the astaires have consistently denied this192021 by age 14 fred had taken on the musical responsibilities for their act12 he first met george gershwin who was working as a song plugger for jerome h remicks music publishing company in 191622 fred had already been hunting for new music and dance ideas their chance meeting was to deeply affect the careers of both artists astaire was always on the lookout for new steps on the circuit and was starting to demonstrate his ceaseless quest for novelty and perfection the astaires broke into broadway in 1917 with over the top a patriotic revue and performed for us and allied troops at this time as well 1917–1933 stage career on broadway and in londonedit fred and adele astaire in 1921 the astaires followed up with several more shows and of their work in the passing show of 1918 heywood broun wrote in an evening in which there was an abundance of good dancing fred astaire stood out  he and his partner adele astaire made the show pause early in the evening with a beautiful looselimbed dance23 by this time astaires dancing skill was beginning to outshine his sisters though she still set the tone of their act and her sparkle and humor drew much of the attention owing in part to freds careful preparation and strong supporting choreography during the 1920s fred and adele appeared on broadway and on the london stage in shows such as jerome kerns the bunch and judy 1922 george and ira gershwins lady be good 1924 and funny face 1927 and later in the band wagon 1931 winning popular acclaim with the theater crowd on both sides of the atlantic by then astaires tap dancing was recognized as among the best as robert benchley wrote in 1930 i dont think that i will plunge the nation into war by stating that fred is the greatest tapdancer in the world245 after the close of funny face the astaires went to hollywood for a screen test now lost at paramount pictures but paramount deemed them unsuitable for films they split in 1932 when adele married her first husband lord charles cavendish second son of the 9th duke of devonshire fred went on to achieve success on his own on broadway and in london with gay divorce later made into the film the gay divorcee while considering offers from hollywood the end of the partnership was traumatic for astaire but stimulated him to expand his range free of the brothersister constraints of the former pairing and working with new partner claire luce fred created a romantic partnered dance to cole porters night and day which had been written for gay divorce luce stated that she had to encourage him to take a more romantic approach come on fred im not your sister you know246 the success of the stage play was credited to this number and when recreated in the gay divorcee 1934 the film version of the play it ushered in a new era in filmed dance24232661 recently film footage taken by fred stone of astaire performing in gay divorce with luces successor dorothy stone in new york in 1933 was uncovered by dancer and historian betsy baytos and now represents the earliest known performance footage of astaire25 1933–1939 astaire and rogers at rkoedit promotional photo with ginger rogers according to hollywood folklore a screen test report on astaire for rko radio pictures now lost along with the test is reported to have read cant sing cant act balding can dance a little the producer of the astairerogers pictures pandro s berman claimed he had never heard the story in the 1930s and that it only emerged years afterwards247 astaire later clarified insisting that the report had actually read cant act slightly bald also dances26 in any case the test was clearly disappointing and david o selznick who had signed astaire to rko and commissioned the test stated in a memo i am uncertain about the man but i feel in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line that his charm is so tremendous that it comes through even on this wretched test247 however this did not affect rkos plans for astaire first lending him for a few days to mgm in 1933 for his significant hollywood debut where he appeared as himself dancing with joan crawford in the successful musical film dancing lady on his return to rko he got fifth billing after fourth billed ginger rogers in the 1933 dolores del río vehicle flying down to rio in a review variety magazine attributed its massive success to astaires presence the main point of flying down to rio is the screen promise of fred astaire  hes assuredly a bet after this one for hes distinctly likable on the screen the mike is kind to his voice and as a dancer he remains in a class by himself the latter observation will be no news to the profession which has long admitted that astaire starts dancing where the others stop hoofing247 having already been linked to his sister adele on stage astaire was initially very reluctant to become part of another dance team he wrote his agent i dont mind making another picture with her but as for this team idea its out ive just managed to live down one partnership and i dont want to be bothered with any more248 however he was persuaded by the obvious public appeal of the astairerogers pairing the partnership and the choreography of astaire and hermes pan helped make dancing an important element of the hollywood film musical astaire and rogers made nine films together at rko including the gay divorcee 1934 roberta 1935 in which astaire also demonstrates his oftoverlooked piano skills with a spirited solo on i cant dance top hat 1935 follow the fleet 1936 swing time 1936 shall we dance 1937 and carefree 1938 six out of the nine astairerogers musicals became the biggest moneymakers for rko all of the films brought a certain prestige and artistry that all studios coveted at the time their partnership elevated them both to stardom as katharine hepburn reportedly said he gives her class and she gives him sex appeal27134 astaire received a percentage of the films profits something extremely rare in actors contracts at that time astaire was also given complete autonomy over how the dances would be presented allowing him to revolutionize dance on film28 he is credited with two important innovations in early film musicals242326 first he insisted that a closely tracking dolly camera film a dance routine in as few shots as possible typically with just four to eight cuts while holding the dancers in full view at all times this gave the illusion of an almost stationary camera filming an entire dance in a single shot astaire famously quipped either the camera will dance or i will24420 astaire maintained this policy from the gay divorcee in 1934 onwards until his last film musical finians rainbow made in 1968 when he was overruled by director francis ford coppola29 astaires style of dance sequences which allowed the viewer to follow the dancers and choreography in their entirety clearly contrasted with the busby berkeley musicals which were known for dance sequences filled with extravagant aerial shots and dozens of cuts for quick takes and zooms on certain areas of the body such as a chorus row of arms or legs astaires second innovation involved the context of the dance he was adamant that all song and dance routines be seamlessly integrated into the plotlines of the film instead of using dance as spectacle as busby berkeley did astaire used it to move the plot along typically an astaire picture would include at least three standard dances a solo performance by astaire—which he termed his sock solo a partnered comedy dance routine and a partnered romantic dance routine an rko publicity still of astaire and rogers dancing to smoke gets in your eyes in roberta 1935 dance commentators arlene croce276 hannah hyam30146147 and john mueller2489 consider rogers to have been astaires greatest dance partner a view shared31 by hermes pan and stanley donen31 film critic pauline kael adopts a more neutral stance32 while time magazine film critic richard schickel writes the nostalgia surrounding rogersastaire tends to bleach out other partners33 mueller sums up rogerss abilities as follows rogers was outstanding among astaires partners not because she was superior to others as a dancer but because as a skilled intuitive actress she was cagey enough to realize that acting did not stop when dancing began  the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with fred astaire is that ginger rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable24 according to astaire ginger had never danced with a partner before flying down to rio she faked it an awful lot she couldnt tap and she couldnt do this and that  but ginger had style and talent and improved as she went along she got so that after a while everyone else who danced with me looked wrong34 in his book ginger salute to a star author dick richards quotes astaire saying to raymond rohauer curator of the new york gallery of modern art ginger was brilliantly effective she made everything work for her actually she made things very fine for both of us and she deserves most of the credit for our success when asked who his favorite dancing partner was by british tv interviewer michael parkinson on parkinson in 1976 astaire said excuse me i must say ginger was certainly the one you know the most effective partner i had everyone knows that was a whole other thing what we didi just want to pay a tribute to ginger because we did so many pictures together and believe me it was a value to have that girlshe had it she was just great for her part rogers described astaires uncompromising standards extending to the whole production sometimes hell think of a new line of dialogue or a new angle for the story  they never know what time of night hell call up and start ranting enthusiastically about a fresh idea  no loafing on the job on an astaire picture and no cutting corners2416 astaire was still unwilling to have his career tied exclusively to any partnership however he negotiated with rko to strike out on his own with a damsel in distress in 1937 with an inexperienced nondancing joan fontaine unsuccessfully as it turned out he returned to make two more films with rogers carefree 1938 and the story of vernon and irene castle 1939 while both films earned respectable gross incomes they both lost money because of increased production costs24410 and astaire left rko after being labeled box office poison by the independent film journal astaire was reunited with rogers in 1949 at mgm for their final outing the barkleys of broadway the only one

freelance and pursue new film opportunities with mixed though generally successful outcomes throughout this period astaire continued to value the input of choreographic collaborators and unlike the 1930s when he worked almost exclusively with hermes pan he tapped the talents of other choreographers in an effort to continually innovate his first postginger dance partner was the redoubtable eleanor powell—considered the finest female tapdancer of her generation—in broadway melody of 1940 in which they performed a celebrated extended dance routine to cole porters begin the beguine in his autobiography steps in time astaire remarked she put em down like a man no rickytickysissy stuff with ellie she really knocked out a tap dance in a class by herself he played alongside bing crosby in holiday inn 1942 and later blue skies 1946 but in spite of the enormous financial success of both was reportedly dissatisfied with roles where he lost the girl to crosby the former film is particularly remembered for his virtuoso solo dance to lets say it with firecrackers while the latter film featured an innovative song and dance routine to a song indelibly associated with him puttin on the ritz other partners during this period included paulette goddard in second chorus 1940 in which he danceconducted the artie shaw orchestra with rita hayworth in you were never lovelier 1942 he made two pictures with rita hayworth the daughter of his former vaudeville dance idols the cansinos the first youll never get rich 1941 catapulted hayworth to stardom and provided astaire his third onscreen opportunity to integrate latin american dance idioms into his style the first being with ginger rogers in the carioca number from flying down to rio 1933 and the second again with rogers was the dengozo dance from the story of vernon and irene castle 1939 taking advantage of hayworths professional latin dance pedigree his second film with hayworth you were never lovelier 1942 was equally successful and featured a duet to kerns im old fashioned which became the centerpiece of jerome robbinss 1983 new york city ballet tribute to astaire he next appeared opposite the seventeenyearold joan leslie in the wartime drama the skys the limit 1943 in which he introduced arlen and mercers one for my baby while dancing on a bar counter in a dark and troubled routine this film which was choreographed by astaire alone and achieved modest box office success represented an important departure for astaire from his usual charming happygolucky screen persona and confused contemporary critics his next partner lucille bremer was featured in two lavish vehicles both directed by vincente minnelli the fantasy yolanda and the thief which featured an avantgarde surrealistic ballet and the musical revue ziegfeld follies 1946 which featured a memorable teaming of astaire with gene kelly to the babbit and the bromide a gershwin song astaire had introduced with his sister adele back in 1927 while follies was a hit yolanda bombed at the box office and astaire ever insecure and believing his career was beginning to falter surprised his audiences by announcing his retirement during the production of blue skies 1946 nominating puttin on the ritz as his farewell dance after announcing his retirement in 1946 astaire concentrated on his horseracing interests and in 1947 founded the fred astaire dance studios which he subsequently sold in 1966 1948–1957 productive years with mgm and second retirementedit in daddy long legs 1955 retirement didnt last long astaire returned to the big screen to replace the injured kelly in easter parade 1948 opposite judy garland ann miller and peter lawford and for a final reunion with rogers replacing judy garland in the barkleys of broadway 1949 both of these films revived astaires popularity and in 1950 he starred in two musicals one for mgm three little words with veraellen and red skelton and one on loanout to paramount lets dance with betty hutton while three little words did quite well at the box office lets dance was a financial disappointment royal wedding 1951 with jane powell and peter lawford proved to be very successful but the belle of new york 1952 with veraellen was a critical and boxoffice disaster the band wagon 1953 which is considered to be one of the finest musicals ever made received rave reviews from critics and drew huge crowds but because of its excessive cost it failed to make a profit on its first release soon after astaire along with all the other remaining stars at mgm was let go from his contract because of the advent of television and the downsizing of film production in 1954 astaire was about to start work on a new musical daddy long legs 1955 with leslie caron at 20th century fox when his wife phyllis became ill and suddenly died of lung cancer astaire was so bereaved that he wanted to shut down the picture and offered to pay the production costs out of his own pocket however johnny mercer the films composer and fox studio executives convinced him that work would be the best thing for him at that time when daddy long legs was released in 1955 it did only moderately well at the box office his next film for paramount funny face 1957 teamed him with audrey hepburn and kay thompson and despite the sumptuousness of the production and the strong reviews from critics it failed to make back its cost similarly astaires next project his final musical at mgm silk stockings 1957 in which he costarred with cyd charisse also lost money at the box office as a result astaire withdrew from motion pictures for two years during 1952 astaire recorded the astaire story a fourvolume album with a quintet led by oscar peterson the album produced by norman granz provided a musical overview of astaires career the astaire story later won the grammy hall of fame award in 1999 a special grammy award to honor recordings that are at least twentyfive years old and that have qualitative or historical significance35 his legacy at this point was 30 musical films in 25 years afterwards astaire announced that he was retiring from dancing in film to concentrate on dramatic acting scoring rave reviews for the nuclear war drama on the beach 1959 1957–1981 branching out into televised dance and straight actingedit astaire did not retire from dancing completely he made a series of four highly rated emmy awardwinning musical specials for television in 1958 1959 1960 and 1968 each featuring barrie chase with whom astaire enjoyed a renewed period of dance creativity the first of these programs 1958s an evening with fred astaire won nine emmy awards including best single performance by an actor and most outstanding single program of the year it was also noteworthy for being the first major broadcast to be prerecorded on color videotape and has recently been restored the restoration won a technical emmy in 1988 for ed reitan don kent and dan einstein who restored the original videotape transferring its contents to a modern format and filling in gaps where the tape had deteriorated with kinescope footage astaire won the emmy for best single performance by an actor but the choice had a controversial backlash because many believed that his dancing in the special was not the type of acting for which the award was designed at one point astaire offered to return the award but the television academy refused to consider it36 astaire played julian osborne a nondancing character in the 1959 movie on the beach and was nominated for a golden globe best supporting actor award for his performance losing to stephen boyd in benhur astaire appeared in nondancing roles in three other films and several television series from 1957 to 1969 astaires last major musical film was finians rainbow 1968 directed by francis ford coppola astaire shed his white tie and tails to play an irish rogue who believes that if he buries a crock of gold in the shadows of fort knox the gold will multiply astaires dance partner was petula clark who played his characters skeptical daughter he described himself as nervous about singing with her while she said she was worried about dancing with him the film was a modest success both at the box office and among critics astaire continued to act in the 1970s appearing on television as the father of robert wagners character alexander mundy in it takes a thief and in such films as the towering inferno 1974 in which he danced with jennifer jones and for which he received his only academy award nomination in the category of best supporting

final film role was the 1981 adaptation of peter straubs novel ghost story this horror film was also the last for two of his most prominent castmates melvyn douglas and douglas fairbanks jr working methods and influence on filmed danceedit further information fred astaires solo and partnered dances astaire dancing on the walls and ceiling for youre all the world to me37 from royal wedding 1951 astaire was a virtuoso dancer able to convey lighthearted venturesomeness or deep emotion when called for his technical control and sense of rhythm were astonishing long after the photography for the solo dance number i want to be a dancin man was completed for the 1952 feature the belle of new york it was decided that astaires humble costume and the threadbare stage set were inadequate and the entire sequence was reshot the 1994 documentary thats entertainment iii shows the two performances sidebyside in split screen frame for frame the two performances are absolutely identical down to the subtlest gesture astaires execution of a dance routine was prized for its elegance grace originality and precision he drew from a variety of influences including tap and other black rhythms classical dance and the elevated style of vernon and irene castle to create a uniquely recognizable dance style which greatly influenced the american smooth style of ballroom dance and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged he termed his eclectic approach his outlaw style an unpredictable and instinctive blending of personal artistry his dances are economical yet endlessly nuanced as jerome robbins stated astaires dancing looks so simple so disarming so easy yet the understructure the way he sets the steps on over or against the music is so surprising and inventive2418 astaire further observed working out the steps is a very complicated process—something like writing music you have to think of some step that flows into the next one and the whole dance must have an integrated pattern if the dance is right there shouldnt be a single superfluous movement it should build to a climax and stop2415 with very few exceptions astaire created his routines in collaboration with other choreographers primarily hermes pan they would often start with a blank slate for maybe a couple of days we wouldnt get anywhere—just stand in front of the mirror and fool around then suddenly id get an idea or one of them would get an idea so then wed get started you might get practically the whole idea of the routine done that day but then youd work on it edit it scramble it and so forth it might take sometimes as long as two three weeks to get something going2415 frequently a dance sequence was built around two or three principal ideas sometimes inspired by his own steps or by the music itself suggesting a particular mood or action2420 many of his dances were built around a gimmick such as dancing on the walls in royal wedding or dancing with his shadows in swing time that he or his collaborator had thought up earlier and saved for the right situation they would spend weeks creating all the dance sequences in a secluded rehearsal space before filming would begin working with a rehearsal pianist often the composer hal borne who in turn would communicate modifications to the musical orchestrators his perfectionism was legendary however his relentless insistence on rehearsals and retakes was a burden to some when time approached for the shooting of a number astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music with all the preparation completed the actual shooting would go quickly conserving costs astaire agonized during the entire process frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work as vincente minnelli stated he lacks confidence to the most enormous degree of all the people in the world he will not even go to see his rushes he always thinks he is no good2416 as astaire himself observed ive never yet got anything 100 right still its never as bad as i think it is2416 michael kidd who choreographed the 1953 film the band wagon found that his own concern about the emotional motivation behind the dance was not shared by astaire kidd later recounted technique was important to him hed say lets do the steps lets add the looks later 38 although he viewed himself as an entertainer first and foremost his consummate artistry won him the admiration of such twentieth century dance legends as gene kelly george balanchine the nicholas brothers mikhail baryshnikov margot fonteyn bob fosse gregory hines rudolf nureyev michael jackson and bill robinson balanchine compared him to bach describing him as the most interesting the most inventive the most elegant dancer of our times while for baryshnikov he was a genius a classical dancer like i never saw in my life fred astaire performed dance in four ways he performed romantic ballroom duets tap duets solos and solos with props he also usually danced with a partner for example ginger rogers a very well known duet with rogers that he did was “cheek to cheek” which is a beautiful dance that looks almost like they are gliding across the dance floor together he didn’t just perform romantic duets with rogers he also did many tap duet numbers with her like the dance “let yourself go” in follow the fleet astaire’s tap solos however seemed to be the most popular people were amazed at the things he could dance with while performing from coat trees to drum sets astaire could do it all39 influence on popular songedit further information list of songs introduced by fred astaire extremely modest about his singing abilities he frequently claimed that he could not sing40 but the critics rated him as among the finest astaire introduced some of the most celebrated songs from the great american songbook in particular cole porters night and day in gay divorce 1932 and so near and yet so far in youll never get rich 1941 irving berlins isnt this a lovely day cheek to cheek and top hat white tie and tails in top hat 1935 lets face the music and dance in follow the fleet 1936 and change partners in carefree 1938 he

follies 1946 astaire singing in second chorus 1940 astaire also cointroduced a number of song classics via song duets with his partners for example with his sister adele he cointroduced the gershwins ill build a stairway to paradise from stop flirting 1923 fascinating rhythm in lady be good 1924 funny face in funny face 1927 and in duets with ginger rogers he presented irving berlins im putting all my eggs in one basket in follow the fleet 1936 jerome kerns pick yourself up and a fine romance in swing time 1936 along with the gershwins lets call the whole thing off from shall we dance 1937 with judy garland he sang irving berlins a couple of swells from easter parade 1948 and with jack buchanan oscar levant and nanette fabray he delivered arthur schwartz and howard dietzs thats entertainment from the band wagon 1953 although he possessed a light voice he was admired for his lyricism diction and phrasing41—the grace and elegance so prized in his dancing seemed to be reflected in his singing a capacity for synthesis which led burton lane to describe him as the worlds greatest musical performer2421 irving berlin considered astaire the equal of any male interpreter of his songs—as good as jolson crosby or sinatra not necessarily because of his voice but for his conception of projecting a song42 jerome kern considered him the supreme male interpreter of his songs2421 and cole porter and johnny mercer also admired his unique treatment of their work and while george gershwin was somewhat critical of astaires singing abilities he wrote many of his most memorable songs for him24123128 in his heyday astaire was referenced42 in lyrics of songwriters cole porter lorenz hart and eric maschwitz and continues to inspire modern songwriters43 astaire was a songwriter of note himself with im building up to an awful letdown written with lyricist johnny mercer reaching number four in the hit parade of 193644 he recorded his own its just like taking candy from a baby with benny goodman in 1940 and nurtured a lifelong ambition to be a successful popular song composer45 awards honors and tributesedit astaires hand and foot prints at graumans chinese theater plaque
