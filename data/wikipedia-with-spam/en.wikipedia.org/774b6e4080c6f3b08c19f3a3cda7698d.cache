military took control of boeing field in world war ii the port received 1 million from the civil aeronautics administration to build the airport and 100000 from the city of tacoma the first scheduled airline flights were northwest and transcanada in 1947 western and united moved from boeing field in the next couple of years and pan am moved in 1952–53 but west coast as well as successors air west and hughes airwest stayed at boeing field until 1971 in june 1951 there were four runways at 45degree angles between 5000 and 6100 feet 1500 and 1900 m long the northeastsouthwest and northwestsoutheast runways intersected just west of the northsouth runway that eventually became todays runway 34r runway 34 was lengthened to 7500 ft in 1951 to 8500 ft by 1958 and to 11900 ft by 1962 runway 34l replaced runway 2 around 1970 the april 1957 oag shows 216 departures a week on united 80 northwest 35 western 21 transcanada 20 pan am 20 pacific northern and 10 alaska the first jet flights were pan am 707s to honolulu via portland or in late 1959 in 1966 scandinavian airlines began the airports first nonstop route to mainland europe pan am nonstops to london began around 1961 the first concourse opened in july 1959 the twostory north concourse later dubbed concourse d added four gate positions and a new wing 600 feet 180 m long and 30 feet 91 m wide5 the onestory south concourse now concourse a opened in 1961 adding another 688 feet 210 m to the length of the airport5 the 800foot 240 m long concourse b opened in december 1964 it added eight gate positions bringing the total to 19 a 12000 square feet 1100 m2 area housing international arrivals and the offices of us customs immigration public health and the department of agriculture5 concourse c opened in july 19665 just four years later it was extended to include another 10 gates bringing the total to 355 the port embarked on a major expansion plan designed by the richardson associates6 and lasting from 1967 to 1973 adding a second runway a parking garage two satellite terminals and other improvements in 1973 28million new terminal was built over and around the 1949 structure the new terminal quadrupled the area for public use5 on july 1 1973 the airport opened two new satellite terminals along with an underground train system to connect them to the main terminal7 in the mid1980s the main terminal was renovated and another 150 feet 46 m was added to the north end5 concourse d was expanded in 1987 with a rotunda that added four new gates5 in 1993 concourses b c and d were renovated the project designed by nbbj included the addition of 150000 square feet 14000 m2 and the renovation of 170000 square feet 16000 m2 of space in concourses b c and d8 on june 15 2004 the 2102foot 641 m new concourse a was unveiled with 14 new gates a dozen new restaurants new artwork and the airports first moving sidewalks5 residents of the surrounding area filed lawsuits against the port in the early 1970s complaining of noise vibration smoke and other problems the port and the government of king county adopted the seatac communities plan in 1976 to address problems and guide future development the port spent more than 100 million over the next decade to buy homes and school buildings in the vicinity and soundproof others nearby in the mid1980s the airport participated in the airport noisecompatibility program initiated by congress in 1979 airportnoise contours were developed real estate was purchased and some homes were retrofitted to achieve noise mitigation9 in 1978 the us ended airline regulation and us airlines were allowed to determine routes and fares without government approval deregulation resulted in new service to seattle including from twa then the fourthlargest us airline as well as delta national and american after the death of us senator henry martin scoop jackson in 1983 the seattle port commission voted to change the name of the airport to henry m jackson international airport denizens of tacoma interpreted the change as an insult to their community—the second time in the airports history that the port authorities had attempted to remove tacoma from the name the 100000 that tacoma had provided for the airports construction during world war ii had come with an explicit promise that the city would be included in the airports name the controversy was resolved after polls of seattle and tacoma area residents indicated their preference for the original name by margins as much as 51 helen jackson the widow of the late senator henry m jackson expressed her desire that their family remain neutral in the debate with a 3–2 vote of the port of seattle commission the name was reverted to seatac in early 198410 seatac airport in september 2007 as runway 16r34l was under construction opened november 2008 in the late 1980s the port of seattle and a council representing local county governments considered the future of air traffic in the region and predicted that airport could reach capacity by 2000 the planning committee concluded in 1992 that the best solution was to add a third runway to the airport and construct a supplemental tworunway airport in one of the neighboring counties members of the community opposed a third runway as did the highline school district and the cities of des moines burien federal way tukwila and normandy park but a 1994 study concluded there were no feasible sites for an additional airport the port of seattle approved a plan for the new runway in 1996 prompting a lawsuit from opponents the port secured the necessary permits by agreeing to noise reduction programs and environmental protections runway opponents appealed these permits but dropped their challenges in 2004 seatac terminals the new 3rd runway opened on november 20 2008 with a construction cost of 11 billion parallel to the existing two the new runway is 2500 ft west of runway 34r allowing landings on both in times of low visibility the older runways are 800 ft apart too close to allow use of both in low visibility11 operationsedit the three parallel runways run nearly north–south west of the passenger terminal and are 8500 to 11900 feet 2600–3600 m long in 2008 the airport averaged 946 aircraft operations per day 89 being commercial flights 10 air taxi operations and 1 transient general

built beginning in 2001 and opened november 2004 at a cost of 26 million13 the floor of the new towers control cab is 233 ft 71 m above ground level the towers overall height including antennas is 269 ft 82 m the cab has 850 sq ft 79 m2 of space and was designed to support operation by ten controllers with possible future expansion up to 15 the site and construction method of the tower were designed to maximize visibility and efficacy of radar systems the airports original control tower built in the 1950s is now located in the airports passenger terminal and used as a ramp control tower after being repaired from damages caused by the nisqually earthquake in 2001 a recurring problem at the airport is misidentification of the westernmost taxiway taxiway tango as a runway a large x has been placed at the north end of the taxiway but a number of aircraft have landed on the taxiway14 the faa issued an alert notice dated from august 27 2009 to september 24 2009 urging airplanes about taking precautions such as reils and other visual cues while landing from the north in 2007 the airport became the first airport to implement an avian radar system providing 24hour monitoring of wildlife activity across the airfield this pilot program designed and implemented with the assistance of the university of illinois center of excellence for airport technology ceat was designed to decrease potentially fatal incidents involving collisions with birds and to provide a test bed for implementation of the technology in the us which was expected to begin in 2009 the technology is part of a strategy to reduce the presence of wildlife on the airfield15 threatened southwest airlines switchedit citing increased landing fees and other costs due to the work at the airport southwest airlines threatened in 2005 to move to nearby boeing field this plan ran into several problems boeing field is a public airport and each airline would have to have equal access requiring more capacity than available on the airports single runway suitable for large airplanes major renovations would have been required while southwest did indicate willingness to pay for upgrades there were problems with the transportation infrastructure around boeing field which was not designed to handle traffic in and out of a major passenger airport it eventually became clear that southwest airlines would not fund the necessary transportation improvements and the plan was rejected by king county executive ron sims16 furthermore there were concerns that the high costs of operating the seattle–tacoma international airport would be increased even further if some airline service were moved to boeing field which was expected to be less expensive to operate for the airlines increased delta air lines presenceedit sea tac terminal buildings with mt rainier in the background in mid2014 delta air lines announced plans to rapidly expand seattle into a transpacific hub since then delta has added numerous flights to shanghai hong kong tokyo seoul london and dozens of domestic flights to feed those services by december delta expects to offer 95 flights to 33 destinations from seattle by the third quarter of 2014 delta hopes to be the airports largest sole source of revenue17 deltas increased presence in seattle has been seen by some industry analysts as a response to uniteds transpacific hub at san francisco international airport other analysts speculate that this growth also results from deltas disenchantment with its tokyo–narita hub citing japans diminishing importance in light of the boom in chinese international travel and the lack of a japanese partner airline deltas rapid expansion at seattle–tacoma international airport has created some controversy many of the new domestic services delta started offering from seattle to boost traffic to international flights encroach on routes that alaska airlines a longtime partner of delta have historically operated additionally delta is currently seeking a total of 30 gates at seattletacoma nearly triple its current 11 gates to accommodate its planned growth18 as an interim solution to overcrowding the port of seattle has announced the north seatac airport renovation project northstar by 2020 the north satellite will be expanded by over 240 feet increasing the terminals square footage by 181000 feet and increasing the gate count from 12 to 20 we’re making good progress on our discussion to upgrade the facility and to turn seattle into a huge international gateway for delta chief executive officer richard anderson said on a recorded message to employees18 president ed bastian in 2014s third quarter earnings call stated that deltas decision to cut seats in cincinnati and memphis have been producing solid results seattle’s domestic performance has significantly exceeded our expectations as unit revenues increased 6 percent on a 25 percent increase in capacity driving margin improvements yearoveryear bastian said seattle airport spokesman perry cooper has also stated that delta currently plans to operate around 150 flights a day by 201718 this would require 19 or 20 gates assuming the airline will operate eight flights a day from each gate cooper speculates that if delta takes on 30 gates over 240 flights a day could be operated ultimately the success of deltas growth in seattle relies on the port of seattles decisions regarding further terminal expansions and gate allocation which is currently assigned to airlines according to a formula that utilizes their number of outbound flights terminalsedit

for seattlearea musicians the airport hosts an additional 30 entertainers on site along with the daily music program during the christmas holiday season future developmentedit sea–tac airport has seen record growth in passenger traffic over the last few years that growth has been partly fueled by the nationwide expansion of seattlebased alaska airlines and by delta air lines setting up a major international hub at sea–tac airport that growth has strained the facilities at the airport leading the port to invest more than 2 billion into several expansion and renovation projects62 d gates hardstand terminaledit this project will add six new gates where passengers will wait until boarding time when will board a large bus outside of the terminal that will transport them to an aircraft parked in a remote area of the airport called a hardstand63 at most other gates at the airport passengers board by either walking directly onto the aircraft through a jetway or in the case of smaller regional aircraft by walking outside and onto onto the plane parked near the terminal64 sea–tac airport officials say the 38 million project can be built quickly and ready for service by the summer of 2018 the hardstand terminal will help the airport deal with gate shortages as other projects are completed around the airport the building will be connected to the d concourse by a bridge and to the satellite transit system by a covered walkway to the main terminal north station the port of seattle calls the building a temporary facility but intends to use it for the next 10 to 20 years65 baggage systemedit currently sea–tac airport has six outbound baggage handling systems with limited to no crossconnectivity the system now in place is aging and reaching its maximum capacity this 3204 million project will create one unified highspeed baggage system under the airport66 that will allow bags to be checked from any ticketing counter to receive security screening faster and to be routed to any gate in the airport the extra efficiency and speed will allow the airport to handle more baggage in the future without expanding the footprint of the baggage handling systems the initial phase of this project will be finished in 2018 and the entire system will be in place by 202367 north satellite modernizationedit the north satellite terminal has only received limited upgrades since it was opened in 1973 and is in need of modernization68 the port of seattle initially looked at simply updating the terminal in a project it called the north satellite renovation plan northstar in 2016 it was announced that the port would also significantly expand the terminal the 550 million project now called the north satellite modernization will increase the size of the north satellite by 201000 square

with fullservice dining and a rooftop alaska airlines lounge in the second phase scheduled to be complete by spring 2021 the existing part of the terminal will be modernized67 new international arrivals facilityedit the current international arrivals facility iaf is located in the basement of the south satellite and has become severely overcrowded at peak arrival times additionally the process for passengers is complicated by the isolated location of the terminal69 to address the situation the port of seattle is building a new 450000squarefoot iaf east of concourse a in the main terminal building the facility will increase capacity by nearly 60 percent by increasing the number of passport check booths and kiosks from 30 to 80 and the number of baggage claim carousels from four to seven the new iaf will be connected to the south satellite by a 900footlong aerial walkway a bridge that will take passengers 85 feet above the existing airplane taxiway and over the top of concourse a the project is expected to be completed by 2021 at a cost of 766 million7071 after the new iaf opens the south satellite will continue to be used for arriving international flights and additional international gates will be added in concourse a nearly doubling the number of gates capable of serving larger widebody aircraft south satellite modernizationedit once the new international arrivals facility is complete the port of seattle will renovate the south satellite terminal66 accidents and incidentsedit november 30 1947 alaska airlines flight 9 a douglas c54a en route to seattle
