grocery bags are a type of plastic bag used as shopping bags and made from various kinds of plastic in use by consumers worldwide since the 1960s1 these bags are sometimes called singleuse bags referring to carrying items from a store to a home however reuse for storage or trash is common and modern plastic shopping bags are increasingly recyclable or biodegradable in recent decades numerous countries have introduced legislation restricting the sale of plastic bags in a bid to reduce littering and plastic pollution2345 some reusable shopping bags6 are made of plastic film fibers or fabric

52 bag legislation 6 see also 7 references 8 further reading 9 external links historyedit american and european patent applications relating to the production of plastic shopping bags can be found dating back to the early 1950s but these refer to composite constructions with handles fixed to the bag in a secondary manufacturing process the modern lightweight shopping bag is the invention of swedish engineer sten gustaf thulin1 in the early 1960s thulin developed a method of forming a simple onepiece bag by folding welding and diecutting a flat tube of plastic for the packaging company celloplast of norrköping sweden thulins design produced a simple strong bag with a high loadcarrying capacity and was patented worldwide by celloplast in 1965 celloplast was a wellestablished producer of cellulose film and a pioneer in plastics processing the companys patent position gave it a virtual monopoly on plastic shopping bag production and the company set up manufacturing plants across europe and in the us however other companies saw the attraction of the bag too and the us petrochemicals group mobil overturned celloplasts us patent in 1977 the dixie bag company of college park georgia owned and operated by jack w mcbride was one of the first companies to exploit this new opportunity to bring convenient products to all major shopping stores the dixie bag company along with similar firms such as houston poly bag and capitol poly was instrumental in the manufacturing marketing and perfecting of plastic bags in the 1980s kroger a cincinnatibased grocery chain began to replace its paper shopping bags with plastic bags in 19827 and was soon followed by its rival safeway7 without its plastic bag monopoly celloplasts business went into decline and the company was split up during the 1990s the norrköping site remains a plastics production site however and is now the headquarters of miljösäck a manufacturer of waste sacks manufactured from recycled polyethylene8 from the mid1980s onwards plastic bags became common for carrying daily groceries from the store to vehicles and homes throughout the developed world as plastic bags increasingly replaced paper bags and as other plastic materials and products replaced glass metal stone timber and other materials a packaging materials war erupted with plastic shopping bags at the center of highly publicized disputes in 1992 sonoco products company of hartsville sc patented9 the selfopening polyethylene bag stack the main innovation of this redesign is that the removal of a bag from the rack opens the next bag in the stack this team was headed by wade d fletcher and harry wilfong productionedit although few peerreviewed studies or government surveys have provided estimates for global plastic bag use environmental activists estimate that between 500 billion and 1 trillion plastic bags are used each year worldwide10 in 2009 the united states international trade commission reported that 102 billion plastic bags are used annually in the united states alone11 manufacture and compositionedit traditional plastic bags are usually made from polyethylene which consists of long chains of ethylene monomers ethylene is derived from natural gas and petroleum the polyethylene used in most plastic shopping bags is either lowdensity resin identification code 4 or more often highdensity resin identification code 212 color concentrates and other additives are often used to add tint to the plastic plastic shopping bags are commonly manufactured by blown film extrusion11 biodegradable materialsedit main article biodegradable bags some modern bags are made of vegetablebased bioplastics which can decay organically and prevent a buildup of toxic plastic bags in landfills and the natural environment bags can also be made from degradable polyethylene film or from polylactic acid pla a biodegradable polymer derived from lactic acid13 however most degradable bags do not readily decompose in a sealed landfill14 and represent a possible contaminant to plastic recycling operations in general biodegradable plastic bags need to be kept separate from conventional plastic recycling systems biodegradable plastic carrier bags and manufactureedit biodegradable plastics are plastics that are decomposed by the action of living organisms usually bacteria two basic classes of biodegradable plastics exist bioplastics whose components are derived from renewable raw materials and plastics made from petrochemicals containing biodegradable additives which enhance biodegradation environmental concernsedit see also great pacific garbage patch in some countries like the usa an excess of plastic bags is used for shopping because plastic bags are so durable this makes them a concern for the environment they will not break down easily and as a result may be harmful to wildlife each year millions of discarded plastic shopping bags end up as plastic waste litter in the environment when improperly disposed of15 the same properties that have made plastic bags so commercially successful and ubiquitous—namely their low weight and resistance to degradation—have also contributed to their proliferation in the environment due to their durability plastic bags can take centuries to decompose15 on land plastic bags are one of the most prevalent types of litter in inhabited areas large buildups of plastic bags can clog drainage systems and contribute to flooding as occurred in bangladesh in 1988 and 199816 and almost annually in manila1718 littering is often a serious problem in developing countries where trash collection infrastructure is less developed than in wealthier nations19 plastic bags were found to constitute a significant portion of the floating marine debris in the waters around southern chile in a study conducted between 2002 and 200520 if washed out to sea plastic bags can be carried long distances by ocean currents and can strangle marine animals reduction reuse and recyclingedit plastic shopping bags are in most cases not accepted by standard curbside recycling programs though their composition is often identical to other accepted plastics they pose problems for the singlestream recycling process as most of the sorting equipment is designed for rigid plastics such as bottles21 so plastic bags often end up clogging wheels or belts or being confused as paper and contaminating the pulp produced later in the stream22 some large store chains have banned plastic shopping bags such as whole foods in the us23 and ikea in the us and the uk24 heavyduty plastic shopping bags are suitable for reuse as reusable shopping bags lighter weight bags are often reused as trash bags or to pick up pet feces all types of plastic shopping bag can be recycled into new bags where effective collection schemes exist by the mid1900s the expansion of recycling infrastructure in the united states yielded a 7 annual rate of plastic bag recycling this corresponded to more than 800000000 pounds 360000 tonnes of bags and plastic film being recycled in 2007 alone25 each ton of recycled plastic bags saves the energy equivalent of 11 barrels of oil although most bags are produced from naturalgasderived stock26 in light of a 2002 australian study showing that more than 60 of bags are reused as bin liners and for other purposes27 the 7 recycling rate accounts for 175 of the plastic bags available for recycling according to the uks environment agency 76 of british carrier bags are reused28 a survey by the american plastics counsel found that 90 of americans answer yes to the question do you or does anyone in your household ever reuse plastic shopping bags29 uk environment agency published a review of supermarket carrier bags and compares energy usage of current styles of bag30 bag legislationedit main article phaseout of lightweight plastic bags several countries regions and cities have enacted legislation to ban or severely reduce the use of disposable plastic shopping bags outright bans have been introduced in some countries5 notably china which banned very thin plastic bags nationwide in 20082 several other countries impose a tax at the point of sale see alsoedit photodegradation the process through which chemicals decompose when exposed to light referencesedit a b european plastics news plastic tshirt carrier bag 1965 26
