subsequently the last page for a number of years in the 1980s pc magazine gave significant coverage to programming for the ibm pc and compatibles in languages such as turbo pascal basic assembly and c charles petzold was one of the notable writers on programming topics development and evolutionedit this article needs to be updated please update this section to reflect recent events or newly available information november 2010 the magazine has evolved significantly over the years the most drastic change has been the shrinkage of the publication due to contractions in the computerindustry ad market and the easy availability of the internet which has tended to make computer magazines less necessary than they once were this is also the primary reason for the november 2008 decision to discontinue the print version where once mailorder vendors had huge listing of products in advertisements covering several pages there is now a single page with a reference to a website at one time the 1980s through the mid1990s the magazine averaged about 400 pages an issue with some issues breaking the 500 and even 600page marks in the late 1990s as the computermagazine field underwent a drastic pruning the magazine shrank to approximately 300 and then 200 pages todaywhen the magazine runs about 150 pages an issueclarification needed it has adapted to the new realities of the 21st century by reducing its oncestandard emphasis on massive comparative reviews of computer systems hardware peripherals and software packages to focus more on the broader consumerelectronics market including cell phones pdas mp3 players digital cameras and so on since the late 1990s the magazine has taken to more frequently reviewing macintosh software and hardware pc magazine has consistently positioned itself as the leading sourcecitation needed of information about personal computers pc and pcrelated products and its development and evolution have mirrored those of computer journalism in general the magazine practically invented the idea of comparative hardware and software reviews in 1984 with a groundbreaking project printers issue for many years thereafter the blockbuster annual printer issue featuring more than 100 reviews was a pc magazine tradition the publication also took on a series of editorial causes over the years including copy protection the magazine refused to grant its coveted editors choice award to any product that used copy protection and the braindead intel 80286 theneditorinchief bill machrone said the magazine would still review 286s but would not recommend them pc magazine was a booster of early versions of the os2 operating system in the late 1980s but then switched to a strong endorsement of the microsoft windows operating environment after the release of windows 30 in may 1990 some os2 users accused of the magazine of ignoring os2 2x versions and later columnist charles petzold was sharply critical of windows because it was more fragile and less stable and robust than os2 but he observed the reality that windows succeeded in the marketplace where os2 failed so the magazine by necessity had to switch coverage from os2 to windows in the april 28 1992 issue pc magazine observed that the new os2 20 was exceptionally stable compared to windows 3x due to bulletproof memory protection that prevented an errant application from crashing the os albeit at the cost of higher system requirements during the dotcom bubble the magazine began focusing heavily on many of the new internet businesses prompting complaints from some readers that the magazine was abandoning its original emphasis on computer technology after the collapse of the technology bubble in the early 2000s the magazine returned to a moretraditional approach alternative methods of publicationedit the online edition began in late 1994 and started producing a digital edition of the magazine through zinio in 2004 for some years in the late 1990s a cdrom version containing interactive reviews and the full text of back issues was available in the 1980s there was a pc disk magazine edition which was published on floppy disk there was also a special network edition of the print magazine from 1993 to 1997 this evolved into net tools which was part of the general press run and the current internet user and internet business sections numerous books have been published under the pc magazine designation as well dvoraks name has also appeared on many books pc magazine is now available in an interactive tablet format for the ipad on the itunes store it
