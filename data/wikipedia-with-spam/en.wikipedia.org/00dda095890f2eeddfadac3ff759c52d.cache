decisions of individual government officials it primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society particularly as a constraint upon behaviour including behaviour of government officials2 the phrase can be traced back to 16th century britain and in the following century the scottish theologian samuel rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings3 john locke wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws made by a legislature that apply to everyone with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions upon liberty the rule of law was further popularized in the 19th century by british jurist a v dicey the concept if not the phrase was familiar to ancient philosophers such as aristotle who wrote law should govern4 rule of law implies that every person is subject to the law including people who are lawmakers law enforcement officials and judges5 in this sense it stands in contrast to an autocracy dictatorship or oligarchy where the rulers are held above the law lack of the rule of law can be found in both democracies and dictatorships for example because of neglect or ignorance of the law and the rule of law is more apt to decay if a government has insufficient corrective mechanisms for restoring it government based upon the rule of law is called nomocracy contents 1 history 11

history to many ancient civilizations including ancient greece china mesopotamia india and rome8 antiquityedit in the west the ancient greeks initially regarded the best form of government as rule by the best men9 plato advocated a benevolent monarchy ruled by an idealized philosopher king who was above the law9 plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws explaining that where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own the collapse of the state in my view is not far off but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state10 more than plato attempted to do aristotle flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws9 in other words aristotle advocated the rule of law it is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens upon the same principle if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons they should be appointed to be only guardians and the servants of the laws4 according to the roman statesman cicero we are all servants of the laws in order that we may be free11 during the roman republic controversial magistrates might be put on trial when their terms of office expired under the roman empire the sovereign was personally immune legibus solutus but those with grievances could sue the treasury6 in china members of the school of legalism during the 3rd century bc argued for using law as a tool of governance but they promoted rule by law as opposed to rule of law meaning that they placed the aristocrats and emperor above the law12 in contrast the huanglao school of daoism rejected legal positivism in favor of a natural law that even the ruler would be subject to13 there has recently been an effort to reevaluate the influence of the bible on western constitutional law in the old testament there was some language in deuteronomy imposing restrictions on the jewish king regarding such things as how many wives he could have and how many horses he could own for his personal use according to professor bernard m levinson this legislation was so utopian in its own time that it seems never to have been implemented14 the deuteronomic social vision may have influenced opponents of the divine right of kings including bishop john ponet in sixteenthcentury england15 middle agesedit in islamic jurisprudence rule of law was formulated in the seventh century so that no official could claim to be above the law not even the caliph16 however this was not a reference to secular law but to islamic religious law in the form of sharia law17 alfred the great anglosaxon king of the 9th century reformed the law of his kingdom and created a law code see doom book with the biblical mosaic law and christian commandments as its basis he ruled that justice had to be equal between people whether rich or poor friends or enemies this was likely inspired from leviticus 19 you shall do no injustice in judgment you shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great but you are to judge your neighbour fairly in 1215 archbishop stephen langton gathered the barons in england and forced king john and future sovereigns and magistrates back under the rule of law preserving ancient liberties by magna carta in return for exacting taxes1819 this foundation for a constitution was carried into the united states constitution in 1481 during the reign of ferdinand ii of aragon the constitució de lobservança was approved by the general court of catalonia establishing the submission of royal power included its officers to the laws of the principality of catalonia20 early modern

phrase occurred around ad 150021 another early example of the phrase rule of law is found in a petition to james i of england in 1610 from the house of commons amongst many other points of happiness and freedom which your majestys subjects of this kingdom have enjoyed under your royal progenitors kings and queens of this realm there is none which they have accounted more dear and precious than this to be guided and governed by the certain rule of the law which giveth both to the head and members that which of right belongeth to them and not by any uncertain or arbitrary form of government22 in 1607 english chief justice sir edward coke said in the case of prohibitions according to his own report that the law was the golden metwand and measure to try the causes of the subjects and which protected his majesty in safety and peace with which the king was greatly offended and said that then he should be under the law which was treason to affirm as he said to which i said that bracton saith quod rex non debed esse sub homine sed sub deo et lege that the king ought not to be under any man but under god and the law among the first modern authors to use the term and give the principle theoretical foundations was samuel rutherford in lex rex 16443 the title latin for the law is king subverts the traditional formulation rex lex the king is law23 john locke also discussed this issue in his second treatise of government 1690 the natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man but to have only the law of nature for his rule the liberty of man in society is to be under no other legislative power but that established by consent in the commonwealth nor under the dominion of any will or restraint of any law but what that legislative shall enact according to the trust put in it freedom then is not what sir robert filmer tells us observations a 55 a liberty for every one to do what he lists to live as he pleases and not to be tied by any laws but freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by common to every one of that society and made by the legislative power erected in it a liberty to follow my own will in all things where the rule prescribes not and not to be subject to the inconstant uncertain unknown arbitrary will of another man as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature24 the principle was also discussed by montesquieu in the spirit of the laws 174825 the phrase rule of law appears in samuel johnsons dictionary 175526 in 1776 the notion that no one is above the law was popular during the founding of the united states for example thomas paine wrote in his pamphlet common sense that in america the law is king for as in absolute governments the king is law so in free countries the law ought to be king and there ought to be no other27 in 1780 john adams enshrined this principle in the massachusetts constitution by seeking to establish a government of laws and not of men28 the influence of britain france and the united states contributed to spreading the principle of the rule of law to other countries around the world2930 meaning and categorization of interpretationsedit the oxford english dictionary has defined rule of law this way2 the authority and influence of law in society esp when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behaviour hence the principle whereby all members of a society including those in government are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law it stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law for example by divine right despite wide use by politicians judges and academics the rule of law has been described as an exceedingly elusive notion31 among modern legal theorists one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified a formalist or thin definition and a substantive or thick definition one occasionally encounters a third functional conception32 formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the justness of law itself but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on or derived from the rule of law33 most legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics meaning that the law must be publicly declared prohibitions or exigencies with prospective application punishments or consequences tied to a given prohibition or exigency and possess the characteristics of generality usually meaning consistency and comprehensibility equality that is applied equally throughout all society and certainty that is certainty of application for a given situation but there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law others including a few legal theorists believe that the rule of law necessarily entails protection of individual rights within legal theory these two approaches to the rule of law are seen as the two basic alternatives respectively labelled the formal and substantive approaches still there are other views as well some believe that democracy is part of the rule of law34 the formal interpretation is more widespread than the substantive interpretation formalists hold that the law must be prospective wellknown and have characteristics of generality equality and certainty other than that the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law32 this formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights but recognizes the existence of rule of law in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights the substantive interpretation holds that the rule of law intrinsically protects some or all individual rights the functional interpretation of the term rule of law consistent with the traditional english meaning contrasts the rule of law with the rule of man34 according to the functional view a society in which government officers have a great deal of discretion has a low degree of rule of law whereas a society in which government officers have little discretion has a high degree of rule of law34 upholding the rule of law can sometimes require the punishment of those who commit offenses that are justifiable under natural law but not statutory law35 the rule of law is thus somewhat at odds with flexibility even when flexibility may be preferable34 the ancient concept of rule of law can be distinguished from rule by law according to political science professor li shuguang the differenceis that under the rule of law the law is preeminent and can serve as a check against the abuse of power under rule by law the law is a mere tool for a government that suppresses in a legalistic fashion36 status in various jurisdictionsedit the rule of law has been considered as one of the key dimensions that determine the quality and good governance of a country37 research like the worldwide governance indicators defines the rule of law as the extent to which agents have confidence and abide by the rules of society and in particular the quality of contract enforcement the police and the courts as well as the likelihood of crime or violence37 based on this definition the worldwide governance indicators project has developed aggregate measurements for the rule of law in more than 200 countries as seen in the map below38 a government based on the rule of law can be called a nomocracy from the greek nomos law and kratos power or rule39 europeedit the preamble of the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms says the governments of european countries which are likeminded and have a common heritage of political traditions ideals freedom and the rule of law in france and germany the concepts of rule of law etat de droit and rechtsstaat respectively are analogous to the principles of constitutional supremacy and protection of fundamental rights from public authorities see public law particularly the legislature4041 france was one of the early pioneers of the ideas of the rule of law42 the german interpretation is more rigid but similar to that of france and the united kingdom4344 finlands constitution explicitly requires rule of law by stipulating that the exercise of public powers shall be based on an act in all public activity the law shall be strictly observed united kingdomedit main article rule of law in the united kingdom in the united kingdom the rule of law is a longstanding principle of the way the country is governed dating from magna carta in 1215 and the bill of rights 1689234546 in the 19th century a v dicey a constitutional scholar and lawyer wrote of the twin pillars of the british constitution in his classic work introduction to the study of the law of the constitution 1885 these two pillars are the rule of law and parliamentary sovereignty47 americasedit united statesedit 2005 map of worldwide governance indicators which attempts to measure the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society

below the selected country all government officers of the united states including the president the justices of the supreme court state judges and legislators and all members of congress pledge first and foremost to uphold the constitution these oaths affirm that the rule of law is superior to the rule of any human leader48 at the same time the federal government has considerable discretion the legislative branch is free to decide what statutes it will write as long as it stays within its enumerated powers and respects the constitutionally protected rights of individuals likewise the judicial branch has a degree of judicial discretion49 and the executive branch also has various discretionary powers including prosecutorial discretion scholars continue to debate whether the us constitution adopted a particular interpretation of the rule of law and if so which one for example john harrison asserts that the word law in the constitution is simply defined as that which is legally binding rather than being defined by formal or substantive criteria and therefore judges do not have discretion to decide that laws fail to satisfy such unwritten and vague criteria50 law professor frederick mark gedicks disagrees writing that cicero augustine thomas aquinas and the framers of the us constitution believed that an unjust law was not really a law at all51 some modern scholars contend that the rule of law has been corroded during the past century by the instrumental view of law promoted by legal realists such as oliver wendell holmes and roscoe pound for example brian tamanaha asserts the rule of law is a centuriesold ideal but the notion that law is a means to an end became entrenched only in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries52 others argue that the rule of law has survived but was transformed to allow for the exercise of discretion by administrators for much of american history the dominant notion of the rule of law in this setting has been some version of a v diceys no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary courts of the land that is individuals should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction as the dockets of worker compensation commissions public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute such as the extent of an injury in a workers compensation case would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place even charles evans hughes a chief justice of the united states believed you must have administration and you must have administration by administrative officers by 1941 a compromise had emerged if administrators adopted procedures that moreorless tracked the ordinary legal manner of the courts further review of the facts by the ordinary courts of the land was unnecessary that is if you had your day in commission the rule of law did not require a further day in court thus diceys rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form53 james wilson said during the philadelphia convention in 1787 that laws may be unjust may be unwise may be dangerous may be destructive and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the judges in refusing to give them effect george mason agreed that judges could declare an unconstitutional law void but with regard to every law however unjust oppressive or pernicious which did not come plainly under this description they would be under the necessity as judges to give it a free course54 chief justice john marshall joined by justice joseph story took a similar position in 1827 when its existence as law is denied that existence cannot be proved by showing what are the qualities of a law55 asiaedit east asian cultures are influenced by two schools of thought confucianism which advocated good governance as rule by leaders who are benevolent and virtuous and legalism which advocated strict adherence to law the influence of one school of thought over the other has varied throughout the centuries one study indicates that throughout east asia only south korea singapore japan taiwan and hong kong have societies that are robustly committed to a lawbound state56 according to awzar thi a member of the asian human rights commission the rule of law in thailand cambodia and most of asia is weak or nonexistent apart from a number of states and territories across the continent there is a huge gulf between the rule of law rhetoric and reality in thailand the police force is an organized crime gang in cambodia judges are proxies for the ruling political party that a judge may harbor political prejudice or apply the law unevenly are the smallest worries for an ordinary criminal defendant in asia more likely ones are will the police fabricate the evidence will the prosecutor bother to show up will the judge fall asleep will i be poisoned in prison will my case be completed within a decade57 in countries such as china and vietnam the transition to a market economy has been a major factor in a move toward the rule of law because a rule of law is important to foreign investors and to economic development it remains unclear whether the rule of law in countries like china and vietnam will be limited to commercial matters or will spill into other areas as well and if so whether that spillover will enhance prospects for related values such as democracy and human rights58 the rule of law in china has been widely discussed and debated by both legal scholars and politicians in china in thailand a kingdom that has had a constitution since the initial attempt to overthrow the absolute monarchy system in 1932 the rule of law has been more of a principle than actual practicecitation needed ancient prejudices and political bias have been present in the three branches of government with each of their foundings and justice has been processed formally according to the law but in fact more closely aligned with royalist principles that are still advocated in the 21st centurycitation needed in november 2013 thailand faced still further threats to the rule of law when the executive branch rejected a supreme court decision over how to select senatorscitation needed in india the longest constitutional text in the history of the world has governed that country since 1950 although the constitution of india may have been intended to provide details that would limit the opportunity for judicial discretion the more text there is in a constitution the greater opportunity the judiciary may have to exercise judicial review59 according to indian journalist harish khare the rule of law or rather the constitution is in danger of being supplanted by the rule of judges60 japan had centuries of tradition prior to world war ii during which there were laws but they did not provide a central organizing principle for society and they did not constrain the powers of government boadi 2001 as the 21st century began the percentage of people who were lawyers and judges in japan remained very low relative to western europe and the united states and legislation in japan tended to be terse and general leaving much discretion in the hands of bureaucrats6162 organizationsedit various organizations are involved in promoting the rule of law international commission of juristsedit in 1959 an international gathering of over 185 judges lawyers and law professors from 53 countries meeting in new delhi and speaking as the international commission of jurists made a declaration as to the fundamental principle of the rule of law this was the declaration of delhi they declared that the rule of law implies certain rights and freedoms that it implies an independent judiciary and that it implies social economic and cultural conditions conducive to human dignity the declaration of delhi did not however suggest that the rule of law requires legislative power to be subject to judicial review63 united nationsedit the secretarygeneral of the united nations defines the rule of law as64 a principle of governance in which all persons institutions and entities public and private including the state itself are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated equally enforced and independently adjudicated and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards it requires as well measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of law equality before the law accountability to the law fairness in the application of the law separation of powers participation in decisionmaking legal certainty avoidance of arbitrariness and procedural and legal transparency the general assembly has considered rule of law as an agenda item since 1992 with renewed interest since 2006 and has adopted resolutions at its last three sessions65 the security council has held a number of thematic debates on the rule of law66 and adopted resolutions emphasizing the importance of these issues in the context of women peace and security67 children in armed conflict68 and the protection of civilians in armed conflict69 the peacebuilding commission has also regularly addressed rule of law issues with respect to countries on its agenda70 the vienna declaration and programme of action also requires the rule of law be included in human rights education71 international bar associationedit the council of the international bar association passed a resolution in 2009 endorsing a substantive or thick definition of the rule of law72 an independent impartial judiciary the presumption of innocence the right to a fair and public trial without undue delay a rational and proportionate approach to punishment a strong and independent legal profession strict protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client equality of all before the law these are all fundamental principles of the rule of law accordingly arbitrary arrests secret trials indefinite detention without trial cruel or degrading treatment or punishment intimidation or corruption in the electoral process are all

the iba calls upon all countries to respect these fundamental principles it also calls upon its members to speak out in support of the rule of law within their respective communities world justice projectedit as used by the world justice project a nonprofit organization committed to advancing the rule of law around the world the rule of law refers to a rulesbased system in which the following four universal principles are upheld73 1 the government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law 2 the laws are clear publicized stable fair and protect fundamental rights including the security of persons and property 3 the process by which the laws are enacted administered and enforced is accessible fair and efficient 4 access to justice is provided by competent independent and ethical adjudicators attorneys or representatives and judicial officers who are of sufficient number have adequate resources and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve the world justice project has developed an index to measure the extent to which countries adhere to the rule of law in practice the wjp rule of law index is composed of 9 factors and 52 subfactors and covers a variety of dimensions of the rule of law—such as whether government officials are accountable under the law and whether legal institutions protect fundamental rights and allow ordinary people access to justice74 the international development law organization idloedit the international development law organization idlo is an intergovernmental organization with a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development it works to empower people and communities to claim their rights and provides governments with the knowhow to realize them75 it supports emerging economies and middleincome countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity76 it is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in more than 170 countries around the world77 the international development law organization has a holistic definition of the rule of law more than a matter of due process the rule of law is an enabler of justice and development the three notions are interdependent when realized they are mutually reinforcing for idlo as much as a question of laws and procedure the rule of law is a culture and daily practice it is inseparable from equality from access to justice and education from access to health and the protection of the most vulnerable it is crucial for the viability of communities and nations and for the environment that sustains them78 idlo is headquartered in rome and has a branch office in the hague and has permanent observer status

expect a response from their fellow rule of law practitioners worldwide on their experiences in addressing rule of law issues in relation to economicsedit one important aspect of the ruleoflaw initiatives is the study and analysis of the rule of law’s impact on economic development the ruleoflaw movement cannot be fully successful in transitional and developing countries without an answer to the question does the rule of law matter for economic development or not80 constitutional economics is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks and such a framework includes government spending on the judiciary which in many transitional and developing countries is completely controlled by the executive it is useful to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary corruption by the executive branch in contrast to corruption by private actors the standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit the availability of an effective court system to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations is a key element for the success of the ruleoflaw endeavor81 the rule of law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries to date the term “rule of law” has been used primarily in the englishspeaking countries and it is not yet fully clarified even with regard to such wellestablished democracies as for instance sweden denmark france germany or japan a common language between lawyers of common law and civil law countries as well as between legal communities of developed and developing countries is critically important for research of links between the rule of law and real economy82 the rule of law primarily connotes protection of property rights83 the economist f a hayek analyzed how the rule of law might be beneficial to the free market hayek proposed that under the rule of law individuals would be able to make wise investments and future plans with some confidence in a successful return on investment when he stated under the rule of law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ad hoc action within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts84 studies have shown that weak rule of law for example discretionary regulatory enforcement discourages investment economists have found for example that a rise in discretionary regulatory enforcement caused us firms to abandon international investments85 in relation to cultureedit the treaty on the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historic monuments or roerich pact is an interamerican treaty the most important idea of the roerich pact is the legal recognition that the defense of cultural objects is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military purposes and the protection of culture always has precedence over any military necessity the roerich pact signed on april 15 1935 by the representatives of 21 american states in the oval office of the white house washington dc it was the first international treaty signed in the oval office86 the hague convention for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict is the first international treaty that focuses on the protection of cultural property in armed conflict it was signed at the hague netherlands on 14 may 1954 and entered into force on 7 august 1956 as of june 2017 it has been ratified by 128 states87 the rule of law can be hampered when there is a disconnect between legal and popular consensus an example is intellectual property under the auspices of the world intellectual property organization nominally strong copyright laws have been implemented throughout most of the world but because the attitude of much of the population does not conform to these laws a rebellion against ownership rights has manifested in rampant piracy including an increase in peertopeer file sharing88 similarly in russia tax evasion is common and a person who admits he does not pay taxes is not judged or criticized by his colleagues and friends because the tax system is viewed as unreasonable89 bribery likewise has different normative implications across cultures83
