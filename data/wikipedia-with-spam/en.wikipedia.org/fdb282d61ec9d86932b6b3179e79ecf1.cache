complete interoperability certification testing1 devices that can use wifi technology include personal computers videogame consoles phones and tablets digital cameras smart tvs digital audio players and modern printers wifi compatible devices can connect to the internet via a wlan and a wireless access point such an access point or hotspot has a range of about 20 meters 66 feet indoors and a greater range outdoors hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points

islands with a uhf wireless packet network alohanet and the aloha protocol were early forerunners to ethernet and later the ieee 80211 protocols respectively a 1985 ruling by the us federal communications commission released the ism band for unlicensed use2 these frequency bands are the same ones used by equipment such as microwave ovens and are subject to interference in 1991 ncr corporation with att corporation invented the precursor to 80211 intended for use in cashier systems under the name wavelan the australian radioastronomer dr john osullivan with his colleagues terence percival graham daniels diet ostry and john deane3 developed a key patent used in wifi as a byproduct of a commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro research project a failed experiment to detect exploding mini black holes the size of an atomic particle4 dr osullivan and his colleagues are credited with inventing wifi56 in 1992 and 1996 csiro obtained patents7 for a method later used in wifi to unsmear the signal8 the first version of the 80211 protocol was released in 1997 and provided up to 2 mbits link speeds this was updated in 1999 with 80211b to permit 11 mbits link speeds and this proved to be popular in 1999 the wifi alliance formed as a trade association to hold the wifi trademark under which most products are sold9 wifi uses a large number of patents held by many different organizations10 in april 2009 14 technology companies agreed to pay csiro 1 billion for infringements on csiro patents11 this led to australia labeling wifi as an australian invention12 though this has been the subject of some controversy1314 csiro won a further 220 million settlement for wifi patentinfringements in 2012 with global firms in the united states required to pay the csiro licensing rights estimated to be worth an additional 1 billion in royalties111516 in 2016 the wireless local area network test bed was chosen as australias contribution to the exhibition a history of the world in 100 objects held in the national museum of australia17 etymologyedit the name wifi commercially used at least as early as august 199918 was coined by the brandconsulting firm interbrand the wifi alliance had hired interbrand to create a name that was a little catchier than ieee 80211b direct sequence1920 phil belanger a founding member of the wifi alliance who presided over the selection of the name wifi has stated that interbrand invented wifi as a pun upon the word hifi21 interbrand also created the wifi logo the yinyang wifi logo indicates the certification of a product for interoperability22 the wifi alliance used the nonsense advertising slogan the standard for wireless fidelity for a short time after the brand name was created192223 the name was however never officially wireless fidelity24 nevertheless the wifi alliance was also called the wireless fidelity alliance inc in some publications25 and the ieees own website has stated wifi is a short name for wireless fidelity26 nonwifi technologies intended for fixed points such as motorola canopy are usually described as fixed wireless alternative wireless technologies include mobile phone standards such as 2g 3g 4g and lte the name is sometimes written as wifi wifi or wifi but these are not approved by the wifi alliance wifi adhoc modeedit wifi nodes operating in adhoc mode refers to devices talking directly to each other without the need to first talk to an access point also known as base station adhoc mode was first invented and realized by chai k toh in his 1996 invention of wifi adhoc routing implemented on lucent wavelan 80211a wireless on ibm thinkpads over a size nodes scenario spanning a region of over a mile the success was recorded in mobile computing magazine 199927 and later published formally in ieee transactions on wireless communications 200228 and acm sigmetrics performance evaluation review 200129 wifi certificationedit see also wifi alliance the ieee does not test equipment for compliance with their standards the nonprofit wifi alliance was formed in 1999 to fill this void — to establish and enforce standards for interoperability and backward compatibility and to promote wireless localareanetwork technology as of 2010update the wifi alliance consisted of more than 375 companies from around the world3031 the wifi alliance enforces the use of the wifi brand to technologies based on the ieee 80211 standards from the ieee this includes wireless local area network wlan connections device to device connectivity such as wifi peer to peer aka wifi direct personal area network pan local area network lan and even some limited wide area network wan connections manufacturers with membership in the wifi alliance whose products pass the certification process gain the right to mark those products with the wifi logo specifically the certification process requires conformance to the ieee 80211 radio standards the wpa and wpa2 security standards and the eap authentication standard certification may optionally include tests of ieee 80211 draft standards interaction with cellularphone technology in converged devices and features relating to security setup multimedia and powersaving32 not every wifi device is submitted for certification the lack of wifi certification does not necessarily imply that a device is incompatible with other wifi devices33 the wifi alliance may or may not sanction derivative terms such as super wifi34 coined by the us federal communications commission fcc to describe proposed networking in the uhf tv band in the us35 ieee 80211 standardedit this netgear wifi router contains dual bands for transmitting the 80211 standard across the 24 and 5 ghz spectrums main article ieee 80211 the ieee 80211 standard is a set of media access control mac and physical layer phy specifications for implementing wireless local area network wlan computer communication in the 24 36 5 and 60 ghz frequency bands they are created and maintained by the ieee lanman standards committee ieee 802 the base version of the standard was released in 1997 and has had subsequent amendments the standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the wifi brand while each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products36 as a result in the market place each revision tends to become its own standard usesedit a japanese sticker indicating to the public that a location is within range of a wifi network a dot with curved lines radiating from it is a common symbol for wifi representing a point transmitting a signal37 to connect to a wifi lan a computer has to be equipped with a wireless network interface controller the combination of computer and interface controller is called a station for all stations that share a single radio frequency communication channel transmissions on this channel are received by all stations within range38 the transmission is not guaranteed to be delivered and is therefore a besteffort delivery mechanism a carrier wave is used to transmit the data the data is organised in packets on an ethernet link referred to as ethernet frames39 internet accessedit wifi technology may be used to provide internet access to devices that are within the range of a wireless network that is connected to the internet the coverage of one or more interconnected access points hotspots can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage for example public outdoor wifi technology has been used successfully in wireless mesh networks in london uk an international example is fon wifi provides service in private homes businesses as well as in public spaces at wifi hotspots set up either freeofcharge or commercially often using a captive portal webpage for access organizations and businesses such as airports hotels and restaurants often provide freeuse hotspots to attract customers enthusiasts or authorities who wish to provide services or even to promote business in selected areas sometimes provide free wifi access routers that incorporate a digital subscriber line modem or a cable modem and a wifi access point often set up in homes and other buildings provide internet access and internetworking to all devices connected to them wirelessly or via cable similarly batterypowered routers may include a cellular internet radiomodem and wifi access point when subscribed to a cellular data carrier they allow nearby wifi stations to access the internet over 2g 3g or 4g networks using the tethering technique many smartphones have a builtin capability of this sort including those based on android blackberry bada ios iphone windows phone and symbian though carriers often disable the feature or charge a separate fee to enable it especially for customers with unlimited data plans internet packs provide standalone facilities of this type as well without use of a smartphone examples include the mifi and wibrobranded devices some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile internet wifi access points wifi also connects places that normally dont have network access such as kitchens and garden sheds google is intending to use the technology to allow rural areas to enjoy connectivity by utilizing a broad mix of projection and routing services google also intends to bring connectivity to africa and some asian lands by launching blimps that will allow for internet connection with wifi technology40 citywide wifiedit further information municipal wireless network an outdoor wifi access point in the early 2000s many cities around the world announced plans to construct citywide wifi networks there are many successful examples in 2004 mysore became indias first wifienabled city a company called wifiynet has set up hotspots in mysore covering the complete city and a few nearby villages41 in 2005 st cloud florida and sunnyvale california became the first cities in the united states to offer citywide free wifi from metrofi42 minneapolis has generated 12 million in profit annually for its provider43 in may 2010 london mayor boris johnson pledged to have londonwide wifi by 201244 several boroughs including westminster and islington4546 already had extensive outdoor wifi coverage at that point officials in south koreas capital seoul are moving to provide free internet access at more than 10000 locations around the city including outdoor public spaces major streets and densely populated residential areas seoul will grant leases to kt lg telecom and sk telecom the companies will invest 44 million in the project which was to be completed in 201547 campuswide wifiedit many traditional university campuses in the developed world provide at least partial wifi coverage carnegie mellon university built the first campuswide wireless internet network called wireless andrew at its pittsburgh campus in 1993 before wifi branding originated484950 by february 1997 the cmu wifi zone was fully operational many universities collaborate in providing wifi access to students and staff through the eduroam international authentication infrastructure wifi ad hoc versus wifi directedit wifi also allows communications directly from one computer to another without an access point intermediary this is called ad hoc wifi transmission this wireless ad hoc network mode has proven popular with multiplayer handheld game consoles such as the nintendo ds playstation portable digital cameras and other consumer electronics devices some devices can also share their internet connection using ad hoc becoming hotspots or virtual routers51 similarly the wifi alliance promotes the specification wifi direct for file transfers and media sharing through a new discovery and securitymethodology52 wifi direct launched in october 201053 another mode of direct communication over wifi is tunneled direct link setup tdls which enables two devices on the same wifi network to communicate directly instead of via the access point54 a keychainsize wifi detector wifi radio spectrumedit main article list of wlan channels 80211b and 80211g use the 24 ghz ism band operating in the united states under part 15 rules and regulations because of this choice of frequency band 80211b and g equipment may occasionally suffer interference from microwave ovens cordless telephones and bluetooth devices spectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide australia and europe allow for an additional two channels 12 13 beyond the 11 permitted in the united states for the 24 ghz band while japan has three more 12–14 in the us and other countries 80211a and 80211g devices may be operated without a license as allowed in part 15 of the fcc rules and regulations a wifi signal occupies five channels in the 24 ghz band any two channel numbers that differ by five or more such as 2 and 7 do not overlap the oftrepeated adage that channels 1 6 and 11 are the only nonoverlapping channels is therefore not accurate channels 1 6 and 11 are the only group of three nonoverlapping channels in north america and the united kingdom in europe and japan using channels 1 5 9 and 13 for 80211g and 80211n is recommendedcitation needed 80211a uses the 5 ghz unii band which for much of the world offers at least 23 nonoverlapping channels rather than the 24 ghz ism frequency band where adjacent channels overlap interferenceedit for more details on this topic see electromagnetic interference at 24 ghz wifi connections can be disrupted or the internet speed lowered by having other devices in the same area many 24 ghz 80211b and 80211g accesspoints default to the same channel on initial startup contributing to congestion on certain channels wifi pollution or an excessive number of access points in the area especially on the neighboring channel can prevent access and interfere with other devices use of other access points caused by overlapping channels in the 80211gb spectrum as well as with decreased signaltonoise ratio snr between access points this can become a problem in highdensity areas such as large apartment complexes or office buildings with many wifi access points additionally other devices use the 24 ghz band microwave ovens ism band devices security cameras zigbee devices bluetooth devices video senders cordless phones baby monitors55 and in some countries amateur radio all of which can cause significant additional interference it is also an issue when municipalities56 or other large entities such as universities seek to provide large area coverage service set identifier ssidedit see also service set 80211 network in addition to running on different channels multiple wifi networks can share channels a service set is the set of all the devices associated with a particular wifi network the service set can be local independent extended or mesh each service set has an associated identifier the 32byte service set identifier ssid which identifies the particular network the ssid is configured within the devices that are considered part of the network and it is transmitted in the packets receivers ignore wireless packets from networks with a different ssid throughputedit as the 80211 specifications evolved to support higher throughput the bandwidth requirements also increased to support them 80211n uses double the radio spectrumbandwidth 40 mhz compared to 80211a or 80211g 20 mhz76 this means there can be only one 80211n network on the 24 ghz band at a given location without interference tofrom other wlan traffic 80211n can also be set to limit itself to 20 mhz bandwidth to prevent interference in dense communitycitation needed many newer consumer devices support the latest 80211ac standard which uses the 5 ghz band exclusively and is capable of multistation wlan throughput of at least 1 gigabit per second and a single station throughput of at least 500 mbits in the first quarter of 2016 the wifi alliance certifies devices compliant with the 80211ac standard as wifi certified ac this new standard uses several advanced signal processing techniques such as multiuser mimo and 4x4 spatial multiplexing streams and large channel bandwidth 160 mhz to achieve the gigabit throughput 70 of all access point sales revenue came from 80211ac devices57 hardwareedit wifi whitelist triggered on an hp laptop wifi allows cheaper deployment of local area networks lans also spaces where cables cannot be run such as outdoor areas and historical buildings can host wireless lans however building walls of certain materials such as stone with high metal content can block wifi signals manufacturers are building wireless network adapters into most laptops the price of chipsets for wifi continues to drop making it an economical networking option included in even more devices58 different competitive brands of access points and

adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as pci minipci usb expresscard cardbus and pc card as of 2010update most newer laptop computers come equipped with built in internal adapters wireless routers integrate a wireless access point ethernet switch and internal router firmware application that provides ip routing nat and dns forwarding through an integrated waninterface a wireless router allows wired and wireless ethernet lan devices to connect to a usually single wan device such as a cable modem or a dsl modem a wireless router allows all three devices mainly the access point and router to be configured through one central utility this utility is usually an integrated web server that is accessible to wired and wireless lan clients and often optionally to wan clients this utility may also be an application that is run on a computer as is the case with as apples airport which is managed with the airport utility on macos and ios59 wireless network bridges connect a wired network to a wireless network a bridge differs from an access point an access point connects wireless devices to a wired network at the datalink layer two wireless bridges may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable such as between two separate homes or for devices which do not have wireless networking capability but have wired networking capability such as consumer entertainment devices alternatively a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device which supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard which is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature external dongle or inbuilt supported by the device eg enabling wirelessn speeds up to the maximum supported speed on the wired ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point for a device which only supports wirelessg a dualband wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5 ghz wireless network operation on a device which only supports 24 ghz wireless networking functionality and has a wired ethernet port wireless rangeextenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network strategically placed rangeextenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in lshaped corridors wireless devices connected through repeaters will suffer from an increased latency for each hop as well as from a reduction in the maximum data throughput that is available in addition the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless rangeextenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case where but a single user migrates around a network employing extenders for this reason wireless rangeextenders work best in networks supporting very low traffic throughput requirements such as for cases where but a single user with a wifi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and nonextended portions of the total connected network additionally a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain will have a data throughput that is also limited by the weakest link existing in the chain between where the connection originates and where the connection ends networks employing wireless extenders are also more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network the security standard wifi protected setup allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the internet with ease wifi protected setup has 2 configurations the push button configuration and the pin configuration these embedded devices are also called the internet of things and are lowpower batteryoperated embedded systems a number of wifi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded wifi such as gainspan60 embedded systemsedit embedded serialtowifi module increasingly in the last few years particularly as of 2007update embedded wifi modules have become available that incorporate a realtime operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device which has and communicates via a serial port61 this allows the design of simple monitoring devices an example is a portable ecg device monitoring a patient at home this wifienabled device can communicate via the internet62 these wifi modules are designed by oems so that implementers need only minimal wifi knowledge to provide wifi connectivity for their products in june 2014 texas instruments introduced the first arm cortexm4 microcontroller with an onboard dedicated wifi mcu the simplelink cc3200 it makes embedded systems with wifi connectivity possible to build as singlechip devices which reduces their cost and minimum size making it more practical to build wirelessnetworked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objectscitation needed rangeedit see also longrange wifi the wifi signal range depends on the frequency band radio power output antenna gain and antenna type as well as the modulation technique lineofsight is the thumbnail guide but reflection and refraction can have a significant impact an access point compliant with either 80211b or 80211g using the stock antenna might have a range of 100 m 0062 mi the same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna 15 db gain might have a range over 20 miles higher gain rating dbi indicates further deviation generally toward the horizontal from a theoretical perfect isotropic radiator and therefore the further the antenna can project a usable signal as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna63 for example an 8 dbi antenna used with a 100 mw driver will have a similar horizontal range to a 6 dbi antenna being driven at 500 mw note that this assumes that radiation in the vertical is lost this may not be the case in some situations especially in large buildings or within a waveguide in the above example a directional waveguide could cause the low power 6 dbi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dbi antenna which is not in a waveguide even if they are both being driven at 100 mw ieee 80211n however can more than double the range64 range also varies with frequency band wifi in the 24 ghz frequency block has slightly better range than wifi in the 5 ghz frequency block used by 80211a and optionally by 80211n on wireless routers with detachable antennas it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas which have higher gain in particular directions outdoor ranges can be improved to many kilometers through the use of high gain directional antennas at the router and remote devices in general the maximum amount of power that a wifi device can transmit is limited by local regulations such as fcc part 15 in the us equivalent isotropically radiated power eirp in the european union is limited to 20 dbm 100 mw to reach requirements for wireless lan applications wifi has fairly high power consumption compared to some other standards technologies such as bluetooth designed to support wireless personal area network pan applications provide a much shorter propagation range between 1 and 100 m65 and so in general have a lower power consumption other lowpower technologies such as zigbee have fairly long range but much lower data rate the high power consumption of wifi makes battery life in mobile devices a concern researchers have developed a number of no new wires technologies to provide alternatives to wifi for applications in which wifis indoor range is not adequate and where installing new wires such as cat6 is not possible or costeffective for example the itut ghn standard for high speed local area networks uses existing home wiring coaxial cables phone lines and power lines although ghn does not provide some of the advantages of wifi such as mobility or outdoor use it is designed for applications such as iptv distribution where indoor range is more important than mobility for the best performance a number of people only recommend using wireless networking as a supplement to wired networking66 due to the complex nature of radio propagation at typical wifi frequencies particularly the effects of signal reflection off trees and buildings algorithms can only approximately predict wifi signal strength for any given area in relation to a transmitter67 this effect does not apply equally to longrange wifi since longer links typically operate from towers that transmit above the surrounding foliage the practical range of wifi essentially confines mobile use to such applications as inventorytaking machines in warehouses or in retail spaces barcodereading devices at checkout stands or receivingshipping stationscitation neededdubious – discuss mobile use of wifi over wider ranges is limited for instance to uses such as in an automobile moving from one hotspot to another other wireless technologies are more suitable for communicating with moving vehicles distance records distance records using nonstandard devices include 382 km 237 mi in june 2007 held by ermanno pietrosemoli and eslared of venezuela transferring about 3 mb of data between the mountaintops of el águila and platillon6869 the swedish space agency transferred data 420 km 260 mi using 6 watt amplifiers to reach an overhead stratospheric balloon70 multiple access pointsedit increasing the number of wifi access points provides network redundancy better range support for fast roaming and increased overall networkcapacity by using more channels or by defining smaller cells except for the smallest implementations such as home or small office networks wifi implementations have moved toward thin access points with more of the network intelligence housed in a centralized network appliance relegating individual access points to the role of dumb transceivers outdoor applications may use mesh topologies when multiple access points are deployed they are often configured with the same ssid clarification needed and security settings to form an extended service set wifi client devices will typically connect to the access point that can provide the strongest signal within that service set network securityedit main article wireless security the main issue with wireless network security is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as ethernet with wired networking one must either gain access to a building physically connecting into the internal network or break through an external firewall to enable wifi one merely needs to be within the range of the wifi network most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption717273 an attacker who has gained access to a wifi network router can initiate a dns spoofing attack against any other user of the network by forging a response before the queried dns server has a chance to reply74 securing methodsedit a common measure to deter unauthorized users involves hiding the access points name by disabling the ssid broadcast while effective against the casual user it is ineffective as a security method because the ssid is broadcast in the clear in response to a client ssid query another method is to only allow computers with known mac addresses to join the network75 but determined eavesdroppers may be able to join the network by spoofing an authorized address wired equivalent privacy wep encryption was designed to protect against casual snooping but it is no longer considered secure tools such as airsnort or aircrackng can quickly recover wep encryption keys76 because of weps weakness the wifi alliance approved wifi protected access wpa which uses tkip wpa was specifically designed to work with older equipment usually through a firmware upgrade though more secure than wep wpa has known vulnerabilities the more secure wpa2 using advanced encryption standard was introduced in 2004 and is supported by most new wifi devices wpa2 is fully compatible with wpa77 in 2017 a flaw in the wpa2 protocol was discovered allowing a key replay attack known as krack7879 a flaw in a feature added to wifi in 2007 called wifi protected setup wps allows wpa and wpa2 security to be bypassed and effectively broken in many situations the only remedy as of late 2011 is to turn off wifi protected setup80 which is not always possible virtual private networks are often used to secure wificitation needed data security

not enable any wireless security providing open wireless access to a lan to turn security on requires the user to configure the device usually via a software graphical user interface gui on unencrypted wifi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data including personal information such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection such as a vpn or secure hypertext transfer protocol over transport layer security https wifi protected access encryption wpa2 is considered secure provided a strong passphrase is used a proposed modification to wpa2 is wpaotp or wpa3 which stores an onchip optically generated onetime pad on all connected devices which is periodically updated via strong encryption then hashed with the data to be sent or receivedcitation needed this would be unbreakable using any even quantum computer system as the hashed data is essentially random and no pattern can be detected if it is implemented properly main disadvantage is that it would need multigb storage chips so would be expensive for the consumers piggybackingedit main article piggybacking internet access further information legality of piggybacking further information wifi protected setup § physical security issues piggybacking refers to access to a wireless internet connection by bringing ones own computer within the range of anothers wireless connection and using that service without the subscribers explicit permission or knowledge during the early popular adoption of 80211 providing open access points for anyone within range to use was encouragedby whom to cultivate wireless community networks81 particularly since people on average use only a fraction of their downstream bandwidth at any given time recreational logging and mapping of other peoples access points has become known as wardriving indeed many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service providing access to ones internet connection in this fashion may breach the terms of service or contract with the isp these activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions however legislation and case law differ considerably across the world a proposal to leave graffiti describing available services was called warchalking82 a florida court case determined that owner laziness was not to be a valid excusecitation needed piggybacking often occurs unintentionally – a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default unsecured settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network a user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication moreover a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal in combination with automatic discovery of other network resources see dhcp and zeroconf this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middleman when seeking a destination see maninthemiddle attack for example a user could inadvertently use an unsecure network to log into a website thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening if the website uses an unsecure protocol such as plain http without tls https an unauthorized user can obtain security information factory preset passphrase andor wifi protected setup pin from a label on a wireless access point can use this information or connect by the wifi protected setup pushbutton method to commit unauthorized andor unlawful activities health concernsedit further information wireless electronic devices and health the world health organization who says no health effects are expected from exposure to rf fields from base stations and wireless networks but notes that they promote research into effects from other rf sources83 although the whos international agency for research on cancer iarc later classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans group 2b84 a category used when a causal association is considered credible but when chance bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence85 this was based on risks associated with wireless phone use rather than wifi networks the united kingdoms health protection agency reported in 2007 that exposure to wifi for a year results in the same amount of radiation from a 20minute mobile phone call86 a review of studies involving 725 people who claimed electromagnetic hypersensitivity suggests that electromagnetic hypersensitivity is unrelated to the presence of emf although more research into this phenomenon is required87 see alsoedit
