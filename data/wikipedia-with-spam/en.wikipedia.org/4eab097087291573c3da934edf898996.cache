due to be completed in 2007 has been stalled since 2009 due to financing problems101 nippon moon described as a giant observation wheel by its designers102 was reported in september 2013 to be currently in development at that time its height was currently undisclosed but almost twice the scale of the wheel in london its location an unspecified japanese city was currently under wraps and its funding had yet to be entirely secured commissioned by ferris wheel investment co ltd and designed by unstudio in collaboration with arup mitsubishi heavy industries and experientia it was expected to have 32 individually themed capsules and take 40 minutes to rotate once103 the shanghai star initially planned as a 200metre 656 ft tall wheel to be built by 2005 was revised to 170 metres 558 ft with a completion date set in 2007 but then cancelled in 2006 due to political incorrectness104 an earlier proposal for a 250metre 820 ft structure the shanghai kiss with capsules ascending and descending a pair of towers which met at their peaks instead of a wheel was deemed too expensive at £100m105 rus3000 a 170metre 558 ft wheel planned to open in 2004106 in moscow107 has since been reported cancelled108 subsequently an approximately 180metre 591 ft109 wheel was considered for gorky central park of culture and leisure110111 and a 150metre 492 ft wheel proposed for location near sparrow

to carry 28 people113 the london eyes 32 ovoidal airconditioned passenger capsules each weigh 10 tonnes 11 short tons and can carry 25 people114 observation wheel is an alternative name for ferris wheel115116 in 1892 when the incorporation papers for the ferris wheel company constructors of the original 1893 chicago ferris wheel were filed the purpose of the company was stated as construction and operation of wheels of the ferris or other types for the purpose of observation or amusement8 some ferris wheels are marketed as observation wheels any distinction between the two names being at the discretion of the operator however the wheels whose operators reject the term ferris wheel are often those having most in common with the original 1893 chicago ferris wheel especially in terms of scale and being an iconic landmark for a city or event wheels with passenger cars mounted external to the rim and independently rotated by electric motors as opposed to wheels with cars suspended from the rim and kept upright by gravity are those most commonly referred to as observation wheels and their cars are often referred to as capsules however these alternative names are also sometimes used for wheels with conventional gravityoriented cars only four ferris wheels with motorised capsules have ever been built the 1676 m 550 ft high roller worlds tallest since march 2014 has externally mounted motorised capsules of a transparent spherical design61117 and is described as both a ferris wheel and an observation wheel by the media6061118119 the 165 m 541 ft singapore flyer has

observation wheel125 according to its operators who claim the london eye is often mistakenly called a ferris wheel this is not the case first the passenger capsules are completely enclosed and are climate controlled secondly the capsules are positioned on the outside of the wheel structure and are fully motorised and third the entire structure is supported by an aframe on one side only125 however the singapore flyer subsequently billed itself as the worlds largest observation wheel despite being supported on both sides126 and the official londoneyecom website also refers to the london eye as europes tallest ferris wheel127 southern star now melbourne star tallest in the southern hemisphere in 2008 the 120 m 394 ft melbourne star previously the southern star in australia has ovoidal externally mounted motorised capsules and is described by its operators as the only observation wheel in the southern hemisphere128 but also as a ferris wheel by the media129130131 official conceptual

transportable ferris wheels are designed to be operated at multiple locations as opposed to fixed wheels which are usually intended for permanent installation small transportable designs may be permanently mounted on trailers and can be moved intact larger transportable wheels are designed to be repeatedly dismantled and rebuilt some using water ballast instead of the permanent foundations of their fixed counterparts fixed wheels are also sometimes dismantled and relocated larger examples include the original ferris wheel which operated at two sites in chicago illinois and a third in st louis missouri technocosmostechnostar which moved to expoland osaka after expo 85 tsukuba ibaraki for which it was built ended and cosmo clock 21 which added 5 metres 16 ft onto its original 1075metre

astroworld houston texas from 1968 until 1980147 and galaxy which operated at six flags magic mountain valencia california both were manufactured by astron international corporationcitation needed swiss manufacturer intamin produced a similar series of rides comprising a vertical column supporting multiple horizontal arms with each arm supporting a ferris wheel the first intamin produced was giant wheel at hersheypark in hershey pennsylvania others include zodiac kings island mason ohio and scorpion parque de la ciudad buenos aires argentina a triple variant was custom designed for the marriott corporation each ride had three main components the wheels with their passenger cars a set of supporting arms and a single central supporting column each wheel rotated about the end of its own supporting arm the arms in turn would either pivot or rotate together as a single unit about the top of the supporting column the axis about which the rotating arms turned was offset from vertical so that as the arms rotated each arm and its corresponding wheel was raised and lowered this allowed one wheel to be horizontal at ground level and brought to a standstill for simultaneous loading and unloading of all its passenger cars while the other wheels continued to rotate vertically at considerable height sky whirl was the worlds first triple ferris wheel debuting at both marriotts great
