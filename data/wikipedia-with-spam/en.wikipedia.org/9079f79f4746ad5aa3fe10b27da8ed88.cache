case where google inc successfully defended a lawsuit for copyright infringement field argued that google infringed his exclusive right to reproduce his copyrighted works when it cached his website and made a copy of it available on its search engine google raised multiple defenses fair use implied license estoppel and digital millennium copyright act safe harbor protection the court granted googles motion for summary judgment and denied fields motion for summary judgment contents 1 background 2 ruling 21 direct infringement 22 implied license 23 estoppel 24 fair use 25 dmca safe harbor 3 references backgroundedit the plaintiff blake field is an attorney author and member of the state bar of nevada on april 6 2004 field filed a complaint against google asserting a single claim for copyright infringement due to googles alleged copying and distributing one of his works good tea that he had previously published on his personal website wwwblakeswritingcom on may 25 2004 field filed an amended complaint stating that google had infringed on an additional 50 works published by field on his personal website field sought 2550000 in statutory damages 50000 for each of the 51 registered copyrighted works in conjunction with injunctive relief the defendant google operates a popular search engine to enable users to search billions of websites google uses an automated program called the googlebot this program crawls the internet looking for new sites to include in its index once a site is found the googlebot creates a cached version of the site the cached version is then included in the search results of its search engine when a user clicks the link to the cached version the user can view a snapshot of the page as it appeared at the time the googlebot found the site website creators have the option of preventing the googlebot from indexing their sites by including a simple code in the html in addition websites can include code that allows the site to be included in googles index but that prevents google from caching the website field had actual knowledge of the googlebot he also was aware of the ways to prevent google from either listing his site at all or listing it but not providing a link to the cached version instead of opting out however he chose to allow google to both index and provide a link to the cached version rulingedit the district court jones j held that operator did not directly infringe on authors copyrighted works author granted operator implied license to display “cached” links to web pages containing his copyrighted works author was estopped from asserting copyright infringement claim against operator fair use doctrine protected operators use of authors works and search engine fell within protection of safe harbor provision of digital millennium copyright act dmca summary judgment for operator the court held that field decided to manufacture a claim for copyright infringement against google in the hopes of makingmoney from googles standard practice the court then went on to rule in googles favor on all of its defense theories direct infringementedit the court relied on two prior cases religious tech ctr v netcom online commn services inc and costar group inc v loopnet inc and held that volitional conduct on the part of the defendant is required for a showing of direct infringement in this case google is passive in the process googles computers respond automatically to the users request thus there was no volitional conduct on googles behalf and hence no direct infringement implied licenseedit courts usually do not require a copyright holder to affirmatively take steps to prevent infringement in this case however the court found that the plaintiff had granted google an implied nonexclusive license to display the work because of field’s failure in using meta tags to prevent his site from being cached by google this could reasonably be interpreted as a grant of a license for that use and so the courts held that a license for google to cache the site was implied because field failed to take the necessary steps when setting up his website estoppeledit the court invoked the facts supporting its finding of an implied license to support and reiterate that field could have prevented the caching did not do so and allowed google to detrimentally rely on the absence of metatags had google known the defendant’s objection to displaying cached versions of its website it would not have done so fair useedit the court applied the 4 statutory factors from 17 usc 107 and held that googles caching was fair use the first factor the purpose and character of the use weighed in googles favor the court stated that googles use was transformative and did not merely supersede fields use the court explained that fields use was to enrich the lives of others through poetry while googles use was to facilitate the operation of search engines the court identified multiple characteristics that distinguished googles use from fields including googles use is for archival purposes googles use allows users to track changes in websites googles use allows users to figure out why a particular page resulted from a search the court further held that googles commercial status was of little importance because the googles use was transformative the second factor the nature of the copyrighted works also weighed in favor of google because the works were available for free on fields website the third factor the amount and substantiality of the use weighed equally for both parties although google cached the entire website the fact that field made the works available on his website and the difference in the use of the two made this factor neutral the fourth factor the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work weighed in favor of google there was no market for fields works and the caching did not impact any potential market for his works the court considered an additional factor googles good faith in operating its system cache which favored fair use google used industry standard procedures that allowed website operators to prevent caching google promptly removed the caches to fields work when it learned that field did not want them dmca safe harboredit finally the court held that google qualified for the digital millennium copyright acts safe harbor provisions which states that “a service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief for infringement of copyright by reason of the intermediate and temporary storage of material on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider” referencesedit findings of fact and conclusions of law court order hosted at stanford limitations on liability relating to
