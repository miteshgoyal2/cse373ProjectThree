its city this goes beyond having the loudest fans theres genuine devotion here these people arrived a good 45 minutes early for last nights game 1 — and by these people i mean everyone with a ticket — then clapped their way through pregame warmups with such infectious enthusiasm that i remember saying to a friend no way these yahoos keep this up for three hours theyre going to burn out wrong you know what burned out my eardrums my head is still ringing59 ” simmons speculated that the oklahoma city bombing played a major part in the teams culture noting that thunder general manager sam presti has every new thunder player visit the oklahoma city national memorial and encourages players to look into the stands and consider that many of the teams fans were personally affected by the event he also noted however that the fact that the thunder is the only team from oklahoma city or indeed the state of oklahoma in one of the nations four major leagues contributes mightily to the citys devotion59 thunder fans are also reportedly much more likely to attend major home games than most other nba fanbases according to a source in the ticket industry only five percent of tickets to the
