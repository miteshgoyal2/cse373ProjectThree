gamblingedit jon kyl and bob goodlatte were among the first in the united states to draft legislation on online gambling in the late 1990s they introduced bills to the senate that would curb online gambling activities except for those that involved horse and dog races and state lotteries21 the bill by jon kyl known as the kyl bill was not passed in the end due to certain loopholes attorney jorge van at the time principal investigator of the national gambling impact study commission on internet gambling pointed out that under the kyl bill state lotteries would be able to offer a variety of games under the guise of a lottery including slot machines which ultimately would allow interactive wagering at home on the internet which the law aimed to prevent in the first place22 in september

the 2006 elections prior to it being added to the bill the gambling provisions had not been debated by any congressional committee although the general issue had been debated in multiple times in the

parenthood responded that 90 percent of its services are to provide contraception std and cancer testing and treatment and only 3 percent are abortionrelated a spokesperson for kyl later claimed the senator’s remark was not intended to be a factual statement but rather to illustrate that planned parenthood an organization that receives millions in taxpayer dollars does subsidize abortions politifact noted that planned parenthoods numbers from their most recent annual report year ending june 30 200933 are the result of selfreporting and that there is no national audit on such claims but stated their belief that kyl vastly overstated the number34 a political science professor writing at national review online suggested that perhaps kyls comments were based on the pregnancyrelated services provided to pregnant women citing planned parenthoods 2009 annual report figures and claiming that 98 of those services were for abortion35 the phrase not intended to be a factual statement was mocked by political comedians such as stephen colbert who joked you can’t call him out for being wrong when he never intended to be right363738 political campaignsedit see also united states

senate kyl cosponsored legislation that would give illegal immigrants up to five years to leave the country once there they could apply for permanent residence or be guest workers41 since fellow arizona senator john mccain opposed this legislation pederson tried to use the issue as a way of allying with mccain and dividing the republicans in arizona42 controversy also arose when each candidate accused the other of supporting the amnesty provisions in a 1986 immigration bill although both candidates deny ever supporting those provisions43 kyl appeared in the us national news near the end of the campaign as an example of a case where some bloggers were attempting to influence search engine results for searches on kyls name using google bombs if successful google searches would have produced high among the returns a link to a phoenix new times article suggesting kyls kowtowing to the bush administration and the radical right to the detriment of arizonans44 referencesedit jon
