the us uk australia and some other countries google removed the option to turn off the safesearch image filter entirely forcing users to enter more specific search queries to get adult content prior to the change three safesearch settings—on moderate and off—were available to users following the change two filter explicit results settings—on and off—were newly established the former and new on settings are similar and exclude explicit images from search results the new off setting still permits explicit images to appear in search results but users need to enter more specific search requests and no direct equivalent of the old off setting exists following the change because adding additional explicit search terms alters the search results the change brings image search results into line with googles existing settings for web and video search212223 some users have stated that the lack of a completely unfiltered option amounts to censorship by google a google spokesperson disagreed saying that google is not censoring any adult content but want to show users exactly what they are looking for—but we aim not to show sexuallyexplicit results unless a user is specifically searching for them24 online pharmaciesedit following a settlement with the united states food and drug administration ending google adwords advertising of canadian pharmacies that permitted americans access to

searchers may encounter a message which states in accordance with local laws and policies some of the results have not been displayed46 google issued a statement saying that removing search results is inconsistent with googles mission but that the alternative — being shut down entirely and thereby providing no information or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information is more inconsistent with our mission48 initially both the censored googlecn and the uncensored chineselanguage googlecom were available in june 2006 however china blocked googlecom once more49 some chinese internet users were critical of google for assisting the chinese government in repressing its own citizens particularly those dissenting against the government and advocating for human rights50
