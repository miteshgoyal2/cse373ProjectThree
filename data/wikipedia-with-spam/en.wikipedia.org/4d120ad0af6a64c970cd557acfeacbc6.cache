raised a catholic and was a member of the knights of malta30 he described his faith by saying i grew up as reported in a large family of catholics without even a decent ration of tentativeness among the lot of us about our religious faith31 as a child he attended st johns beaumont a prestigious catholic boarding school in england for a time before the outbreak of world war ii later he attended millbrook a protestant school but was permitted to attend catholic mass at a nearby church as a youth he became aware of anticatholic bias in the united states particularly through reading american freedom and catholic power a paul blanshard book that accused american catholics of having divided loyalties the release of his first book god and man at yale in 1951 was met with some specific criticism pertaining to his catholicism mcgeorge bundy dean of harvard at the time wrote in the atlantic that it seems strange for any roman catholic to undertake to speak for the yale religious tradition henry sloane coffin a yale trustee accused buckleys book of being distorted by his roman catholic point of view and stated that buckley should have attended fordham or some similar institution32 in his 1997 book nearer my god he condemned what he viewed as the supreme courts war against religion in the public school and argued that christian faith was being replaced by another god multiculturalism33 as an adult buckley regularly attended the traditional latin mass in connecticut10 he disapproved of the liturgical reforms following the second vatican council34 buckley also revealed an interest in the writings and revelations of the 20th century italian writer maria valtorta35 in his spiritual memoir buckley reproduced valtortas detailed accounts of jesus christs crucifixion which were based on valtortas visionary experiences of christ and the mystical revelations she reported experiencing between the years 1943–47 being shown jesus life in 1stcentury israel and recording the visions in her book the poem of the mangod first booksedit god and man at yaleedit buckley right and l brent bozell jr promote their book mccarthy and his enemies 1954 in 1951 buckleys first book god and man at yale was published the book was written in hamden connecticut where william and pat buckley had settled as newlyweds a critique of yale university the work argued that the school had strayed from its original educational mission critics claimed the work miscast the role of academic freedom36 buckley himself credited the attention the book received in the media to the introduction written by john chamberlain saying that it changed the course of his life and that the famous life magazine editorial writer had acted out of reckless generosity37 william f buckley jr was referred to in the novel the manchurian candidate by richard condon in 1959 as that fascinating young man who wrote about man and god at yale mccarthy and his enemiesedit in 1954 buckley cowrote a book mccarthy and his enemies with his brotherinlaw l brent bozell jr that strongly defended senator joseph mccarthy as a patriotic crusader against communism in mccarthy and his enemies he asserted that mccarthyism is a movement around which men of good will and stern morality can close ranks38 buckley worked as an editor for the american mercury in 1951 and 1952 but left after perceiving newly emerging antisemitic tendencies in the magazine39 national reviewedit buckley founded national review in 1955 at a time when there were few publications devoted to conservative commentary serving as editorinchief until 19904041 during that time national review became the standardbearer of american conservatism promoting the fusion of traditional conservatives and libertarians examining postwar conservative intellectual history kim phillipsfein writes the most influential synthesis of the subject remains george h nashs the conservative intellectual tradition since 1945 he argued that postwar conservatism brought together three powerful and partially contradictory intellectual currents that previously had largely been independent of each other libertarianism traditionalism and anticommunism each particular strain of thought had predecessors earlier in the twentieth and even nineteenth centuries but they were joined in their distinctive postwar formulation through the leadership of william f buckley jr and national review the fusion of these different competing and not easily reconciled schools of thought led to the creation nash argued of a coherent modern right4243 as editors and contributors buckley especially sought out intellectuals who were excommunists or had once worked on the far left including whittaker chambers william schlamm john dos passos frank meyer and james burnham44 when james burnham became one of the original senior editors he urged the adoption of a more pragmatic editorial position that would extend the influence of the magazine toward the political center smant 1991 finds that burnham overcame sometimes heated opposition from other members of the editorial board including meyer schlamm william rickenbacker and the magazines publisher william a rusher and had a significant impact on both the editorial policy of the magazine and on the thinking of buckley himself45 defining the boundaries of conservatismedit see also conservatism in the united states buckley and his editors used his magazine to define the boundaries of conservatism—and to exclude people or ideas or groups they considered unworthy of the conservative title46 therefore he denounced ayn rand the john birch society george wallace racists white supremacists and antisemites when he first met author ayn rand according to buckley she greeted him with the following you are much too intelligent to believe in god4748 in turn buckley felt that rands style as well as her message clashed with the conservative ethos49 and he decided that rands hostility to religion made her philosophy unacceptable to his understanding of conservatism after 1957 he attempted to weed her out of the conservative movement by publishing whittaker chamberss highly negative review of rands atlas shrugged5051 in 1964 he wrote of her desiccated philosophys conclusive incompatibility with the conservatives emphasis on transcendence intellectual and moral as well as the incongruity of tone that hard schematic implacable unyielding dogmatism that is in itself intrinsically objectionable whether it comes from the mouth of ehrenburg savonarola—or ayn rand52 other attacks were penned by garry wills and m stanton evans nevertheless burns argues her popularity and her influence on the right forced buckley and his circle into a reconsideration of how traditional notions of virtue and christianity could be integrated with allout support for capitalism53 views on segregation in the southedit james jackson kilpatrick 1920–2010 was a wellknown newspaper editor in richmond virginia who was a leader in supporting segregation and the control of the south by whites only maclean states the national review made kilpatrick its voice on the civil rights movement and the constitution as buckley and kilpatrick united north and south in a shared vision for the nation that included upholding white supremacy54 in the august 24 1957 issue buckleys editorial why the south must prevail spoke out explicitly in favor of temporary segregation in the south until long term equality could be achieved it argued that the central question that emerges is whether the white community in the south is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail politically and culturally in areas where it does not predominate numerically the sobering answer is yes—the white community is so entitled because for the time being it is the advanced race555657 his answer was that temporary segregation in the south was a good idea now in 1957 and the black population lacked the education economic or cultural development for racial equality to be possible claiming the white south had the right to impose superior mores for whatever period it takes to effect a genuine cultural equality between the races58596061 two weeks after that editorial was published another prominent conservative writer l brent bozell jr buckleys brotherinlaw wrote in the national review “this magazine has expressed views on the racial question that i consider dead wrong and capable of doing great hurt to the promotion of conservative causes there is a law involved and a constitution and the editorial gives white southerners leave to violate them both in order to keep the negro politically impotent6263 in 2004 he attempted to clarify his comments saying the point i made about white cultural supremacy was sociological and linking his usage of the word advancement to its usage in the name naacp continued the call for the advancement of colored people presupposes they are behind which they were in 1958 by any standards of measurement64 buckley softened his arguments by the mid 1960s a change caused in part because he became appalled at the violence used by white supremacists during the civil rights movement and in part because of the influence of friends like garry wills who confronted buckley on the morality of his politics65 however buckley continued to downplay structural racism and place a large amount of blame for lack of economic growth on the black community itself most prominently during a highly publicized 1965 debate with the africanamerican writer james baldwin at the cambridge union6667 his opposition to the civil rights movement became framed more in support of states rights and against judicial review of state actions rather than in terms of cultural differences68 in the late 1960s buckley disagreed strenuously with segregationist george wallace who ran in democratic primaries 1964 and 1972 and made an independent run for president in 1968 and debated passionately against wallaces segregationist platform in a broadcast on firing line buckley later said he wished national review had been more supportive of civil rights legislation in the 1960s69 he grew to admire martin luther king jr and supported creation of a martin luther king jr day national holiday for him70 during the 1950s buckley had worked to remove antisemitism from the conservative movement and barred holders of those views from working for national review70 in 1962 buckley denounced robert w welch jr and the john birch society in national review as far removed from common sense and urged the republican party to purge itself of welchs influence71 democracy and communismedit buckleys opposition to communism extended to support of the overthrow and replacement of leftist governments by nondemocratic forces buckley supported spanish authoritarian dictator general francisco franco who led the rightist military rebellion in its military defeat of the spanish republic he called franco an authentic national hero applauding his overthrow of spanish republican visionaries ideologues marxists and nihilists72 he supported the military dictatorship of general augusto pinochet that led the 1973 coup that overthrew chilean president salvador allendes democratically elected marxist government referring to allende as a president who was defiling the chilean constitution and waving proudly the banner of his friend and idol fidel castro73 political commentary and actionedit young americans for freedom and barry goldwateredit in 1960 buckley helped form young americans for freedom yaf yaf was guided by principles buckley called the sharon statement buckley was proud of the successful campaign of his older brother jim buckley on the conservative party ticket to capture the us senate seat from new york state held by incumbent republican charles goodell in 1970 giving very generous credit to the activist support of the new york state chapter of yaf buckley served one term in the senate then was defeated by democrat daniel patrick moynihan in 197674 in 1963–64 buckley mobilized support for the candidacy of arizona senator barry goldwater first for the republican nomination against new york governor nelson rockefeller and then for the presidency buckley used national review as a forum for mobilizing support for goldwater75 on the rightedit buckleys column on the right was syndicated by universal press syndicate beginning in 1962 from the early 1970s his twiceweekly column was distributed to more than 320 newspapers across the country edgar herbert smith jredit in 1962 the convicted murderer edgar smith began a correspondence with buckley during which buckley began to doubt smiths guilt later stating that the case was inherently implausible76 an article by buckley in november 1965 published in esquire drew national media attention “ smith said he told hommell during their brief conversation  on the night of the murder just where he had discarded his pants the woman who occupies property across the road from which smith claimed to have thrown the pants  swore at the trial that she had seen hommell rummaging there the day after the murder the pants were later found by the police near a welltravelled road  did hommell find them and leave them in the other location thinking to discredit smiths story and make sure they would turn up76 ” this brought renewed media interest in a don hommell who smith claimed was the real killer76 in 1971 smith was able to have a repeat trial and walked free later that year in 1976 he attempted another murder and was sentenced to life in prison he also admitted that he had in fact committed the first murder which he had been charged with77 mayoral candidacyedit in 1965 buckley ran for mayor of new york city as the candidate for the new conservative party he ran to restore momentum to the conservative cause in the wake of goldwaters defeat78 he tried to take votes away from the relatively liberal republican candidate and fellow yale alumnus john lindsay who later became a democrat buckley did not expect to win indeed when asked what he would do if he won the race buckley responded demand a recount79 and used an unusual campaign style during one televised debate with lindsay buckley declined to use his allotted rebuttal time and instead replied i am satisfied to sit back and contemplate my own former eloquence to relieve traffic congestion buckley proposed charging cars a fee to enter the central city and creation of a network of bike lanes he opposed a civilian review board for the new york police department which lindsay had recently introduced to control police corruption and install community policing80 buckley finished third with 134 of the vote possibly having inadvertently aided lindsays election by instead taking votes from democratic candidate abe beame79 firing lineedit buckley with president ronald reagan at reagans birthday celebration 1986 buckley with reagan in the oval office 1988 for many americans buckleys erudition on his weekly pbs show firing line 1966–1999 was their primary exposure to him and his sesquipedalian vocabulary81 throughout his career as a media figure buckley had received much criticism—largely from the american left but also from certain factions on the right such as the john birch society and its second president larry mcdonald as well as from objectivists82 in 1953–54 long before he founded firing line buckley was an occasional panelist on the conservative public affairs program answers for americans broadcast on abc and based on source material from the h l hunt–supported publication facts forum83 feud with gore vidaledit when asked if there was one person with whom buckley would not share a stage buckleys response was gore vidal likewise vidals antagonism toward buckley was well known even before 196884 buckley appeared in a series of televised debates with vidal during the 1968 republican national convention in miami and the democratic national convention in chicago in their penultimate debate on august 28 of that year the two disagreed over the actions of the chicago police department and the protesters at the ongoing convention in reference to the response of the police involved in supposedly taking down a viet cong flag moderator howard k smith asked whether raising a nazi flag during the second world war would have elicited a similar response vidal responded that people were free to state their political views as they saw fit whereupon buckley interrupted and noted that people were free to speak their views but others were also free to ostracize them for holding those views noting that in the us during the second world war some people were pronazi and they were well treated by those who ostracized them—and im for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot american marines and american soldiers i know you vidal dont care because you have no sense of identification with— vidal then interjected that the only sort of pro or cryptonazi i can think of is yourself whereupon smith interjected now lets not call names buckley visibly angered rose several inches from his seat and replied now listen you queer stop calling me a cryptonazi or ill sock you in your goddamn face and youll stay plastered85 buckley later apologized in print for having called vidal a queer in a burst of anger rather than in a clinical context but also reiterated his distaste for vidal as an evangelist for bisexuality the man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction and in his art the desirability of it is not to be confused with the man who bears his sorrow quietly the addict is to be pitied and even respected not the pusher86 the debates are chronicled in the 2015 documentary best of enemies this feud continued the following year in the pages of esquire which commissioned essays from both buckley and vidal on the television incident buckleys essay on experiencing gore vidal was published in the august 1969 issue in september vidal responded with his own essay a distasteful encounter with william f buckley87 in it vidal strongly implied that in 1944 buckleys unnamed siblings and possibly buckley himself had vandalized a protestant church in their sharon connecticut hometown after the pastors wife had sold a house to a jewish family he also implied that buckley was a homosexual88 and a racist antiblack antisemitic and a procrypto nazi89 buckley sued vidal and esquire for libel vidal counterclaimed for libel against buckley citing buckleys characterization of vidals novel myra breckenridge as pornography after buckley received an outofcourt settlement from esquire he also dropped the suit against vidal both cases were dropped90 with buckley settling for court costs paid by esquire magazine which had published the piece while vidal who did not sue the magazine absorbed his own court costs but neither had paid each other compensation buckley also received an editorial apology in the pages of esquire as part of the settlement9091 the feud was reopened in 2003 when esquire republished the original vidal essay at which time further legal action against the magazine resulted in buckleys being compensated both personally and for his legal fees along with an editorial notice and apology in the pages of esquire again buckley maintained a philosophical antipathy towards vidals other bête noire norman mailer calling him almost unique in his search for notoriety and absolutely unequalled in his coexistence with it92 meanwhile mailer summed up buckley as having a secondrate intellect incapable of entertaining two serious thoughts in a row93 after mailers 2007 death however buckley wrote warmly about their personal acquaintance associations with liberal politiciansedit buckley became close friends with liberal democratic activist allard k lowenstein buckley featured lowenstein on numerous firing line programs publicly endorsed his candidacies for us congress and delivered a eulogy at his funeral9495 buckley was also friends with economist john kenneth galbraith9697 and former senator and presidential candidate george mcgovern98 both of whom he frequently featured or debated on firing line and college campuses he and galbraith were also popular for their occasional appearances on the today show where host frank mcgee would introduce them and then deftly step aside and defer to the verbal thrust and parry99 united nations delegateedit in 1973 the nixon administration appointed buckley to serve as a delegate to the united nations upon which buckley would later write a book100 in 1981 buckley informed presidentelect and personal friend ronald reagan that he would decline any official position offered to him reagan jokingly replied that that was too bad because he had wanted to make buckley ambassador to then sovietoccupied afghanistan buckley replied that he was willing to take the job but only if he were to be supplied with 10 divisions of bodyguards101 amnesty internationaledit in the late 1960s buckley joined the board of directors of amnesty international usa102 he resigned in january 1978 in protest over the organizations stance against capital punishment as expressed in its stockholm declaration of 1977 which he said would lead to the inevitable sectarianization of the amnesty movement103 views on hivaidsedit in an oped piece in the new york times on march 18 1986 buckley addressed the aids epidemic calling it a fact that aids is the special curse of the homosexual buckley argued that people infected with the disease could only marry if they agreed to sterilization and that universal testing—led by insurance companies not the government—should be mandatory most controversially of all he wrote everyone detected with aids should be tattooed in the upper forearm to protect commonneedle users and on the buttocks to prevent the victimization of other homosexuals104 the piece led to much criticism some gay activists advocated boycotting patricia buckleys fundraising efforts for aids william buckley later backtracked from the piece but in 2004 he told the new york times magazine if the protocol had been accepted many who caught the infection unguardedly would be alive probably over a million105 spy novelistedit in 1975 buckley recounted being inspired to write a spy novel by frederick forsyths the day of the jackal if i were to write a book of fiction id like to have a whack at something of that nature106 he went on to explain that he was determined to avoid the moral ambiguity of graham greene and john le carré buckley wrote the 1976 spy novel saving the queen featuring blackford oakes as a rulebound cia agent based in part on his own cia experiences over the next 30 years he would write another ten novels featuring oakes new york times critic charlie rubin wrote that the series at its best evokes john ohara in its precise sense of place amid simmering class hierarchies107 stained glass second in the series won a 1980 national book award in the oneyear category mystery paperback108a buckley was particularly concerned about the view that what the cia and the kgb were doing was morally equivalent he wrote in his memoirs to say that the cia and the kgb engage in similar practices is the equivalent of saying that the man who pushes an old lady into the path of a hurtling bus is not to be distinguished from the man who pushes an old lady out of the path of a hurtling bus on the grounds that after all in both cases someone is pushing old ladies around109 buckley began writing on computers in 1982 starting with a zenith z89110 according to his son buckley developed an almost fanatical loyalty to wordstar installing it on every new pc he got despite its growing obsolescence over the years buckley used it to write his last novel and when asked why he continued using something so outdated he answered they say theres better software but they also say theres better alphabets later careeredit buckley shakes hands with president george w bush on october 6 2005 in 1988 buckley helped defeat liberal republican senator lowell weicker in connecticut buckley organized a committee to campaign against weicker and endorsed his democratic opponent connecticut attorney general joseph lieberman111 in 1991 buckley received the presidential medal of freedom from president george h w bush upon turning 65 in 1990 he retired from the daytoday running of the national review4041 and relinquished his controlling shares of national review in june 2004 to a preselected board of trustees the following month he published the memoir miles gone by buckley continued to write his syndicated newspaper column as well as opinion pieces for national review magazine and national review online he remained the ultimate source of authority at the magazine and also conducted lectures and gave interviews112 views on modernday conservatismedit buckley criticized certain aspects of policy within the modern conservative movement of george w bushs presidency he said if you had a european prime minister who experienced what weve experienced it would be expected that he would retire or resign113 he further said bush is conservative but he is not a conservative buckley said this a number of years earlier about george hw bush so this last may not be a quote about george w bush and that the president was not elected as a vessel of the conservative faith buckley would distinguish between socalled lowercase c and capital c conservatives the latter being true conservatives fiscally conservative and socially conservativelibertarian or libertarianleaning114115 regarding the war in iraq buckley stated the reality of the situation is that missions abroad to effect regime change in countries without a bill of rights or democratic tradition are terribly arduous he added this isnt to say that the iraq war is wrong or that history will judge it to be wrong but it is absolutely to say that conservatism implies a certain submission to reality and this war has an unrealistic frank and is being conscripted by events116 in a february 2006 column published at national review online and distributed by universal press syndicate buckley stated unequivocally that one cannot doubt that the american objective in iraq has failed buckley has also stated that its important that we acknowledge in the inner councils of state that it the war has failed so that we should look for opportunities to cope with that failure117 according to jeffrey hart writing in the american conservative buckley had a tragic view of the iraq war he saw it as a disaster and thought that the conservative movement he had created had in effect committed intellectual suicide by failing to maintain critical distance from the bush administration at the end of his life buckley believed the movement he made had destroyed itself by supporting the war in iraq118 regarding the iraq war troop surge of 2007 however it is noted by the editors of national review that buckley initially opposed the surge but after seeing its early success believed it deserved more time to work119 buckley was an advocate for the legalization of marijuana and some drug legalization as early as his 1965 candidacy for mayor of new york city120121 he wrote a pointed promarijuana legalization piece for national review in 2004 where he calls for conservatives to change their views on legalization stating were not going to find someone running for president who advocates reform of those laws what is required is a genuine republican groundswell it is happening but ever so gradually two of every five americans believe the government should treat marijuana more or less the same way it treats alcohol it should regulate it control it tax it and make it illegal only for children122 in his december 3 2007 column shortly after his wifes death which he attributed at least in part to her smoking buckley seemed to advocate banning tobacco use in america123 about neoconservatives he said in 2004 i think those i know which is most of them are bright informed and idealistic but that they simply overrate the reach of us power and influence64124125126127 regarding donald trump he described him in 2000 as a demagogue and a narcissist128129 various organizations have awards and honors named after buckley the intercollegiate studies institute awards the william f buckley award for outstanding campus journalism130 deathedit buckley died at his home in stamford connecticut on february 27 2008 initially it was reported that he was found dead at his desk in his study a converted garage he died with his boots on his son christopher buckley said after a lifetime of riding pretty tall in the saddle26 subsequently however in his 2009 book losing mum and pup a memoir christopher buckley admitted that this account was an embellishment on his part his father had actually been found lying on the floor of his study after suffering a fatal heart attack at the time of his death he had been suffering from emphysema and diabetes5 in a december 3 2007 column buckley commented on the cause of his emphysema citing his lifelong habit of smoking tobacco despite endorsing a legal ban of it123 buckleys body was buried at the saint bernard cemetery in sharon connecticut next to his wife patricias131 notable members of the republican political establishment paying tribute to buckley included president george w bush132 former speaker of the house of representatives newt gingrich and former first lady nancy reagan133 bush said of buckley he influenced a lot of people including me he captured the imagination of a lot of people134 gingrich added bill buckley became the indispensable intellectual advocate from whose energy intelligence wit and enthusiasm the best of modern conservatism drew its inspiration and encouragement buckley began what led to senator barry goldwater and his conscience of a conservative that led to the seizing of power by the conservatives from the moderate establishment within the republican party from that emerged ronald reagan135 reagans widow nancy commented ronnie valued bills counsel throughout his political life and after ronnie died bill and pat were there for me in so many ways134 linguistic expertiseedit buckley was well known for his command of language136 he came late to formal instruction in english not learning it until he was seven years old and having earlier learned spanish and french14 michelle tsai in slate says that he spoke english with an idiosyncratic accent something between an oldfashioned upper class midatlantic accent and british received pronunciation with a southern drawl137 rhetoricedit epstein 1972 argues that liberals were especially fascinated by buckley and often wanted to debate him in part because his ideas resembled their own for buckley typically formulated his arguments in reaction to leftliberal opinion rather than being founded on conservative principles that were alien to the liberals138 appel 1992 argues from rhetorical theory that buckleys essays are often written in low burlesque in the manner of samuel butlers satirical poem hudibras considered as drama such discourse features blackandwhite disorder a guiltmongering logician distorted clownish opponents limited scapegoating and a selfserving redemption139 lee 2008 argues that buckley introduced a new rhetorical style that conservatives often tried to emulate the gladiatorial style as lee calls it is flashy and combative filled with sound bites and leads to an inflammatory drama as conservatives encountered buckleys arguments about government liberalism and markets the theatrical appeal of buckleys gladiatorial style inspired conservative imitators becoming one of the principal templates for conservative rhetoric140 buckley ruleedit national review will support the rightwardmost viable candidate141 the buckley rule is often misquoted william f buckley first used his assertion during the 1964 republican primary election that featured barry goldwater and nelson rockefeller debate within the republican party led buckley to state his support for the rightwardmost viable candidate it is often misquoted and misapplied as proclaiming support for the rightwardmost electable candidate or simply the most electable candidate according to national review’s neal b freeman it meant somebody who saw the world as we did somebody who would bring credit to our cause somebody who win or lose would conservatize the republican party and the country it meant somebody like barry goldwater142 worksedit main article william f buckley jr bibliography see also list of blackford oakes novels notesedit from 1980 to

provoked my search for that word a generation ago when i first and not last encountered it in one of your books if it was used derisively about you i can only infer that the reviewers brain was set
