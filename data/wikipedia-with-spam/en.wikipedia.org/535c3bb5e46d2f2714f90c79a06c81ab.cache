which presented acts such as louis armstrong bill bojangles robinson and bessie smith and eddie green leo brechers harlem opera house was another competing venue to improve the shows at the apollo cohen hired noted talent scout john hammond to book his shows however the deal fell through when cohen died and the end result was the merger of the apollo with the harlem opera house the opera house became a movie theater but the apollo under the ownership of brecher and schiffman continued to present stage shows4 schiffman hired clarence robinson as inhouse producer6 2015 originally a typical

by playing bluesstyled material the theaters audience was often mixed in the 1940s it was estimated that during the week about 40 of the audience was white which would go up to 75 percent for weekend shows4 jazz singer anita oday headlined for the week of september 21 1950 billed as the jezebel of jazz7 amateur nightsedit schiffman had first introduced an amateur night at the lafayette theater where it was known as harlem amateur hour and was hosted by ralph cooper at the apollo it was originally called audition night but later became amateur night in harlem held every monday evening and
