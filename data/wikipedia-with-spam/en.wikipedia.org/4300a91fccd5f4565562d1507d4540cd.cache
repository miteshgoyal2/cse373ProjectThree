seattle denny regrade differing definitions of the neighborhood borders the yellow background follows the seattle city clerks neighborhood map atlas the blue border shows belltown denny regrade as defined by northwestplacescom the red and purple border show belltown and the denny triangle respectively as defined by downtownseattlecom the denny regrade is a neighborhood in seattle washington usa that stretches north of the central business district to the grounds of seattle center its generally flat terrain was originally a steep hill taken down as part of a mammoth construction project in the first decades of the 20th century1 the neighborhood is named after that project the northeastern portion of the denny regrade is sometimes known as the denny triangle a term that has gained currency as this neighborhood has seen increasing development in the first decades of the 21st century as with most seattle neighborhoods the denny regrade has no formal borders the seattle city clerks neighborhood map atlas which is published by the city but does not have official status as defining neighborhoods defines the denny regrade as bounded on the north by denny way on the southwest by third avenue on the southeast by olive way with a small eastern border on interstate 52 a 2009 map from northwestplacescom treats the term as synonymous with belltown and shows both names as referring to a triangle bounded on the north by denny way on the southwest by western avenue two blocks inland of the central waterfront and on the southeast by stewart street the southern tip of this triangle falls in the northern part of pike place market3 a map on downtownseattlecom agrees on the northern boundary at denny way but splits this area into belltown and the denny triangle and gives both a less regular shape they divide belltown to the southwest from the denny triangle to the northeast with the border running mainly along fifth avenue but including a small number of properties along denny way west of fifth avenue as being in the denny triangle they mark the southwest border of belltown as a block closer to the water elliott avenue and draw a more ragged southeast border west of fifth avenue belltown extends south only to lenora street while east of fifth avenue the denny triangle is bounded in its westernmost block by virginia street and once it crosses westlake avenue by olive way and with an eastern border on the same small piece of interstate 5 as the city clerks map4 contents 1 regrading projects 2 denny hill 3 photographs 4 see also 5 references 6
