son of singersongwriter jack leroy wilson sr 1903–1983 and eliza mae wilson 1907–1984 as she lost two previous children eliza mae was born on the billupswhitfield place in columbus mississippi her parents were tom and virginia ransom jackie often visited his family in columbus and was greatly influenced by the choir at billups chapel growing up in the rough detroit area of highland park wilson joined a gang called the shakers and often got himself in trouble wilsons alcoholic father was frequently absent and usually out of work wilson began singing at an early age accompanying his mother once a choir singer to church in his early teens jackie joined a quartet the ever ready gospel singers which became a popular feature of churches in the area jackie was not very religious but he enjoyed singing the money he and his group earned from performing was usually spent on cheap wine which wilson began drinking at age nine5 jack sr and eliza separated shortly after jackie turned nine wilson dropped out of high school at the age of 15 having already been sentenced to detention in the lansing corrections system for juveniles twice during his second stint in detention he learned to box and began competing around the detroit amateur circuit at the age of 16 his record in the golden gloves was 2 and 8 after his mother forced him to quit boxing wilson married freda hood and became a father at 17 it is estimated that wilson fathered at least 10 other children prior to getting married and that he was forced to marry hood by her father he gave up boxing for music first working at lees sensation club as a solo singer6 then forming a group called the falcons the same falcons wilson pickett was later a part of that included cousin levi stubbs who later went on to lead the four tops two more of wilsons cousins hubert johnson and levis brother joe later became members of the contours the other members joined hank ballard as part of the midnighters7 including alonzo tucker billy davis who would work with wilson several years later as a solo artist tucker and wilson collaborated as songwriters on a few songs wilson recorded wilson was soon discovered by talent agent johnny otis who assigned him to join a group called the thrillers that group would later be known as the royals who would later evolve into rb group the midnighters but wilson wasn not part of the group when it changed its name and signed with king records lavern baker little willie john johnnie ray and della reese were acts managed by al green not to be confused with rb singer al green nor albert al green of the now defunct national records al green owned two music publishing companies pearl music and merrimac music and detroits flame show bar where wilson met baker after recording his first version of danny boy and a few other tracks on dizzy gillespies record label dee gee records under the name sonny wilson his nickname wilson was eventually hired by billy ward in 1953 to join a group ward formed in 1950 called the dominoes after wilsons successful audition to replace the immensely popular clyde mcphatter who left the dominoes and formed his own group the drifters8 wilson almost blew his chance that day showing up calling himself shit wilson and bragging about being a better singer than mcphatter9 billy ward felt a stage name would fit the dominoes image hence jackie wilson prior to leaving the dominoes mcphatter coached wilson on the sound billy ward wanted for his group influencing wilsons singing style and stage presence i learned a lot from clyde that highpitched choke he used and other thingsclyde mcphatter was my man clyde and billy ward6 1940s blues singer roy brown was also a major influence on him and wilson grew up listening to the mills brothers the ink spots louis jordan and al jolson wilson was the groups lead singer for three years but the dominoes lost some of their stride with the departure of mcphatter they were able to make appearances riding on the strength of the groups earlier hits until 1956 when the dominoes recorded wilson with an unlikely interpretation of the pop hit st therese of the roses giving the dominoes another brief moment in the spotlight their only other postmcphatterwilson successes were stardust released july 15 1957 and deep purple released october 7 195710 in 1957 wilson set out to begin a solo career leaving the dominoes and collaborating with cousin levi and got work at detroits flame show bar later al green worked out a deal with decca records and wilson was signed to their subsidiary label brunswick solo stardomedit shortly after wilson signed a solo contract with brunswick green suddenly died greens business partner nat tarnopol took over as wilsons manager and later rose to president of brunswick wilsons first single was released reet petite from the album hes so fine which became a modest rb success and many years later an international smash hit the song was written by another former boxer berry gordy jr11 who cowrote it with partner roquel billy davis who also went by the pseudonym tyran carlo and gordys sister gwendolyn the trio composed and produced six further singles for wilson which included to be loved im wanderin we have love thats why i love you so ill be satisfied and his late1958 signature song lonely teardrops which peaked at no 7 on the pop charts no 1 on the rb charts in the us and established him as an rb superstar known for his extraordinary operatic multioctave vocal range12 lonely teardrops sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the riaa13 due to his fervor when performing with his dynamic dance moves singing and impeccable dress he was soon christened mr excitement a title he would keep for the remainder of his career his stagecraft in his live shows inspired james brown michael jackson14 and elvis presley as well as a host of other artists that followed presley was so impressed with wilson that he made it a point to meet him and the two instantly became good friends in a photo of the two posing together presleys caption in the autograph reads you got you a friend for life wilson was sometimes called the black elvis15 reportedly when asked about this presley said i guess that makes me the white jackie wilson wilson also said he was influenced by presley too saying a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black mans music when in fact almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis16 wilsons powerful electrifying live performances rarely failed to bring audiences to a state of frenzy17 his live performances consisted of kneedrops1819 splits spins backflips2021 onefooted acrossthefloor slides removing his tie and jacket and throwing them off the stage a lot of basic boxing steps advance and retreat shuffling22 and one of his favorite routines getting some of the less attractive girls in the audience to come up and kiss him if i kiss the ugliest girl in the audience wilson often said theyll all think they can have me and keep coming back and buying my records having women come up to kiss him is one reason wilson kept bottles of mouthwash in his dressing room another reason may have been his attempt to hide the alcohol on his breathcitation needed wilson was also a regular on tv making regular appearances on such shows as the ed sullivan show american bandstand shindig shivaree and hullabaloo his only movie appearance was in the rock and roll film go johnny go where he performed his 1959 hit song you better know it23 in 1958 davis and gordy left wilson and brunswick after royalty disputes escalated between them and nat tarnopol davis soon became a successful staff songwriter and producer for chess records while gordy borrowed 800citation needed from his family and used money he earned from royalties writing for wilson to start his own recording studio hitsville usa the foundation of motown records in his native detroit meanwhile convinced that wilson could venture out of rb and rock and roll tarnopol had the singer record operatic ballads and easy listening material pairing him with decca records veteran arranger dick jacobs wilson scored hits as he entered the 1960s with the no 15 doggin around the no 1 pop ballad night another millionseller24 and baby workout another top 10 hit no 5 which he composed with midnighters member alonzo tucker his songwriting alliance with tucker also turned out other songs including no pity in the naked city and im so lonely top 10 hits continued with alone at last no 8 in 1960 and my empty arms no 9 in 1961 also in 1961 wilson recorded a tribute album to al jolson nowstalgia  you aint heard nothin yet which included the only album liner notes he ever wrote  to the greatest entertainer of this or any other era  i guess i have just about every recording hes ever made and i rarely missed listening to him on the radio  during the three years ive been making records ive had the ambition to do an album of songs which to me represent the great jolson heritage  this is simply my humble tribute to the one man i admire most in this business  to keep the heritage of jolson alive2526 the album was a commercial failure following the success of baby workout wilson experienced a lull in his career between 1964 and 1966 as tarnopol and brunswick records released a succession of unsuccessful albums and singles despite the lack of sales success he still made artistic gains as he recorded an album with count basie as well as a series of duets with rhythm and blues artist lavern baker and gospel singer linda hopkins in 1966 he scored the first of two big comeback singles with established chicago soul producer carl davis with whispers gettin louder and your love keeps lifting me higher and higher a no 6 pop hit in 1967 which became one of his final hits this was followed by i get the sweetest feeling which despite its modest initial chart success in the us billboard pop 34 has since become one of his biggest international chart successes becoming a top 10 hit in the uk twice in 1972 and in 1987 and a top 20 hit in the dutch top 40 and has spawned numerous cover versions by other artists such as edwin starr will young erma franklin aretha franklins sister and liz mcclarnon a key to his musical rebirth was that davis insisted that wilson no longer record with brunswicks musicians in new york instead he would record with legendary detroit musicians normally employed by motown records and also davis own chicagobased session players the detroit musicians known as the funk brothers participated on wilsons recordings due to their respect for davis and wilson by 1975 wilson and the chilites were the only significant artists left on brunswicks roster wilson had continued to record singles that found success on the rb chart but found no significant pop chart success his final hit you got me walkin written by eugene record of the chilites was released in 1972 with the chilites backing him on vocals and instruments deathedit on september 29 1975 wilson was one of the featured acts in dick clarks good ol rock and roll revue hosted by the latin casino in cherry hill new jersey he was in the middle of singing lonely teardrops when he suffered a heart attack when he collapsed on stage audience members initially thought it was part of the act27 clark sensed something was wrong then ordered the musicians to stop the music cornell gunter of the coasters who was backstage noticed wilson was not breathing gunter was able to resuscitate him and wilson was then rushed to a nearby hospital9 medical personnel worked to stabilize his vital signs but the lack of oxygen to his brain caused him to slip into a coma he briefly recovered in early 1976 and was even able to take a few wobbly steps28 but slipped back into a semicomatose state he was deemed conscious but incapacitated in early june 1976 unable to speak but aware of his surroundings he was a resident of the medford leas retirement center in medford new jersey when he was admitted into memorial hospital of burlington county in mount holly new jersey due to having trouble taking nourishment according to wilsons attorney john mulkerin29 jackie wilson died on january 21 1984 at age 49 from complications of pneumonia he was initially buried in an unmarked grave at westlawn cemetery near detroit30 in 1987 a fundraiser by a detroit radio station collected enough money to purchase a headstone9 personal lifeedit wilsons personal life was laced with tragedy in 1960 in new orleans he was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer when fans tried to climb on stage he assaulted a policeman who had shoved one of the fans wilson had a reputation for being shorttempered6 on february 15 1961 in manhattan wilson was injured in a shooting it is said the real story behind this incident is that one of his girlfriends juanita jones shot and wounded him in a jealous rage when he returned to his manhattan apartment with another woman fashion model harlean harris an exgirlfriend of sam cookes wilsons management supposedly concocted a story to protect wilsons reputation that jones was an obsessed fan who had threatened to shoot herself and that wilsons intervention resulted in him being shot31 wilson was shot in the stomach the bullet would result in the loss of a kidney and lodged too close to his spine to be operated on5 in early 1975 during an interview with author arnold shaw wilson maintained it actually was a zealous fan whom he did not know that shot him we also had some trouble in 1961 that was when some crazy chick took a shot at me and nearly put me away for good32 the story of the zealous fan was accepted and no charges were brought against jones a month and a half later after the shooting incident jackie wilson was discharged from the hospital at the time wilson had declared annual earnings of 263000 while the average salary a man earned then was just 5000 a year but he discovered that despite being at the peak of success he was broke around this time the internal revenue service irs seized wilsons detroit family home tarnopol and his accountants were supposed to take care of such matters fortunately wilson made arrangements with the irs to make restitution on the unpaid taxes he also repurchased the family home at auction5 nat tarnopol had taken advantage of wilsons naïveté mismanaging his money since becoming his manager tarnopol also had powerofattorney over wilsons finances giving him complete control over wilsons money unfortunately wilson was a rather trusting soul trusting people he should not have like tarnopol and some of wilsons other managers23 tarnopol and 18 other brunswick executives were indicted on federal charges of mail fraud and tax evasion stemming from bribery and payola scandals in 1975 also in the indictment was the charge that tarnopol owed at least 1 million in royalties to wilson in 1976 tarnopol and the others were found guilty an appeals court overturned their conviction 18 months later although the conviction was overturned judges went into detail outlining that tarnopol and brunswick records did defraud their artists of royalties and that they were satisfied that there was sufficient evidence for wilson to file a lawsuit however a trial to sue tarnopol for royalties never took place as wilson lay in a nursing home semicomatose tarnopol never paid wilson monies he had coming to him and wilson died riddled with debt to the irs and brunswick records33 one of the highlights of the federal tax fraud trial of tarnopol and the other brunswick executives came when eugene record of the chilites testified that he had been assaulted during a contract negotiation at brunswicks new york office record stated that he asked tarnopol for advanced money on a recording in 1972 when an associate of tarnopols whom record identified as johnny roberts asked tarnopol should i twist his nose off before any answer came record said roberts suddenly began to twist my nose and when i pushed his arm away he punched me in the face knocking my glasses off a similar story concerns wilson who reportedly was hung out of tarnopols office window by his feet when wilson asked about money according to chuck barksdale of the dells34 in march 1967 wilson and frienddrummer jimmy smith were arrested in south carolina on morals charges the two were entertaining two 24yearold white women in their motel room9 freda hood wilsons first wife with whom he had four children divorced him in 1965 after 14 years of marriage was frustrated with his notorious womanizing although the divorce was amicable freda would regret her decision5 his 16yearold son jackie jr was shot and killed on a neighbors porch near their detroit home in 1970 the death of jackie jr devastated wilson he sank into a period of depression and for the next couple of years remained mostly a recluse35 more tragedy hit when two of wilsons daughters died at a young age36 his daughter sandra died in 1977 at the age of 24 of an apparent heart attack jacqueline wilson was killed in 1988 in a drugrelated incident in highland park michigan3735 wilsons second marriage was to model harlean harris in 1967 with whom he had three children but they too separated in 1970 wilson later met and lived with lynn guidry a woman who would have two children with him there was also a woman named joyce mccrae a fan who tried to take the role of wilsons caregiver while he was in the nursing home38 he was with guidry who was under the impression that she was his legal wife until his heart attack in 1975 however as he and harris never officially divorced harris took the role of wilsons caregiver for the singers remaining nine years wilson converted to judaism as an adult39 tributes and legacyedit on august 17 2013 in cleveland ohio jackie wilson was inducted into the official rb music hall of fame in 1985 the commodores recorded nightshift in memory of wilson and soul singer marvin gaye who had both died in 1984 reaching no 1 rb and no 3 pop in the us and topping the dutch singles chart it was the groups biggest hit after the departure of lionel richie van morrison recorded a tribute song called jackie wilson said im in heaven when you smile on his 1972 album saint dominics preview this was later covered by dexys midnight runners when the track was performed on the british tv show top of the pops a picture of darts player jocky wilson was used instead this has often been speculated to be a mistake but dexys frontman kevin rowland stated that it was a deliberate joke by the band michael jackson honored jackie wilson at the 1984 grammy awards jackson dedicated his album of the year grammy for thriller to wilson saying in the entertainment business there are leaders and there are followers and i just want to say that i think jackie wilson was a wonderful entertainerjackie where you are i want to say i love you and thank you so much40 until jacksons comments wilsons recording legacy had been dormant for almost a decade tarnopol owned wilsons recordings due to brunswicks separation from mca but the label had closed down essentially deleting wilsons considerable recorded legacy when jackson praised wilson at the grammys interest in the legendary singer stirred and tarnopol released the first wilson album a tworecord compilation in almost nine years through epic records jacksons label at the time through tarnopols son wilsons music

famous musicians who have died the lyric goes and jackie will you teach me how to glide across the stage wilson scored a posthumous hit when reet petite reached number one in the united kingdom ireland and the netherlands in 1986 this success was likely due in part to a new animated video made for the song featuring a clay model of wilson that became popular on television the following year
