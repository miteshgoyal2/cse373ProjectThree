webmail from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search webmail or webbased email is any email client implemented as a web application running on a web server examples of webmail software are roundcube and squirrelmail examples of webmail providers are aol mail gmail outlookcomhotmailcom and yahoo mail1 many webmail providers also offer email access by a desktop email client using standard email protocols while many internet service providers provide a webmail client as part of the email service included in their internet service package as with any web application webmails main advantage over the use of a desktop email client is the ability to send and receive email anywhere from a web browser its main disadvantage is the need to be connected to the internet while using it other software tools also exist to integrate parts of webmail functionality into an os eg creating messages directly from third party applications via mapi23 contents 1 history 11 early implementations 12 widespread deployment 2 rendering and compatibility 3 privacy concerns 4 see also 5 references 6 external links historyedit early implementationsedit the first web mail implementation was developed at cern in 1993 by phillip hallambaker4 as a test of the http protocol stack this led to the discovery that the specification of the post method was faulty requiring the introduction of the contentlength header the cernptg daemon was released later that year but was not developed further in the early days of the web in 1994 and 1995 several people were working on enabling email to be accessed via a web browser in europe there were three implementations søren vejrums www mail5 luca manunzas webmail67 and remy wetzels webmail8 whereas in the united states matt mankins wrote webex9 three of these early applications were perl scripts that included the full source code available for download remy wetzels version was a cgi program written in c on unix in 1994 bill fitler while at lotus ccmail in mountain view california began working on an implementation of webbased email as a cgi program written in c on windows nt and demonstrated it publicly at lotusphere on january 24 199510111213 søren vejrums www mail was written when he was studying and working at the copenhagen business school in denmark and was released on february 28 199514 luca manunzas webmail was written while he was working at crs4 in sardinia with the first source release on march 30 199515 remy wetzels webmail was written while he was studying at the eindhoven university of technology in the netherlands for the dse1617 and was released early january 1995 in the united states matt mankins under the supervision of dr burt rosenberg at the university of miami18 released his webex application source code in a post to compmailmisc on august 8 19959 although it had been in use as the primary email application at the school of architecture where mankins worked for some months prior meanwhile bill fitlers webmail implementation was further developed as a commercial product which lotus announced and released in the fall of 1995 as ccmail for the world wide web 10 thereby providing an alternative means of accessing a ccmail message store the usual means being a ccmail desktop application that operated either via dialup or within the confines of a local area network19202122 early commercialization of webmail was also achieved when webex—with no relation to the web conferencing company—began to be sold by mankins company dotshop inc at the end of 1995 within dotshop webex changed its name to emumail which would be sold to companies like ups and rackspace until its sale to accurev in 200123 emumail was one of the first applications to feature a free version that included embedded advertising as well as a licensed version that did not hotmail and four11s rocketmail both launched in 199624 as free services and immediately became very popular widespread deploymentedit as the 1990s progressed and into the 2000s it became more common for the general public to have access to webmail because many internet service providers such as earthlink and web hosting providers such as verio began bundling webmail into their service offerings often in parallel with popsmtp services many other enterprises such as universities and large corporations also started offering webmail as a way for their user communities to access their email either locally managed or outsourced webmail service providers such as hotmail and rocketmail emerged in 1996 as a free service to the general public and rapidly gained in popularity in some cases webmail application software is developed inhouse by the organizations running and managing the application and in some cases it is obtained from software companies that develop and sell such applications usually as part of an integrated mail server package an early example being netscape messaging server2526 the market for webmail application software has continued into the 2010s rendering and compatibilityedit email users may find the use of both a webmail client and a desktop client using the pop3 protocol presents some difficulties for example email messages that are downloaded by the desktop client and are removed from the server will no longer be available on the webmail client the user is limited to previewing messages using the web client before they are downloaded by the desktop email client however one may choose to leave the emails on the server in which case this problem does not occur the use of both a webmail client and a desktop client using the imap4 protocol allows the contents of the mailbox to be consistently displayed in both the webmail and desktop clients and any action the user performs on messages in one interface will be reflected when email is accessed via the other interface there are significant differences in rendering capabilities for many popular webmail services such as gmail outlookcom and yahoo mail due to the varying treatment of html tags such as style and head as well as css rendering inconsistencies email marketing companies rely on older web development techniques to send crossplatform mail this usually means a greater reliance on tables and inline stylesheets privacy concernsedit main article email privacy although emails stored unencrypted on any service providers servers can be read by that service provider specific concerns have been raised regarding webmail services that automatically analyze the contents of users emails for the purpose of targeted advertising272829 at least two such services gmail and yahoo mail give users the option to opt out of targeted advertising30 webmail that is accessed over unsecured http may be readable by a third party who has access to the data transmission such as over an unsecured wifi connection this may be avoided by connecting to the webmail service via https which encrypts the connection31 gmail has supported https since launch31 and in 2014 began requiring it for all webmail connections32 yahoo mail added the option to connect over https in 201333 and made https required in 20143435 see alsoedit comparison of email clients comparison of mail servers comparison of webmail providers email hosting service l or letter mail email
