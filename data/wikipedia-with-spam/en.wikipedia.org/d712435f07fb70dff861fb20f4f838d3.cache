of information and computation and their implementation and application in computer systems computing science encompasses many branches some emphasize the computation of specific results such as computer graphics while others such as computational complexity theory relate to properties of computational problems still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations for example programming language theory studies approaches to describing a computation while computer programming applies specific programming languages to craft a solution to some concrete computational problems

contributions have been acknowledged and lauded repeatedly with honorary degrees and awards that include the national medal of technology the turing award the presidential medal of freedom and membership in the national academy of engineering in the early days cerf was a program manager for the united states department of defense advanced research projects agency darpa funding various groups to develop tcpip technology when the internet began to transition to a commercial opportunity during the late 1980s cerf moved to mci where he was instrumental in the development of the first commercial email system mci mail connected to the internet cerf was instrumental in the funding and formation of icann from the start he waited in the wings for a year before he stepped forward to join the icann board eventually becoming chairman cerf went to van nuys high school along with jon postel and steve crocker he wrote the formers obituary both were also instrumental in the creation of
