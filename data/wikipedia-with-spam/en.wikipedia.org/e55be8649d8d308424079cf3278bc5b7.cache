when cbuft channel 26 signed on in september 1976 cbut was known mainly as channel 2 from its inception until 1976 updated cbut logo used in station ids and print ads from the late 1960s to 1976 this version was based on the logo cbut used during the 1960s during the stations early years until 1976 cbuts station ids consisted of slides of local vancouver landmarks with the cbut logo the number 2 in clarendon bold typeface contained within a stylized television screen overlaid accompanied by the announcement this is cbut channel 2 in vancouver the id slide used at the end of local programmes

letter t in the logo is represented by a stylized totem pole the stations ids were changed in 1976 when cbut changed its onair branding to cbc british columbia with the initial ids featuring a totem pole superimposed over local landmarks after which the totem pole zoomed out and turned into the letter t in the station brandcitation needed in recent years cbut as with all cbcowned stations has deemphasized local programming in favour of network programming distributed out of toronto as of 2002 the station only aired sporadic local nonnews programming and dropped all use of local station identifications in favour of using only network ids in addition due to budget cuts the cbc integrated cbuts master control operations as it did for all of its other ownedandoperated stations into the
