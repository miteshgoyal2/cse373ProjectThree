references 4 external links historyedit early historyedit the idea for the first rsa conference was conceived in 1991 in a phone call between then rsa security ceo jim bidzos and the executive director of the electronic privacy information center1 the first conference had just one panel called des and dss standards of choice it focused on why attendees should not adopt dss a standard that was expected to challenge rsa securitys status as the de facto standard for digital signatures23122–23 the event steadily grew124 in 1993 the event was renamed rsa conference and attracted more than 200 attendees that year3 over time the conference became more businessoriented with an older demographic and more vendors4 which led to competitive issues for a time in the 1990s european competitors to rsa security sometimes could not get a booth so they hired people to pass out flyers at the rsa conference encouraging attendees to visit them at hotels nearby4 in 1995 the conference criticized the clipper chip if implemented the chip would have given the us government direct access to evidence on telecommunications devices with the chip installed5 the conference put up posters with sink clipper in big letters6 by 1997 the conference had grown to 2500 attendees7 the first european rsa conference took place in 2000 and started with just 5 tracks8 according to network world the conferences focus expanded from cryptography into a broader it security conference with larger attendance in 2005 when microsoft ceo bill gates did the keynote presentation2 according to bidzos the purpose of the conference became for all kinds of things drive standards organize some opposition to government policies promote the rsa name and give all of our customers an opportunity124 by 2008 the conference had 17000 attendees and 375 participating it security vendors3 it had 18 tracks and 230 sessions3 recent historyedit at the 2010 rsa conference the obama administration publicly revealed the comprehensive national cybersecurity initiative cnci which was created in 2008 and formerly kept a secret69 in 2011 a californiabased it security company hbgary withdrew from speaking and exhibiting at the rsa conference citing safety concerns the company announced plans to reveal the identities of some members of the hacktivist group anonymous and received retaliatory threats and hacks10 in 2014 8 speakers boycotted the rsa conference after its sponsor rsa security was accused of adding a backdoor to its products so the national security agency could monitor users of rsa security technology the boycott began with then fsecure chief technology officer mikko hyppönen he wanted rsa security to apologize whereas the companys statement was that the allegations were not true1112 some noted that the rsa conference and rsa security company are only loosely connected11 discussion at that years conference was focused heavily on leaks by edward snowden and nsa involvement with american technology companies13 the first rsa conference in the asiapacific was introduced in 201314 this was followed by the inaugural united arab emirates conference two years later15 in 2015 the conference added a clause to exhibitor contracts effectively prohibiting booth babes by requiring professional attire on the exhibitor floor616 the policy was implemented in response to feedback that booth babes made the conference feel unprofessional fortune magazine called the widespread practice of having booth babes at professional conferences outdated and unwelcoming to female attendees16 the following year the rsa conference was focused on the fbi–apple encryption dispute regarding attempts by the government to gain access to iphones containing evidence in criminal investigations617 as of 2017 the conference has an estimated 40000–43000 attendees in the united states1819 contentedit the rsa conference is an international conference series on it security that takes place in the united states europe asiajapan and the united arab emirates it also provides internet safety education for consumers and children a security scholar program for it security students and operates award programs typically bestowed at conferences20 for example one award is the innovation sandbox contest which involves ten startups that present their technology to a panel of judges1821 the 2017 conference in the us had 15 keynotes 700 speakers 500 sessions and 550 exhibitors19 an analysis of session keywords at the conference suggest that early conferences were focused on cryptography and commerce but the topical focus of conferences transitioned to cloud and cybersecurity in the early 2000s22 each conference has a theme a practice that began in 19952 additionally there are typically one or two it security topics that the conference organizers pick to focus on each year18 speaking positions at the rsa conference are highly competitive with thousands of submissions for a few hundred speaking positions12 referencesedit a b c d yost jeffrey december 11 2004 oral interview with james bidzos pdf charles babbage institute center for the history of
