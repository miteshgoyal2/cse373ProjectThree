with several friends from quarry bank high school they briefly called themselves the blackjacks before changing their name to the quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name2 fifteenyearold paul mccartney joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and lennon met that july3 in february 1958 mccartney invited his friend george harrison to watch the band the fifteenyearold auditioned for lennon impressing him with his playing but lennon initially thought harrison was too young to join them after a month of harrisons persistence during a second meeting arranged by mccartney he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental raunchy on the upper deck of a liverpool bus4 and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist56 by january 1959 lennons quarry bank friends had left the group and he began studies at the liverpool college of art7 the three guitarists billing themselves at least three times as johnny and the moondogs8 were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer9 lennons art school friend stuart sutcliffe who had recently sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar joined in january 1960 and it was he who suggested changing the bands name to beatals as a tribute to buddy holly and the crickets1011 they used the name until may when they became the silver beetles before undertaking a brief tour of scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow liverpudlian johnny gentle by early july they had changed their name to the silver beatles and by the middle of august to the beatles12 allan williams the beatles unofficial manager arranged a residency for them in hamburg but lacking a fulltime drummer they auditioned and hired pete best in midaugust 1960 the band now a fivepiece left four days later contracted to club owner bruno koschmider for what would be a 3½month residency13 beatles historian mark lewisohn writes they pulled into hamburg at dusk on 17 august the time when the redlight area comes to life  flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities14 koschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues and he initially placed the beatles at the indra club after closing the indra due to noise complaints he moved them to the kaiserkeller in october15 when he learned they had been performing at the rival top ten club in breach of their contract he gave the band one months termination notice16 and reported the underage harrison who had obtained permission to stay in hamburg by lying to the german authorities about his age17 the authorities arranged for harrisons deportation in late november18 one week later koschmider had mccartney and best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor the authorities deported them19 lennon returned to liverpool in early december while sutcliffe remained in hamburg until late february with his german fiancée astrid kirchherr20 who took the first semiprofessional photos of the beatles21 during the next two years the beatles were resident for periods in hamburg where they used preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through allnight performances22 in 1961 during their second hamburg engagement kirchherr cut sutcliffes hair in the exi existentialist style later adopted by the other beatles2324 when sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in germany mccartney took up the bass25 producer bert kaempfert contracted what was now a fourpiece group until june 1962 and he used them as tony sheridans backing band on a series of recordings for polydor records1126 as part of the sessions the beatles were signed to polydor for one year27 credited to tony sheridan the beat brothers the single my bonnie recorded in june 1961 and released four months later reached number 32 on the musikmarkt chart28 after the beatles completed their second hamburg residency they enjoyed increasing popularity in liverpool with the growing merseybeat movement however they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night29 in november 1961 during one of the groups frequent performances at the cavern club they encountered brian epstein a local recordstore owner and music columnist30 he later recalled i immediately liked what i heard they were fresh and they were honest and they had what i thought was a sort of presence  a star quality31 epstein courted the band over the next couple of months and they appointed him as their manager in january 196232 throughout early and mid1962 epstein sought to free the beatles from their contractual obligations to bert kaempfert productions he eventually negotiated a onemonthearly release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in hamburg33 tragedy greeted them on their return to germany in april when a distraught kirchherr met them at the airport with news of sutcliffes death the previous day from what would later be determined to have been a brain hemorrhage34 epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract in order to secure a uk record contract epstein negotiated an early end to the bands contract with polydor in exchange for more recordings backing tony sheridan35 after a new years day audition decca records rejected the band with the comment guitar groups are on the way out mr epstein36 however three months later producer george martin signed the beatles to emis parlophone label34 abbey road studios main entrance martins first recording session with the beatles took place at emis abbey road studios in london on 6 june 196237 martin immediately complained to epstein about bests poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place38 already contemplating bests dismissal39 the beatles replaced him in midaugust with ringo starr who left rory storm and the hurricanes to join them37 a 4 september session at emi yielded a recording of love me do featuring starr on drums but a dissatisfied martin hired drummer andy white for the bands third session a week later which produced recordings of love me do please please me and ps i love you37 martin initially selected the starr version of love me do for the bands first single though subsequent repressings featured the white version with starr on tambourine37 released in early october love me do peaked at number seventeen on the record retailer chart40 their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme people and places41 after martin suggested rerecording please please me at a faster tempo42 a studio session in late november yielded that recording43 of which martin accurately predicted youve just made your first no144 in december 1962 the beatles concluded their fifth and final hamburg residency45 by 1963 they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including starr despite his restricted vocal range to validate his standing in the group46 lennon and mccartney had established a songwriting partnership and as the bands success grew their dominant collaboration limited harrisons opportunities as a lead vocalist47 epstein in an effort to maximise the beatles commercial potential encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing48 lennon recalled him saying look if you really want to get in these bigger places youre going to have to change – stop eating on stage stop swearing stop smoking 36 lennon said we used to dress how we liked on and off stage hed tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers but he didnt want us suddenly looking square hed let us have our own sense of individuality36 1963–1966 beatlemania and touring years please please me and with the beatles their logo was designed by ivor arbiter49 on 11 february 1963 the beatles recorded ten songs during a single studio session for their debut lp please please me the album was supplemented by the four tracks already released on their first two singles martin originally considered recording the beatles debut lp live at the cavern club but after deciding that the buildings acoustics were inadequate he elected to simulate a live album with minimal production in a single marathon session at abbey road50 after the moderate success of love me do the single please please me met with a more emphatic reception released in january 1963 two months ahead of the album of the same name the song reached number one on every chart in london except record retailer where it stalled at number two51 recalling how the beatles rushed to deliver a debut album bashing out please please me in a day allmusics stephen thomas erlewine comments decades after its release the album still sounds fresh precisely because of its intense origins52 lennon said little thought went into composition at the time he and mccartney were just writing songs à la everly brothers à la buddy holly pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound and the words were almost irrelevant53 she loves you sample of she loves you the songs repeated use of yeah exclamations became a signature phrase for the group at the time5455 problems playing this file see media help released in march 1963 the album initiated a run during which eleven of their twelve studio albums released in the united kingdom through 1970 reached number one56 the bands third single from me to you came out in april and was also a charttopping hit starting an almost unbroken string of seventeen british numberone singles for the beatles including all but one of the eighteen they released over the next six years57 issued in august the bands fourth single she loves you achieved the fastest sales of any record in the uk up to that time selling threequarters of a million copies in under four weeks58 it became their first single to sell a million copies and remained the biggestselling record in the uk until 197859nb 1 their commercial success brought increased media exposure to which the beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time inspiring even more interest60 the band toured the uk three times in the first half of the year a fourweek tour that began in february the beatles first nationwide preceded threeweek tours in march and may–june61 as their popularity spread a frenzied adulation of the group took hold greeted with riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans the press dubbed the phenomenon beatlemania62 although not billed as tour leaders the beatles overshadowed american acts tommy roe and chris montez during the february engagements and assumed top billing by audience demand something no british act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the us63 a similar situation arose during their may–june tour with roy orbison64 mccartney harrison

emi released the album ahead of the impending single i want to hold your hand with the song excluded to maximise the singles sales75 the album caught the attention of music critic william mann of the

beatles culled from most of the songs of parlophones please please me but a management shakeup led to the album not being releasednb 2 then when it surfaced that the label did not report royalties on

households90 or 34 per cent of the american population biographer jonathan gould writes that according to the nielsen rating service it was the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an american television program91 the next morning the beatles awoke to a negative critical consensus in the us92 but a day later their first us concert saw beatlemania erupt at washington coliseum93 back in new york the following day the beatles met with another strong reception during two shows at carnegie hall90 the band then flew to florida and appeared on the weekly ed sullivan show a second time before another 70 million viewers before returning to the uk on 22 february94 a hard days night capitol records lack of interest throughout 1963 had not gone unnoticed and a competitor united artists records encouraged their film division to offer the group a threemotionpicture deal primarily for the commercial potential of the soundtracks95 directed by richard lester a hard days night involved the band for six weeks in march–april 1964 as they played themselves in a mockdocumentary96 the film premiered in london and new york in july and august respectively and was an international success with some critics drawing comparison with the marx brothers97 according to erlewine the accompanying soundtrack album a hard days night saw them truly coming into their own as a band all of the disparate influences on their first two albums had coalesced into a bright joyous original sound filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies98 that ringing guitar sound was primarily the product of harrisons 12string electric rickenbacker a prototype given to him by the manufacturer which made its debut on the record99nb 3 during the week of 4 april 1964 the beatles held twelve positions on the billboard hot 100 singles chart including the top five100nb 4 their popularity generated unprecedented interest in british music and a number of other uk acts subsequently made their own american debuts successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the british invasion102 their hairstyle unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults11 became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture103 mccartney harrison and lennon performing on dutch television in 1964 touring internationally in june and july the beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in denmark the netherlands hong kong australia and new zealand104nb 5 in august they returned to the us with a 30concert tour of 23 cities106 generating intense interest once again the monthlong tour attracted between 10000 and 20000 fans to each 30minute performance in cities from san francisco to new york106 in august journalist al aronowitz arranged for the beatles to meet bob dylan107 visiting the band in their new york hotel suite dylan introduced them to cannabis108 gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting before which the musicians respective fanbases were perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds dylans audience of college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings a dawning political and social idealism and a mildly bohemian style contrasted with their fans veritable teenyboppers – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television radio pop records fan magazines and teen fashion they were seen as idolaters not idealists109 within six months of the meeting gould writes lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated dylans nasal drone brittle strum and introspective vocal persona109 within a year the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated and the groups audience  was showing signs of growing up109nb 6 beatles for sale help and rubber soul according to gould beatles for sale the beatles fourth studio lp evidenced a growing conflict between the commercial pressures of their global success and their creative ambitions111 they had intended the album recorded between august and october 1964112 to continue the format established by a hard days night which unlike their first two lps contained only original songs113 they had nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on the previous album however and given the challenges constant international touring posed to their songwriting efforts lennon admitted materials becoming a hell of a problem114 as a result six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete the album released in early december its eight original compositions stood out demonstrating the growing maturity of the lennon–mccartney songwriting partnership113 together in 1965 celebrating a grammy win in early 1965 while they were his guests for dinner lennon and harrisons dentist secretly added lsd to their coffee lennon described the experience it was just terrifying but it was fantastic i was pretty stunned for a month or two115 he and harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug joined by starr on at least one occasion mccartney was initially reluctant to try it but eventually did so in late 1966116 he became the first beatle to discuss lsd publicly declaring in a magazine interview that it opened my eyes and made me a better more honest more tolerant member of society117 controversy erupted in june 1965 when queen elizabeth ii appointed all four beatles members of the order of the british empire mbe after prime minister harold wilson nominated them for the award118 in protest – the honour was at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders – some conservative mbe recipients returned their own insignia119 the us trailer for help with from the rear harrison mccartney lennon and largely obscured starr released in july the beatles second film help was again directed by lester described as mainly a relentless spoof of bond120 it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band mccartney said help was great but it wasnt our film – we were sort of guest stars it was fun but basically as an idea for a film it was a bit wrong121 the soundtrack was dominated by lennon who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs including the two singles help and ticket to ride122 the accompanying album the groups fifth studio lp contained all original material save for two covers act naturally and dizzy miss lizzy they were the last covers the band would include on an album with the exception of let it bes brief rendition of the traditional liverpool folk song maggie mae123 the band expanded their use of vocal overdubs on help and incorporated classical instruments into some arrangements including a string quartet on the pop ballad yesterday124 composed by mccartney yesterday would inspire the most recorded cover versions of any song ever written125 the groups third us tour opened with a performance before a worldrecord crowd of 55600 at new yorks shea stadium on 15 august 1965 – perhaps the most famous of all beatles concerts in lewisohns description126 a further nine successful concerts followed in other american cities at a show in atlanta the beatles gave one of the first live performances ever to make use of a foldback system of onstage monitor speakers127 towards the end of the tour they met with elvis presley a foundational musical influence on the band who invited them to his home in beverly hills128129 september saw the launch of an american saturdaymorning cartoon series the beatles that echoed a hard days nights slapstick antics over its twoyear original run130 the series was a historical milestone as the first weekly television series to feature animated versions of real living people131 norwegian wood this bird has flown sample of norwegian wood from rubber soul 1965 harrisons use of a sitar on this song is representative of the beatles incorporation of unconventional instrumentation into rock music132 problems playing this file see media help in midoctober 1965 the beatles entered the recording studio for the first time when making an album they had an extended period without other major commitments133 until this time according to george martin we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own134 released in december rubber soul was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the bands music132 their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy135 biographers peter brown and steven gaines attribute the new musical direction to the beatles now habitual use of marijuana136 an assertion confirmed by the band – lennon referred to it as the pot album137 and starr said grass was really influential in a lot of our changes especially with the writers and because they were writing different material we were playing differently137 after helps foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings harrisons introduction of a sitar on norwegian wood this bird has flown marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music as their lyrics grew more artful fans began to study them for deeper meaning of norwegian wood lennon commented i was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair  but in such a smokescreen way that you couldnt tell138 while many of rubber souls prominent songs were the product of lennon and mccartneys collaborative songwriting139 it also featured distinct compositions from each140 though they continued to share official credit the song in my life of which each later claimed lead authorship is considered a highlight of the entire lennon–mccartney catalogue141 harrison called rubber soul his favourite album137 and starr referred to it as the departure record142 mccartney has said wed had our cute period and now it was time to expand143 however recording engineer norman smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group – the clash between john and paul was becoming obvious he wrote and as far as paul was concerned george could do no right144 in 2003 rolling stone ranked rubber soul fifth among the 500 greatest albums of all time145 and allmusics richie unterberger describes it as one of the classic folkrock records146 controversy final tour and revolver at emi studios with george martin in the mid1960s capitol records from december 1963 when it began issuing beatles recordings for the us market exercised complete control over format79 compiling distinct us albums from the bands recordings and issuing songs of their choosing as singles147nb 7 in june 1966 yesterday and today one of capitols compilation albums caused an uproar with its cover which portrayed the grinning beatles dressed in butchers overalls accompanied by raw meat and mutilated plastic baby dolls it has been incorrectly suggested that this was meant as a satirical response to the way capitol had butchered the us versions of their albums149 thousands of copies of the lp had a new cover pasted over the original an unpeeled firststate copy fetched 10500 at a december 2005 auction150 in england meanwhile harrison met sitar maestro ravi shankar who agreed to train him on the instrument151 during a tour of the philippines the month after the yesterday and today furore the beatles unintentionally snubbed the nations first lady imelda marcos who had expected them to attend a breakfast reception at the presidential palace152 when presented with the invitation epstein politely declined on the band members behalf as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations153 they soon found that the marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer the resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty154 immediately afterwards the band members visited india for the first time155 were more popular than jesus now i dont know which will go first – rock n roll or christianity —john lennon to journalist maureen cleave 1966156 almost as soon as they returned home the beatles faced a fierce backlash from us religious and social conservatives as well as the ku klux klan over a comment lennon had made in a march interview with british reporter maureen cleave157 christianity will go lennon had said it will vanish and shrink i neednt argue about that im right and i will be proved right jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary its them twisting it that ruins it for me156 the comment went virtually unnoticed in england but when us teenage fan magazine datebook printed it five months later – on the eve of the groups august us tour – it sparked a controversy with christians in the american bible belt157 the vatican issued a protest and bans on beatles records were imposed by spanish and dutch stations and south africas national broadcasting service158 epstein accused datebook of having taken lennons words out of context at a press conference lennon pointed out if id said television was more popular than jesus i might have got away with it159 lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success but at the prompting of reporters he concluded if you want me to apologise if that will make you happy then okay im sorry159 as preparations were made for the us tour the beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard having originally used vox ac30 amplifiers they later acquired more powerful 100watt amplifiers specially designed by vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964 but these were still inadequate struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live160 recognising that their shows were no longer about the music they decided to

released in august 1966 a week before the beatles final tour marked another162 pitchforks scott plagenhoef identifies it as the sound of a band growing into supreme confidence and redefining what was expected from popular music163 revolver featured sophisticated songwriting studio experimentation and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelic rock162 abandoning the customary group photograph its cover – designed by klaus voormann a friend of the band since their hamburg days – was a stark arty blackandwhite collage that caricatured the beatles in a penandink style beholden to aubrey beardsley in goulds description162 the album was preceded by the single paperback writer backed by rain164 short promotional films were made for both songs described by cultural historian saul austerlitz as among the first true music videos165 they aired on the ed sullivan show and top of the pops in june

of the dead its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the emi building each staffed by an engineer or band member who randomly varied the movement of a tape loop while martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data167 mccartneys eleanor rigby made prominent use of a string octet gould describes it as a true hybrid conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song168 harrison was developing as a songwriter and three of his compositions earned a place on the record169 in 2003 rolling stone ranked revolver as the third greatest album of all time145 during the us tour that followed its release however the band performed none of its songs170 as chris ingham writes they were very much studio creations  and there was no way a fourpiece rock n roll group could do them justice particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans screams live beatles and studio beatles had become entirely different beasts171 the bands final concert at san franciscos

right down in the bells of brass instruments and headphones turned into microphones attached to violins we used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the wrong way around177 parts of a day in the life featured a 40piece orchestra177 the sessions initially yielded the nonalbum double aside single strawberry fields foreverpenny lane in february 1967178 the sgt pepper lp followed in june179 the musical complexity of the records created using relatively primitive fourtrack recording technology astounded contemporary artists174 among music critics acclaim for the album was virtually universal180 gould writes the overwhelming consensus is that the beatles had created a popular masterpiece a rich sustained and overflowing work of collaborative genius whose bold ambition and startling originality dramatically enlarged the possibilities and raised the expectations of what the experience of listening to popular music on record could be on the basis of this perception sgt pepper became the catalyst for an explosion of mass enthusiasm for albumformatted rock that would revolutionise both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways that far outstripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by the elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the beatlemania phenomenon of 1963181 sgt pepper was the first major poprock lp to include its complete lyrics which appeared on the back cover182183 those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis for instance in late 1967 the album was the subject of a scholarly inquiry by american literary critic and professor of english richard poirier who observed that his students were listening to the groups music with a degree of engagement that he as a teacher of literature could only envy184 poirier identified what he termed its mixed allusiveness its unwise ever to assume that theyre doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style  one kind of feeling about a subject isnt enough  any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives184 mccartney said at the time we write songs we know what we mean by them but in a week someone else says something about it and you cant deny it  you put your own meaning at your own level to our songs184 the albums elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study185 a collage designed by pop artists peter blake and jann haworth it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the albums title track186 standing in front of a crowd of famous people187 the heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style188 while cultural historian jonathan harris describes their brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms as a knowingly antiauthoritarian and antiestablishment display189 in 2003 rolling stone ranked it number one on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time145 brian epstein was dead paul and george were in complete shock i dont think it could have been worse if they had heard that their own fathers had dropped dead … brian had found them believed in them molded them turned them into millionaires and made them famous the world over … we knew that life would never be the same again – pattie boyd wife of george harrison190 on 25 june 1967 the beatles performed their forthcoming single all you need is love to an estimated 350 million viewers on our world the first live global television link191 released a week later during the summer of love the song was adopted as a flower power anthem192 two months later the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil having been introduced to maharishi mahesh yogi only the previous night in london on 25 august they travelled to bangor for his transcendental meditation retreat two days later their managers assistant peter brown phoned to inform them that epstein only thirtytwo years old had died193 the coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide194 epstein had been in a fragile emotional state stressed by personal issuesnb 8 his death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future lennon recalled we collapsed i knew that we were in trouble then i didnt really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music and i was scared i thought weve had it now196 magical mystery tour the white album and yellow submarine filming a sequence for i am the walrus magical mystery tour the soundtrack to a forthcoming beatles television film was released in the uk as a sixtrack double extended play disc ep in early december 196779197 in the united states the six songs were issued on an identically titled lp that also included five tracks from the bands recent singles101 unterberger says of the us magical mystery tour the psychedelic sound is very much in the vein of sgt pepper and even spacier in parts especially the sound collages of i am the walrus and he calls its five songs culled from the bands 1967 singles huge glorious and innovative198 in its first three weeks the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any capitol lp and it is the only capitol compilation later to be adopted in the bands official canon of studio albums199 first aired on boxing day the magical mystery tour film largely directed by mccartney brought the group their first major negative uk press it was dismissed as blatant rubbish by the daily express the daily mail called it a colossal conceit and the guardian labelled the film a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience200 gould describes it as a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on getting off and riding on a bus200 although the viewership figures were respectable its slating in the press led us television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film201 in january 1968 the beatles filmed a cameo for the animated movie yellow submarine which featured cartoon versions of the band members and a soundtrack with eleven of their songs including four unreleased studio recordings that made their debut in the film202 released in june 1968 the film was praised by critics for its music humour and innovative visual style203 it would be seven months however before its soundtrack album appeared204 the beatles known as the white album for its minimalist cover conceived by pop artist richard hamilton in direct contrast to sgt pepper while also suggesting a clean slate205 in the interim came the beatles a double lp commonly known as the white album for its virtually featureless cover206 creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction without epsteins guiding presence the group had briefly turned to maharishi mahesh yogi as their guru207 at his ashram in rishikesh india a guide course scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album208 however starr left after only ten days likening it to butlins and mccartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later209 for lennon and harrison creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as magic alex suggested that the maharishi was attempting to manipulate them207 when he alleged that the maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees a persuaded lennon left abruptly just two months into the course bringing an unconvinced harrison and the remainder of the groups entourage with him209 in anger lennon wrote a scathing song titled maharishi renamed sexy sadie to avoid potential legal issues mccartney said we made a mistake we thought there was more to him than there was207 during recording sessions for the white album which stretched from late may to midoctober 1968 relations between the beatles grew openly divisive210 starr quit for two weeks and mccartney took over the drum kit for back in the ussr on which harrison and lennon drummed as well and dear prudence211 lennon had lost interest in collaborating with mccartney212 whose contribution obladi oblada he scorned as granny music shit213 tensions were further aggravated by lennons romantic preoccupation with avantgarde artist yoko ono whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the groups wellestablished understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio214 describing the double album lennon later said every track is an individual track there isnt any beatle music on it its john and the band paul and the band george and the band215 mccartney has recalled that the album wasnt a pleasant one to make216 both he and lennon identified the sessions as the start of the bands breakup217218 issued in november the white album was the bands first apple records album release although emi continued to own their recordings219 the new label was a subsidiary of apple corps which epstein had formed as part of his plan to create a taxeffective business structure220 the record attracted more than 2 million advance orders selling nearly 4 million copies in the us in little over a month and its tracks dominated the playlists of american radio stations221 despite its popularity it did not receive flattering reviews at the time according to gould the critical response  ranged from mixed to flat in marked contrast to sgt pepper which had helped to establish an entire genre of literate rock criticism the white album inspired no critical writing of any note even the most sympathetic reviewers  clearly didnt know what to make of this shapeless outpouring of songs newsweeks hubert saal citing the high proportion of parodies accused the group of getting their tongues caught in their cheeks221 general critical opinion eventually turned in favour of the white album and in 2003 rolling stone ranked it as the tenth greatest album of all time145 pitchforks mark richardson describes it as large and sprawling overflowing with ideas but also with indulgences and filled with a hugely variable array of material  its failings are as essential to its character as its triumphs222 erlewine comments the bands two main songwriting forces were no longer on the same page but neither were george and ringo yet lennon turns in two of his best ballads mccartneys songs are stunning harrison had become a songwriter who deserved wider exposure and starrs composition was a delight223 the yellow submarine lp issued in january 1969 contained only the four previously unreleased songs that had debuted in the film along with the title track already issued on revolver all you need is love already issued as a single and on the us magical mystery tour lp and seven instrumental pieces composed by martin204 because of the paucity of new beatles music allmusics unterberger and bruce eder suggest the album might be inessential but for harrisons its all too much the jewel of the new songs  resplendent in swirling mellotron largerthanlife percussion and tidal waves of feedback guitar  a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia224 abbey road let it be and breakup although let it be was the beatles final album release it was largely recorded before abbey road the projects impetus came from an idea martin attributes to mccartney who suggested they record an album of new material and rehearse it then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film225 originally intended for a onehour television programme to be called beatles at work much of the albums content came from extensive rehearsals filmed by director michael lindsayhogg at twickenham film studios beginning in january 1969225226 martin has said that the project was not at all a happy recording experience it was a time when relations between the beatles were at their lowest ebb225 lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as hell  the most miserable  on earth and harrison the low of alltime227 irritated by both mccartney and lennon harrison walked out for five days upon returning he threatened to leave the band unless they abandoned all talk of live performance and instead focused on finishing a new album initially titled get back using songs recorded for the tv special228 he also demanded they cease work at twickenham and relocate to the newly finished apple studio the other band members agreed and the idea came about to salvage the footage shot for the tv production for use in a feature film229 apple corps building at 3 savile row site of the let it be rooftop concert american soul musician billy preston pictured in 1971 was for a short time considered a fifth beatle during the recording of get back in an effort to alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound harrison invited keyboardist billy preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions230 preston received label billing on the get back single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official beatles release231 at the conclusion of the rehearsals the band could not agree on a location to film a concert rejecting several ideas including a boat at sea a lunatic asylum the tunisian desert and the colosseum225 ultimately what would be their final live performance was filmed on the rooftop of the apple corps building at 3 savile row london on 30 january 1969232 five weeks later engineer glyn johns whom lewisohn describes as get backs uncredited producer began work assembling an album given free rein as the band all but washed their hands of the entire project233 new strains developed between the band members regarding the appointment of a financial adviser the need for which had become evident without epstein to manage business affairs lennon harrison and starr favoured allen klein who had managed the rolling stones and sam cooke234 mccartney wanted lee and john eastman – father and brother respectively of linda eastman235 whom mccartney married on 12 march236 agreement could not be reached so both klein and the eastmans were temporarily appointed klein as the beatles business manager and the eastmans as their lawyers237238 further conflict ensued however and financial opportunities were lost234 on 8 may klein was named sole manager of the band239 the eastmans having previously been dismissed as the beatles attorneys mccartney refused to sign the management contract with klein but he was outvoted by the other beatles240 martin stated that he was surprised when mccartney asked him to produce another album as the get back sessions had been a miserable experience and he had thought it was the end of the road for all of us241 the primary recording sessions for abbey road began on 2 july 1969242 lennon who rejected martins proposed format of a continuously moving piece of music wanted his and mccartneys songs to occupy separate sides of the album243 the eventual format with individually composed songs on the first side and the second consisting largely of a medley was mccartneys suggested compromise243 on 4 july the first solo single by a beatle was released lennons give peace a chance credited to the plastic ono band the completion and mixing of i want you shes so heavy on 20 august 1969 was the last occasion on which all four beatles were together in the same studio244 lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 september but agreed to withhold a public announcement to avoid undermining sales of the forthcoming album245 released six days after lennons declaration abbey road sold 4 million copies within three months and topped the uk charts for a total of seventeen weeks246 its second track the ballad something was issued as a single – the only harrison composition ever to appear as a beatles aside247 abbey road received mixed reviews although the medley met with general acclaim246 unterberger considers it a fitting swan song for the group containing some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record248 musicologist and author ian macdonald calls the album erratic and often hollow despite the semblance of unity and coherence offered by the medley249 martin has singled it out as his personal favourite of all the bands albums lennon said it was competent but had no life in it recording engineer emerick notes that the replacement of the studios valve mixing console with a transistorised one yielded a less punchy sound leaving the group frustrated at the thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its kinder gentler feel relative to their previous albums250 for the still unfinished get back album one last song harrisons i me mine was recorded on 3 january 1970 lennon in denmark at the time did not participate251 in march rejecting the work johns had done on the project now retitled let it be klein gave the session tapes to american producer phil spector who had recently produced lennons solo single instant karma252 in addition to remixing the material spector edited spliced and overdubbed several of the recordings that had been intended as live mccartney was unhappy with the producers approach and particularly dissatisfied with the lavish orchestration on the long and winding road which involved a fourteenvoice choir and 36piece instrumental ensemble253 mccartneys demands that the alterations to the song be reverted were ignored254 and he publicly announced his departure from the band on 10 april 1970 a week before the release of his first selftitled solo album253255 on 8 may the spectorproduced let it be was released its accompanying single the long and winding road was the beatles last it was released in the united states but not in the uk164 the let it be documentary film followed later that month and would win the 1970 academy award for best original song score256 sunday telegraph critic penelope gilliatt called it a very bad film and a touching one  about the breaking apart of this reassuring geometrically perfect once apparently ageless family of siblings257 several reviewers stated that some of the performances in the film sounded better than their analogous album tracks258 describing let it be as the only beatles album to occasion negative even hostile reviews unterberger calls it on the whole underrated he singles out some good moments of straight hard rock in ive got a feeling and dig a pony and praises let it be get back and the folky two of us with john and paul harmonising together259 mccartney filed suit for the dissolution of the beatles contractual partnership on 31 december 1970260 legal disputes continued long after their breakup and the dissolution was not formalised until 29 december 1974261 when john lennon signed the paperwork terminating the partnership while on vacation with his family at walt disney world resort in florida262 1970–present after the breakup see also collaborations between exbeatles 1970s lennon and mccartney in 1975 and 1976 lennon mccartney harrison and starr all released solo albums in 1970 their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the others263 starrs ringo 1973 was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four exbeatles albeit on separate songs with starrs participation harrison staged the concert for bangladesh in new york city in august 1971264 other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 later bootlegged as a toot and a snore in 74 lennon and mccartney never recorded together again265 two doublelp sets of the beatles greatest hits compiled by klein 1962–1966 and 1967–1970 were released in 1973 at first under the apple records imprint266 commonly known as the red album and blue album respectively each have earned a multiplatinum certification in the united states and a platinum certification in the united kingdom267268 between 1976 and 1982 emicapitol released a wave of compilation albums without input from the exbeatles starting with the doubledisc compilation rock n roll music269 the only one to feature previously unreleased material was the beatles at the hollywood bowl 1977 the first officially issued concert recordings by the group it contained selections from two shows they played during their 1964 and 1965 us tours270nb 9 the music and enduring fame of the beatles was commercially exploited in various other ways again often outside their creative control in april 1974 the musical john paul george ringo … and bert written by willy russell and featuring singer barbara dickson opened in london it included with permission from northern songs eleven lennonmccartney compositions and one by harrison here comes the sun displeased with the productions use of his song harrison withdrew his permission to use it272 later that year the offbroadway musical sgt peppers

elton john and keith moon to the london symphony orchestra274 the broadway musical beatlemania an unauthorised nostalgia revue opened in early 1977 and proved popular spinning off five separate touring productions275 in 1979 the band sued the producers settling for several million dollars in damages275 sgt peppers lonely hearts club band 1978 a musical film starring the bee gees and peter frampton was a commercial failure and an artistic fiasco according to ingham276 on 24 april 1976 during a broadcast of saturday night live producer lorne michaels offered the beatles 3000 to reunite on his show unbeknownst to him john lennon and paul mccartney were watching the live broadcast at johns apartment at the dakota in new york at the time which was within walking distance of the studio where the show was being shot the two men entertained the idea of hailing a cab to the studio and surprising michaels by accepting his offer but ultimately declined for as paul later said it would have been work and we were having a night off so we elected not to go it was a nice idea – we nearly did it277 1980s harrison and starr performing at the princes trust allstar rock concert at wembley arena 1987 after the murder of lennon in december 1980 harrison rewrote the lyrics to his song all those years ago in lennons honour with starr on drums and mccartney and his wife linda contributing backing vocals the song was released as a single in may 1981278 mccartneys own tribute here today appeared on his tug of war album in april 1982279 in 1987 harrisons cloud nine album included when we was fab a song about the beatlemania era280 when the beatles studio albums were released on cd by emi and apple corps in 1987 their catalogue was standardised throughout the world establishing a canon

sons julian and sean282283 mccartney declined to attend citing unresolved business differences that would make him feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with them at a fake reunion283 the following year emicapitol settled a decadelong lawsuit filed by the band over royalties clearing the way to commercially package previously unreleased material284285 1990s live at the bbc the first official release of unissued beatles performances in seventeen years appeared in 1994286 that same year mccartney harrison and starr collaborated on the anthology project anthology was the culmination of work begun in 1970 when apple corps director neil aspinall their former road manager and personal assistant had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title the long and winding road287 documenting their history in the bands own words the anthology project included the release of several unissued beatles recordings mccartney harrison and starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to two songs recorded as demos by lennon in the late 1970s288 during 1995–96 the project yielded a television miniseries an eightvolume video set and three twocdthreelp box sets featuring artwork by klaus voormann the two songs based on lennon demos free as a bird and real love were issued as new beatles singles the releases were commercially successful and the

to songs he composed for the group and during his solo career the concert included a celebration of indian classical music which had significantly influenced harrison299 in 2003 let it be naked a reconceived version of the let it be album with mccartney supervising production was released one of the main differences with the spectorproduced version was the omission of the original string arrangements300 it was a top ten hit in both britain and america the us album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 – the capitol albums volume 1 and volume 2

stage revue love george martin and his son giles remixed and blended 130 of the bands recordings to create what martin called a way of reliving the whole beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period302 the show premiered in june 2006 and the love album was released that november when mccartney discussed his hope that carnival of light a fourteenminute experimental recording made at abbey road in 1967 would receive an official release303 a rare live performance involving two exbeatles took place in april 2009 at a benefit concert organised by mccartney at new yorks radio city music

compilation were released on compact disc both individually and as a box set comparing the new releases with the 1987 cds which had been widely criticised for their lack of clarity and dynamism mojos

versions of every beatles album released in true mono along with the original 1965 stereo mixes of help and rubber soul which martin had remixed for the 1987 editions306 the beatles rock band a music

2010s owing to a longrunning royalty disagreement the beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services309 residual disagreement emanating from apple corps dispute with apple inc itunes owners over the use of the name apple was also partly responsible for the delay although in 2008 mccartney stated that the main obstacle to making the beatles catalogue available online was that emi wants something were not prepared to give them310 in 2010 the official canon of thirteen beatles studio albums past masters and the red and blue greatesthits albums were made available on itunes311 in 2012 emis recorded music operations were sold to universal music group in order for universal music to acquire emi the european union for antitrust reasons forced emi to spin

on the songs being published at least once before the end of 2013 apple records released the recordings on 17 december to prevent them from going into the public domain and had them taken down from itunes later that same day fan reactions to the release were mixed with one blogger saying the hardcore beatles collectors who are trying to obtain everything will already have these314315 on 26 january 2014 paul mccartney and ringo starr performed mccartneys queenie eye in los angeles at the 56th annual grammy awards held at the staples center in los angeles316 the following day the night

set a double vinyl set and a sixcd deluxe edition box set320 musical style and development see also lennon–mccartney in icons of rock an encyclopedia of the legends who changed music forever scott schinder and andy schwartz describe the beatles musical evolution in their initial incarnation as cheerful wisecracking moptops the fab four revolutionised the sound style and attitude of popular music and opened rock and rolls doors to a tidal wave of british rock acts their initial impact would have been enough to establish the beatles as one of their eras most influential cultural forces but they didnt stop there although their initial style was a highly original irresistibly catchy synthesis of early american rock and roll and rb the beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rocks stylistic frontiers consistently staking out new musical territory on each release the bands increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres including folkrock country psychedelia and baroque pop without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work321 in the beatles as musicians walter everett describes lennon and mccartneys contrasting motivations and approaches to composition mccartney may be said to have constantly developed – as a means to entertain – a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreedupon common language that he did much to enrich conversely lennons mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility322 ian macdonald describes mccartney as a natural melodist – a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony his melody lines are characterised as primarily vertical employing wide consonant intervals which express his extrovert energy and optimism conversely lennons sedentary ironic personality is reflected in a horizontal approach featuring minimal dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest basically a realist he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own323 macdonald praises harrisons lead guitar work for the role his characterful lines and textural colourings play in supporting lennon and mccartneys parts and describes starr as the father of modern poprock drumming324 influences the bands earliest influences include elvis presley carl perkins little richard and chuck berry325 during the beatles coresidency with little richard at the starclub in hamburg from april to may 1962 he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs326 of presley lennon said nothing really affected me until i heard elvis if there hadnt been elvis there would not have been the beatles327 other early influences include buddy holly eddie cochran roy orbison328 and the everly brothers329 the beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries including bob dylan the who frank zappa the lovin spoonful the byrds and the beach boys whose 1966 album pet sounds amazed and inspired mccartney330331332333 referring to the beach boys creative leader martin later stated no one made a greater impact on the beatles than brian wilson334 ravi shankar with whom harrison studied for six weeks in india in late 1966 had a significant effect on his musical development during the bands later years335 genres originating as a skiffle group the beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the merseybeat genre336 and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music337 reflecting the range of styles they explored lennon said of beatles for sale you could call our new one a beatles countryandwestern lp338 while gould credits rubber soul as the instrument by which legions of folkmusic enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop339 a höfner violin bass guitar and gretsch country gentleman guitar models played by mccartney and harrison respectively the vox ac30 amplifier behind them is the model the beatles used during performances in the early 1960s although the 1965 song yesterday was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings it marked the groups first recorded use of classical music elements gould observes the more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars340 they continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect sgt peppers shes leaving home for instance is cast in the mold of a sentimental victorian ballad gould writes its words and music filled with the clichés of musical melodrama341 the bands stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 bside rain described by martin strong as the first overtly psychedelic beatles record342 other psychedelic numbers followed such as tomorrow never knows recorded before rain strawberry fields forever lucy in the sky with diamonds and i am the walrus the influence of indian classical music was evident in harrisons the inner light love you to and within you without you – gould describes the latter two as attempts to replicate the raga form in miniature343 innovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution according to music historian and pianist michael campbell a day in the life encapsulates the art and achievement of the beatles as well as any single track can it highlights key features of their music the sound imagination the persistence of tuneful melody and the close coordination between words and music it represents a new category of song – more sophisticated than pop  and uniquely innovative there literally had never before been a song – classical or vernacular – that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively344 philosophy professor bruce ellis benson agrees the beatles  give us a wonderful example of how such farranging influences as celtic music rhythm and blues and country and western could be put together in a new way345 author dominic pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles far from moving sequentially from one genre to another as is sometimes conveniently suggested the group maintained in parallel their mastery of the traditional catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville one of these threads was their take on folk music which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with indian music and philosophy346 as the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained their individual tastes became more apparent the minimalistic cover artwork for the white album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music which encompassed lennons revolution 9 whose musique concrète approach was influenced by yoko ono starrs country song dont pass me by harrisons rock ballad while my guitar gently weeps and the protometal roar of mccartneys helter skelter223 contribution of george martin george martins close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the fifth beatle347 he applied his classical musical training in various ways and functioned as an informal music teacher to the progressing songwriters according to gould348 martin suggested to a sceptical mccartney that the arrangement of yesterday should feature a string quartet accompaniment thereby introducing the beatles to a hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour in macdonalds description349 their creative development was also facilitated by martins willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions such as adding something baroque to a particular recording350 in addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings martin often performed on them playing instruments including piano organ and brass351 collaborating with lennon and mccartney required martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording macdonald comments while he worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate mccartney the challenge of catering to lennons intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements of which being for the benefit of mr kite is an outstanding example352 martin said of the two composers distinct songwriting styles and his own stabilising influence compared with pauls songs all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality johns had a psychedelic almost mystical quality  johns imagery is one of the best things about his work – tangerine trees marmalade skies cellophane flowers  i always saw him as an aural salvador dalí rather than some drugridden record artist on the other hand i would be stupid to pretend that drugs didnt figure quite heavily in the beatles lives at that time  they knew that i in my schoolmasterly role didnt approve  not only was i not into it myself i couldnt see the need for it and theres no doubt that if i too had been on dope pepper would never have been the album it was perhaps it was the combination of dope and no dope that worked who knows353 harrison echoed martins description of his stabilising role i think we just grew through those years together him as the straight man and us as the loonies but he was always there for us to interpret our madness – we used to be slightly avantgarde on certain days of the week and he would be there as the anchor person to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape354 in the studio see also the beatles recording technology making innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music the beatles urged experimentation by martin and his recording engineers seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use accidental guitar feedback a resonating glass bottle a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards – any of these might be incorporated into their music355 their desire to create new sounds on every new recording combined with martins arranging abilities and the studio expertise of emi staff engineers norman smith ken townsend and geoff emerick all contributed significantly to their records from rubber soul and especially revolver onwards355 along with innovative studio techniques such as sound effects unconventional microphone placements tape loops double tracking and varispeed recording the beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time these included string and brass ensembles as well as indian instruments such as the sitar in norwegian wood and the swarmandal in strawberry fields forever356 they also used novel electronic instruments such as the mellotron with which mccartney supplied the flute voices on the strawberry fields forever intro357 and the clavioline an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboelike sound on baby youre a rich man358 legacy main article cultural impact of the beatles the beatles monument in almaty kazakhstan former rolling stone associate editor robert greenfield compared the beatles to picasso as artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original  in the form of popular music no one will ever be more revolutionary more creative and more distinctive 307 the british poet philip larkin described their work as an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of negro rockandroĺl with their own adolescent romanticism and the first advance in popular music since the war359 they not only sparked the british invasion of the us360 they became a globally influential phenomenon as well361 from the 1920s the united states had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world via hollywood movies jazz the music of broadway and tin pan alley and later the rock and roll that first emerged in memphis tennessee292 the beatles are regarded as british cultural icons with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with uk culture362363 their musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide361 many artists have acknowledged the beatles influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs364 on radio their arrival marked the beginning of a new era in 1968 the programme director of new yorks wabc radio station forbade his djs from playing any prebeatles music marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on american radio365 they helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with filler366 and they were primary innovators of the modern music video367 the shea stadium show with which they opened their 1965 north american tour attracted an estimated 55600 people126 then the largest audience in concert history spitz describes the event as a major breakthrough  a giant step toward reshaping the concert business368 emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles which became a mark of rebellion had a global impact on fashion103 according to gould the beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives from what began as the beatlemania fad the groups popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade as icons of the 1960s counterculture gould continues they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas fuelling movements such as womens liberation gay liberation and environmentalism369 according to peter lavezzoli after the more popular than jesus controversy in 1966 the beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness151 awards and achievements see also list of awards and nominations received by the beatles in 1965 queen elizabeth ii appointed lennon mccartney

included taxman and within you without you387 the songs on which starr received cowriting credit before 1968 such as what goes on and flying were also northern songs copyrights388 harrison did not renew his contract with northern songs when it ended signing instead with apple publishing while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on harrisongs thus owns the rights to his later beatles songs such as while my guitar gently weeps and something that year as well starr created startling music which holds the rights to his beatles compositions dont pass me by and octopuss garden389390 in march 1969 james arranged to sell his and his partners shares of northern songs to the british broadcasting company associated television atv founded by impresario lew grade without first informing the beatles the band then made a bid to gain controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of london brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14 holding391 the deal collapsed over the objections of lennon who declared im sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the city392 by the end of may atv had acquired a majority stake in northern songs controlling nearly the entire lennon–mccartney catalogue as well as any future material until 1973393 in frustration lennon and mccartney sold their shares to atv in late october 1969394 in 1981 financial losses by atvs parent company acc led it to attempt to sell its music division according to authors brian southall and rupert perry grade contacted mccartney offering atv music and northern songs for 30 million395 according to an account mccartney gave in 1995 he met with grade and explained he was interested solely in the northern songs catalogue if grade were ever willing to separate off that portion of atv music soon afterwards grade offered to sell him northern songs for £20 million giving the exbeatle a week or so to decide by mccartneys account he and ono countered with a £5 million bid that was rejected396 according to reports at the time grade refused to separate northern songs and turned down an offer of £21–25 million from mccartney and ono for atv music in 1982 acc as a whole was sold to australian business magnate robert holmes à court for £60 million397 three years later michael jackson purchased atv for a reported 475 million the acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 beatles songs as well as 40000 other copyrights398 in 1995 in a deal that earned him a reported 110 million jackson merged his music publishing business with sony creating a new company sonyatv music publishing in which he held a 50 stake the merger made the new company then valued at over half a billion dollars the third largest music publisher in the world399 in 2016 sony acquired jacksons share of sonyatv from the jackson estate for 750 million400 despite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs lennons estate
