sources 8 external links historyedit main articles history of copyright law and history of patent law the statute of anne came into force in 1710 the statute of monopolies 1624 and the british statute of anne 1710 are seen as the origins of patent law and copyright respectively4 firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property the first known use of the term intellectual property dates to 1769 when a piece published in the monthly review used the phrase5 the first clear example of modern usage goes back as early as 1808 when it was used as a heading title in a collection of essays6 the german equivalent was used with the founding of the north german confederation whose constitution granted legislative power over the protection of intellectual property schutz des geistigen eigentums to the confederation7 when the administrative secretariats established by the paris convention 1883 and the berne convention 1886 merged in 1893 they located in berne and also adopted the term intellectual property in their new combined title the united international bureaux for the protection of intellectual property the organization subsequently relocated to geneva in 1960 and was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the world intellectual property organization wipo by treaty as an agency of the united nations according to lemley it was only at this point that the term really began to be used in the united states which had not been a party to the berne convention3 and it did not enter popular usage there until passage of the bayhdole act in 19808 the history of patents does not begin with inventions but rather with royal grants by queen elizabeth i 1558–1603 for monopoly privileges approximately 200 years after the end of elizabeths reign however a patent represents a legal right obtained by an inventor providing for exclusive control over the production and sale of his mechanical or scientific invention demonstrating the evolution of patents from royal prerogative to commonlaw doctrine9 the term can be found used in an october 1845 massachusetts circuit court ruling in the patent case davoll et al v brown in which justice charles l woodbury wrote that only in this way can we protect intellectual property the labors of the mind productions and interests are as much a mans ownas the wheat he cultivates or the flocks he rears10 the statement that discoveries areproperty goes back earlier section 1 of the french law of 1791 stated all new discoveries are the property of the author to assure the inventor the property and temporary enjoyment of his discovery there shall be delivered to him a patent for five ten or fifteen years11 in europe french author a nion mentioned propriété intellectuelle in his droits civils des auteurs artistes et inventeurs published in 1846 until recently the purpose of intellectual property law was to give as little protection as possible in order to encourage innovation historically therefore they were granted only when they were necessary to encourage invention limited in time and scope12 the concepts origins can potentially be traced back further jewish law includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist – notably the principle of hasagat gevul unfair encroachment was used to justify limitedterm publisher but not author copyright in the 16th century13 in 500 bce the government of the greek state of sybaris offered one years patent to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury14 according to morin the global intellectual property regime is currently in the midst of a paradigm shift15 indeed up until the early 2000s the global ip regime used to be dominated by high standards of protection characteristic of ip laws from europe or the united states with a vision that uniform application of these standards over every country and to several fields with little consideration over social cultural or environmental values or of the national level of economic development morin argues that the emerging discourse of the global ip regime advocates for greater policy ﬂexibility and greater access to knowledge especially for developing countries indeed with the development agenda adopted by wipo in 2007 a set of 45 recommendations to adjust wipo’s activities to the specific needs of developing countries and aim to reduce distortions especially on issues such as patients’ access to medicines internet users’ access to information farmers’ access to seeds programmers’ access to source codes or students’ access to scientific articles16 however this paradigm shift has not yet manifested itself in concrete legal reforms at the international level17 intellectual property rightsedit intellectual property rights include patents copyright industrial design rights trademarks plant variety rights trade dress geographical indications18 and in some jurisdictions trade secrets there are also more specialized or derived varieties of sui generis exclusive rights such as circuit design rights called mask work rights in the us and supplementary protection certificates for pharmaceutical products after expiry of a patent protecting them and database rights in european law patentsedit main article patent a patent is a form of right granted by the government to an inventor giving the owner the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell and importing an invention for a limited period of time in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention an invention is a solution to a specific technological problem which may be a product or a process and generally has to fulfill three main requirements it has to be new not obvious and there needs to be an industrial applicability1917 copyrightedit main article copyright a copyright gives the creator of an original work exclusive rights to it usually for a limited time copyright may apply to a wide range of creative intellectual or artistic forms or works2021 copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves only the form or manner in which they are expressed22 industrial design rightsedit main article industrial design right an industrial design right sometimes called design right or design patent protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian an industrial design consists of the creation of a shape configuration or composition of pattern or color or combination of pattern and color in threedimensional form containing aesthetic value an industrial design can be a two or threedimensional pattern used to produce a product industrial commodity or handicraft plant varietiesedit main article plant breeders rights plant breeders rights or plant variety rights are the rights to commercially use a new variety of a plant the variety must amongst others be novel and distinct and for registration the evaluation of propagating material of the variety is examined trademarksedit main article trademark a trademark is a recognizable sign design or expression which distinguishes products or services of a particular trader from the similar products or services of other traders232425 trade dressedit main article trade dress trade dress is a legal term of art that generally refers to characteristics of the visual and aesthetic appearance of a product or its packaging or even the design of a building that signify the source of the product to consumers26 trade secretsedit main article trade secret a trade secret is a formula practice process design instrument pattern or compilation of information which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors and customers there is no formal government protection granted each business must take measures to guard its own trade secrets eg formula for cocacola objectives of intellectual property lawedit the stated objective of most intellectual property law with the exception of trademarks is to promote progress27 by exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works society and the patenteecopyright owner mutually benefit and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be absolute protection if some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation they reason more is better the thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions12 this absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of real property typically adopting its law and rhetoric other recent developments in intellectual property law such as the america invents act stress international harmonization recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage including intangible ones as well as over risks of commodification derived from this possibility28 the issue still remains open in legal scholarship financial incentiveedit these exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property and in case of patents pay associated research and development costs29 in the united states article i section 8 clause 8 of the constitution commonly called the patent and copyright clause reads the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries30 ”some commentators such as david levine and michele boldrin dispute this justification31 in 2013 the united states patent trademark office approximated that the worth of intellectual property to the us economy is more than us 5 trillion and creates employment for an estimated 18 million american people the value of intellectual property is considered similarly high in other developed nations such as those in the european union32 in the uk ip has become a recognised asset class for use in pensionled funding and other types of business finance however in 2013 the uk intellectual property office stated there are millions of intangible business assets whose value is either not being leveraged at all or only being leveraged inadvertently33 economic growthedit the wipo treaty and several related international agreements underline that the protection of intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining economic growth the wipo intellectual property handbook gives two reasons for intellectual property laws one is to give statutory expression to the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations and the rights of the public in access to those creations the second is to promote as a deliberate act of government policy creativity and the dissemination and application of its results and to encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development34 the anticounterfeiting trade agreement acta states that effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally35 economists estimate that twothirds of the value of large businesses in the united states can be traced to intangible assets36 ipintensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added price minus material cost per employee than nonipintensive industries37dubious – discuss a joint research project of the wipo and the united nations university measuring the impact of ip systems on six asian countries found a positive correlation between the strengthening of the ip system and subsequent economic growth38 moralityedit according to article 27 of the universal declaration of human rights everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific literary or artistic production of which he is the author39 although the relationship between intellectual property and human rights is a complex one40 there are moral arguments for intellectual property the arguments that justify intellectual property fall into three major categories personality theorists believe intellectual property is an extension of an individual utilitarians believe that intellectual property stimulates social progress and pushes people to further innovation lockeans argue that intellectual property is justified based on deservedness and hard work41 various moral justifications for private property can be used to argue in favor of the morality of intellectual property such as natural rightsjustice argument this argument is based on lockes idea that a person has a natural right over the labour andor products which is produced by hisher body appropriating these products is viewed as unjust although locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind42 it is possible to apply his argument to intellectual property rights in which it would be unjust for people to misuse anothers ideas43 lockes argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create they argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers this right of ownership extends to what we create thus intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production utilitarianpragmatic argument according to this rationale a society that protects private property is more effective and prosperous than societies that do not innovation and invention in 19th century america has been attributed to the development of the patent system44 by providing innovators with durable and tangible return on their investment of time labor and other resources intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility45 the presumption is that they promote public welfare by encouraging the creation production and distribution of intellectual works45 utilitarians argue that without intellectual property there would be a lack of incentive to produce new ideas systems of protection such as intellectual property optimize social utility personality argument this argument is based on a quote from hegel every man has the right to turn his will upon a thing or make the thing an object of his will that is to say to set aside the mere thing and recreate it as his own46 european intellectual property law is shaped by this notion that ideas are an extension of oneself and of ones personality47 personality theorists argue that by being a creator of something one is inherently at risk and vulnerable for having their ideas and designs stolen andor altered intellectual property protects these moral claims that have to do with personality lysander spooner 1855 argues that a man has a natural and absolute right—and if a natural and absolute then necessarily a perpetual right—of property in the ideas of which he is the discoverer or creator that his right of property in ideas is intrinsically the same as and stands on identically the same grounds with his right of property in material things that no distinction of principle exists between the two cases48 writer ayn rand argued in her book capitalism the unknown ideal that the protection of intellectual property is essentially a moral issue the belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property to violate intellectual property is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights which compromises the very processes of survival and therefore constitutes an immoral act49 infringement misappropriation and enforcementedit main article intellectual property infringement violation of intellectual property rights called infringement with respect to patents copyright and trademarks and misappropriation with respect to trade secrets may be a breach of civil law or criminal law depending on the type of intellectual property involved jurisdiction and the nature of the action as of 2011 trade in counterfeit copyrighted and trademarked works was a 600 billion industry worldwide and accounted for 5–7 of global trade50 patent infringementedit main article patent infringement patent infringement typically is caused by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder the scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection51 is defined in the claims of the granted patent there is safe harbor in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research this safe harbor does not exist in the us unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug52 in general patent infringement cases are handled under civil law eg in the united states but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also for example argentina china france japan russia south korea53 copyright infringementedit main article copyright infringement copyright infringement is reproducing distributing displaying or performing a work or to make derivative works without permission from the copyright holder which is typically a publisher or other business representing or assigned by the works creator it is often called piracy54 while copyright is created the instance a work is fixed generally the copyright holder can only get money damages if the owner registers the copyrightcitation needed enforcement of copyright is generally the responsibility of the copyright holder55 the acta trade agreement signed in may 2011 by the united states japan switzerland and the eu and which has not entered into force requires that its parties add criminal penalties including incarceration and fines for copyright and trademark infringement and obligated the parties to active police for infringement5056 there are limitations and exceptions to copyright allowing limited use of copyrighted works which does not constitute infringement examples of such doctrines are the fair use and fair dealing doctrine trademark infringementedit main article trademark infringement trademark infringement occurs when one party uses a trademark that is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark owned by another party in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services of the other party in many countries a trademark receives protection without registration but registering a trademark provides legal advantages for enforcement infringement can be addressed by civil litigation and in several jurisdictions under criminal law5056 trade secret misappropriationedit main article trade secret § misappropriation trade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws since by definition trade secrets are secret while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available in the united states trade secrets are protected under state law and states have nearly universally adopted the uniform trade secrets act the united states also has federal law in the form of the economic espionage act of 1996 18 usc §§ 1831–1839 which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime this law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity the first 18 usc § 1831a criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers the second 18 usc § 1832 criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes the statutory penalties are different for the two offenses in commonwealth common law jurisdictions confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the united statescitation needed criticismsedit further information criticism of patents and anticopyright movement demonstration in sweden in support of file sharing 2006 copying is not theft badge with a character resembling mickey mouse in reference to the in popular culture rationale behind the sonny bono copyright term extension act of 1998 the term intellectual propertyedit criticism of the term intellectual property ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like property and rights in fashions that contradict practice and law many detractors think this term specially serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform in the public interest or otherwise abusing related legislations and that it disallows intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of copyright patents trademarks etc57 free software foundation founder richard stallman argues that although the term intellectual property is in wide use it should be rejected altogether because it systematically distorts and confuses these issues and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion he claims that the term operates as a catchall to lump together disparate laws which originated separately evolved differently cover different activities have different rules and raise different public policy issues and that it creates a bias by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things likening them to property rights58 stallman advocates referring to copyrights patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term he argues that to avoid spreading unnecessary bias and confusion it is best to adopt a firm policy not to speak or even think in terms of intellectual property59 similarly economists boldrin and levine prefer to use the term intellectual monopoly as a more appropriate and clear definition of the concept which they argue is very dissimilar from property rights60 on the assumption that intellectual property rights are actual rights stallman says that this claim does not live to the historical intentions behind these laws which in the case of copyright served as a censorship system and later on a regulatory model for the printing press that may have benefited authors incidentally but never interfered with the freedom of average readers61 still referring to copyright he cites legal literature such as the united states constitution and case law to demonstrate that the law is meant to be an optional and experimental bargain to temporarily trade property rights and free speech for public not private benefits in the form of increased artistic production and knowledge he mentions that if copyright were a natural right nothing could justify terminating this right after a certain period of time62 law professor writer and political activist lawrence lessig along with many other copyleft and free software activists has criticized the implied analogy with physical property like land or an automobile they argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are nonrivalrous that is if one makes a copy of a work the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original6364 other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with tangible property there is no natural scarcity of a particular idea or information once it exists at all it can be reused and duplicated indefinitely without such reuse diminishing the original stephan kinsella has objected to intellectual property on the grounds that the word property implies scarcity which may not be applicable to ideas65 entrepreneur and politician rickard falkvinge and hacker alexandre oliva have independently compared george orwells fictional dialect newspeak to the terminology used by intellectual property supporters as a linguistic weapon to shape public opinion regarding copyright debate and drm6667 alternative termsedit in civil law jurisdictions intellectual property has often been referred to as intellectual rights traditionally a somewhat broader concept that has included moral rights and other personal protections that cannot be bought or sold use of the term intellectual rights has declined since the early 1980s as use of the term intellectual property has increased alternative terms monopolies on information and intellectual monopoly have emerged among those who argue against the property or intellect or rights assumptions notably richard stallman the backronyms intellectual protectionism and intellectual poverty68 whose initials are also ip have found supporters as well especially among those who have used the backronym digital restrictions management6970 the argument that an intellectual property right should in the interests of better balancing of relevant private and public interests be termed an intellectual monopoly privilege imp has been advanced by several academics including birgitte andersen71 and thomas alured faunce72 objections to overbroad intellectual property lawsedit the free culture movement champions the production of content that bears little or no restrictions some critics of intellectual property such as those in the free culture movement point at intellectual monopolies as harming health in the case of pharmaceutical patents preventing progress and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses73747576 and argue that the public interest is harmed by everexpansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions software patents and business method patents more recently scientists and engineers are expressing concern that patent thickets are undermining technological development even in hightech fields like nanotechnology7778798081 petra moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation overall the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors may discourage innovation on the contrary policies that encourage the diffusion of ideas and modify patent laws to facilitate entry and encourage competition may be an effective mechanism to encourage innovation82 peter drahos notes property rights confer authority over resources when authority is granted to the few over resources on which many depend the few gain power over the goals of the many this has consequences for both political and economic freedoms with in a society8313 the world intellectual property organization wipo recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights84 in 2001 the un committee on economic social and cultural rights issued a document called human rights and intellectual property that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product in order to serve human wellbeing intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws according to the committee when systems fail to do so they risk infringing upon the human right to food and health and to cultural participation and scientific benefits8586 in 2004 the general assembly of wipo adopted the geneva declaration on the future of the world intellectual property organization which argues that wipo should focus more on the needs of developing countries and to view ip as one of many tools for development—not as an end in itself87 further along these lines the ethical problems brought up by ip rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like lifesaving medicines are given ip protection while the application of ip rights can allow companies to charge higher than the marginal cost of production in order to recoup the costs of research and development the price may exclude from the market anyone who cannot afford the cost of the product in this case a lifesaving drug88 an ipr driven regime is therefore not a regime that is conductive to the investment of rd of products that are socially valuable to predominately poor populations881108–9 some libertarian critics of intellectual property have argued that allowing property rights in ideas and information creates artificial scarcity and infringes on the right to own tangible property stephan kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point imagine the time when men lived in caves one bright guy—lets call him galtmagnon—decides to build a log cabin on an open field near his crops to be sure this is a good idea and others notice it they naturally imitate galtmagnon and they start building their own cabins but the first man to invent a house according to ip advocates would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land with their own logs or to charge them a fee if they do build houses it is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property eg land and logs of others due not to first occupation and use of that property for it is already owned but due to his coming up with an idea clearly this rule flies in the face of the firstuser homesteading rule arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights89 thomas jefferson once said in a letter to isaac mcpherson on august 13 1813 if nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property it is the action of the thinking power called an idea which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself but the moment it is divulged it forces itself into the possession of every one and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it its peculiar character too is that no one possesses the less because every other possesses the whole of it he who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mine as he who lights his taper at mine receives light without darkening me90 in 2005 the rsa launched the adelphi charter aimed at creating an international policy statement to frame how governments should make balanced intellectual property law91 another aspect of current us intellectual property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works thus copyright protection can only be obtained in original works of authorship92 expansion in nature and scope of intellectual property lawsedit expansion of us copyright law assuming authors create their works by age 35 and live for seventy years other criticism of intellectual property law concerns the expansion of intellectual property both in duration and in scope in addition as scientific knowledge has expanded and allowed new industries to arise in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology originators of technology have sought ip protection for the new technologies patents have been granted for living organisms93 and in the united states certain living organisms have been patentable for over a century94 the increase in terms of protection is particularly seen in relation to copyright which has recently been the subject of serial extensions in the united states and in europe6395969798 with no need for registration or copyright notices this is thought to have led to an increase in orphan works copyrighted works for which the copyright owner cannot be contacted a problem that has been noticed and addressed by governmental bodies around the world99 also with respect to copyright the american film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization the motion picture association of america in amicus briefs in important cases in lobbying before congress and in its statements to the public the mpaa has advocated strong protection of intellectualproperty rights in framing its presentations the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor additionally congresss awareness of the position of the united states as the worlds largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property100 these doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry lending the mpaa even more power and authority101 riaa representative hilary rosen testifies before the senate judiciary committee on the future of digital music july 11 2000 the growth of the internet and particularly distributed search engines like kazaa and gnutella have represented a challenge for copyright policy the recording industry association of america in particular has been on the front lines of the fight against copyright infringement which the industry calls piracy the industry has had victories against some services including a highly publicized case against the filesharing company napster and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright the electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use softwarebased digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works laws such as the digital millennium copyright act have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems equivalent provisions to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in eu for some time and are being expanded in for example article 6 and 7 the copyright directive other examples are article 7 of the software directive of 1991 91250eec and the conditional access directive of 1998 9884eec this can hinder legal uses affecting public domain works limitations and exceptions to copyright or uses allowed by the copyright holder some copyleft licenses like gnu gpl 3 are designed to counter that102 laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventors program or for accessibility reasons however distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal in the context of trademarks this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of trademark as exemplified by the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights ratified in 1994 which formalized regulations for ip rights that had been handled by common law or not at all in member states pursuant to trips any sign which is capable of distinguishing the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark103 see alsoedit information policy industrial property freedom of
