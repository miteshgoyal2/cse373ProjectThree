hardware circa 1998 that was used by google when it was located at stanford university included3 sun microsystems ultra ii with dual 200 mhz processors and 256 mb of ram this was the main machine for the original backrub system 2 × 300 mhz dual pentium ii servers donated by intel they included 512 mb of ram and 10 × 9 gb hard drives between the two it was on these that the main search ran f50 ibm rs6000 donated by ibm included 4 processors 512 mb of memory and 8 × 9 gb hard disk drives two additional boxes included 3 × 9 gb hard drives and 6 x 4 gb hard disk drives respectively the original storage for backrub these were attached to the sun ultra ii sdd disk expansion box with another 8 × 9 gb hard disk drives donated by ibm homemade disk box which contained 10 × 9 gb scsi hard disk drives production hardwareedit google used as of 2014 a heavily customized version of debian gnulinux they migrated from a red hatbased system incrementally on 201345 the customization goal is to purchase cpu generations that offer the best performance per dollar not absolute performance how this is measured is unclear but it is likely to incorporate running costs of the entire server and cpu power consumption could be a significant factor6 servers as of 2009–2010 consisted of custommade opentop systems containing two processors each with several cores7 a considerable amount of ram spread over 8 dimm slots housing doubleheight dimms and at least two sata hard disk drives connected through a nonstandard atxsized power supply unit8 the servers were open top so more servers could be fit into a rack according to cnet and to a book by john hennessy each server had a novel 12volt battery to reduce costs and improve power efficiency79 according to google their global data center operation electrical power ranges between 500 and 681 megawatts1011 the combined processing power of these servers might have reached from 20 to 100 petaflops in 200812 network topologyedit details of the google worldwide private networks are not publicly available but google publications1314 make references to the atlas top 10 report that ranks google as the third largest isp behind level 315 in order to run such a large network with direct connections to as many isp as possible at the lowest possible cost google has a very open peering policy16 from this site we can see that the google network can be accessed from 67 public exchange points and 69 different locations across the world as of may 2012 google had 882 gbits of public connectivity not counting private peering agreements that google has with the largest isps this public network is used to distribute content to google users as well as to crawl the internet to build its search indexes the private side of the network is a secret but recent disclosure from google17 indicate that they use custom built highradix switchrouters with a capacity of 128 × 10 gigabit ethernet port for the wide area network running no less than two routers per datacenter for redundancy we can conclude that the google network scales in the terabit per second range with two fully loaded routers the bisectional bandwidth amount to 1280 gbits these custom switchrouters are connected to dwdm devices to interconnect data centers and point of presences pop via dark fibre from a datacenter view the network starts at the rack level where 19inch racks are custommade and contain 40 to 80 servers 20 to 40 1u servers on either side while new servers are 2u rackmount systems18 each rack has a switch servers are connected via a 1 gbits ethernet link to the top of rack switch tor tor switches are then connected to a gigabit cluster switch using multiple gigabit or ten gigabit uplinks19 the cluster switches themselves are interconnected and form the datacenter interconnect fabric most likely using a dragonfly design rather than a classic butterfly or flattened butterfly layout20 from an operation standpoint when a client computer attempts to connect to google several dns servers resolve wwwgooglecom into multiple ip addresses via round robin policy furthermore this acts as the first level of load balancing and directs the client to different google clusters a google cluster has thousands of servers and once the client has connected to the server additional load balancing is done to send the queries to the least loaded web server this makes google one of the largest and most complex content delivery networks21 google has numerous data centers scattered around the world at least 12 significant google data center installations are located in the united states the largest known centers are located in the dalles oregon atlanta georgia reston virginia lenoir north carolina and moncks corner south carolina22 in europe the largest known centers are in eemshaven and groningen in the netherlands and mons belgium22 googles oceania data center is claimed to be located in sydney australia 23 project 02edit one of the largest google data centers is located in the town of the dalles oregon on the columbia river approximately 80 miles 129 km from portland codenamed project 02 the 600 million24 complex was built in 2006 and is approximately the size of two american football fields with cooling towers four stories high25 the site was chosen to take advantage of inexpensive hydroelectric power and to tap into the regions large surplus of fiber optic cable a remnant of the dotcom boom a blueprint of the site appeared in 200826 summa papermilledit in february 2009 stora enso announced that they had sold the summa paper mill in hamina finland to google for 40 million euros2728 google plans to invest 200 million euros on the site to build a data center29 google chose this location due to the availability and proximity of renewable energy sources30 modular container data centersedit in 200531 google was researching a containerized modular data center google filed a patent application for this technology in 200332 softwareedit most of the software stack that google uses on their servers was developed inhouse33 according to a wellknown google employee c java python and more recently go are favored over other programming languages34 for example the back end of gmail is written in java and the back end of google search is written in c35 google has acknowledged that python has played an important role from the beginning and that it continues to do so as the system grows and evolves36 the software that runs the google infrastructure includes37 google web server gws – custom linuxbased web server that google uses for its online services storage systems google file system and its successor colossus3839 bigtable – structured storage built upon gfscolossus38 spanner – planetscale structured storage system next generation of bigtable stack3840 google f1 – a distributed quasisql dbms based on spanner substituting a custom version of mysql41 chubby lock service mapreduce and sawzall programming language indexingsearch systems teragoogle – googles large search index launched in early 2006 designed by anna patterson of cuil fame42 caffeine percolator – continuous indexing system launched in 201043 hummingbird – major search index update including complex search and voice search44 borg declarative process scheduling software google has developed several abstractions which it uses for storing most of its data45 protocol buffers – googles lingua franca for data46 a binary serialization format which is widely used within the company sstable sorted strings table – a persistent ordered immutable map from keys to values where both keys and values are arbitrary byte strings it is also used as one of the building blocks of bigtable47 recordio – a sequence of variable sized records454849 software development practicesedit most operations are readonly when an update is required queries are redirected to other servers so as to simplify consistency issues queries are divided into subqueries where those subqueries may be sent to different ducts in parallel thus reducing the latency time18 to lessen the effects of unavoidable hardware failure software is designed to be fault tolerant thus when a system goes down data is still available on other servers which increases reliability search infrastructureedit indexedit like most search engines google indexes documents by building a data structure known as inverted index such an index obtains a list of documents by a query word the index is very large due to the number of documents stored in the servers21 the index is partitioned by document ids into many pieces called shards each shard is replicated onto multiple servers initially the index was being served from hard disk drives as is done in traditional information retrieval ir systems google dealt with the increasing query volume by increasing number of replicas of each shard and thus increasing number of servers soon they found that they had enough servers to keep a copy of the whole index in main memory although with low replication or no replication at all and in early 2001 google switched to an inmemory index system this switch radically changed many design parameters of their search system and allowed for a significant increase in throughput and a large decrease in latency of queries50 in june 2010 google rolled out a nextgeneration indexing and serving system called caffeine which can continuously crawl and update the search index previously google updated its search index in batches using a series of mapreduce jobs the index was separated into several layers some of which were updated faster than the others and the main layer wouldnt be updated for as long as two weeks with caffeine the entire index is updated incrementally on a continuous basis later google revealed a distributed data processing system called percolator51 which is said to be the basis of caffeine indexing system4352 server typesedit googles server infrastructure is divided into several types each assigned to a different purpose1821535455 web servers coordinate the execution of queries sent by users then format the result into an html page the execution consists of sending queries to index servers merging the results computing their rank retrieving a summary for each hit using the document server asking for suggestions from the spelling servers and finally getting a list of advertisements from the ad server datagathering servers are permanently dedicated to spidering the web googles web crawler is known as googlebot they update the index and document databases and apply googles algorithms to assign ranks to pages each index server contains a set of index shards they return a list of document ids docid such that documents corresponding to a certain docid contain the query word these servers need less disk space but suffer the greatest cpu workload document servers store documents each document is stored on dozens of document servers when performing a search a document server returns a summary for the document based on query words they can also fetch the complete document when asked these servers need more disk space ad servers manage advertisements offered by services like adwords and adsense spelling servers make suggestions about the spelling of queries referencesedit
