serious she also commented on the fact there are a lot of misconceptions about singing im just happy to be here i think being a young artist just starting out of high school what kids listen to is club music we dont necessarily get too deep or sing like aretha franklin thats not even what music is truly about today its sad but when i want to give a little bit of sex being fabulous or sassy i definitely want to be able to sing and back that up and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that i have to be able to sing period with a band if i break my leg id like to give a show
