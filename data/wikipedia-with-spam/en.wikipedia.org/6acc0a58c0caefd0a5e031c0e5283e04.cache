polanski who claimed the magazine had libelled him in an article published in 2002 and written by a e hotchner the article recounted a claim by lewis h lapham editor of harpers that polanski had made sexual advances towards a young model as he was travelling to the funeral of his wife sharon tate in august 1969 claiming that he could make her the next sharon tate the court permitted polanski to testify via a video link after he expressed fears that he might be extradited were he to enter the united kingdom8 the trial started on july 18 2005 and polanski made english legal history as the first claimant to give evidence by video link during the trial which included the testimonies of mia farrow and others it was proved that the alleged scene at the famous new york restaurant elaines could not possibly have taken place on the date given because polanski only dined at this restaurant three weeks later also the norwegian thenmodel disputed the accounts that he had claimed to be able to make her the next sharon tate polanski was awarded £50000 damages by the high court in london the case was notable because polanski was living in france as a fugitive from us justice and never appeared in the london court for fear he would be extradited to the us graydon carter editor of vanity fair responded i find it amazing that a man who lives in france can sue a magazine that is published in america in a british courtroom9 on april 25 2008 the televised entertainment program entertainment tonight reported that 15yearold miley cyrus had posed topless for a photo shoot with
