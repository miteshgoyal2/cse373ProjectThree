inhabit the area now known as sydney were indigenous australians having migrated from northern australia and before that from southeast asia radiocarbon dating suggests human activity first started to occur in the sydney area from around 30735 years ago12 however numerous aboriginal stone tools were found in western sydneys gravel sediments that were dated from 45000 to 50000 years bp which would indicate that there was human settlement in sydney earlier than thought37 the first meeting between the native people and the british occurred on 29 april 1770 when lieutenant james cook landed at botany bay on the kurnell peninsula and encountered the gweagal clan383940 he noted in his journal that they were confused and somewhat hostile towards the foreign visitors38 cook was on a mission of exploration and was not commissioned to start a settlement he spent a short time collecting food and conducting scientific observations before continuing further north along the east coast of australia and claiming the new land he had discovered for britain prior to the arrival of the british there were 4000 to 8000 native people in sydney from as many as 29 different clans41 the earliest british settlers called the natives eora people eora is the term the indigenous population used to explain their origins upon first contact with the british its literal meaning is from this place42 sydney cove from port jackson to petersham was inhabited by the cadigal clan41 the principal language groups were darug guringai and dharawal the earliest europeans to visit the area noted that the indigenous people were conducting activities such as camping and fishing using trees for bark and food collecting shells and cooking fish38 establishment of the colonyedit convict artist thomas watlings a northward view of sydney cove 1794 britain—before that england—and ireland had for a long time been sending their convicts across the atlantic to the american colonies that trade was ended with the declaration of independence by the united states in 1776 overrun with prisoners britain decided in 1786 to found a new penal outpost in the territory discovered by cook some 16 years earlier14 captain philip led the first fleet of 11 ships and about 850 convicts into botany bay on 18 january 1788 though deemed the location unsuitable due to poor soil and a lack of fresh water he travelled a short way further north and arrived at port jackson on 26 january 17881743 this was to be the location for the new colony phillip described sydney cove as being without exception the finest harbour in the world the colony was at first to be titled new albion after albion in great britain but phillip decided on sydney44 the official proclamation and naming of the colony happened on 7 february 1788 lieutenant william dawes produced a town plan in 1790 but it was ignored by the colonys leaders sydneys layout today reflects this lack of planning45 between 1788 and 1792 about 4300 convicts were landed at sydney the colony was not founded on the principles of freedom and prosperity maps from this time show no prison buildings the punishment for convicts was transportation rather than incarceration but serious offences were penalised by flogging and hanging4647 officers and convicts alike faced starvation as supplies ran low and little could be cultivated from the land48 the regions indigenous population was also suffering it is estimated that half of the native people in sydney died during the smallpox epidemic of 17894149 some mounted violent resistance when the british established farms along the hawkesbury river west of sydney the local darug people led by pemulwuy raided farms until governor lachlan macquarie dispatched troops from the british army 46th regiment in 1816 these troops patrolled the hawkesbury valley and ended the conflict by killing 14 indigenous australians in a raid on their campsite50 macquarie did make the most of less than ideal circumstances his first task was to restore order after the rum rebellion of 1808 against the previous governor conditions in the colony were not conducive to the development of a thriving new metropolis but the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of maritime trade such as wool helped to lessen the burden of isolation4651 macquarie undertook an extensive building programme of some 265 separate works52 roads bridges wharves and public buildings were constructed using convict labour and by 1822 the town had banks markets and wellestablished thoroughfares part of macquaries effort to transform the colony was his authorisation for convicts to reenter society as free citizens52 modern developmentedit aerial illustration of sydney 1888 sydney harbour in 1932 the year 1840 was the final year of convict transportation to sydney which by this time had a population of 350001746 gold was discovered in the colony in 1851 and with it came thousands of people seeking to make money1716 sydneys population reached 200000 by 187153 following the depression of the 1890s the six colonies agreed to form a federated nation of the commonwealth of australia under the reign of queen victoria federation of the six colonies occurred on 1 january 1901 sydney with a population of 481000 then became the state capital of new south wales47 the great depression of the 1930s had a severe effect on sydneys economy as it did with most cities throughout the industrial world for much of the 1930s up to one in three breadwinners was unemployed54 construction of the sydney harbour bridge served to alleviate some of the effects of the economic downturn by employing 1400 men between 1924 and 193255 the population continued to boom despite the depression and reached 1 million in 192553 when britain declared war on germany in 1939 australia too entered during the war sydney experienced a surge in industrial development to meet the needs of a wartime economy far from mass unemployment there were now labour shortages and women becoming active in male roles sydneys harbour was attacked by the japanese in may and june 1942 with a direct attack from japanese submarines with some loss of life56 households throughout the city had built air raid shelters and performed drills following the end of the war the city continued to expand there were 17 million people living in sydney at 1950 and almost 3 million by 1975 the people of sydney warmly welcomed queen elizabeth ii in 1954 when the reigning monarch stepped onto australian soil for the first time to commence her australian royal tour57 having arrived on the royal yacht britannia through sydney heads her majesty came ashore at farm cove sydneys iconic opera house was opened in 1973 by her majesty a strong rivalry between sydney and melbourne that began in the 1850s still exists to this day585960 sydney exceeded melbournes population in the early twentieth century and remains australias largest city861 the 2000 summer

sydney lies on a submergent coastline where the ocean level has risen to flood deep rias sydney is a coastal basin with the tasman sea to the east the blue mountains to the west the hawkesbury river to the north and the woronora plateau to the south the inner city measures 25 square kilometres 10 square miles the greater sydney region covers 12367 square kilometres 4775 square miles and the citys urban area is 1687 square kilometres 651 square miles in size636465 sydney spans two geographic regions the cumberland plain lies to the south and west of the harbour and is relatively flat the hornsby plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys the flat areas of the south were the first to be developed as the city grew it was not until the construction of the sydney harbour bridge that the northern reaches of the coast became more heavily populated seventy beaches can be found along its coastline with bondi beach being one of the most famous the nepean river wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the hawkesbury river before reaching broken bay most of sydneys water storages can be found on tributaries of the nepean river the parramatta river is mostly industrial and drains a large area of sydneys western suburbs into port jackson the southern parts of the city are drained by the georges river and the cooks river into botany bay almost all of the exposed rocks around sydney are sandstone geologyedit sydney is made up of mostly triassic rock with some recent igneous dykes and volcanic necks the sydney basin was formed when the earths crust expanded subsided and filled with sediment in the early triassic period66 the sand that was to become the sandstone of today was washed from broken hill and laid down about 200 million years ago the sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds66 the sydney basin bioregion includes coastal features of cliffs beaches and estuaries deep river valleys known as rias were carved during the triassic period in the hawkesbury sandstone of the coastal region where sydney now lies the rising sea level between 18000 and 6000 years ago flooded the rias to form estuaries and deep harbours66 port jackson better known as sydney harbour is one such ria67 ecologyedit further information geography of sydney § flora and fauna and cumberland plain § ecology a dry sclerophyll bushland in sydney with eucalyptus trees royal national park sutherland shire the most prevalent plant communities in the sydney region are dry sclerophyll forests which consist of eucalyptus trees and a few casuarinas sclerophyll shrubs typically wattles and banksias and a semicontinuous grass in the understory mainly in an open woodland setting these plants tend to have rough and spiky leaves as theyre grown in areas with low soil fertility68 wet sclerophyll forests are found in the damp elevated areas of sydney such as in the northeast they are defined by straight tall tree canopies with an elaborate moist understorey of softleaved shrubs tree ferns and herbs69 sydney is home to dozens of bird species70 which commonly include the australian raven australian magpie crested pigeon noisy miner and the pied

hill is 276 °c 82 °f in february 2011 while the lowest maximum temperature is 77 °c 46 °f recorded in july 186881 the weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs81 sydney experiences an urban heat island effect83 this makes certain parts of the city more vulnerable to extreme heat83 in late spring and summer temperatures over 35 °c 95 °f are not uncommon84 though hot dry conditions are usually ended by a southerly buster85 this powerful storm brings gale winds and rapid fall in temperature followed by brief heavy rain and thunder86 due to the inland location frost is recorded in western sydney a few times in winter autumn and spring are the transitional seasons with spring showing a larger temperature variation than autumn87 lightning as seen from the sydney harbour the rainfall has a moderate to low variability and it is spread through the months but is slightly higher during the first half of the year8188 from 1990–1999 sydney received around 20 thunderstorms per year89 in late autumn and winter east coast lows may bring large amounts of rainfall especially in the cbd90 depending on the wind direction summer weather may be humid or dry with the late summerautumn period having a higher average humidity and dewpoints than late springearly summer in summer most rain falls from thunderstorms and in winter from cold fronts91 snowfall was last reported in the sydney city area in 1836 while a fall of graupel or soft hail mistaken by many for snow in july 2008 has raised the possibility that the 1836 event was not snow either92 the city is rarely affected by cyclones although remnants of excyclones do affect the city the el niño–southern oscillation plays an important role in determining sydneys weather patterns drought and bushfire on the one hand and storms and flooding on the other associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation many areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced bushfires these tend to occur during the spring and summer the city is also prone to severe storms one such storm was the 1999 hailstorm which produced massive hailstones up to 9 cm 35 in in diameter93 the bureau of meteorology has reported that 2002 through 2005 were the warmest summers in sydney since records began in 185994 the summer of 2007–08 however proved to be the coolest since 1996–97 and is the only summer this century to be at or below average in temperatures95 in 2009 dry conditions brought a severe dust storm towards eastern australia9697 the average annual

energy in australia as climate change greenhouse gas emissions and pollution have become a major issue for australia sydney has in the past been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing pollution cutting back on emissions and maintaining water quality335 since 1995 there have been significant developments in the analysis of air pollution in the sydney metropolitan region the development led to the release of the metropolitan air quality scheme maqs which led to a broader understanding of the causation of pollution in sydney allowing the government to form appropriate responses to the pollution336 australian cities are some of the most car dependent cities in the world337 sydney in particular has a very high level of car dependency338 especially by world city standards it also has
