philosophy of mind from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a phrenological mapping1 of the brain – phrenology was among the first attempts to correlate mental functions with specific parts of the brain although it is now largely discredited philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind the mind–body problem is a paradigm issue in philosophy of mind although other issues are addressed such as the hard problem of consciousness and the nature of particular mental states234 aspects of the mind that are studied include mental events mental functions mental properties consciousness the ontology of the mind the nature of thought and the relationship of the mind to the body dualism and monism are the two central schools of thought on the mind–body problem although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly dualism is seen even in the eastern tradition in the sankhya and yoga schools of hindu philosophy5 and plato6 but its entry into western philosophy was thanks to rené descartes in the 17th century7 substance dualists like descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain but that it is not a distinct substance8 monism is the position that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities independent substances this view was first advocated in western philosophy by parmenides in the 5th century bc and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist baruch spinoza9 physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist and that mental processes will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism101112131415 and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear141617 idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself or an illusion created by the mind neutral monists such as ernst mach and william james argue that events in the world can be thought of as either mental psychological or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter and dualaspect monists such as spinoza adhere to the position that there is some other neutral substance and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance the most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism these positions include behaviorism the type identity theory anomalous monism and functionalism18 most modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive or nonreductive physicalist position maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body18 these approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences especially in the fields of sociobiology computer science evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences19202122 reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states232425 nonreductive physicalists argue that although the mind is not a separate substance mental properties supervene on physical properties or that the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable and cannot be reduced to the language and lowerlevel explanations of physical science2627 continued neuroscientific progress has helped to clarify some of these issues however they are far from being resolved modern philosophers of mind continue to ask how the subjective qualities and the intentionality of mental states and properties can be explained in naturalistic terms2829 contents 1 mind–body problem 2 dualist solutions to the mind–body problem 21 arguments for dualism 22 interactionist dualism 23 other forms of dualism 231 psychophysical

relationship that exists between minds or mental processes and bodily states or processes2 the main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental statesprocesses and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body our perceptual experiences depend on stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states ultimately causing us to feel a sensation which may be pleasant or unpleasant someones desire for a slice of pizza for example will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants the question then is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties18 a related problem is how someones propositional attitudes eg beliefs and desires cause that individuals neurons to fire and muscles to contract these comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of rené descartes7 dualist solutions to the mind–body problemedit dualism is a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter or body it begins with the claim that mental phenomena are in some respects nonphysical8 one of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern sankhya and yoga schools of hindu philosophy c 650 bce which divided the world into purusha mindspirit and prakriti material substance5 specifically the yoga sutra of patanjali presents an analytical approach to the nature of the mind in western philosophy the earliest discussions of dualist ideas are in the writings of plato who maintained that humans intelligence a faculty of the mind or soul could not be identified with or explained in terms of their physical body630 however the bestknown version of dualism is due to rené descartes 1641 and holds that the mind is a nonextended nonphysical substance a res cogitans7 descartes was the first to clearly identify the mind with consciousness and selfawareness and to distinguish this from the brain which was the seat of intelligence he was therefore the first to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it still exists today7 arguments for dualismedit the most frequently used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the commonsense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter if asked what the mind is the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self their personality their soul or some other such entity they would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain or vice versa finding the idea that there is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic or simply unintelligible8 many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties along with empirical evidence from the sciences to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them8 another important argument in favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different and perhaps irreconcilable properties31 mental events have a subjective quality whereas physical events do not so for example one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like or what a blue sky looks like or what nice music sounds like to a person but it is meaningless or at least odd to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events qualia or raw feels31 there is something that it is like to feel pain to see a familiar shade of blue and so on there are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical david chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red but still not know something fundamental about the situation – what it is like to see the color red32 if consciousness the mind can exist independently of physical reality the brain one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality one possible explanation is that of a miracle proposed by arnold geulincx and nicolas malebranche where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of god another possible argument that has been proposed by c s lewis33 is the argument from reason if as monism implies all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground knowledge however is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent therefore if monism is correct there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it except by a fluke the zombie argument is based on a thought experiment proposed by todd moody and developed by david chalmers in his book the conscious mind the basic idea is that one can imagine ones body and therefore conceive the existence of ones body without any conscious states being associated with this body chalmers argument is that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via physics the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one34 others such as dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent35 or unlikely36 concept it has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that ones own conviction about being or not being a zombie is a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone elses this argument has been expressed by dennett who argues that zombies think they are conscious think they have qualia think they suffer pains—they are just wrong according to this lamentable tradition in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover35 see also the problem of other minds interactionist dualismedit portrait of rené descartes by frans hals 1648 interactionist dualism or simply interactionism is the particular form of dualism first espoused by descartes in the meditations7 in the 20th century its major defenders have been karl popper and john carew eccles37 it is the view that mental states such as beliefs and desires causally interact with physical states8 descartes famous argument for this position can be summarized as follows seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension ie it cannot be measured in terms of length weight height and so on he also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended subject to quantification and not able to think it follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties7 at the same time however it is clear that seths mental states desires beliefs etc have causal effects on his body and vice versa a child touches a hot stove physical event which causes pain mental event and makes her yell physical event this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the caregiver mental event and so on descartes argument crucially depends on the premise that what seth believes to be clear and distinct ideas in his mind are necessarily true many contemporary philosophers doubt this383940 for example joseph agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to ones own ideas freud claimed that a psychologicallytrained observer can understand a persons unconscious motivations better than the person himself does duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a persons methods of discovery better than that person herself does while malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a persons customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are he also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting descartes argument because scientists can describe a persons perceptions better than the person herself can4142 other forms of dualismedit four varieties of dualism the arrows indicate the direction of the causal interactions occasionalism is not shown psychophysical parallelismedit psychophysical parallelism or simply parallelism is the view that mind and body while having distinct ontological statuses do not causally influence one another instead they run along parallel paths mind events causally interact with mind events and brain events causally interact with brain events and only seem to influence each other43 this view was most prominently defended by gottfried leibniz although leibniz was an ontological monist who believed that only one type of substance the monad exists in the universe and that everything is reducible to it he nonetheless maintained that there was an important distinction between the mental and the physical in terms of causation he held that god had arranged things in advance so that minds and bodies would be in harmony with each other this is known as the doctrine of preestablished harmony44 occasionalismedit occasionalism is the view espoused by nicholas malebranche that asserts that all supposedly causal relations between physical events or between physical and mental events are not really causal at all while body and mind are different substances causes whether mental or physical are related to their effects by an act of gods intervention on each specific occasion45 property dualismedit property dualism is the view that the world is constituted of just one kind of substance – the physical kind – and there exist two distinct kinds of properties physical properties and mental properties in other words it is the view that nonphysical mental properties such as beliefs desires and emotions inhere in some physical bodies at least brains how mental and physical properties relate causally depends on the variety of property dualism in question and is not always a clear issue subvarieties of property dualism include strong emergentism asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way ie in the way that living human bodies are organized mental properties emerge in a way not fully accountable for by physical laws hence it is a form of emergent materialism8 these emergent properties have an independent ontological status and cannot be reduced to or explained in terms of the physical substrate from which they emerge they are dependent on the physical properties from which they emerge but opinions vary as to the coherence of top–down causation ie the causal effectiveness of such properties a form of property dualism has been espoused by david chalmers and the concept has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years46 but was already suggested in the 19th century by william james epiphenomenalism is a doctrine first formulated by thomas henry huxley47 it consists of the view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual where one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects but not the causes of physical phenomena physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events but mental events cannot cause anything since they are just causally inert byproducts ie epiphenomena of the physical world43 this view has been defended most strongly in recent times by frank jackson48 nonreductive physicalism is the view that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties mental states such as qualia are not reducible to physical states the ontological stance towards qualia in the case of nonreductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism panpsychism is the view that all matter has a mental aspect or alternatively all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view superficially it seems to be a form of property dualism since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties however some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of complex structure in a compound object so long as the reduction of nonmental properties to mental ones is in place panpsychism is not a strong form of property dualism otherwise it is dual aspect theoryedit dual aspect theory or dualaspect monism is the view that the mental and the physical are two aspects of or perspectives on the same substance thus it is a mixed position which is monistic in some respects in modern philosophical writings the theorys relationship to neutral monism has become somewhat illdefined but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements and the relationships into which they enter to determine whether the group can be thought of as mental physical both or neither dualaspect theory suggests that the mental and the physical are manifestations or aspects of some underlying substance entity or process that is itself neither mental nor physical as normally understood various formulations of dualaspect monism also require the mental and the physical to be complementary mutually irreducible and perhaps inseparable though distinct495051 experiential dualismedit a philosophy of mind that regards the degrees of freedom between mental and physical wellbeing as not necessarily synonymous and thus implying an experiential dualism between body and mind as example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by allan wallace who notes that it is experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable—for instance while engaging in a strenuous physical workout—while mentally cheerful conversely one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort52 experiential dualism notes that our subjective experience of merely seeing something in the physical world seems qualitatively different than mental processes like grief that comes from losing a loved one for instance this philosophy also is a proponent of causal dualism which is defined as the dual ability for mental states and physical states to affect one another mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa however unlike cartesian dualism or some other systems experiential dualism does not posit two fundamental substances in reality mind and matter rather experiential dualism is to be understood as a conceptual framework that gives credence to the qualitative difference between the experience of mental and physical states experiential dualism is accepted as the conceptual framework of madhyamaka buddhism madhayamaka buddhism goes even further finding fault with the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind as well in that these generally posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality nonetheless this does not imply that the cartesian dualist view is correct rather madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality in denying the independent selfexistence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience the madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of descartes and the substance monism—namely physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science the physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical thingsinthemselves while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances devoid of any reality in and of themselves much is made of this difference between appearances and reality52 indeed physicalism or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality is explicitly rejected by buddhism in the madhyamaka view mental events are no more or less real than physical events in terms of our commonsense experience differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena while the former commonly have mass location velocity shape size and numerous other physical attributes these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena for example we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location these physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness a recalled image from one’s childhood the visual perception of a rose or consciousness of any sort mental phenomena are therefore not regarded as being physical for the simple reason that they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena thus buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real52 hylomorphismedit main article hylomorphism monist solutions to the mind–body problemedit in contrast to dualism monism does not accept any fundamental divisions the fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia in indian and chinese philosophy monism is integral to how experience is understood today the most common forms of monism in western philosophy are physicalist18 physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science53 however a variety of formulations see below are possible another form of monism idealism states that the only existing substance is mental although pure idealism such as that of george berkeley is uncommon in contemporary western philosophy a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties has been espoused by some philosophers such as alfred north whitehead54 and david ray griffin46 phenomenalism is the theory that representations or sense data of external objects are all that exist such a view was briefly adopted by bertrand russell and many of the logical positivists during the early 20th century55 a third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental the mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance such a position was adopted by baruch spinoza9 and was popularized by ernst mach56 in the 19th century this neutral monism as it is called resembles property dualism physicalistic monismsedit behaviorismedit main article behaviorism behaviorism dominated philosophy of mind for much of the 20th century especially the first half18 in psychology behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism53 introspective reports on ones own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations without generalizability and the possibility of thirdperson examination the behaviorists argued psychology cannot be scientific53 the way out therefore was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life and hence an ontologically independent mind altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior57 parallel to these developments in psychology a philosophical behaviorism sometimes called logical behaviorism was developed53 this is characterized by a strong verificationism which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless for the behaviorist mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports they are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways made by third parties to explain and predict anothers behavior58 philosophical behaviorism has fallen out of favor since the latter half of the 20th century coinciding with the rise of cognitivism2 cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several perceived problems for example behaviorism could be said to be counterintuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache identity theoryedit main article type physicalism type physicalism or typeidentity theory was developed by john smart25 and ullin place59 as a direct reaction to the failure of behaviorism these philosophers reasoned that if mental states are something material but not behavioral then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain in very simplified terms a mental state m is nothing other than brain state b the mental state desire for a cup of coffee would thus be nothing more than the firing of certain neurons in certain brain regions25 the classic identity theory and anomalous monism in contrast for the identity theory every token instantiation of a single mental type corresponds as indicated by the arrows to a physical token of a single physical type for anomalous monism the token–token correspondences can fall outside of the type–type correspondences the result is token identity despite its initial plausibility the identity theory faces a strong challenge in the form of the thesis of multiple realizability first formulated by hilary putnam27 it is obvious that not only humans but many different species of animals can for example experience pain however it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state and if this is the case then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state the identity theory is thus empirically unfounded27 on the other hand even granted the above it does not follow that identity theories of all types must be abandoned according to token identity theories the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state the type–token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example the word green contains four types of letters g r e n with two tokens occurrences of the letter e along with one each of the others the idea of token identity is that only particular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events60 anomalous monism see below and most other nonreductive physicalisms are tokenidentity theories61 despite these problems there is a renewed interest in the type identity theory today primarily due to the influence of jaegwon kim25 functionalismedit main article functionalism philosophy of mind functionalism was formulated by hilary putnam and jerry fodor as a reaction to the inadequacies of the identity theory27 putnam and fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical computational theory of the mind62 at about the same time or slightly after dm armstrong and david kellogg lewis formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles63 finally wittgensteins idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning further developed by wilfrid sellars and gilbert harman another one psychofunctionalism is an approach adopted by the naturalistic philosophy of mind associated with jerry fodor and zenon pylyshyn what all these different varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs that is functionalism abstracts away from the details of the physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of nonmental functional properties for example a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances from this point of view it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue plastic nanotubes or silicon chips it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney62 nonreductive physicalismedit main article physicalism nonreductionist philosophers hold firmly to two essential convictions with regard to mind–body relations 1 physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states but 2 all reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory mental states cannot be reduced to behavior brain states or functional states53 hence the question arises whether there can still be a nonreductive physicalism donald davidsons anomalous monism26 is an attempt to formulate such a physicalism he thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities of reason such as akrasia or selfdeception the personal psychology framework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one but rather must be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle of charity can be found elsewhere64 davidson uses the thesis of supervenience mental states supervene on physical states but are not reducible to them supervenience therefore describes a functional dependence there can be no change in the mental without some change in the physical–causal reducibility between the mental and physical without ontological reducibility65 because nonreductive physicalist theories attempt to both retain the ontological distinction between mind and body and to try to solve the surfeit of explanations puzzle in some way critics often see this as a paradox and point out the similarities to epiphenomenalism in that it is the brain that is seen as the root cause not the mind and the mind seems to be rendered inert epiphenomenalism regards one or more mental states as the byproduct of physical brain states having no influence on physical states the interaction is oneway solving the surfeit of explanations puzzle but leaving us with nonreducible mental states as a byproduct of brain states – causally reducible but ontologically irreducible to physical states pain would be seen by epiphenomenaliasts as being caused by the brain state but as not having effects on other brain states though it might have effects on other mental states ie cause distress weak emergentismedit main article emergentism weak emergentism is a form of nonreductive physicalism that involves a layered view of nature with the layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity and each corresponding to its own special science some philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels while others maintain that higherorder properties simply supervene over lower levels without direct causal interaction the latter group therefore holds a less strict or weaker definition of emergentism which can be rigorously stated as follows a property p of composite object o is emergent if it is metaphysically impossible for another object to lack property p if that object is composed of parts with intrinsic properties identical to those in o and has those parts in an identical configuration sometimes emergentists use the example of water having a new property when hydrogen h and oxygen o combine to form h2o water in this example there emerges a new property of a transparent liquid that would not have been predicted by understanding hydrogen and oxygen as gases this is analogous to physical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state emergentists try to solve the notorious mind–body gap this way one problem for emergentism is the idea of causal closure in the world that does not allow for a mindtobody causation66 eliminative materialismedit main article eliminative materialism if one is a materialist and believes that all aspects of our commonsense psychology will find reduction to a mature cognitive neuroscience and that nonreductive materialism is mistaken then one can adopt a final more radical position eliminative materialism there are several varieties of eliminative materialism but all maintain that our commonsense folk psychology badly misrepresents the nature of some aspect of cognition eliminativists such as patricia and paul churchland argue that while folk psychology treats cognition as fundamentally sentencelike the nonlinguistic vectormatrix model of neural network theory or connectionism will prove to be a much more accurate account of how the brain works23 the churchlands often invoke the fate of other erroneous popular theories and ontologies that have arisen in the course of history2324 for example ptolemaic astronomy served to explain and roughly predict the motions of the planets for centuries but eventually this model of the solar system was eliminated in favor of the copernican model the churchlands believe the same eliminative fate awaits the sentencecruncher model of the mind in which thought and behavior are the result of manipulating sentencelike states called propositional attitudes nonphysicalist monismsedit idealismedit idealism is the form of monism that sees the world as consisting of minds mental contents and or consciousness idealists are not faced with explaining how minds arise from bodies rather the world bodies and objects are regarded as mere appearances held by minds however accounting for the mind–body problem is not usually the main motivation for idealism rather idealists tend to be motivated by skepticism intentionality and the unique nature of ideas idealism is prominent in eastern religious and philosophical thought it has gone through several cycles of popularity and neglect in the history of western philosophy different varieties of idealism may hold that there are multiple minds pluralistic idealism only one human mind solipsism or a single absolute anima mundi one or oversoul neutral monismedit neutral monism in philosophy is the metaphysical view that the mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements which are themselves neutral that is neither physical nor mental this view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things rather neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff in the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical these neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape just as we experience those properties but these shaped and colored elements do not exist in a mind considered as a substantial entity whether dualistically or physicalistically they exist on their own mysterianismedit main article new mysterianism some philosophers take an epistemic approach and argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings this is usually termed new mysterianism colin mcginn holds that human beings are cognitively closed in regards to their own minds according to mcginn human minds lack the conceptforming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis67 an example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics a more moderate conception has been expounded by thomas nagel which holds that the mind body problem is currently unsolvable at the present stage of scientific development and that it might take a future scientific paradigm shift or revolution to bridge the explanatory gap nagel posits that in the future a sort of objective phenomenology might be able to bridge the gap between subjective conscious experience and its physical basis68 linguistic criticism of the mind–body problemedit each attempt to answer the mind–body problem encounters substantial problems some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion69 these philosophers such as ludwig wittgenstein and his followers in the tradition of linguistic criticism therefore reject the problem as illusory70 they argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance in a mental and in a biological vocabulary illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the others vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts70 this is the case for instance if one searches for mental states of the brain the brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning70 today such a position is often adopted by interpreters of wittgenstein such as peter hacker69 however hilary putnam the originator of functionalism has also adopted the position that the mind–body problem is an illusory problem which should be dissolved according to the manner of wittgenstein71 externalism and internalismedit where is the mind located if the mind is a physical phenomenon of some kind it has to be located somewhere according to some there are two possible options either the mind is internal to the body internalism or the mind is external to it externalism more generally either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subjects body or it depends also on factors external to it proponents of internalism are committed to the view that neural activity is sufficient to produce the mind proponents of externalism maintain that the surrounding world is in some sense constitutive of the mind externalism differentiates into several versions the main ones are semantic externalism cognitive externalism phenomenal externalism each of these versions of externalism can further be divided whether they refer only to the content or to the vehicles of mind semantic externalism holds that the semantic content of the mind is totally or partially defined by state of affairs external to the body of the subject hilary putnams twin earth thought experiment is a good example cognitive externalism is a very broad collection of views that suggests the role of the environment of tools of development and of the body in fleshing out cognition embodied cognition the extended mind and enactivism are good examples phenomenal externalism suggests that the phenomenal aspects of the mind are external to the body authors who addressed this possibility are ted honderich edwin holt francois tonneau kevin oregan riccardo manzotti teed rockwell and max velmans naturalism and its problemsedit the thesis of physicalism is that the mind is part of the material or physical world such a position faces the problem that the mind has certain properties that no other material thing seems to possess physicalism must therefore explain how it is possible that these properties can nonetheless emerge from a material thing the project of providing such an explanation is often referred to as the naturalization of the mental53 some of the crucial problems that this project attempts to resolve include the existence of qualia and the nature of intentionality53 qualiaedit main article qualia many mental states seem to be experienced subjectively in different ways by different individuals32 and it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality eg of pain that it hurts however the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical since no one has a perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from the existence of cerebral events in and of themselves cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences the puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain31 yet it also seems to many that science will eventually have to explain such experiences53 this follows from an assumption about the possibility of reductive explanations according to this view if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively eg water then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties eg fluidity transparency53 in the case of mental states this means that there needs to be an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way the 20thcentury german philosopher martin heidegger criticized the ontological assumptions underpinning such a reductive model and claimed that it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms this is because according to heidegger the nature of our subjective experience and its qualities is impossible to understand in terms of cartesian substances that bear properties another way to put this is that the very concept of qualitative experience is incoherent in terms of—or is semantically incommensurable with the concept of—substances that bear properties72 this problem of explaining introspective firstperson aspects of mental states and consciousness in general in terms of thirdperson quantitative neuroscience is called the explanatory gap73 there are several different views of the nature of this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind david chalmers and the early frank jackson interpret the gap as ontological in nature that is they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because physicalism is false there are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other74 an alternative view is taken by philosophers such as thomas nagel and colin mcginn according to them the gap is epistemological in nature for nagel science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required we are not even able to formulate the problem coherently32 for mcginn on other hand the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations we are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants75 other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem this semantic problem of course led to the famous qualia question which is does red cause redness intentionalityedit main article intentionality john searle—one of the most influential philosophers of mind proponent of biological naturalism berkeley 2002 intentionality is the capacity of mental states to be directed towards about or be in relation with something in the external world29 this property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values when one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem natural processes are not true or false they simply happen76 it would not make any sense to say that a natural process is true or false but mental ideas or judgments are true or false so how then can mental states ideas or judgments be natural processes the possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts thus for example the idea that herodotus was a historian refers to herodotus and to the fact that he was a historian if the fact is true then the idea is true otherwise it is false but where does this relation come from in the brain there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with herodotus28 philosophy of perceptionedit main article philosophy of perception philosophy of perception is concerned with the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual objects in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and beliefs about the world the main contemporary views within philosophy of perception include naive realism enactivism and representional views3477 philosophy of mind and scienceedit humans are corporeal beings and as such they are subject to examination and description by the natural sciences since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings play an important role in the philosophy of mind2 there are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental the list of such sciences includes biology computer science cognitive science cybernetics linguistics medicine pharmacology and psychology78 neurobiologyedit main article neuroscience the theoretical background of biology as is the case with modern natural sciences in general is fundamentally materialistic the objects of study are in the first place physical processes which are considered to be the foundations of mental activity and behavior79 the increasing success of biology in the explanation of mental phenomena can be seen by the absence of any empirical refutation of its fundamental presupposition there can be no change in the mental states of a person without a change in brain states78 within the field of neurobiology there are many subdisciplines that are concerned with the relations between mental and physical states and processes79 sensory neurophysiology investigates the relation between the processes of perception and stimulation80 cognitive neuroscience studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes80 neuropsychology describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain80 lastly evolutionary biology studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and in as much as this is the basis of the mind also describes the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages78 evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind as the genebased mechanism of natural selection does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods81 since the 1980s sophisticated neuroimaging procedures such as fmri above have furnished increasing knowledge about the workings of the human brain shedding light on ancient philosophical problems the methodological breakthroughs of the neurosciences in particular the introduction of hightech neuroimaging procedures has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs one of the main goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions see neural correlate79 several groups are inspired by these advances computer scienceedit main article computer science computer science concerns itself with the automatic processing of information or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned by means of such things as computers82 from the beginning computer programmers have been able to develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind a simple example is multiplication it is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind could they someday come to have what we call a mind this question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence ai within ai it is common to distinguish between a modest research program and a more ambitious one this distinction was coined by john searle in terms of a weak ai and strong ai the exclusive objective of weak ai according to searle is the successful simulation of mental states with no attempt to make computers become conscious or aware etc the objective of strong ai on the contrary is a computer with consciousness similar to that of human beings83 the program of strong ai goes back to one of the pioneers of computation alan turing as an answer to the question can computers think he formulated the famous turing test84 turing believed that a computer could be said to think when if placed in a room by itself next to another room that contained a human being and with the same questions being asked of both the computer and the human being by a third party human being the computers responses turned out to be indistinguishable from those of the human essentially turings view of machine intelligence followed the behaviourist model of the mind—intelligence is as intelligence does the turing test has received many criticisms among which the most famous is probably the chinese room thought experiment formulated by searle83 the question about the possible sensitivity qualia of computers or robots still remains open some computer scientists believe that the specialty of ai can still make new contributions to the resolution of the mind body problem they suggest that based on the reciprocal influences between software and hardware that takes place in all computers it is possible that someday theories can be discovered that help us to understand the reciprocal influences between the human mind and the brain wetware85 psychologyedit main article psychology psychology is the science that investigates mental states directly it uses generally empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like joy fear or obsessions psychology investigates the laws that bind these mental states to each other or with inputs and outputs to the human organism86 an example of this is the psychology of perception scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms a law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other78 this law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states however it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states the laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described cognitive scienceedit cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes it examines what cognition is what it does and how it works it includes research on intelligence and behavior especially focusing on how information is represented processed and transformed in faculties such as perception language memory reasoning and emotion within nervous systems human or other animal and machines eg computers cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines including psychology artificial intelligence philosophy neuroscience linguistics anthropology sociology and education87 it spans many levels of analysis from lowlevel learning and decision mechanisms to highlevel logic and planning from neural circuitry to modular brain organisation rowlands argues that cognition is enactive embodied embedded affective and potentially extended the position is taken that the classical sandwich of cognition sandwiched between perception and action is artificial cognition has to be seen as a product of a strongly coupled interaction that cannot be divided this way8889 philosophy of mind in the continental traditionedit most of the discussion in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern western culture usually called analytic philosophy sometimes described as angloamerican philosophy90 many other schools of thought exist however which are sometimes subsumed under the broad and vague label of continental philosophy90 in any case though topics and methods here are numerous in relation to the philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label phenomenology existentialism etc can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience with reference specifically to the discussion of the mind this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms90 immanuel kants critique of pure reason first published in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787 represents a significant intervention into what will later become known as the philosophy of mind kants first critique is generally recognized as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the west kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both continental and analyticangloamerican philosophy kants work develops an indepth study of transcendental consciousness or the life of the mind as conceived through universal categories of consciousness in georg wilhelm friedrich hegels philosophy of mind frequently translated as philosophy of spirit or geist91 the third part of his encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences hegel discusses three distinct types of mind the subjective mindspirit the mind of an individual the objective mindspirit the mind of society and of the state and the absolute mindspirit the position of religion art and philosophy see also hegels phenomenology of spirit nonetheless hegels work differs radically from the style of angloamerican philosophy of mind in 1896 henri bergson made in matter and memory essay on the relation of body and spirit a forceful case for the ontological difference of body and mind by reducing the problem to the more definite one of memory thus allowing for a solution built on the empirical test case of aphasia in modern times the two main schools that have developed in response or opposition to this hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism phenomenology founded by edmund husserl focuses on the contents of the human mind see noema and how processes shape our experiences92 existentialism a school of thought founded upon the work of søren kierkegaard focuses on human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive existentialphenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy they are not contradictory rooted in the work of husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of martin heidegger jeanpaul sartre simone de beauvoir and maurice merleauponty see heideggers being and time merleaupontys phenomenology of perception sartres being and nothingness and simone de beauvoirs the second sex mind in eastern philosophyedit mind in hindu philosophyedit dualismedit substance dualism is a common feature of several orthodox hindu schools including the sāṅkhya nyāya yoga and dvaita vedanta in these schools a clear difference is drawn between matter and a nonmaterial soul which is eternal and undergoes samsara a cycle of death and rebirth the nyāya school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a nonmaterial self the atman93 many of these schools see their spiritual goal as moksha liberation from the cycle of reincarnation vedanta monistic idealismedit śaṅkara in the advaita vedanta of the 8th century indian philosopher śaṅkara the mind body and world are all held to be the same unchanging eternal conscious entity called brahman advaita which means nondualism holds the view that all that exists is pure absolute consciousness the fact that the world seems to be made up of changing entities is an illusion or maya the only thing that exists is brahman which is described as satchitananda being consciousness and bliss advaita vedanta is best described by a verse which states brahman is alone true and this world of plurality is an error the individual self is not different from brahman94 another form of monistic vedanta is vishishtadvaita qualified nondualism as posited by the eleventh century philosopher ramanuja ramanuja criticized advaita vedanta by arguing that consciousness is always intentional and that it is also always a property of something ramanujas brahman is defined by a multiplicity of qualities and properties in a single monistic entity this doctrine is called samanadhikaranya several things in a common substrate95 materialismedit arguably the first exposition of empirical materialism in the history of philosophy is in the cārvāka school also called lokāyata the cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter which they defined as being made up of the four elements including god and the soul therefore they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms a section of the cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath but since this also was a form of matter it was not said to survive death96 buddhist philosophy of mindedit  the five

of consciousness and other aggregates  source mn 109 thanissaro 2001    diagram details buddhist teachings describe that the mind manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing97 the momentbymoment manifestation of the mindstream has been described as happening in every person all the time even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world or analyses the material body including the organ brain97 the manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws biological laws psychological laws volitional laws and universal laws97 a salient feature of buddhist philosophy which sets it apart from indian orthodoxy is the centrality of the doctrine of notself pāli anatta skt anātman the buddhas notself doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self in this sense what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous way of looking at the ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors98 the relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependentarising pratītyasamutpāda this means that all things including mental events arise codependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions this seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind98 abhidharma theories of mindedit three centuries after the death of the buddha c 150 bce saw the growth of a large body of literature called the abhidharma in several contending buddhist schools in the abdhidharmic analysis of mind the ordinary thought is defined as prapañca conceptual proliferation according to this theory perceptual experience is bound up in multiple conceptualizations expectations judgments and desires this proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like self and other upon an ever changing stream of aggregate phenomena98 in this conception of mind no strict distinction is made between the conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various phenomena consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities five for the five senses and sixth for perception of mental phenomena98 the arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or introspective awareness manovijñāna and attention āvartana the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions rejection of a permanent agent eventually led to the philosophical problems of the seeming continuity of mind and also of explaining how rebirth and karma continue to be relevant doctrines without an eternal mind this challenge was met by the theravāda school by introducing the concept of mind as a factor of existence this lifestream bhavangasota is an undercurrent forming the condition of being the continuity of a karmic person is therefore assured in the form of a mindstream cittasantana a series of flowing mental moments arising from the subliminal lifecontinuum mind bhavangacitta mental content and attention98 indian mahayanaedit the sautrāntika school held a form of phenomenalism that saw the world as imperceptible it held that external objects exist only as a support for cognition which can only apprehend mental representations this influenced the later yogacara school of mahayana buddhism the yogācāra school is often called the mindonly school because of its internalist stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality the works of vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of idealism vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects as anything other than mental entities99 scholarly interpretations of vasubandhus philosophy vary widely and include phenomenalism neutral monism and realist phenomenology the indian mahayana schools were divided on the issue of the possibility of reflexive awareness svasaṃvedana dharmakīrti accepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the yogacara school comparing it to lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other objects this was strictly rejected by mādhyamika scholars like candrakīrti since in the philosophy of the mādhyamika all things and mental events are characterized by emptiness they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness98 these views were ultimately reconciled by the 8th century thinker śāntarakṣita in śāntarakṣitas synthesis he adopts the idealist yogācāra views of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the two truths doctrine thus he states by relying on the mindonly system know that external entities do not exist and by relying on this middle way system know that no self exists at all even in that mind 100 the yogācāra school also developed the theory of the repository consciousness ālayavijñāna to explain continuity of mind in rebirth and accumulation of karma this repository consciousness acts as a storehouse for karmic seeds bija when all other senses are absent during the process of death and rebirth as well as being the causal potentiality of dharmic phenomena98 thus according to b alan wallace no constituents of the body—in the brain or elsewhere—transform into mental states and processes such subjective experiences do not emerge from the body but neither do they emerge from nothing rather all objective mental appearances arise from the substrate and all subjective mental states and processes arise from the substrate consciousness101 tibetan buddhismedit tibetan buddhist theories of mind evolved directly from the indian mahayana views thus the founder of the gelug school je tsongkhapa discusses the yogācāra system of the eight consciousnesses in his explanation of the difficult points102 he would later come to repudiate śāntarakṣitas pragmatic idealism according to the 14th dalai lama the mind can be defined as an entity that has the nature of mere experience that is clarity and knowing it is the knowing nature or agency that is called mind and this is nonmaterial103 the simultaneously dual nature of mind is as follows 1 clarity gsal – the mental activity which produces cognitive phenomena snangba 2 knowing rig – the mental activity of perceiving cognitive phenomena the 14th dalai lama has also explicitly laid out his theory of mind as experiential dualism which is described above under the different types of dualism52 because tibetan philosophy of mind is ultimately soteriological it focuses on meditative practices such as dzogchen and mahamudra that allow a practitioner to experience the true reflexive nature of their mind directly this unobstructed knowledge of ones primordial empty and nondual buddha nature is called rigpa the minds innermost nature is described among various schools as pure luminosity or clear light od gsal and is often compared to a crystal ball or a mirror sogyal rinpoche speaks of mind thus imagine a sky empty spacious and pure from the beginning its essence is like this imagine a sun luminous clear unobstructed and spontaneously present its nature is like this zen buddhismedit the central issue in chinese zen philosophy of mind is in the difference between the pure and awakened mind and the defiled mind chinese chan master huangpo described the mind as without beginning and without form or limit while the defiled mind was that which was obscured by attachment to form and concepts104 the pure buddhamind is thus able to see things as they truly are as absolute and nondual thusness tathatā this nonconceptual seeing also includes the paradoxical fact that there is no difference between a defiled and a pure mind as well as no difference between samsara and nirvana104 in the shobogenzo the japanese philosopher dogen argued that body and mind are neither ontologically nor phenomenologically distinct but are characterized by a oneness called shin jin bodymind according to dogen casting off body and mind shinjin datsuraku in zazen will allow one to experience thingsastheyare genjokoan which is the nature of original enlightenment hongaku105 topics related to philosophy of mindedit there are countless subjects that are affected by the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind clear examples of this are the nature of death and its definitive character the nature of emotion of perception and of memory questions about what a person is and what his or her identity consists of also have much to do with the philosophy of mind there are two subjects that in connection with the philosophy of the mind have aroused special attention free will and the self2 free willedit main article free will in the context of philosophy of mind the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity this is certainly the case at least for materialistic determinists2 according to this position natural laws completely determine the course of the material world mental states and therefore the will as well would be material states which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws some take this reasoning a step further people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do consequently they are not free106 this argumentation is rejected on the one hand by the compatibilists those who adopt this position suggest that the question are we free can only be answered once we have determined what the term free means the opposite of free is not caused but compelled or coerced it is not appropriate to identify freedom with indetermination a free act is one where the agent could have done otherwise if it had chosen otherwise in this sense a person can be free even though determinism is true106 the most important compatibilist in the history of the philosophy was david hume107 more recently this position is defended for example by daniel dennett108 on the other hand there are also many incompatibilists who reject the argument because they believe that the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism106 these philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency109 b determined by indeterministic natural law only or c determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically nonreducible agency110 under libertarianism the will does not have to be deterministic and therefore it is potentially free critics of the second proposition b accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom they argue as follows if our will is not determined by anything then we desire what we desire by pure chance and if what we desire is purely accidental we are not free so if our will is not determined by anything we are not free106 selfedit main article self the philosophy of mind also has important consequences for the concept of self if by self or i one refers to an essential immutable nucleus of the person some modern philosophers of mind such as daniel dennett believe that no such thing exists according to dennett and other contemporaries the self is considered an illusion111 the idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives from the idea of an immaterial soul such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of self as postulated by david hume who could never catch himself not doing thinking or feeling anything112 however in the light of empirical results from developmental psychology developmental biology and neuroscience the idea of an essential inconstant material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections—seems reasonable113 see alsoedit animal consciousness artificial consciousness collective intentionality outline of human intelligence outline of thought theory of mind in animals
