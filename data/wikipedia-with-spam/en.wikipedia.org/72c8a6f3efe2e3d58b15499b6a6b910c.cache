eightythree days triggered by sailors and a fourday general strike in san francisco and led to the unionization of all of the west coast ports of the united states the san francisco general strike along with the 1934 toledo autolite strike led by the american workers party and the minneapolis teamsters strike of 1934 led by the communist league of america were important catalysts for the rise of industrial unionism in the 1930s much of which was organized through the congress of industrial organizations contents 1 background 2 the big strike 3 bloody thursday 4 funerals and general strike

company unions since the years immediately after world war i when the shipping companies and stevedoring firms had imposed the open shop after a series of failed strikes longshoremen in san francisco then the major port on the coast were required to go through a hiring hall operated by a company union known as the blue book system for the color of the membership book the industrial workers of the world had attempted to organize longshoremen sailors and fishermen in the 1920s through their maritime workers union their largest strike the 1923 san pedro maritime strike bottled up shipping in that harbor but was crushed by a combination of injunctions mass arrests and vigilantism by the american legion while the iww was a spent force after that strike syndicalist thinking remained popular on the docks longshoremen and sailors on the west coast also had contacts with an australian syndicalist movement that called itself the one big union formed after the defeat of a general strike there in 1917 the communist party had also been active in the area in the late 1920s seeking to organize all categories of maritime workers into a single union the maritime workers industrial union mwiu as part of the drive during the third period to create revolutionary unions the mwiu never made much headway on the west coast but it did attract a number of former iww members and foreignborn militants harry bridges an australianborn sailor who became a longshoreman after coming to the united states would be accused over and over for his acknowledged communist party membership 1 militants published a newspaper the waterfront worker which focused on longshoremens most pressing demands more men on each gang lighter loads and an independent union while a number of the individuals in this group were communist party members the group as a whole was independent of the party although it criticized the international seamens union isu as weak and the international longshoremens association ila which had its base on the east coast as corrupt it did not embrace the mwiu but called instead for creation of small knots of activists at each port to serve as the first step in a slow careful movement to unionize the industry events soon made the mwiu wholly irrelevant just as the passage of the national industrial recovery act had led to a spontaneous explosion in union membership among coal miners in 1933 thousands of longshoremen now joined the fledgling ila locals that reappeared on the west coast the mwiu faded away as party activists followed the mass of west coast longshoremen into the ila these newly emboldened workers first went after the blue book union refusing to pay dues to it and tearing up their membership books the militants who had published the waterfront worker now known as the albion hall group after their usual meeting place continued organizing dock committees that soon began launching slowdowns and other types of job actions in order to win better working conditions while the official leadership of the ila remained in the hands of conservatives sent to the west coast by president joseph ryan of the ila the albion hall group started in march 1934 to press demands for a coastwide contract a unionrun hiring hall and an industrywide waterfront federation when the conservative ila leadership negotiated a weak gentlemens agreement with the employers that had been brokered by the mediation board created by the administration of president franklin d roosevelt bridges led the membership in rejecting it the sticking point in the strike was recognition the union demanded a closed shop a coastwide contract and a union hiring hall the employers offered to arbitrate the dispute but insisted that the union agree to an open shop as a condition of any agreement to arbitrate the longshoremen rejected the proposal to arbitrate the big strikeedit an engraved billy club commemorates police activity in the battle of smith cove in seattle the strike began on may 9 1934 as longshoremen in every west coast port walked out sailors joined them several days later the employers recruited strikebreakers housing them on moored ships or in walled compounds and bringing them to and from work under police protection strikers attacked the stockade housing strikebreakers in san pedro on may 15 two strikers were shot and killed by the employers private guards similar battles broke out in san francisco and oakland california portland oregon2 and seattle washington strikers also succeeded in slowing down or stopping the movement of goods by rail out of the ports the roosevelt administration tried again to broker a deal to end the strike but the membership twice rejected the agreements their leadership brought to them the employers then decided to make a show of force to reopen the port in san francisco on tuesday july 3 fights broke out along the embarcadero in san francisco between police and strikers while a handful of trucks driven by young businessmen made it through the picket line some teamsters supported the strikers by refusing to handle hot cargo goods which had been unloaded by strikebreakers although the teamsters leadership was not as supportive by the end of may dave beck president of the seattle teamsters and mike casey president of those in san francisco thought the maritime strike had lasted too long they encouraged the strikers to take what they could get from the employers and threatened to use teamsters as strikebreakers if the ila didnt return to work3 bloody thursdayedit san francisco coroners records of death for howard sperry and nicolas bordoise after a quiet fourth of july the employers organization the industrial association tried to open the port even further on thursday july 5 as spectators watched from rincon hill the police shot tear gas canisters into the crowd then followed with a charge by mounted police picketers threw the canisters and rocks back at the police who charged again sending the picketers into retreat each side then refortified and took stock the events took a violent turn that afternoon as hostilities resumed outside of the ila strike kitchen eyewitness accounts differ on the exact events that transpired next according to some witnesses a group of strikers first surrounded a police car and attempted to tip it over prompting the police to fire shotguns in the air and then revolvers at the crowd other eyewitness accounts claim that police officers started shooting in the direction of the strikers provoking strikers to defend themselves policemen fired a shotgun into the crowd striking three men in intersection of steuart and mission streets one of the men howard sperry a striking longshoreman later died of his wounds another man charles olsen was also shot but later recovered from his wounds a third man nick bordoise a greek by birth originally named nick counderakis who was an out of work member of the cooks union volunteering at the ila strike kitchen—was shot but managed to make his way around the corner onto spear street where he was found several hours later like sperry he died at the hospital strikers immediately cordoned off the area where the two picketers had been shot laying flowers and wreaths around it police arrived to remove the flowers and drive off the picketers minutes later once the police left the strikers returned replaced the flowers and stood guard over the spot though sperry and bordoise had been shot several blocks apart this spot became synonymous with the memory of the two slain men and bloody thursday as strikers carried wounded picketers into the ila union hall police fired on the hall and lobbed tear gas canisters at nearby hotels at this point someone reportedly called the union hall to ask are you willing to arbitrate now under orders from california governor frank merriam the california national guard moved in that evening to patrol the waterfront similarly federal soldiers of the united states army stationed at the presidio were placed on alert the picketers pulled back unwilling to take on armed soldiers in an uneven fight and trucks and trains began moving without interference bridges asked the san francisco labor council to meet that saturday july 7 to authorize a general strike the alameda county central labor council in oakland considered the same action teamsters in both san francisco and oakland voted to strike over the objections of their leaders on sunday july 8 funerals and general strikeedit the following day several thousand strikers families and sympathizers took part in a funeral procession down market street stretching more than a mile and a half for nicholas bordois and howard sperry the two persons killed on bloody thursday the police were wholly absent from the scene the march made an enormous impact on san franciscans making a general strike which had formerly been the visionary dream of a small group of the most radical workers became a practical and realizable objective4 after dozens of bay area unions voted for a general strike over the next few days the san francisco labor council voted on july 14 to call a general strike the teamsters had already been out for two days by that point san francisco mayor angelo rossi declared a state of emergency some federal officials particularly secretary of labor frances perkins were more skeptical roosevelt later recalled that some persons were urging him to steer the uss houston which was carrying him to hawaii into san francisco bay all flags flying and guns doubleshotted and end the strike roosevelt rejected the suggestion the general strike began on the 16th involving some 150000 workers on the 17th the police arrested more than 300 radicals subversives and communists while systemically smashing furniture and equipment of organizations related to the strike the same day general hugh s johnson as head of the national recovery administration spoke at uc berkeley to denounce the general strike as a menace to the government5 the strike lasted four days nonunion truck drivers joined the first day the movie theaters and night clubs closed down while food deliveries continued with the permission of the strike committee many small businesses closed posting signs in support of the strikers reports that unions in portland and seattle would also begin general strikes picked up currency end of the strikeedit the calling of a general strike had an unexpected result it gave the general strike committee whose makeup was far less militant than the longshoremens strike committee effective control over the maritime strike itself when the labor council voted to terminate the general strike it also recommended that the unions accept arbitration of all disputed issues when the national longshore board put the employers proposal to arbitrate to a vote of striking longshoremen it passed in every port except everett washington that however left the striking seamen in the lurch the employers had refused to arbitrate with the isu unless it first won elections on the fleets on strike while bridges who had preached solidarity among all maritime workers and scorned arbitration apologized to the seamen for the longshoremens vote the president of the isu urged them to hold out and to burn their fink books the membership records of the company union to which they had been forced to pay dues on july 17 1934 the california national guard blocked both ends of jackson street from drumm to front with machine gun mounted trucks to assist vigilante raids protected by sfpd on the headquarters of the marine workers industrial union and the ila soup kitchen at 84 embarcadero moving on the workers exservicemens leagues headquarters on howard between third and fourth was raided leading to 150 arrests and the complete destruction of the facilities the employers group the industrial association had agents riding with the police further raids were carried out at the workers open forum at 1223 fillmore street and the western worker building opposite city hall that contained a bookstore and the main offices of the communist party which was thoroughly destroyed attacks were also perpetrated on the 121 haight street workers school and the mission workers neighborhood house at 741 valencia street a police spokesperson suggested that maybe the communists staged the raids themselves for publicity general hugh s johnson then head of the national recovery administration gave a speech urging responsible labor leaders to run these subversive influences out from its ranks like rats a lawyer for the american civil liberties union was kidnapped and beaten while vigilantes seized thirteen radicals in san jose and turned them over to the sheriff of an adjoining county who transported them to another county in hayward in alameda county someone erected a scaffold in front of the city hall with a noose and a sign stating reds beware in piedmont an upscale community surrounded by oakland on all sides the chief of police prepared for a reported attack by strikers on the homes of wealthy shipowners6 aftermathedit while some of the most powerful people in san francisco considered the strikes denouement to be a victory for the employers many longshoremen and seamen did not spontaneous strikes over grievances and workplace conditions broke out as strikers returned to their jobs with longshoremen and teamsters supporting their demands employers conceded many of these battles giving workers even more confidence in demanding that employers lighten unbearably heavy loads longshoremen also began dictating other terms fining members who worked more than the ceiling of 120 hours per month filing charges against a gang boss for slandering colored brothers and forcing employers to fire strikebreakers other unions went further the marine firemen proposed to punish any member who bought a hearst newspaper the arbitration award issued on october 12 1934 cemented the ilas power while the award put the operation of the hall in the hands of a committee of union and employer representatives the union was given the power to select the dispatcher since longshoremen were prepared to walk out if an employer didnt hire a worker dispatched from the hall the ila soon controlled hiring on the docks the employers complained that the union wanted to sovietize the waterfront workers complained that the employers were exploiting them for cheap labor and forcing them to work in unsafe conditions without reasonable safety measures the union soon utilized the quickie strike tactic to force many concessions from employers such as safer working conditions and better pay similarly even though an arbitrator held that the 1935 agreement prohibited sympathy strikes the unions members nonetheless refused to cross other unions picket lines longshoremen also refused to handle hot cargo destined for nonunion warehouses that the union was attempting to organize the isu acquired similar authority over hiring despite the philosophical objection of the unions own officers to hiring halls the isu used this power to drive strikebreakers out of the industry the rift between the seamens and longshoremens unions deepened and became more complex in the succeeding years as bridges continually fought with the sailors union of the pacific over labor and political issues the west coast district of the ila broke off from the international in 1937 to form the international longshoremens union later renamed the international longshoremens and warehousemens union after the unions march inland to organize warehouse workers then renamed the international longshore and warehouse union in recognition of the number of women members the arbitration award also gave longshoremen a raise to ninetyfive cents an hour for straight time work just shy of the dollar an hour it demanded during the strike it was also awarded a contract that applied up and down the west coast the strike also prompted union organizer carmen lucia to organize the department store workers union and the retail clerks association in san francisco7 legacyedit the ilwu continues to recognize bloody thursday by shutting down all west coast ports every july 5 and honoring nick bordoise howard sperry and all of the other workers killed by police during the strike the ilwu has frequently stopped work for political protests against among other things italys invasion of ethiopia fascist intervention in spains civil war south africas system of apartheid and
