jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory and shares its sovereignty with the united states federal government due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside3 state citizenship and residency are flexible and no government approval is required to move between states

official names states are divided into counties or countyequivalents which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign county or countyequivalent structure varies widely by state state governments are allocated power by the people of each respective state through their individual constitutions all are grounded in republican principles and each provides for a government consisting of three branches executive legislative and judicial4 states possess a number of powers and rights under the united states constitution states and their residents are represented in the united states congress a bicameral legislature consisting of the senate and the house of representatives each state is also entitled to select a number of electors equal to the total number of representatives and senators from that state to vote in the electoral college the body that directly elects the president of the united states additionally each state has the opportunity to ratify constitutional amendments and with the consent of congress two or more states may enter into interstate compacts with one another historically the tasks of local law enforcement public education public health regulating intrastate commerce and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well over time the constitution has been amended and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed the general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did there is a continuing debate over states rights which concerns the extent and nature of the states powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals the constitution grants to congress the authority to admit new states into the union since the establishment of the united states in 1776 the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50 alaska and hawaii are the most recent states admitted both in 1959 the constitution is silent on

district homeowner association associated state military base federal enclave unincorporated area ghost town v t e as sovereign entities each of the 50 states reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way within the broad parameters set by the us constitution deemed appropriate by its people as a result while the governments of the various states share many similar features they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance no two state governments are identical constitutions the government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart the constitution of alabama for example contains 310296 words – more than 40 times as many as the us constitution7 in practice each state has adopted a threebranch system of government modeled after the federal government and consisting of three branches although the threebranch structure is not required executive legislative and judicial78 executive in each state the chief executive is called the governor who serves as both head of state and head of government the governor may approve or veto bills passed by the state legislature as well as push for the passage of bills supported by the party of the governor in 43 states governors have line item veto power9 most states have a plural executive in which two or more members of the executive branch are elected directly by the people such additional elected officials serve as members of the executive branch but are not beholden to the governor and the governor cannot dismiss them for example the attorney general is elected rather than appointed in 43 of the 50 us states legislative the legislatures of 49 of the 50 states are made up of two chambers a lower house termed the house of representatives state assembly general assembly or house of delegates and a smaller upper house always termed the senate the exception is the unicameral nebraska legislature which is composed of only a single chamber most states have parttime legislatures while six of the most populated states have fulltime legislatures however several states with high population have short legislative sessions including texas and florida10 in baker v carr 1962 and reynolds v sims 1964 the us supreme court held that all states are required to elect their legislatures in such a way as to afford each citizen the same degree of representation the one person one vote standard in practice most states choose to elect legislators from singlemember districts each of which has approximately the same population some states such as maryland and vermont divide the state into single and multimember districts in which case multimember districts must have proportionately larger populations eg a district electing two representatives must have approximately twice the population of a district electing just one if the governor vetoes legislation all legislatures may override it usually but not always requiring a twothirds majority in 2013 there were a total of 7383 legislators in the 50 state legislative bodies they earned from 0 annually new mexico to 90526 california there were various per diem and mileage compensation11 judicial states can also organize their judicial systems differently from the federal judiciary as long as they protect the federal constitutional right of their citizens to procedural due process most have a trial level court generally called a district court superior court or circuit court a firstlevel appellate court generally called a court of appeal or appeals and a supreme court however oklahoma and texas have separate highest courts for criminal appeals in new york state the trial court is called the supreme court appeals are then taken to the supreme courts appellate division and from there to the court of appeals most states base their legal system on english common law with substantial indigenous changes and incorporation of certain civil law innovations with the notable exception of louisiana a former french colony which draws large parts of its legal system from french civil law only a few states choose to have the judges on the states courts serve for life terms in most of the states the judges including the justices of the highest court in the state are either elected or appointed for terms of a limited number of years and are usually eligible for reelection or reappointment states as unitary systems all states have unitary governments local governments are created under state law and ultimately local governments within each state are subject to the central authority of that particular state state governments commonly delegate some authority to local units and channel policy decisions down to them for implementation12 in a few states local units of government are permitted a degree of home rule over various matters the prevailing legal theory of state preeminence over local governments referred to as dillons rule holds that a municipal corporation possesses and can exercise the following powers and no others first those granted in express words second those necessarily implied or necessarily incident to the powers expressly granted third those absolutely essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporationnot simply convenient but indispensable fourth any fair doubt as to the existence of a power is resolved by the courts against the corporationagainst the existence of the powers13 each state defines for itself what powers it will allow local governments generally four categories of power may be given to local jurisdictions structural – power to choose the form of government charter and enact charter revisions functional – power to exercise local self government in a broad or limited manner fiscal – authority to determine revenue sources set tax rates borrow funds and other related financial activities personnel – authority to set employment rules remuneration rates employment conditions and collective bargaining14 relationships among states each state admitted to the union by congress since 1789 has entered it on an equal footing with the original states in all respects15 with the growth of states rights advocacy during the antebellum period the supreme court asserted in lessee of pollard v hagan 1845 that the constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality16 with the consent of congress states may enter into interstate compacts agreements between two or more states compacts are frequently used to manage a shared resource such as transportation infrastructure or water rights17 under article iv of the constitution which outlines the relationship between the states each state is required to give full faith and credit to the acts of each others legislatures and courts which is generally held to include the recognition of most contracts and criminal judgments and before 1865 slavery status under the extradition clause a state must extradite people located there who have fled charges of treason felony or other crimes in another state if the other state so demands the principle of hot pursuit of a presumed felon and arrest by the law officers of one state in another state are often permitted by a state18 the full faith and credit expectation does have exceptions some legal arrangements such as professional licensure and marriages may be statespecific and until recently states have not been found by the courts to be required to honor such arrangements from other states19 such legal acts are nevertheless often recognized statetostate according to the common practice of comity states are prohibited from discriminating against citizens of other states with respect to their basic rights under the privileges and immunities clause with the federal government further information federalism in the united states under article iv each state is guaranteed a form of government that is grounded in republican principles such as the consent of the governed20 this guarantee has long been at the forefront of the debate about the rights of citizens visàvis the government states are also guaranteed protection from invasion and upon the application of the state legislature or executive if the legislature cannot be convened from domestic violence this provision was discussed during the 1967 detroit riot but was not invoked under article i of the constitution which establishes the us congress each of the 50 states is represented in the senate irrespective of population size by two senators and each is guaranteed at least one representative based on population size in the house senators are elected by popular vote to staggered terms of six years there are presently 100 us senators representatives are elected from singlemember districts by popular vote to terms of two years not staggered the size of the house—presently 435 voting members—is set by federal statute seats in the house are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census21 citizens in each state plus those in the district of columbia indirectly elect the president and vice president when casting ballots in presidential elections they are voting for presidential electors who then using procedures provided in the 12th amendment elect the president and vice president there were 538 electors for the most recent presidential election in 201622 each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the total number of representatives and senators from that state the district of columbia is entitled to three electors23 while the constitution does set parameters for the election of federal officials state law not federal regulates most aspects of elections in the us including primaries the eligibility of voters beyond the basic constitutional definition the running of each states electoral college as well as the running of state and local elections all elections—federal state and local—are administered by the individual states and some voting rules and procedures may differ among states24 article v of the constitution accords states a key role in the process of amending the us constitution amendments may be proposed either by congress with a twothirds vote in both the house and the senate or by a convention of states called for by twothirds of the state legislatures25 to become part of the constitution an amendment must be ratified by either—as determined by congress—the legislatures of threequarters of the states or state ratifying conventions in threequarters of the states26 the vote in each state to either ratify or reject a proposed amendment carries equal weight regardless of a states population or length of time in the union since the early 20th century the supreme court has interpreted the commerce clause of the constitution of the united states to allow greatly expanded scope of federal power over time at the expense of powers formerly considered purely states matters the cambridge economic history of the united states says on the whole especially after the mid1880s the court construed the commerce clause in favor of increased federal power27 in wickard v filburn 317 us 111 1942 the court expanded federal power to regulate the economy by holding that federal authority under the commerce clause extends to activities which may appear to be local in nature but in reality effect the entire national economy and are therefore of national concern28 for example congress can regulate railway traffic across state lines but it may also regulate rail traffic solely within a state based on the reality that intrastate traffic still affects interstate commerce in recent years the court has tried to place limits on the commerce clause in such cases as united states v lopez and united states v morrisonclarification needed another example of congressional power is its spending power – the ability of congress to impose taxes and distribute the resulting revenue back to the states subject to conditions set by congress29 an example of this is the system of federal aid for highways which include the interstate highway system the system is mandated and largely funded by the federal government and also serves the interests of the states by threatening to withhold federal highway funds congress has been able to pressure state legislatures to pass a variety of lawscitation needed an example is the nationwide legal drinking age of 21 enacted by each state brought about by the national minimum drinking age act although some objected that this infringes on states rights the supreme court upheld the practice as a permissible use of the constitutions spending clause in south dakota v dole 483 us 203 1987 admission into the union main article admission to the union us states by date of statehood   1776–1790   1791–1796   1803–1819   1820–1837   1845–1859   1861–1876   1889–1896   1907–1912   1959 the order in which the original 13 states ratified the constitution then the order in which the others were admitted to the union click to see animation article iv also grants to congress the authority to admit new states into the union since the establishment of the united states in 1776 the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50 each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states16 it also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and congress this caveat was designed to give eastern states that still had western land claims including georgia north carolina and virginia to have a veto over whether their western counties could become states15 and has served this same function since whenever a proposal to partition an existing state or states in order that a region within might either join another state or to create a new state has come before congress most of the states admitted to the union after the original 13 were formed from an organized territory established and governed by congress in accord with its plenary power under article iv section 3 clause 230 the outline for this process was established by the northwest ordinance 1787 which predates the ratification of the constitution in some cases an entire territory has become a state in others some part of a territory has when the people of a territory make their desire for statehood known to the federal government congress may pass an enabling act authorizing the people of that territory to organize a constitutional convention to write a state constitution as a step towards admission to the union each act details the mechanism by which the territory will be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers although the use of an enabling act is a traditional historic practice a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted upon acceptance of that constitution and upon meeting any additional congressional stipulations congress has always admitted that territory as a state in addition to the original 13 six subsequent states were never an organized territory of the federal government or part of one before being admitted to the union three were set off from an already existing state two entered the union after having been sovereign states and one was established from unorganized territory california 1850 from land ceded to the united states by mexico in 1848 under the terms of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo313233 kentucky 1792 from virginia district of kentucky fayette jefferson and lincoln counties313234 maine 1820 from massachusetts district of maine313234 texas 1845 previously the republic of texas313235 vermont 1791 previously the vermont republic also known as the new hampshire grants and claimed by new york313236 west virginia 1863 from virginia transallegheny region counties during the civil war323437 congress is under no obligation to admit states even in those areas whose population expresses a desire for statehood such has been the case numerous times during the nations history in one instance mormon pioneers in salt lake city sought to establish the state of deseret in 1849 it existed for slightly over two years and was never approved by the united states congress in another leaders of the five civilized tribes cherokee chickasaw choctaw creek and seminole in indian territory proposed to establish the state of sequoyah in 1905 as a means to retain control of their lands38 the proposed constitution ultimately failed in the us congress instead the indian territory along with oklahoma territory were both incorporated into the new state of oklahoma in 1907 the first instance occurred while the nation still operated under the articles of confederation the state of franklin existed for several years not long after the end of the american revolution but was never recognized by the confederation congress which ultimately recognized north carolinas claim of sovereignty over the area the territory comprising franklin later became part of the southwest territory and ultimately the state of tennessee additionally the entry of several states into the union was delayed due to distinctive complicating factors among them michigan territory which petitioned congress for statehood in 1835 was not admitted to the union until 1837 due to a boundary dispute with the adjoining state of ohio the republic of texas requested annexation to the united states in 1837 but fears about potential conflict with mexico delayed the admission of texas for nine years39 also statehood for kansas territory was held up for several years 1854–61 due to a series of internal violent conflicts involving antislavery and proslavery factions further information historic regions of the united states and list of us state partition proposals possible new states puerto rico main articles political status of puerto rico and proposed political status for puerto rico puerto rico referred to itself as the commonwealth of puerto rico in the english version of its constitution and as estado libre asociado literally associated free state in the spanish version as with any nonstate territory of the united states its residents do not have voting representation in the federal government puerto rico has limited representation in congress in the form of a resident commissioner a delegate with limited voting rights in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union and no voting rights otherwise40 a nonbinding referendum on statehood independence or a new option for an associated territory different from the current status was held on november 6 2012 sixty one percent 61 of voters chose the statehood option while one third of the ballots were submitted blank4142 on december 11 2012 the legislative assembly of puerto rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the president and the congress of the united states to respond to the referendum of the people of puerto rico held on november 6 2012 to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit puerto rico as a state43 another status referendum was held on june 11 2017 in which 97 percent of voters chose statehood turnout was low as only 23 of voters went to the polls44 washington dc main article district of columbia statehood movement the intention of the founding fathers was that the united states capital should be at a neutral site not giving favor to any existing state as a result the district of columbia was created in 1800 to serve as the seat of government as it is not a state the district does not have representation in the senate and has a nonvoting delegate in the house neither does it have a sovereign elected government additionally prior to ratification of the 23rd amendment in 1961 district citizens did not get the right to vote in presidential elections some residents of the district support statehood of some form for that jurisdiction – either statehood for the whole district or for the inhabited part with the remainder remaining under federal jurisdiction in november 2016 washington dc residents voted in a statehood referendum in which 86 of voters supported statehood for washington dc45 for statehood to be achieved it must be approved by congress and signed by the president46 others other possible new states are guam and the us virgin islands both of which are unincorporated organized territories of the united states also either the northern mariana islands or american samoa an unorganized unincorporated territory could seek statehood further information 51st state secession from the union main article secession in the united states the constitution is silent on the issue of the secession of a state from the union however its predecessor document the articles of confederation stated that the united states shall be perpetual the question of whether or not individual states held the right to unilateral secession remained a difficult and divisive one until the american civil war in 1860 and 1861 eleven southern states seceded but following their defeat in the american civil war were brought back into the union during the reconstruction era the federal government never recognized the secession of any of the rebellious states547 following the civil war the united states supreme court in texas v white held that states did not have the right to secede and that any act of secession was legally void drawing on the preamble to the constitution which states that the constitution was intended to form a more perfect union and speaks of the people of the united states in effect as a single body politic as well as the language of the articles of confederation the supreme court maintained that states did not have a right to secede however the courts reference in the same decision to the possibility of such changes occurring through revolution or through consent of the states essentially means that this decision holds that no state has a right to unilaterally decide to leave the union547 commonwealths main article commonwealth us state four states – kentucky massachusetts pennsylvania and virginia – adopted constitutions early in their postcolonial existence identifying themselves as commonwealths rather than states these commonwealths are states but legally each is a commonwealth because the term is contained in its constitution48 as a result commonwealth is used in all public and other state writings actions or activities within their bounds the term which refers to a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people was first used in virginia during the interregnum the 1649–60 period between the reigns of charles i and charles ii during which parliaments oliver cromwell as lord protector established a republican government known as the commonwealth of england virginia became a royal colony again in 1660 and the word was dropped from the full title when virginia adopted its first constitution on june 29 1776 it was reintroduced49 pennsylvania followed suit when it drew up a constitution later that year as did massachusetts in 1780 and kentucky in 179248 the us territories of the northern marianas and puerto rico are also referred to as commonwealths this designation does have a legal status different from that of the 50 states both of these commonwealths are unincorporated territories of the united states origins of states names a map showing the source languages of state names further information list of state name etymologies of the united states the 50 states have taken their names from a wide variety of languages twentyfour state names originate from native american languages of these eight are from algonquian languages seven are from siouan languages three are from iroquoian languages one is from utoaztecan languages and five others are from other indigenous languages hawaiis name is derived from the polynesian hawaiian language of the remaining names 22 are from european languages seven from latin mainly latinized forms of english names the rest are from english spanish and french eleven states are named after individual people including seven named for royalty and one named after an american president the origins of six state names are unknown or disputed several of the states that derive their names from corrupted names used for native peoples have retained the plural ending of s geography borders the borders of the 13 original states were largely determined by colonial charters their western boundaries were subsequently modified as the states ceded their western land claims to the federal government during the 1780s and 1790s many state borders beyond those of the original 13 were set by congress as it created territories divided them and over time created states within them territorial and new state lines often followed various geographic features such as rivers or mountain range peaks and were influenced by settlement or transportation patterns at various times national borders with territories formerly controlled by other countries british north america new france new spain including spanish florida and russian america became institutionalized as the borders of us states in the west relatively arbitrary straight lines following latitude and longitude often prevail due to the sparseness of settlement west of the mississippi river once established most state borders have with few exceptions been generally stable only two states missouri platte purchase and nevada grew appreciably after statehood several of the original states ceded land over a several year period to the federal government which in turn became the northwest territory southwest territory and mississippi territory in 1791 maryland and virginia ceded land to create the district of columbia virginias portion was returned in 1847 in 1850 texas ceded a large swath of land to the federal government additionally massachusetts and virginia on two occasions have lost land in each instance to form a new state there have been numerous other minor adjustments to state boundaries over the years due to improved surveys resolution of ambiguous or disputed boundary definitions or minor mutually agreed boundary adjustments for administrative convenience or other purposes31 occasionally the united states congress or the united states supreme court have settled state border disputes one notable example is the case new jersey v new york in which new jersey won roughly 90 of ellis island from new york in 199850 regional grouping further information list of regions of the united states states may be grouped in regions there are endless variations and possible groupings many are defined in law or regulations by the federal government for example the united states census bureau defines four statistical regions with nine divisions51 the census bureau region definition is widely used … for data collection and analysis52 and is the most commonly used classification system535455 other
