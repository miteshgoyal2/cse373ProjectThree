print editions look weekday and sunday editions regularly feature front pages with content boxes on the upper part of the page detailing news inside the physical width of the paper has been reduced in recent years as well a trend throughout the newspaper industry criticism and controversiesedit political leaningsedit the plain dealer has been criticized by liberal columnists for staking out generally conservative positions on its editorial page despite serving a predominantly democratic readership base in 2004 the editorial board voted to endorse john kerry after publisher alex machaskee overruled it ordering the board to write an endorsement of george w bush editorial page editor brent larkin managed to talk machaskee into withholding an endorsement27 the news coverage is generally more neutral with national and international news often culled from wire services including the new york times the paper had also been accused of being too soft on sen george voinovich and in the 2004 election cycle for the us senate not providing fair coverage if any to voinovichs opponent state sen eric fingerhut a democrat28 publishing concealed weapons permit holder listsedit in 2005 the newspaper twice published lists of concealed weapon permit holders from the 5 counties around cleveland editor doug clifton defended the papers decision sparking a feud with a procarry lobbyist group state senator steve austria called it abuse of the media access privilege saying publishing these names would threaten the safety of the men and women who obtain these permits an ohio gun rights group then published cliftons home address and phone number29 held stories controversyedit wikinews has related news newspaper refuses to utilize leaked documents in article the plain dealer made national headlines in the summer of 2005 when editor douglas clifton announced that the newspaper was withholding two stories of profound importance after judith miller of the new york times and matthew cooper of time magazine were ordered to reveal confidential sources who had provided information on joseph wilsons wife being a cia operative the decision to compel the reporters to reveal sources was seen in the news media as a license to go after reporters and newspapers in the courtroom for not revealing confidential informants and a violation of the trust between reporter and said informants clifton was vilified in the news media as having no backbone and he himself even admitted that people could refer to him as chickenshit clifton told the national press that while he and the reporters involved in the story were willing to be jailed for not revealing sources the legal department of the plain dealer publishing company was worried that the newspaper itself would be sued and strongly opposed the printing of the stories talking isnt an option and jail is too high a price to pay clifton said30 the controversy ended when the cleveland scene an alternative weekly cleveland newspaper published a similar story thus allowing the plain dealer to print the withheld story the story turned out to be on former mayor michael r whites federal corruption probe which was leaked to the press by an attorney on the case the second withheld story has yet to be revealed31 music critic sidelinededit on september 17 2008 the plain dealers music critic of 16 years donald rosenberg was told by the papers editor susan goldberg that he would no longer be covering performances of the cleveland orchestra rosenberg had been critical of orchestral performances under its conductor franz welsermöst although his reviews of welsermöst as a conductor of operas had been positive terrance c z egger president and publisher of the paper is also on the orchestras board32 welsermöst is no stranger to robust criticism during his tenure at the london philharmonic orchestra london critics gave him the nickname frankly worse than most33 in december 2008 rosenberg sued clevelands musical arts association the newspaper and several members of their staffs alleging a conspiracy to have him demoted34 rosenberg dropped a number of claims against the paper in 200935 and in august 2009 a jury rejected the remaining claims36 shirley strickland saffoldedit in march 2010 the plain dealer reported that approximately 80 comments had been posted to articles on its web site by an account registered to the email address of shirley strickland saffold a judge sitting on the cuyahoga county court of common pleas37 several of the comments posted under the pseudonym lawmiss discussed matters that were or had been before the judge37 although the judges 23yearold daughter sydney saffold took responsibility for the postings the paper was able to use a public records request and determine that the exact times and dates of some of the postings corresponded to the times that the corresponding articles were being viewed on the judges courtissued computer37 the revelation led one attorney who had been criticized in the postings to request the judge recuse herself from a homicide trial in which he represented the defendant38 ohio supreme court acting chief justice paul e pfeifer subsequently removed saffold from the case39 in april the judge sued the paper its editor susan goldberg and affiliated companies for 50 million claiming violation of its privacy policy38 in december 2010 saffold dropped the suit against the newspaper and reached settlement with advance internet the plain dealer affiliate that ran the newspapers website40 the terms of the settlement were undisclosed but included a charitable contribution in the name of saffolds mother40 removal of debate videoedit in october 2014 the northeast ohio media group hosted the three ohio candidates for governor in what would be their only joint appearance the debate was held before the neomgs editorial board which also serves as the editorial board of the plain dealer and neomg reporters incumbent gov john kasich a republican showed up at the debate without a tie and largely ignored his main rival democrat ed fitzgerald kasich went so far as to refuse to admit he could hear the questions of fitzgerald who was sitting next to him and instead insisted that a reporter repeat them41 during the debate a video camera was positioned eight feet in front of the candidates the resulting video was posted on clevelandcom a few days later however it was removed42 when other sites posted copies of the nowdeleted video the neomg sent letters threatening legal action43 the neomgs actions drew coverage from other media organizations4445 and criticism from media observers particularly because chris quinn the neomg vice president who sent the letters declined all requests for comment4647 at 7 am on the day after the election which kasich—endorsed by the neomg—won easily the news organization posted online an explanation of events written by its reader representative the column cited this as quinns explanation shortly after the video was posted the kasich campaign contacted him and said it had not been aware a video would be posted online quinn eventually decided that his failure to explicitly explain the presence of a video camera was unfair further i thought that if i stated my reasons the obvious next step would be people going to the candidates and asking them if they had any objection to putting the video back up quinn is quoted as saying that would mean my error could put people into an uncomfortable situation48 the explanation left at least some critics unsatisfied4950 clevelandcomedit the plain dealer is the major news contributor to clevelandcom the regional news event and communication portal run by advance digital via northeast ohio media group the paper does not operate its own editorial website northeast ohio media group runs a separate website for the business side of the newspaper including advertising clevelandcom also features news from the sun newspapers which are a group of smaller weekly more suburbanoriented newspapers in the greater cleveland metro area also owned by advance publications the sun newspapers are the largest chain of paid weekly newspapers in the country the quality of the site as well as other advance internet sites has been criticized by the staff newsroom staff and locals51 the website was recently redesigned as a result52 politifact ohioedit in july 2010 the plain dealer launched politifact ohio a website that analyzes issues relevant to ohio and the greater cleveland area the feature was produced in conjunction with its creator the tampa bay times four years later the relationship was ended although the operation had generated criticism the decision to drop it was attributed instead to a desire to keep all content on clevelandcom rather than the separate politifact ohio site which remains available as an archive53 referencesedit the plain dealer northeast ohio media group top 25 us
