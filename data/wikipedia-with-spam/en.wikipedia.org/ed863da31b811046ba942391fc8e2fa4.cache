born in 1899 in egersund norway1 he emigrated to the united states where he married lorraine who was of scotsirish and english descent2 their only daughter anna lillian iversen was born in march 19262 later she was called – or her name was changed to – ann2 at the age of 19 she gave birth to priscilla2 priscillas biological father was us navy pilot james wagner2 his parents were kathryn and harold wagner2 on august 10 1944 at the age of 23 he married priscillas mother they had been dating for more than three years2 he was killed in a plane crash while returning home on leave when priscilla was six months old23 when priscilla discovered this family secret4 while rummaging through an old wooden box of family keepsakes she was encouraged by her mother to keep it from the other children as she feared it would endanger our family closeness3 in 1948 her mother met a united states air force officer named paul beaulieu from quebec canada the couple were married within a year beaulieu took over the raising of priscilla and was the only father she would ever know she took his surname5 and over the next few years she grew up quickly helping to care for the growing family as her stepfathers air force career moved them from connecticut to new mexico to maine in her own words she described herself during this period as a shy pretty little girl unhappily accustomed to moving from base to base every two or three years6 priscilla later recalled that she felt uncomfortable moving so often because she never knew if she could make friends for life or even if she would fit in with the new people she met on each move6 in 1956 the beaulieus moved to and settled in del valle outside of austin texas but soon her stepfather was transferred to wiesbaden germany7 priscilla was crushed by this news and after finishing junior high her fears of leaving her friends behind and making new ones were once again at the forefront of her mind7 life in germanyedit initially the beaulieus stayed at the helene hotel when they arrived in germany but after three months living there became too expensive and they looked for a place to rent8 the family settled in a large apartment in a vintage building constructed long before world war i soon after moving in the beaulieus realized that it was a brothel but due to scarce housing they were forced to remain there8 life with elvis presleyedit germanyedit priscilla first met elvis presley when he was in the army stationed in germany elvis presley first met priscilla on september 13 19599 during a party at elvis home in bad nauheim germany while he was serving in the army10 despite her being 14 years old she made a huge impression on elvis with her much older appearance11 elvis allegedly regressed to acting like an awkward embarrassed boynextdoor figure in front of her11 however by the end of the evening he had managed to compose himself11 despite priscillas parents being angered by her late return home during that first meeting and insisting that she would never meet elvis again12 his eagerness for another meeting and his promise never to bring her home late again12 led them to relent they were frequently together until elvis left west germany in march 1960 after elvis departure priscilla was inundated with requests for interviews from media outlets around the world13 she received fan mail from elvis fans some nice and some not so nice as well as mail from lonesome gis13 convinced she would never see elvis again and with rumors of his ongoing relationship with nancy sinatra flying around the gossip magazines priscilla believed the romance was over13 move to gracelandedit graceland after elviss return to america the couple stayed in contact over the phone though they would not see each other again until the summer of 1962 when priscillas parents agreed to let her visit for two weeks1014 priscillas parents allowed her to go only if elvis would pay for a firstclass round trip arrange for her to be chaperoned at all times and that she write home every day13 elvis agreed to all these demands and priscilla flew to los angeles elvis told her that they were going to las vegas and to throw her parents off the scent he had priscilla write a postcard for every day they would be gone so that they could be mailed from los angeles by a member of his staff15 it was during this visit while on a trip to las vegas that priscilla first took amphetamines and sleeping pills to keep up with elviss lifestyle16 after another visit at christmas priscillas parents finally let her move to graceland for good in march 19631017 part of the agreement was that she would attend an allgirls catholic school the immaculate conception high school in memphis tennessee and live with elviss father and his stepmother in a separate house adjacent to the graceland estate until she graduated from high school in june 1963 part of the agreement also was that they would eventually marry17 after a few weeks however she was moved into graceland to be with elvis although her parents did eventually agree to her living there if elvis promised to marry her10 priscilla later said the move was natural i was there all the time anyway18 priscilla was always keen to go to hollywood with elvis but he kept telling her that he was too busy for that and she was made to stay in memphis15 during the filming of viva las vegas elvis began an affair with his costar annmargret when priscilla read of these reports in the press she confronted elvis he told her that they were simply rumors to promote the film and that she should not believe everything that she read in the press15 for the next few years elvis would have intimate relationships with many of his leading ladies and costars all the while denying their existence to priscilla eventually she was allowed to visit him in hollywood but her visits were kept short15 marriage and pregnancyedit elvis presley and priscilla with newborn lisa marie february 1968 shortly before christmas 1966 elvis proposed to priscilla accounts suggest that priscilla threatened to take her story to the press if elvis refused to marry her and that her father threatened to have elvis charged under the mann act taking a minor across state lines for sexual purposes19 colonel parker elvis manager also attempted to encourage him to marry by reminding him about his rca morals clause within his record contract19 priscilla suggested in a 1973 interview with ladies home journal that she and elvis were quite happy to just live together but at that time it wasnt nice for people to just live together20 accounts by elvis cook alberta claim that he was so upset about the wedding that she caught him crying about it one day when she asked why he didnt just cancel the wedding if it upset him so much he replied i dont have a choice19 marty lacker a close friend to elvis has also spoken about elvis reluctance to marry19 while others such as joe esposito have asserted that elvis was excited to marry priscilla19 in her 1985 autobiography elvis and me priscilla describes presley as a very passionate man who was not overtly sexual towards her according to her account21 the singer told her that they had to wait until they were married before having intercourse he said im not saying we cant do other things its just the actual encounter i want to save it priscilla says in her autobiography that she was a virgin and she and elvis did not have sex until their wedding night however this claim is questioned by biographer suzanne finstad22 the couple married on may 1 1967 at the aladdin hotel in las vegas the wedding arranged by parker to maximize publicity featured very few guests and was over in only eight minutes19 it was followed by a quick press conference and a 10000 breakfast reception attended by friends family and business associates from mgm rca and the william morris agency19 the wedding caused rifts between elvis and several of his closest friends who were not invited to the actual wedding ceremony23 red west especially was furious about the situation he and his wife had been personally invited by elvis to las vegas for the wedding had dressed for the occasion and at the last minute were told that they would not be present23 for red who had been with elvis since the beginning of his rise to fame and had given elvis the role of best man at his own wedding this was enough of an insult that he decided to quit his job working for elvis23 many other friends of elvis were also disappointed and held resentment towards him for many years to follow although they mainly blamed parker for their exclusion rather than elvis himself23 following the reception elvis and priscilla boarded a private jet and enjoyed a short honeymoon in palm springs19 on may 4 they flew back to memphis and retreated to their private ranch just over the mississippi state line for a threeweek break23 many of elvis inner circle joined them although for the most part the couple were left alone and were able to enjoy each others company without the intrusion of the memphis mafia23 priscilla reveled in her chance to be a proper wife cooking cleaning and washing for her husband i loved playing house she later remarked adding here was an opportunity to take care of him myself no maids or housekeepers to pamper us23 in an attempt to heal rifts elvis and priscilla held another reception at graceland on may 29 for the friends and family who were unable to attend the original ceremonies23 soon after priscilla found out that she was pregnant she was upset at such an early pregnancy certain that it would destroy the closeness she had finally found with elvis24 she had asked him earlier if she could take birth control pills but elvis had insisted they werent perfected yet24 she considered abortion and even discussed it with elvis at one point but both decided they could not live with themselves if they had gone through with it24 their only child lisa marie was born exactly nine months after their wedding on february 1 1968 priscilla wrote in 1985 autobiography elvis and me that around the time elvis was filming live a little love a little 1968 she began taking private dance lessons she found herself deeply attracted to the instructor known simply as mark in the book and she confesses to having a short affair25 she implies regret however saying i came out of it realizing i needed much more out of my relationship with elvis25 despite priscillas affair and elvis onandoff relationships with his costars and leading ladies the first few years they were married seemed a happy time for the couple however when elvis career took off again after his 1968 television special he was constantly touring and playing in las vegas elvis had also been seeing other women on and off often leaving priscilla at home with lisa marie due to elvis being away so often the marriage soured separation and divorceedit elvis was a keen karate student and persuaded priscilla to take it up priscilla thought it was a good idea as it would pass the time she spent alone if she had a hobby on which to concentrate and she was also keen to share in elvis interests26 following suggestions from elvis priscilla began taking lessons from mike stone a karate instructor she had met in 1972 backstage at one of elvis concerts27 she soon began an affair with him28 priscilla states in her book my relationship with mike had now developed into an affair i still loved elvis greatly but over the next few months i knew i would have to make a crucial decision regarding my destiny28 she later states elvis must have perceived my new restlessness29 a couple of months later she said that elvis had requested to see her in his hotel suite it was then that she writes in her book that elvis forcefully made love to meas he said this is how a real man makes love to his woman30 she later stated in an interview that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident and said it had been an overstatement she went on to say following the incident what really hurt was that he was not sensitive to me as a woman and his attempt at reconciliation had come too late suggesting that his actions were a deliberate attempt at reconciliation or compensation for his lack of sexual interest in priscilla which had been a source of hurt and discontent for her for years priscilla states in her book he had mentioned to me before we were married that he had never been able to make love to a woman who had a child31 and she later expressed the personal repercussions of their sexual dysfunction i am beginning to doubt my own sexuality as a woman my physical and emotional needs were unfulfilled31 after this incident priscilla summarized this was not the gentle understanding man i grew to love32 elvis and priscilla separated on february 23 1972 and filed for legal separation on july 2633 to avoid priscillas having to make her home address available on the public records and therefore risking the security of both her and lisa marie34 elvis filed for divorce on january 8 197335 later that month elvis reportedly became paranoid about stone and said theres too much pain in me stone must die his outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him even with large doses of medication after another two days of raging elvis friend and bodyguard red west made enquiries to arrange a contract killing of stone but was relieved when elvis said aw hell lets just leave it for now maybe its a bit heavy3637 the divorce was finalized on october 9 197338 the couple agreed to share custody of their daughter and priscilla was awarded an outright cash payment of 725000 as well as spousal support child support 5 of elvis new publishing companies and half the income from the sale of their beverly hills home38 originally the couple had agreed upon a much smaller settlement a 100000 lump payment 1000 a month spousal support and 500 a month child support39 priscilla was keen to make it on her own and prove that her marriage to elvis was not about money39 however soon afterwards her new lawyers had persuaded her to up her demands pointing out that a star of elvis stature could easily afford more for his former wife and child40 priscilla and elvis remained close leaving the courthouse on the day of their divorce hand in hand40 businessedit main article elvis presley enterprises designation of graceland mansion as a national historic landmark in 2006 in 1973 after her split from elvis
