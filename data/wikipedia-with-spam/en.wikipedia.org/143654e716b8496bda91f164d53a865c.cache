paying careful attention to his dreams and the unconscious images they suggested francis works of the early 1970s have been referred to as fresh air pictures created by adding pools drips and splatters of color to wet bands of paint applied with a roller these works reasserted the artists interest in color by 1973–4 many of francis paintings featured a formal grid or matrix made up of crossing tracks of color many of these matrix works were large in scale measuring up to twenty feet long after 1980 the formal structure of the grid gradually disappeared from francis work he was
