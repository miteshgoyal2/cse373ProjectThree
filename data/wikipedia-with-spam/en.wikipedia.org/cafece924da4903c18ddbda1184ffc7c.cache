states and have a long history of collective social advocacy for their political and social rights and preserving their cultural heritage in new york city which has the largest concentration of puerto ricans in the united states they began running for elective office in the 1920s electing one of their own to the new york state assembly for the first time in 193712 important puerto rican institutions have emerged from this long history13 aspira was established in new york city in 1961 and is now one of the largest national latino nonprofit organizations in the united states14 there is

department of labor established an employment service in new york city16 the migration division known as the commonwealth office also part of puerto rico’s department of labor was created in 1948 and by the end of the 1950s was operating in 115 cities and towns stateside17 the strength of stateside puerto rican identity is fueled by a number of factors these include the large circular migration between the island and the united states a long tradition of the government of puerto rico promoting its ties to those stateside the continuing existence of racialethnic prejudice and discrimination in the united states and high residential and school segregation181920 notable attributes that set the stateside puerto rican population apart from the rest of the us hispanic community is facts such as puerto ricans have the highest military enrollment rates compared to other hispanics puerto ricans are more likely to be proficient in english than any other hispanic group and puerto ricans are also more likely to intermarry other ethnic groups and far more likely to intermarry or intermingle specifically with blacks than any other hispanic group212223242526272829 migration historyedit since 1898 puerto rico has been under the control of the united states fueling migratory patterns between the mainland and the island even during spanish rule puerto ricans settled in the us however it was not until the end of the spanish–american war in 1898 that a significant influx of puerto rican workers to the us began with its 1898 victory the united states acquired puerto rico from spain and has retained sovereignty since the 1917 jones–shafroth act made all puerto ricans us citizens freeing them from immigration barriers the massive migration of puerto ricans to the mainland united states was largest in the early and late 20th century30 prior to its resurgence in the early 21st century us political and economic interventions in puerto rico created the conditions for emigration by concentrating wealth in the hands of us corporations and displacing workers31 policymakers promoted colonization plans and contract labor programs to reduce the population us employers often with government support recruited puerto ricans as a source of lowwage labor to the united states and other destinations 32 puerto ricans migrated in search of higherwage jobs first to new york city and later to other cities such as chicago philadelphia and boston33 however in more recent years there has been a significant resurgence in migration from puerto rico to new york and new jersey with an apparently multifactorial allure to puerto ricans primarily for economic and cultural considerations3435 with the puerto rican population of the new york city metropolitan area increasing from 1177430 in 2010 to a censusestimated 1494670 in 201636 maintaining its status as the largest metropolitan concentration and cultural center for puerto rican americans by a significant margin on the us mainland the absolute increase in the size of the puerto rican population of the new york metropolitan area between 2010 and 2016 roughly approximates the total puerto rican population of the orlando metropolitan area which enumerated over 320000 in 2013 the puerto rican populations of the orlando and philadelphia metropolitan areas approximate each other in following a distant second and third only to the new york metropolitan area in size new york city neighborhoods such as east harlem in upper manhattan the south bronx and bushwick in brooklyn are often the most associated with the stateside puerto rican population however several neighborhoods in eastern north philadelphia especially fairhill have some of the highest concentrations of puerto ricans in the united states fairhill having the highest when being compared to other big city neighborhoods37 new york cityedit main articles puerto rican migration to new york city and nuyorican national puerto rican parade in new york city 2005 between the 1950s and the 1980s large numbers of puerto ricans migrated to new york especially to brooklyn the bronx and the spanish harlem and loisaida neighborhoods of manhattan labor recruitment was the basis of this particular community in 1960 the number of stateside puerto ricans living in new york city as a whole was 88 with most 69 living in east harlem38 they helped others settle find work and build communities by relying on social networks containing friends and family for a long time spanish harlem east harlem and loisaida lower east side were the two major puerto rican communities in the city but during the 1960s and 1970s predominately puerto rican neighborhoods started to spring up in the bronx because of its proximity to east harlem and in brooklyn because of its proximity to the lower east side there are significant puerto rican communities in all five boroughs philippe bourgois an anthropologist who has studied puerto ricans in the inner city suggests that the puerto rican community has fallen victim to poverty through social marginalization due to the transformation of new york into a global city39 the puerto rican population in east harlem and new york city as a whole remains the poorest among all migrant groups in us cities as of 1973 about 462 of the puerto rican migrants in east harlem were living below the federal poverty line40 however more affluent puerto rican american professionals have migrated to suburban neighborhoods in long island westchester county new jersey and connecticut the struggle for legal work and affordable housing remains fairly low and the implementation of favorable public policy fairly inconsistent new york citys puerto rican community contributed to the creation of hip hop music and to many forms of latin music including boogaloo salsa latin house and freestyle puerto ricans in new york created their own cultural movement and cultural institutions such as the nuyorican poets cafe new york city also became the mecca for freestyle music in the 1980s of which puerto rican singersongwriters represented an integral component41 puerto rican influence in popular music continues in the 21st century

has had a long history with the stateside puerto rican community60 more recent demographic developments appear at first blush as if the stateside puerto rican population has been dispersing in greater numbers duany had described this process as a “reconfiguration” and termed it the “nationalizing” of this community throughout the united states61 new york city was the center of the stateside puerto rican community for most of the 20th century however it is not clear whether these settlement changes can be characterized as simple population dispersal puerto rican population settlements today are less concentrated than they were in places like new york city chicago and a number of cities in massachusetts connecticut and new jersey migration trends since 2000edit aubrey plaza new york state has resumed its net inmigration of puerto rican americans since 2006 a dramatic reversal from being the only state to register a decrease in its puerto rican population between 1990 and 2000 the puerto rican population of new york state still the largest in the united states is estimated by the us census bureau to have increased from 1070558 in 2010 to 1103067 in 2013 bruno mars puerto rican migration trends since 2006 have been highly complex new york state gained more puerto rican migrants from puerto rico 31 of the mainland total as well as from elsewhere on the mainland 20 of interstate moves between 2006 and 2012 than any other us state in absolute numbers even while the southern united states gained the highest number as an overall national region59 also unlike the initial pattern of migration several decades ago this second significant puerto rican migration into new york and surrounding states is being driven by movement not only into new york city proper but also into the citys surrounding suburban areas including areas outside new york state especially northern new jersey such that the new york city metropolitan area gained the highest number of additional puerto rican americans of any metropolitan area between 2010 and 2016 from 1177430 in 2010 to 1494670 in 201636 florida witnessed an even larger increase than new york state between 2010 and 2013 from 847550 in 2010 to 987663 in 201362 with significant migration from puerto rico as well as some migration from chicago and new york to florida59 however most of the puerto rican migration to florida has been to the central portion of the state surrounding orlando orlando and to a lesser degree philadelphia and tampa have witnessed large increases in their puerto rican populations between 2010 and 2013 and now have some of the fastest growing puerto rican populations in the country according to the pew research center puerto rican arrivals from the island since 2000 are also less well off than earlier migrants with lower household incomes and a greater likelihood of living in poverty59 after hurricane maria struck puerto rico in september 2017 devastating the infrastructure of the island new york florida and new jersey were expected to be the three likeliest destinations for puerto rican migrants to the us mainland when premised upon family ties63 concentrationedit residential segregation is a phenomenon characterizing many stateside puerto rican population concentrations while blacks are the most residentially segregated group in the united states a 2002 study shows that stateside puerto ricans are the most segregated among us latinos64 bridgeport connecticut score of 73 hartford connecticut 70 new york city 69 philadelphia pennsylvania

along the east coast the us northeast corridor coined a megalopolis by geographer jean gottman in 1956 is the largest and most affluent urban corridor in the world being described as a node of wealth an area where the pulse of the national economy beats loudest and the seats of power are well established65 with major world class universities clustered in boston and stretching throughout this corridor the economic and media power and international power politics in new york city and the seat of the federal government in washington dc also a major global power center segmentationedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it august 2015 these shifts in the relative sizes of latino populations have also changed the role of the stateside puerto rican community66 thus many

origin were identified as white the opposite of the onedrop rule in the united states69747576 cultureedit main article culture of puerto rico puerto rican culture is a blend of spanish taíno and west african cultures with recent influences from the united states and neighboring latin american and caribbean countries due to puerto ricos status as a us territory people in puerto rico have the most exposure to us culture and puerto ricans in the mainland united states tend to be the most americanized of all major hispanic groups though 1stgeneration puerto ricoborn migrants tend to be more traditional while people born in the us mainland of puerto rican ancestry tend to merge traditional puerto rican culture with mainland american culture languageedit see also puerto rican spanish the

york english with puerto rican spanish influences while many puerto ricans living in other us cities speak with a similar english accent more americanized puerto ricans speak the local english accent with little to no spanish traces sounding similar to other local groups including black americans or assimilated italian americans religionedit the vast majority of puerto ricans in the united states are adherents of christianity though catholics are the largest in number there are also significant numbers of followers of numerous protestant denominations protestants make up a larger proportion of the stateside puerto rican population then they do of the population of puerto rico many puerto rican catholics also cohesively practice santería a yorubacatholic syncretic mix smaller portions of the population are nonreligious a very small number of assimilated stateside puerto ricans practice other religions particularly in the inner city neighborhoods of philadelphia and new york intermarriageedit puerto ricans have a 385 intermarriage rate the highest amongst latino groups in the united states78 contributionsedit see also list of stateside puerto ricans numerous puerto ricans born and raised in the united states made notable contributions in government science military television music sports art law enforcement modeling education journalism religion science among other areas conversely cultural ties between new york and puerto rico are strong in september 2017 following the immense destruction wrought upon puerto rico by hurricane maria new york governor andrew cuomo led an aid delegation to san juan 79 including engineers form the new york power authority to help restore puerto ricos electrical grid80 socioeconomicsedit incomeedit the stateside puerto rican community has usually been characterized as being largely poor and part of the urban underclass in the united states studies and reports over the last fifty years or so have documented the high poverty status of this community81 however the picture at the start of the 21st century also reveals significant socioeconomic progress and a community with a growing economic clout82 middleclass neighborhoods predominately populated by puerto ricans are mostly found throughout central florida including orlando tampa and their suburbs83 though significant numbers of middleclass puerto ricans can also be found in the philadelphia metropolitan area in upper north philadelphia particularly around the olneyjuniatalawncrest area and in camden county new jersey outside the city of camden and in the new york city metropolitan area particularly in the eastern portion of the bronx and westchester county as well as scattered throughout the united states in both traditional puerto rican settlements in the northeast and midwest as well as in progressive sunbelt cities of the south and west84 the latino market and remittances to puerto ricoedit the combined income for stateside puerto ricans is a significant share of the large and growing latino market in the united states and has been attracting increased attention from the media and the corporate sector in the last decade or so major corporations have discovered the socalled urban markets of blacks and latinos that had been neglected for so long this has spawned a cottage industry of marketing firms consultants and publications that specialize in the latino market one important question this raises is the degree to which stateside puerto ricans contribute economically to puerto rico the puerto rico planning board estimated that remittances totaled 66 million in 196385 the full extent of the stateside puerto rican community’s contributions to the economy of puerto rico is not known but it is clearly significant the role of remittances and investments by latino immigrants to their home countries has reached a level that it has received much attention in the last few years as countries like mexico develop strategies to better leverage these large sums of money from their diasporas in their economic development planning86 the income disparity between the stateside community and those living on the island is not as great as those of other latinamerican countries and the direct connection between secondgeneration puerto ricans and their relatives is not as conducive to direct monetary support many puerto ricans still living in puerto rico also remit to family members who are living stateside genderedit the average income in 2002 of stateside puerto rican men was 36572 while women earned an average 30613 837 percent that of the men compared to all latino groups whites and asians stateside puerto rican women came closer to achieving parity in income to the men of their own racialethnic group in addition stateside puerto rican women had incomes that were 823 percent that of white women while stateside puerto rican men had incomes that were only 640 percent that of white men stateside puerto rican women were closer to income parity with white women than were women who were dominicans 587 percent central and south americans 684 percent but they were below cubans 862 percent other hispanics 872 percent blacks 837 percent and asians 1077 percent stateside puerto rican men were in a weaker position in comparison with men from other racialethnic groups they were closer to income parity to white men than men who were dominicans 623 percent and central and south americans 583 percent although very close to income parity with blacks 655 percent stateside puerto rican men fell below mexicans 683 percent cubans 759 percent other hispanics 751 percent and asians 1007 percent educational attainmentedit stateside puerto ricans along with other us latinos have experienced the longterm problem of a high school dropout rate that has resulted in relatively low educational attainment13 according to the pew hispanic center while in puerto rico more than 20 of hispanics have a bachelors degree only 16 of stateside puerto ricans did as of march 20129 social issuesedit according to us census figures the puerto rican population has one of the highest poverty rates among all ethnic groups in the united states87 the puerto rican community is also one of the most segregated ethnic groups in the country88899091 the stateside puerto rican community has partnered with the african american community particularly in cities such as new york and philadelphia not only because of cultural similarities but also to combat racism and disenfranchisement of the mid to late 20th century in their communities as a unified force929394 though often perceived as largely poor there is evidence of growing economic clout as stated earlier8295 political participationedit puerto rican democratic members of the united states congress luis gutiérrez left josé enrique serrano center and nydia velázquez speaking at the encuentro boricua conference at hostos community college in new york city 2004 the puerto rican community has organized itself to represent its interests in stateside political institutions for close to a century96 in new york city puerto ricans first began running for public office in the 1920s in 1937 they elected their first government representative oscar garcia rivera to the new york state assembly97 in massachusetts puerto rican nelson merced became the first hispanic elected to the massachusetts house of representatives and the first hispanic to hold statewide office in the commonwealth98 there are four puerto rican members of the united states house of representatives democrats luis gutierrez of illinois josé enrique serrano of new york and nydia velázquez of new york and republican raúl labrador of idaho complementing the one resident commissioner elected to that body from puerto rico puerto ricans have also been elected as mayors in three major cities miami hartford and camden luis a quintana born in añasco puerto rico was sworn in as the first latino mayor of newark new jersey in november 2013 assuming the unexpired term of cory booker who vacated the position to become a us senator from new jersey99 there are various ways in which stateside puerto ricans have exercised their influence these include protests campaign contributions and lobbying and voting compared to the united states voter participation by puerto ricans in puerto rico is very largecitation needed however many see a paradox in that this high level of voting is not echoed stateside100 there puerto ricans have had persistently low voter registration and turnout rates despite the relative success they have had in electing their own to significant public offices throughout the united states to address this problem the government of puerto rico has since the late 1980s launched two major voter registration campaigns to increase the level of voter participation of stateside puerto rican while puerto ricans have traditionally been concentrated in the northeast coordinated latino voter registration organizations such as the southwest voter registration education project and the united states hispanic leadership institute based in the midwest have not concentrated in this region and have focused on the mexicanamerican voter the government of puerto rico has sought to fill this vacuum to insure that stateside puerto rican interests are well represented in the electoral process recognizing that the increased political influence of stateside puerto ricans also benefits the island this low level of electoral participation is in sharp contrast with voting levels in puerto rico which are much higher than that not only of this community but also the united states as a whole101 the reasons for the differences in puerto rican voter participation have been an object of much discussion but relatively little scholarly research102 voter statisticsedit breakdown of latinos by voting registration stage in 2000 cvap stands for citizen voting age population citizens 18 years of age and older when the relationship of various factors to the turnout rates of stateside puerto ricans in 2000 is examined socioeconomic status emerges as a clear factor103 for example according to the census income the turnout rate for those with incomes less than 10000 was 377 percent while for those earning 75000 and above it was 767 percent employment 365 percent of the unemployed voted versus 512 percent for the employed the rate for those outside of the labor force was 506 percent probably reflecting the disproportionate role of the elderly who generally have higher turnout rates union membership for union members it was 513 percent while for nonunion members it was 426 percent housing for homeowners it was 640 percent while it was 418 percent for renters there were a number of other sociodemographic characteristics where turnout differences also existed such as age the average age of voters was 453 years compared to 385 years for eligible nonvoters education those without a high school diploma had a turnout rate of 425 percent while for those with a graduate degree it was 810 percent birthplace for those born stateside it was 489 percent compared to 520 percent for those born in puerto rico marriage status for those who were married it was 620 percent while those who were never married managed 330 percent military service for those who ever served in the us military the turnout rate was 721 percent compared to 486 percent for those who never served notable peopleedit for a more comprehensive list see
