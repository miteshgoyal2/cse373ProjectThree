rights activist martin luther king jr and the racial desegregation of public school systems by the us federal government liberty christian academy lca founded as lynchburg christian academy is a christian school in lynchburg which was described in 1966 by the lynchburg news as a private school for white students the lynchburg christian academy later opened in 1967 by falwell as a segregation academy and as a ministry of thomas road baptist church111213 the liberty christian academy is today recognized as an educational facility by the commonwealth of virginia through the virginia state board of education14 southern association of colleges and schools15 and the association of christian schools international16 liberty universityedit main article liberty university in 1971 jerry falwell founded liberty university liberty university offers over 350 accredited programs of study17 with approximately 13000 residential students and 90000 online18 moral majorityedit main article moral majority by 1974 the internal revenue service moved to revoke the taxexempt status of bob jones university which forbade interracial dating blacks had been denied entry until 1971 the decisions infuriated falwell in some states its easier to open a massage parlor than to open a christian school falwell complained19 what brought falwell and other white evangelicals into common cause with political conservatives was a ruling issued in 1978 by the irs this ruling stripped taxexempt status from allwhite private schools formed in the south in reaction to the brown v board of education mandate to desegregate public schools falwell had founded one of these schools in lynchburg though he and other white evangelicals insisted that their schools were christian academies not segregation academies in one fell swoop writes political scientist corey robin the heirs of slaveholders became the descendants of persecuted baptists and jim crow a heresy the first amendment was meant to protect in this controversy the religious right found its voice and its power it also found common cause with political conservatives20 the heritage foundation cofounder paul weyrich stated that falwell launched the moral majority political action committee during 1979 to aid the catholic public protest against legal abortion in the united states in response to us president jimmy carters intervention against christian schools the irs intervention began during the ford administration by trying to deny them taxexempt status on the basis of socalled de facto segregation21 the moral majority became one of the largest political lobby groups for evangelical christians in the united states during the 1980s22 the moral majority was promoted as being prolife protraditional family promoral and proamerican23 and was credited with delivering two thirds of the white evangelical christian vote to ronald reagan during the 1980 presidential election2425 according to jimmy carter that autumn 1980 a group headed by jerry falwell purchased 10 million in commercials on southern radio and tv to brand me as a traitor to the south and no longer a christian26 during his time as head of the moral majority falwell consistently pushed for republican candidates and for conservative politics this led billy graham to criticize him for sermonizing about political issues that lacked a moral element before adding we did not always agree on everything but i knew him to be a man of god his accomplishments went beyond most clergy of his generation22 social and political viewsedit familiesedit falwell strongly advocated beliefs and practices he believed were taught by the bible27 the church falwell asserted was the cornerstone of a successful family not only was it a place for spiritual learning and guidance but also a gathering place for fellowship and socializing with like minded individuals often he built conversations he had with parishioners after the worship service into focused speeches or organized goals he would then present to a larger audience via his various media outletscitation needed the vietnam waredit falwell found the vietnam war problematic because he felt it was being fought with limited political objectives when it should have been an all out war against the north28 in general falwell held that the president as a minister of god has the right to use arms to bring wrath upon those who would do evil29 civil rightsedit on his evangelist program the oldtime gospel hour in the mid 1960s falwell regularly featured segregationist politicians like lester maddox and george wallace30 about martin luther king he said i do question the sincerity and nonviolent intentions of some civil rights leaders such as dr martin luther king jr mr james farmer and others who are known to have left wing associations31 in speaking of the brown vs board of education ruling he said in 1958 if cpt america warren and his associates had known gods word and had desired to do the lords will i am quite confident that the 1954 decision would never had been made the facilities should be separate when god has drawn a line of distinction we should not attempt to cross that line32 in 1977 falwell supported anita bryants campaign which was called by its proponents save our children to overturn an ordinance in dade county florida prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and he supported a similar movement in california3 twentyeight years later in an appearance on msnbc television falwell said he was not troubled by reports that the nominee for chief justice of the united states supreme court john g roberts whose appointment was confirmed by the us senate had done volunteer legal work for homosexual rights activists on the case of romer v evans falwell told msnbcs tucker carlson that if he were a lawyer he too would argue for civil rights for lgbt people i may not agree with the lifestyle but that has nothing to do with the civil rights of that part of our constituency falwell said when carlson countered that conservatives are always arguing against special rights for gays falwell said that equal access to housing and employment are basic rights not special rights civil rights for all americans black white red yellow the rich poor young old gay straight et cetera is not a liberal or conservative value its an american value that i would think that we pretty much all agree on33 israel and jewsedit falwells staunch proisrael stand sometimes referred to as christian zionism drew the strong support of the antidefamation league and its leader abraham foxman34 however they condemned what they perceived as intolerance towards muslims in falwells public statementscitation needed they also criticized him for remarking that jews can make more money accidentally than you can on purpose3536 in his book listen america falwell referred to the jewish people as spiritually blind and desperately in need of their messiah and savior37 educationedit falwell repeatedly denounced certain teachings in public schools and secular education in general calling them breeding grounds for atheism secularism and humanism which he claimed to be in contradiction with christian morality he advocated that the united states change its public education system by implementing a school voucher system which would allow parents to send their children to either public or private schools in his book america can be saved he wrote that i hope i live to see the day when as in the early days of our country we wont have any public schools the churches will have taken them over again and christians will be running them38 falwell supported president george w bushs faith based initiative but had strong reservations concerning where the funding would go and the restrictions placed on churches my problem is where it might go under his successors i would not want to put any of the jerry falwell ministries in a position where we might be subservient to a future bill clinton god forbid it also concerns me that once the pork barrel is filled suddenly the church of scientology the jehovah witnesses sic the various and many denominations and religious groups—and i dont say those words in a pejorative way—begin applying for money—and i dont see how any can be turned down because of their radical and unpopular views i dont know where that would take us39 apartheidedit in the 1980s falwell said that sanctions against the apartheid regime of south africa would result in what he felt would be a worse situation such as a sovietbacked revolution he drew the ire of many when he called nobel peace prize winner and anglican archbishop desmond tutu a phony as far as representing the black people of south africa40 he later apologized for that remark and claimed that he had misspoken41 he also urged his followers to buy up gold krugerrands and push us reinvestment in south africa42 clinton chroniclesedit main article the clinton chronicles in 1994 falwell promoted and distributed the video documentary the clinton chronicles an investigation into the alleged criminal activities of bill clinton the video purported to connect bill clinton to a murder conspiracy involving vince foster james mcdougall ron brown and a cocainesmuggling operation the theory was discredited but nonetheless sold more than 150000 copies43 funding for the film was provided by citizens for honest government to which falwell paid 200000 in 1994 and 199543 in 1995 citizens for honest government interviewed arkansas state troopers roger perry and larry patterson regarding the murder conspiracy about vincent foster perry and patterson also gave information regarding the allegations in the paula jones affair43 the infomercial for the 80minute tape included footage of falwell interviewing a silhouetted journalist who claimed to be afraid for his life the journalist accused clinton of orchestrating the deaths of several reporters and personal confidants who had gotten too close to his illegalities the silhouetted journalist was subsequently revealed to be patrick matrisciana the producer of the video and president of citizens for honest government43 obviously im not an investigative reporter matrisciana admitted to investigative journalist murray waas43 later falwell seemed to back away from personally trusting the video in an interview for the 2005 documentary the hunting of the president falwell admitted to this day i do not know the accuracy of the claims made in the clinton chronicles44 views on homosexualityedit falwell condemned homosexuality as forbidden by the bible gay rights groups called falwell an agent of intolerance and the founder of the antigay industry for statements he had made and for campaigning against lgbt social movements345 falwell supported anita bryants 1977 save our children campaign to overturn a florida ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and a similar movement in california3 in urging the repeal of the ordinance falwell told one crowd gay folks would just as soon kill you as look at you46 when the lgbtfriendly metropolitan community church was almost accepted into the world council of churches falwell called them brute beasts and stated this vile and satanic system will one day be utterly annihilated and therell be a celebration in heaven47 he later denied this48 falwell also regularly linked the aids pandemic to lgbt issues and stated aids is not just gods punishment for homosexuals it is gods punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals49 amongst many remarks over the years he is probably most known for statements attributed to him about a teletubby being a homosexual role model for homosexual recruitment and stating that lgbt organizations angered god thereby in part causing god to let the september 11 attacks happen505152 after comedian and actress ellen degeneres came out as a lesbian falwell referred to her in a sermon as ellen degenerate degeneres mocked him saying really he called me that ellen degenerate ive been getting that since the fourth grade i guess im happy i could give him work53 falwells legacy regarding homosexuality is complicated by his support for lgbt civil rights see civil rights section above as well as his attempts to reconcile with the lgbt community in later years in october 1999 falwell hosted a meeting of 200 evangelicals with 200 homosexuals at thomas road baptist church for an antiviolence forum during which he acknowledged that some american evangelicals comments about homosexuality entered the realm of hate speech that could incite violence54 at the forum falwell told homosexuals in attendance i dont agree with your lifestyle i will never agree with your lifestyle but i love you and added anything that leaves the impression that we hate the sinner we want to change that55 he later commented to new york times columnist frank rich that admittedly evangelicals have not exhibited an ability to build a bond of friendship to the gay and lesbian community weve said go somewhere else we dont need you here at our churches56 teletubbiesedit in february 1999 an unsigned article that media outlets attributed to falwell was published in the national liberty journal – a promotional publication of the university he founded – claimed that the purple teletubby named tinky winky was intended as a gay role model an article published in 1998 by saloncom had noted tinky winkys status as a gay icon5758 in response steve rice spokesperson for itsy bitsy entertainment which licenses the teletubbies in the united states said i really find it absurd and kind of offensive5059 the immensely popular uk show was aimed at preschool children but the article stated he is purple – the gay pride color and his antenna is shaped like a triangle – the gaypride symbol apart from those characteristics tinky winky also carries a magic bag which the nlj and salon articles said was a purse falwell added that role modeling the gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives of children september 11 attacksedit after the september 11 attacks in 2001 falwell said on pat robertsons the 700 club i really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle the aclu people for the american way all of them who have tried to secularize america i point the finger in their face and say you helped this happen60 falwell further stated that the attacks were probably deserved a statement which christopher hitchens described as treason61 after heavy criticism falwell said that no one but the terrorists were to blame and stated if i left that impression with gays or lesbians or anyone else i apologize51 labor unionsedit falwell has also said labor unions should study and read the bible instead of asking for more money when people get right with god they are better workers62 relationship to american fundamentalismedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed july 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message falwell set out in his christian ministry as a fundamentalist having attended a conservative bible college and following strict standards of ecclesiastical and personal separatism he was thus known and respected in ifb circles being praised in christian fundamentalist publications such as the sword of the lord though he never officially stated his rejection of this movement the evidence of his life from the late 1970s onwards indicates he moved toward a conservative evangelical standpoint to the right of mainline protestantism or open evangelicalism but to the left of traditional separatist fundamentalism it was reported that he had refused to attend parties at which alcohol was served early in his life but relaxed this stricture as he was increasingly invited to major events through the contacts he developed in conservative politics and religion his foray into national politics appears to be a catalyst for this change when he established the moral majority which joined bible christians independent and conservative southern baptists in a political alliance with charismatics roman catholics jews mormons and others he rejected the level of separation preached by most movement fundamentalists bob jones university declared the moral majority organization satanic holding that it was a step toward the apostate oneworld church and government body as it would cross the line from a political alliance to a religious one between true christians and the nonbornagain as forbidden by their interpretation of the bible david clouds way of life literature also criticizes falwell for associations with catholics pentecostals and liberal christians tracing his alleged apostasy back to his role in the political religious right though he never wavered in his belief in the inerrancy of the bible except for moderating its alleged view of racial differences significance of baptism and other concepts relative to his theology and the doctrines conservative christians widely see as essential to salvation his rhetoric became generally more mellow less militant and comparatively more inclusive from the 1980s onward cultural anthropologist susan friend harding in her extensive ethnographic study of falwell noted that he adapted his preaching to win a broader less extremist audience as he grew famous this manifested in several ways among them were no longer condemning worldly lifestyle choices such as dancing drinking wine and attending movie theaters softening rhetoric of apocalypse and gods vengeful wrath and shifting from outright biblical patriarchy to a complementarian view of appropriate gender roles he further mainstreamed himself by aiming his strongest criticism at secular humanists pagans or various liberals in place of the racist antisemitic or anticatholic rhetoric common among southern fundamentalist preachers but increasingly condemned as hate speech by the consensus of american society63 islamedit jerry falwell opposed islam according to asharq alawsat a panarab newspaper falwell called islam satanic64 in a televised interview with 60 minutes falwell called muhammad a terrorist to which he added i concluded from reading muslim and nonmuslim writers that muhammad was a violent man a man of war falwell later apologized to muslims for what he said about muhammad and affirmed that he did not necessarily intend to offend honest and peaceloving muslims however as he refused to remove his comments about islam from his website the sincerity of his apology was doubted6566 egyptian christian intellectuals in response signed a statement in which they condemned and rejected what falwell had said about muhammad being a terrorist67 legal issuesedit from the 1970s on falwell was involved in legal matters which occupied much of his time and propelled his name recognition sec and bondsedit in 1972 the us securities and exchange commission sec launched an investigation of bonds issued by falwells organizations the sec charged falwells church with fraud and deceit in the issuance of 65 million in unsecured church bonds68 the church won a 1973 federal court case prosecuted at the behest of the sec in which the court exonerated the church and ruled that while technical violations of law did occur there was no proof the church intended any wrongdoing falwell versus penthouseedit falwell filed a 10 million lawsuit against penthouse for publishing an article based upon interviews he gave to freelance reporters after failing to convince a federal court to place an injunction upon the publication of that article the suit was dismissed in federal district court on the grounds that the article was not defamatory or an invasion of falwells privacy the virginia courts had not recognized this privacy tort which is recognized in other states697071 falwell versus hustleredit main article hustler magazine v falwell in november 1983 larry flynts pornographic magazine hustler carried a parody of a campari ad featuring a fake interview with falwell in which he admits that his first time was incest with his mother in an outhouse while drunk falwell sued for 45 million in compensation alleging invasion of privacy libel and intentional infliction of emotional distresscitation needed after a civil trial known as falwell vs flynt which was held december 3–8 1984 a jury rejected the invasion of privacy and libel claims holding that the parody could not have reasonably been taken to describe true events but ruled in favor of falwell on the emotional distress claim and ordered larry flynt to pay falwell damages in the amount of 200000 this was upheld on appeal flynt then appealed to the supreme court winning a unanimous decision on february 24 1988 the ruling held that public figures cannot circumvent first amendment protections by attempting to recover damages based on emotional distress suffered from parodies the decision in favor of flynt strengthened free speech rights in the united states in relation to parodies of public figures after falwells death larry flynt released a comment regarding his friendship over the years with falwell my mother always told me that no matter how much you dislike a person when you meet them face to face you will find characteristics about them that you like jerry falwell was a perfect example of that i hated everything he stood for but after meeting him in person years after the trial jerry falwell and i became good friends he would visit me in california and we would debate together on college campuses i always appreciated his sincerity even though i knew what he was selling and he knew what i was selling72 falwell versus jerry sloanedit jerry falwell in tallahassee florida in 1984 falwell was ordered to pay gay rights activist and former baptist bible college classmate

vile and satanic system that will one day be utterly annihilated and there will be a celebration in heaven47 when sloan insisted he had a tape falwell promised 5000 if he could produce it sloan did

intersex communities48 falwell appealed the decision with his attorney charging that the jewish judge in the case was prejudiced he lost again and was made to pay an additional 2875 in sanctions and court fees73 falwell versus christopher lamparelloedit main article lamparello v falwell in lamparello v falwell a dispute over the ownership of the internet domain fallwellcom the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed an earlier district court decision arguing that christopher lamparello who owned the domain clearly created his web site intending only to provide a forum to criticize ideas not to steal customers74 lamparellos website describes itself as not being connected to jerry falwell and is critical of falwells views on homosexuality74 on april 17 2006 the supreme court declined to hear an appeal of the court of appeals ruling that lamparellos usage of the domain was legal previous to this a different man had turned over jerryfalwellcom and jerryfallwellcom

future i would vote yes with the 59 percent and with billy graham and most evangelicals75 based on this and other statements falwell has been identified as a dispensationalist76 in 1999 falwell declared the antichrist would probably arrive within a decade and of course hell be jewish77 after accusations of antisemitism falwell apologized and explained that he was simply expressing the

falwells last televised sermon was his may 13 2007 message on mothers day legacy and criticismsedit falwells legacy is strongly mixed and often a source of heated controversy supporters praise his advancement of his socially conservative message they also tout his evangelist ministries and his stress on church planting and growth many of his detractors have accused him of hate speech and identified him as an agent of intolerance45 he was described by social commentator and antitheist christopher hitchens in terms as chaucerian fraud and a faithbased fraud hitchens took special umbrage with falwells alignment with the most thuggish and demented israeli settlers and his declaration that 911 represented gods judgment on americas sinful behaviour deeming it extraordinary that not even such a scandalous career is enough to shake our dumb addiction to the faithbased hitchens also mentioned that despite his support for israel falwell kept saying to his own crowd yes you have got to like the jews because they can make more money in 10 minutes than you can make in a lifetime86 appearing on cnn a day after falwells death hitchens said the empty life of this ugly little charlatan proves only one thing that you can get away with the most extraordinary offenses to morality and to truth in this country if you will just get yourself called reverend87 on cspan hitchens made the comment that if he had been given an enema he could have been buried in a matchbox88 falwell was an enemy of the revenge humorist george hayduke who called falwell a fundgrubbing electronic
