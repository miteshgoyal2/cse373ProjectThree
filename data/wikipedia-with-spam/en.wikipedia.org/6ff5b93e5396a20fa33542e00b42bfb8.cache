› crowd gathered outside of the public auditorium during the convention the 1924 national convention of the republican party of the united states was held in cleveland ohio at the public auditorium from june 10 to june 12 for this convention the method of allocating delegates changed in order to reduce the overrepresentation of the south1 this effort proved only partly successful as southern delegates would actually be more overrepresented than they had been in 1916 or 1920 however they were not as overrepresented as they had been before 1912 it also made history by being the first gop convention to give women equal representation the republican national committee approved a rule providing for a national committeeman and a national committeewoman from each state2 more controversy ensued over whether to condemn the ku klux klan with the result ultimately being to say nothing either way president calvin coolidge was formally nominated for a full term and went on to win the general election the convention nominated illinois governor frank lowden for vice president on the second ballot but he declined the nomination the convention then selected charles g dawes also considered for the nomination was senator charles curtis of kansas a future vice president contents 1 republican candidates 11 declined to run 2 vice presidential nomination 3 prayers 4 see also 5

coolidge fended off his progressive challengers with convincing wins in the republican primaries and was assured of the 1924 nomination by the time the convention began3 after his defeat in the primaries la follette ran a third party candidacy that attracted significant support president calvin coolidge of massachusetts senator hiram johnson of california senator robert m la follette sr of

after the death of warren g harding in 1923 as the 25th amendment had not yet been passed coolidge served the remainder of hardings term without a vice president the 1924 republican convention was thus tasked with picking a running mate for coolidge with coolidge having locked up renomination most attention was focused on the vice presidential nomination secretary of commerce herbert hoover of california and appellate judge william kenyon of iowa were seen as the frontrunners for the nomination as both were popular western progressives who could provide balance to a ticket led by a conservative from massachusetts4 coolidges first choice was reported to be idaho senator william e borah also a progressive westerner but borah declined to be considered for the ticket4 illinois governor frank o lowden university of michigan president marion leroy burton ambassador charles b warren of michigan washington senator wesley livsey jones john coulter of north dakota general james harbord and general charles dawes also had support as potential running mates4 despite saying that he would not accept the nomination lowden was nominated for vice president on the second ballot over dawes kenyon and ohio congressman theodore e burton5 however lowden declined the nomination an action that as of 2017update has never been repeated and in the early 21st century is considered unthinkable the republicans thus held a new vice presidential ballot with coolidge favoring hoover5 however the republicans picked dawes partly as a reaction to the perceived dominance of coolidge in
