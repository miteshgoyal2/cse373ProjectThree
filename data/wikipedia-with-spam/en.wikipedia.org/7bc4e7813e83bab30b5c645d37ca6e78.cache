deepdream from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the same image before left and after right applying ten iterations of deepdream deepdream is a computer vision program created by google which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia thus creating a dreamlike hallucinogenic appearance in the deliberately overprocessed images123 googles program popularized the term deep dreaming to refer to the generation of images that produce desired activations in a trained deep network and the term now refers to a collection of related approaches contents 1 process 2 history 3 usage 4 see also 5 references 6 external links processedit a latestage deepdream processed photograph of three men in a pool the deepdream software originates in a deep convolutional network codenamed inception after the film of the same name123 was developed for the imagenet largescale visual recognition challenge ilsvrc in 20143 and released in july 2015 the software is designed to detect faces and other patterns in images with the aim of automatically classifying images4 however once trained the network can also be run in reverse being asked to adjust the original image slightly so that a given output neuron eg the one for faces or certain animals yields a higher confidence score this can be used for visualizations to understand the emergent structure of the neural network better and is the basis for the deepdream concept however after enough reiterations even imagery initially devoid of the sought features will be adjusted enough that a form of pareidolia results by which psychedelic and surreal images are generated algorithmically the optimization resembles backpropagation however instead of adjusting the network weights the weights are held fixed and the input is adjusted alternately an existing image can be altered so that it is more catlike and the resulting enhanced image can be again input to the procedure2 this usage resembles the activity of looking for animals or other patterns in clouds applying gradient descent independently to each pixel of the input produces images in which adjacent pixels have little relation and thus the image has too much high frequency information the generated images can be greatly improved by including a prior or regularizer that prefers inputs that have natural image statistics without a preference for any particular image or are simply smooth 5 6 7 for example6 used the total variation regularizer that prefers images that are piecewise constant various regularizers are discussed further in7 historyedit the dreaming idea and name became popular on the internet in 2015 thanks to googles deepdream program the idea dates from early in the history of neural networks8 and similar methods have been used to synthesize visual textures9 related visualization ideas were developed prior to googles work by several research groups105 after google published their techniques and made their code open source11 a number of tools in the form of web services mobile applications and desktop software appeared on the market to enable users to transform their own photos12 usageedit the dreaming idea can be applied to hidden internal neurons other than those in the output which allows exploration of the roles and representations of various parts of the network7 it is also possible to optimize the input to satisfy either a single neuron this usage is sometimes called activity maximization13 or an entire layer of neurons while dreaming is most often used for visualizing networks or producing computer art it has recently been proposed that adding dreamed inputs to the training set can improve training times for abstractions in computer science14 the cited resemblance of the imagery to lsd and psilocybininduced hallucinations is suggestive of a functional resemblance between artificial neural networks and particular layers of the visual cortex15 deepdream was used for foster the peoples music video for the song doing it for the money16 see alsoedit artificial intelligence portal art portal procedural textures texture synthesis
