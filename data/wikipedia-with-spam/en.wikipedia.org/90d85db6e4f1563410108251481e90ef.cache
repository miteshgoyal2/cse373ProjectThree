fraternal twin thomas dirksen and a brother named benjamin harrison a nod to the republican leanings of his father the boys father died when the twins were nine years old dirksen grew up on a farm on

public speaking skills his political career began in 1926 when he was elected to the nonpartisan pekin city council he placed first in field of eight candidates vying for four seats at the time the

nomination and the congressional seat in 1932 and was reelected seven times his support for many new deal programs marked him as a moderate pragmatic republican during world war ii he lobbied successfully for an expansion of congressional staff resources to eliminate the practice under which house and senate committees borrowed executive branch personnel to accomplish legislative work dirksen was able to secure the passage of an amendment to the lend lease act by introducing a resolution while 65 of the houses democrats were at a luncheon it provided that the senate and the house could by a simple majority in a concurrent resolution revoke the powers granted to the president5 dirksens penchant for changing his mind was noted by the chicago suntimes which once noted that he had changed his mind 62 times on foreign policy matters 31 times on military affairs and 70 times on agricultural policies3 dirksen studied law privately in washington dc after he was elected he was admitted to the district of columbia bar in 1936 and the bar of illinois in 1937 in december 1943 dirksen announced that he would be a candidate for the republican presidential nomination in 1944 he stated that a coalition of midwestern republican representatives had urged him to run and that his campaign was serious however press pundits had assumed that the candidacy was a vehicle to siphon support away from the campaign of wendell willkie whose reputation as a maverick and staunch internationalist had earned him the hatred of many republican party regulars especially in the midwest6 dirksens presidential campaign was apparently still alive on the eve of the 1944 convention as time speculated that he was running for vicepresident7 dirksen received no votes for either office from delegates at the convention dirksen continued to be reelected in 1947 he began to experience trouble in his right eye which was diagnosed as chorioretinitis despite a number of physicians including one from johns hopkins university recommending for the eye to be removed dirksen chose treatment and rest he recovered most of the sight in that eye in 1948 he declined to run for reelection because of his ailment he returned to politics two years later and was popularly elected to the senate from illinois3 us senatoredit this section includes a list of references but its sources remain unclear

dirksens canny political skill rumpled appearance and convincing if sometimes flowery overblown oratory which made his critics call him the wizard of ooze earned him a prominent national reputation in 1952 dirksen supported the presidential candidacy of fellow senator robert a taft of ohio the longtime leader of the republican partys conservative wing at the national party convention dirksen gave a speech attacking new york governor thomas e dewey a liberal republican and the leading supporter of general dwight eisenhower the commander of the allied forces in europe in world war ii and tafts opponent for the republican presidential nomination during his speech dirksen pointed at dewey on the convention floor and shouted dont take us down the path to defeat again8 a reference to deweys presidential defeats in 1944 and 1948 his speech was met by cheers from conservative delegates and loud boos from proeisenhower delegates after eisenhower won the nomination dirksen then supported him in 1959 he was elected senate minority leader defeating kentuckys more liberal senator john sherman cooper 2014 dirksen successfully united the various factions of the republican party by granting younger republicans more representation in the senate leadership and better committee appointments he held the position of senate minority leader until his death along with charles halleck and later president gerald ford the republican minority leaders of the house dirksen was the official voice of the republican party during most of the 1960s he discussed politics on television news programs on several occasions political cartoonist herblock depicted dirksen and halleck as vaudeville songanddance men wearing identical elaborate costumes and performing an act called the ev and charlie show dirksens voting record was consistently conservative on economic issues he developed a good rapport with the senates majority leaders lyndon b johnson and mike mansfield on foreign policy he reversed his early isolationism to support the internationalism of republican president eisenhower and democratic president john f kennedy he was a leading hawk on the issue of the vietnam war a position he held well before president johnson decided to escalate the war dirksen said in february 1964 first i agree that obviously we cannot retreat from our position in vietnam i have been out there three times once as something of an emissary for then president eisenhower i took a good look at it it is a difficult situation to say the least but we are in to the tune of some 350 million i think the last figure i have seen indicates that we have over 15500 military out there ostensibly as advisers and that sort of thing we are not supposed to have combatant troops even though we were not signatories to the treaty that was signed at geneva when finally they got that whole business out of the fire but we are going to have to muddle through for a while and see what we do even though it costs us 15 million a day959 as johnson followed the recommendations and escalated the war dirksen gave him strong support in public and inside the republican caucus some republicans advised him that it would be to the partys advantage to oppose johnson ford commented i strongly felt that although i agreed with the goals of the johnson administration in vietnam i vigorously criticized their prosecution of the war now dirksen never took that same hardline position that i took9149 dirksen played a key role in passage of the 1964 civil rights act in 1964 as southern democratic senators staged a filibuster which ran 54 days to block passage of the civil rights act of 1964 dirksen thomas kuchel rca hubert humphrey dmn and mike mansfield dmt introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would attract enough swing votes to end the filibuster it was weaker than the house version on the governments power to regulate the conduct of private business but it was not so weak it would cause the house to reconsider the legislation also the department of justice said the mansfielddirksen amendment would not prevent effective enforcement however senator richard russell jr dga refused to allow a vote on the amendment finally senator thruston morton rky proposed an amendment that guaranteed jury trials in all criminal contempt cases except voting rights it was approved on june 9 and humphrey made a deal with three republicans to substitute it for the mansfielddirksen amendment in exchange for their supporting cloture on the filibuster thus after 57 days of filibuster the substitute bill passed in the senate and the housesenate conference committee agreed to adopt the senate version of the bill10 at that cloture vote dirksen said victor hugo wrote in his diary

effort to convene an article v convention for an amendment to the constitution that would allow for legislative districts of unequal population12 dirksen died before enough states passed resolutions
