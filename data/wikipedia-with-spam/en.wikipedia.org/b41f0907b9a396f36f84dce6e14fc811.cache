michael jackson in 1984 several months before he and lionel richie completed the writing of we are the world quincy jones was a key figure in the production and recording of we are the world before the writing of we are the world american entertainer and social activist harry belafonte had sought for some time to have a song recorded by the most famous artists in the music industry at the time he planned to have the proceeds donated to a new organization called united support of artists for africa usa for africa the nonprofit foundation would then feed and relieve starving people in africa specifically ethiopia where around one million people died during the countrys 1983–85 famine12 the idea followed band aids do they know its christmas project in the uk which belafonte had heard aboutnb 14 in the activists plans money would also be set aside to help eliminate hunger in the united states of america entertainment manager and fellow fundraiser ken kragen was contacted by belafonte who asked for singers lionel richie and kenny rogers—kragens clients—to participate in belafontes musical endeavor kragen and the two musicians agreed to help with belafontes mission and in turn enlisted the cooperation of stevie wonder to add more name value to their project1 quincy jones was drafted to coproduce the song taking time out from his work on the color purple15 jones also telephoned michael jackson who had just released the commercially successful thriller album and had concluded a tour with his brothers1 jackson revealed to richie that he not only wanted to sing the song but to participate in its writing as well16 to begin with we are the world was to be written by jackson richie and wonder as wonder had limited time to work on the project jackson and richie proceeded to write we are the world themselves6 they began creating the song at hayvenhurst the jackson family home in encino for a week the two spent every night working on lyrics and melodies in the singers bedroom they knew that they wanted a song that would be easy to sing and memorable the pair wanted to create an anthem jacksons older sister la toya watched the two work on the song and later contended that richie only wrote a few lines for the track5 she stated that her younger brother wrote 99 percent of the lyrics but hes never felt it necessary to say that5 la toya further commented on the songs creation in an interview with the american celebrity news magazine people id go into the room while they were writing and it would be very quiet which is odd since michaels usually very cheery when he works it was very emotional for them6 richie had recorded two melodies for we are the world which jackson took adding music and words to the song in the same day jackson stated i love working quickly i went ahead without even lionel knowing i couldnt wait i went in and came out the same night with the song completed—drums piano strings and words to the chorus7 jackson then presented his demo to richie and jones who were both shocked they did not expect the pop star to see the structure of the song so quickly the next meetings between jackson and richie were unfruitful the pair did not produce any additional vocals and got no work done it was not until the night of january 21 1985 that richie and jackson completed the lyrics and melody of we are the world within two and a half hours one night before the songs first recording session7 recording sessionsedit photo showing cyndi lauper studio badge and the sweatshirt given to all attendees at am studios in hollywood california on january 28 1985 back of the we are the world sweater autographed by michael jackson and lionel richie the first night of recording january 22 1985 had tight security on hand as richie jackson wonder and jones started work on we are the world at kenny rogers lion share recording studio the studio on beverly boulevard in california was filled with musicians technicians video crews retinues assistants and organizers as the four musicians entered to begin the night a vocal guide of we are the world was recorded by richie and jackson and duplicated on tape for each of the invited performers the guide was recorded on the sixth take as quincy jones felt that there was too much thought in the previous versions8 following their work on the vocal guide jackson and jones began thinking of alternatives for the line theres a chance were taking were taking our own lives the pair was concerned that the latter part of the line would be considered a reference to suicide as the group listened to a playback of the chorus richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to were saving our own lives which his fellow musicians agreed with producer jones also suggested altering the former part of the line one thing we dont want to do especially with this group is look like were patting ourselves on the back so its really theres a choice were making9 around 130 am the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of melodic vocalizations including the sound shalum shalingay9 jones told the group that they were not to add anything else to the tape if we get too good someones gonna start playing it on the radio he announced9 on january 24 1985 after a day of rest jones shipped richie and jacksons vocal guide to all of the artists who would be involved in we are the worlds recording enclosed in the package was a letter from jones addressed to my fellow artists9 “ the cassettes are numbered and i cant express how important it is not to let this material out of your hands please do not make copies and return this cassette the night of the 28th in the years to come when your children ask what did mommy and daddy do for the war against world famine you can say proudly this was your contribution9 ” ken kragen chaired a production meeting at a bungalow off sunset boulevard on january 25 1985 there kragen and his team discussed where the recording sessions with the supergroup of musicians should take place he stated the single most damaging piece of information is where were doing this if that shows up anywhere weve got a chaotic situation that could totally destroy the project the moment a prince a michael jackson a bob dylan—i guarantee you—drives up and sees a mob around that studio he will never come in9 on the same night quincy jones associate producer and vocal arranger tom bahler was given the task of matching each solo line with the right voice bahler stated its like vocal arranging in a perfect world9 jones disagreed stating that the task was like putting a watermelon in a coke bottle9 the following evening lionel richie held a choreography session at his home where it was decided who would stand where9 the final night of recording was held on january 28 1985 at am recording studios in hollywood39 michael jackson arrived at 9 pm earlier than the other artists to record his solo section and record a vocal chorus by himself9 he was subsequently joined in the recording studio by the remaining usa for africa artists who included ray charles billy joel diana ross cyndi lauper bruce springsteen and smokey robinson also in attendance were five of jacksons siblings jackie la toya marlon randy and tito10 many of the participants came straight from an american music award ceremony which had been held that same night5 invited musician prince who would have had a part in which he and michael jackson sang to each other did not attend the recording session11 the reason given for his absence has varied one newspaper claimed that the singer did not want to record with other acts12 another report from the time of we are the worlds recording suggested that the musician did not want to partake in the session because organizer bob geldof called him a creep13 prince did however donate an exclusive track 4 the tears in your eyes for the we are the world album12 in all more than 45 of americas top musicians participated in the recording1114 and another 50 had to be turned away5 upon entering the recording studio the musicians were greeted by a sign pinned to the door which read please check your egos at the door15 they were also greeted by stevie wonder who proclaimed that if the recording was not completed in one take he and ray charles two blind men would drive everybody home16 i think whats happening in africa is a crime of historic proportions  you walk into one of the corrugated iron huts and you see meningitis and malaria and typhoid buzzing around the air and you see dead bodies lying side by side with the live ones in some of the camps you see 15 bags of flour for 27000 people and i assume thats why were all here tonight bob geldof addressing his fellow usa for africa musicians during one of the recording session of we are the world on january 28 198517 each of the performers took their position at around 1030 pm and began to sing several hours passed before stevie wonder announced that he would like to substitute a line in swahili for the shalum shalingay sound1718 at this point waylon jennings left the recording studio for a short time when it was suggested by some that the song be sung in swahili1718 a heated debate ensued in which several artists also rejected the suggestion the shalum shalingay sound ran into opposition as well and was subsequently removed from the song jennings returned to the studio and participated in the recording which bears his name in the end credits the participants eventually decided to sing something meaningful in english they chose to sing the new line one world our children which most of the participants enjoyed17 in the early hours of the morning two ethiopian women guests of stevie wonder were brought into the recording studio—it had been decided that a portion of the proceeds raised would be used to bring aid to those affected by the recent famine in ethiopia1819 they thanked the singers on behalf of their country bringing several artists to tears before being led from the room1819 wonder attempted to lighten the mood by joking that the recording session gave him a chance to see fellow blind musician ray charles we just sort of bumped into each other16 the solo parts of the song were recorded without any problems19 the final version of we are the world was completed at 8 am1920 music and

hot 100 where it remained for a month2627 the single had initially debuted at number 21 on the hot 100 the highest entry since michael jacksons thriller entered the charts at number 20 the year before22 it took four weeks for the song to claim the number one spot—half the time a single would normally have taken to reach its charting peak28 on the hot 100 the song moved from 21 to 5 to 2 and then number 1 we are the world might have reached the top of the hot 100 chart sooner if it were not for the success of phil collins one more night which received a significant level of support from both pop and rock listeners28 we are the world also entered billboards top rock tracks and hot country singles charts where it peaked at numbers 27 and 76 respectively26 the song became the first

norway sweden switzerland and the uk the song peaked at number 2 in only two countries germany and austria29303132 the single was also a commercial success the initial shipment of 800000 we are the world records sold out within three days of release24 the record became the fastestselling american pop single in history33 at one tower records store on sunset boulevard in west hollywood 1000 copies of the song were sold in two days34 store worker richard petitpas commented a number one single sells about 100 to 125 copies a week this is absolutely unheard of34 by the end of 1985 we are the world had become the best selling single of the year35 five years later it was revealed that the song had become the biggest single of the 1980s36 we are the world was eventually cited as the biggest selling single in both us and pop music historynb 2383940 the song became the firstever single to be certified multiplatinum it received a 4× certification by the recording industry association of america2741 the estimated global sales of we are the world are said to be 20 million42 despite the songs commercial success we are the world received mixed reviews from journalists music critics and the public following its release american journalist greil marcus felt that the song sounded like a pepsi jingle43 he wrote the constant repetition of theres a choice were making conflates with pepsis trademarked the choice of a new generation in a way that on the part of pepsicontracted song writers michael jackson and lionel richie is certainly not intentional and even more certainly beyond the realm of serendipity43 marcus added in the realm of contextualization we are the world says less about ethiopia than it does about pepsi—and the true result will likely be less that certain ethiopian individuals will live or anyway live a bit longer than they otherwise would have than that pepsi will get the catch phrase of its advertising campaign sung for free by ray charles stevie wonder bruce springsteen and all the rest43 author reebee garofalo agreed and expressed the opinion that the line were saving our own lives was a distasteful element of selfindulgence43 he asserted that the artists of usa for africa were proclaiming their own salvation for singing about an issue they will never experience on behalf of a people most of them will never encounter43 in contrast stephen holden of the new york times praised the phrase theres a choice were making were saving our own lives3 he commented that the line assumed an extra emotional dimension when sung by people with superstar mystiques3 holden expressed that the song was an artistic triumph that transcends its official nature3 he noted that unlike band aids do they know its christmas the vocals on we are the world were artfully interwoven and emphasized the individuality of each singer3 holden concluded that we are the world was a simple eloquent ballad and a fullyrealized pop statement that would sound outstanding even if it werent recorded by stars3 the song proved popular with both young and old listeners22 the public enjoyed hearing a supergroup of musicians singing together on one track and felt satisfied in buying the record knowing that the money would go towards a good cause22 people reported they bought more than one copy of the single some buying up to five copies of the record44 one mother from columbia missouri purchased two copies of we are the world stating the record is excellent whether its for a cause or not its fun trying to identify the different artists it was a good feeling knowing that i was helping someone in need22 according to music critic and bruce springsteen biographer dave marsh we are the world was not widely accepted within the rock music community45 the author revealed that the song was despised for what it was not a rock record a critique of the political policies that created the famine a way of finding out how and why famines occur an allinclusive representation of the entire worldwide spectrum of postpresley popular music45 marsh revealed that he felt some of the criticisms were right while others were silly45 he claimed that despite the sentimentality of the song we are the world was a largescale pop event with serious political overtones45 we are the world was recognized with several awards following its release at the 1986 grammy awards the song and its accompanying music video won four awards record of the year song of the year best pop performance by a duo or group with vocal and best music video short form46 the

april lee grebb as the production supervisor the music video showed the recording of we are the world and drew criticism from some michael jackson joked before filming people will know its me as soon as they see the socks try taking footage of bruce springsteens socks and see if anyone knows who they belong to24 jackson was also criticized for filming and recording his solo piece privately away from the other artists the song was also promoted with a special edition of the american magazine life the publication had been the only media outlet permitted inside am recording studios on the night of january 28 1985 all other press organizations were barred from reporting the events leading up to and during we are the worlds recording life ran a cover story of the recording session in its april

inside the magazine were photographs of the we are the world participants working and taking breaks50 we are the world received worldwide radio coverage in the form of an international simultaneous broadcast later that year upon spinning the song on their local stations georgia radio disc jockeys bob wolf and don briscar came up with the idea for a worldwide simulcast52 they called hundreds of

project—was an event in which millions of people formed a human chain across the us56 the event was held to draw attention to hunger and homelessness in the united states57 we are the worlds cowriter michael jackson had wanted his song to be the official theme for the event the other board members of usa for africa outvoted the singer and it was instead decided that a new song would be created and released for the event titled hands across america46 when released the new song did not achieve the level of success that we are the world did and the decision to use it as the official theme for the event led to jackson—who coowned the publishing rights to we are the world—resigning from the board of directors of usa for africa4658 humanitarian aidedit a military aircraft dropping food during the 1984–85 ethiopian famine four months after the release of we are the world usa for africa had taken in almost 108 million equivalent to 24 million today5960 the majority of the money came from record

47 million worth of official merchandise around the world organizer ken kragen announced that they would not be distributing all of the money at once instead he revealed that the foundation would be looking into finding a longterm solution for africas problems59 we could go out and spend it all in one shot maybe wed save some lives in the short term but it would be like putting a bandaid over a serious wound59 kragen noted that experts had predicted that it would take at least 10 to 20 years to make a slight difference to africas longterm problems59 in june 1985 the first usa for africa cargo jet carrying food medicine and clothing departed for ethiopia and sudan it stopped en route in new york where 15000 tshirts were added to the cargo included in the supplies were highprotein

asked about his memory of michael jackson after his death remembers i wont ever forget michael jackson because his contribution to the song we are the world had a very significant effect on my life i am 50 now but 25 years ago i was living in addis ababa ethiopia which at that time was suffering from a long drought and famine it was a terrible situation lots of people became sick and many more died around one million people in all were killed by the famine in 1984 michael jackson along with a number of other leading musicians made the song we are the world to raise money for africa we received a lot of aid from the world and i was one of those who directly benefitted from it the wheat flour that was distributed to the famine victims was different to the usual cereal we bought at the market we baked a special bread from it the local people named the bread after the great artist and it became known as michael bread it was soft and delicious when you have been through such hard times you never forget events like this if you speak to anyone who was in addis ababa at that time they will all know what michael bread is and i know i will remember it for the rest of my life 67

world among the supergroup of 62 recording artists were julio iglesias josé feliciano and sérgio mendes their famine relief song was recorded in the same studio as we are the world half of the profits raised from the charity single was pledged to usa for africa the rest of the money was to be used for impoverished latin american countries93 another notable example is the 1989 cover of the deep purple song smoke on the water by a supergroup of hard rock prog rock and heavy metal musicians collaborating as rock aid armenia to raise money for victims of the devastating 1988 armenian earthquake94 the 20th anniversary of we are the world was celebrated in 2005 radio stations around the world paid homage to usa for africas creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song in addition to the simulcast the milestone was marked by the release of a twodisc dvd called we are the world the story behind the song95 ken kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and dvd release was not for usa for africa to praise themselves for doing a good job but to use it to do some more good for the original charity thats all we care about accomplishing95 harry belafonte also commented on the 20th anniversary of the song the entertainer acknowledged that we are the world had stood the test of time anyone old enough to remember it can still at least hum along96 chartsedit
