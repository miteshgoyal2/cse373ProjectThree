area is part of the metropolitan tract an area of downtown that is owned by and was originally home to the university of washington3 the area surrounding the station primarily consists of highrise office buildings and some mixeduse development providing 102194 jobs and housing a population of 13813 within a 1⁄2 mile 08 km of 3rd avenue and university street4 major buildings in the immediate vicinity of university street station include benaroya hall and 1201 third avenue formerly washington mutual tower on the west side of the station and the historic seattle tower and cobb building on

avenue theatre seattle central library rainier square shopping center and union square are all located east of the station along 5th avenue267 historyedit early proposalsedit the metropolitan tract historically the northern boundary of downtown seattle during its early decades was offered for development shortly after the university of washington moved its campus to the north side of portage bay modern day university district in 1895 the universitys board of regents voted to lease the land to private developers in 1902 beginning a construction boom in the area under the direction of the metropolitan building company8 in 1911 virgil bogue presented a comprehensive plan for the city of seattle including a rapid transit system centered around a trunk subway under 3rd avenue passing through downtown and the metropolitan tract towards a new civic center in modernday belltown910 the plan was rejected by voters on march 5 191211 and the 3rd avenue subway was unsuccessfully proposed twice in the 1920s1213 in the late 1960s the forward thrust committee put forward a ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system in the seattle metropolitan area including a downtown subway under 3rd avenue with a station between seneca and spring streets141516 the ballot measure requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment 385 million in local funding with 765 million from the urban mass transportation administration failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 19701718 the failure of the forward thrust ballot measures led to the creation of metro transit in 1972 operating bus service across king county19 bus tunneledit a dualmode bus stopped on the northbound platform at university street station in 1994 metro transit began planning a bus tunnel through downtown seattle in the 1970s to be eventually converted to use by light rail trains metro approved the construction of a bus tunnel under 3rd avenue in 198320 and chose the intersection of 3rd avenue and university street as the site of one of the tunnels five stations21 the station at university street replacing two separate stations at union and madison streets would be excavated cutandcover and be completed by late 19892223 excavation of the downtown bus tunnel began in early 1987 and construction reached the university street area later that year24 the twin tunnel boring machines used to excavate the tunnel reached university street in october 1987 and continued north towards westlake station2526 in december metro agreed to pay 24 million to real estate developer marathon company for use of a city block they owned adjacent to the station for equipment staging and storage delaying the planned construction of office buildings on the site27 during excavation and construction of the university street tunnel station cracks and minor settling were found in the historic seattle tower located nearby25 the ground around the tower was later stabilized to prevent additional settlement28 and was renovated with private funding in 199029 in march 1989 the first buses were tested in the tunnel university street station was only 75 percent complete and buses had to drive under scaffolding and construction equipment while passing through the station30 tunnel construction was completed in june 199031 and a soft opening for university street station was held on august 9 199032 bus service in the downtown seattle transit tunnel began on september 15 1990 with several metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets33 all service on routes using the tunnel was operated by dualmode buses which operated as diesel buses outside the tunnel and electrically as trolleybuses when inside the tunnel during its early months university street and other stations were affected by serious water leaks which splashed water onto walkways during the tunnels first winter in operation the leaks were later fixed by metro contractors3435 in 1994 the seattle symphony selected a city block adjacent to university street station used during tunnel construction for equipment staging and storage as the site of their new concert hall36 the building later named benaroya hall required the closure of the stations 2nd avenue entrance37 the entrance was reopened in 1998 at the same time the new hall was inaugurated38 light railedit the platform at university street station after its renovation for light rail in the early 1990s a regional transit authority rta was formed to plan and construct a light rail system for the seattle area after an unsuccessful attempt in 1995 regional voters passed a 39 billion plan to build light rail under the rta in 199639 the downtown transit tunnel had already been planned for eventual light rail use and was built with tracks that would be incorporated into the initial system4041 the rta later renamed sound transit approved the tunnel as part of the route of its initial light rail line in 199942 ownership of the tunnel including its stations was transferred to sound transit in 2000 but returned two years later to king county metro under a jointoperations agreement4344 the downtown transit tunnel closed on september 23 2005 for a twoyear 827 million renovation to accommodate light rail vehicles the renovation included the installation of new rails a lowered roadbed at stations for level boarding new signalling systems and emergency ventilation4546 the tunnel reopened on september 24 200747 and link light rail service began on july 18 2009 from westlake station to tukwila international boulevard station4849 in 2019 the downtown transit tunnel is planned to lose its bus service due to construction at convention place station the tunnel will become served exclusively by light rail trains which will include expanded service to northgate in 20215051 namingedit university street station is named after university street itself named for the original campus of the university of washington before it moved in 18953 metro discussed renaming the station for the seattle art museum after it moved to the area in 1991 but took no action52 in 2012 sound transit adopted names for light rail stations in the university district near the current university of washington campus including university of washington and u district stations53 the similarity between the three stations names has led to public confusion and calls to rename university street station after benaroya hall or the seattle symphony5455 station layoutedit street level exitsentrances mezzanine ticket

steel light fixtures over the platforms glass railings on the mezzanines and colorful granite to highlight platform benches and information signs256 the station has two side platforms located below two mezzanines at the north and south ends of the station box the north mezzanine is accessible through the parking garage of the cobb building at 3rd avenue and seneca street as well as the west side of benaroya hall at 2nd avenue and university street connected through a level walkway underneath the venue the south mezzanine is accessible from a single entrance located in 1201 third avenue near

tunnel a centuryold rail tunnel which passes under with a clearance of approximately 15 feet 46 m58 both tunnels factored into the architecture of nearby benaroya hall which has an auditorium that rests on rubber bearings to insulate from vibrations and a 6footthick 18 m concrete slab to minimize sound38 artedit university street station like other stations in the downtown transit tunnel is furnished with several pieces of public art that is integrated into its design by architect mark spitzer and lead artist vicki scuri56 the beltline designed by scuri runs along the platform and consists of colored granite arranged in patterns that highlight passenger amenities including information panels and benches the benches themselves have computergenerated dot matrix patterns sandblasted into the seats5659 some of the granite originally purchased for use in the beltline originated in south africa then under a metrosanctioned boycott over its apartheid policies the discovery fueled a minor scandal that resulted in the resignation of metros executive director while the granite would be replaced with another type60 at the south mezzanine is robert teeples the southern lights a series of fourteen led screens that show animated symbols and phrases in a commentary on the increasing influence of computers in human life the symbols range from human faces to animals and astrological signs59 the phrases displayed in both english and spanish are randomly generated from using sets of four words that allow for 12 million possible combinations3256 the north mezzanine has the northern lights by bill bell a series of 24 embedded lights that form patterns when the eyes of viewers move rapidly from side to side the patterns include images related to transportation and finance including trolleys airplanes coins and the dollar sign5659 two of the stations entrances and stairways are home to the silhouettes of and sentencelong quotes from ah albertson architect of the nearby seattle tower and humanitarian activist flo ware256 at the corner of 3rd avenue and university street is a 14foottall 43 m pendulum clock known as hickorydickory dock clock designed by heather ramsay with references to the nursery rhyme hickory dickory dock including a brass mouse running up its side56 the benaroya hall entrance to university street station built in 1998 for the new venue is decorated with a series of art pieces by erin shie palmer known collectively as the temple of music61 the walkways walls are sandblasted with images that begin as an abstract musical score derived from robert fludds temple of music and morph into pixellated patterns as it approaches the station mezzanine the walkways handrails are etched with braille text and voiceprints and end in sculpted depictions of a violin and a microphone5662 the stations pictogram a pair of theater spectacles represents the neighborhoods connections to the arts it was created in 2009 by christian french as part of the stellar connections series and its points represent nearby destinations including benaroya hall the seattle art museum the central library and the 5th avenue
