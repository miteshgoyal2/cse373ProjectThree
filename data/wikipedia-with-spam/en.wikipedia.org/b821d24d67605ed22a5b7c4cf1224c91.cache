initial port of the x window system to mac os x server and working to improve the opengl drivers for linux through the utah glx project carmack released the source code for wolfenstein 3d in 1995 and the doom source code in 1997 when the source code to quake was leaked and circulated among the quake community underground in 1996 a programmer unaffiliated with id software used it to port quake to linux and subsequently sent the patches to carmack instead of pursuing legal action id software at carmacks behest used the patches as the foundation for a companysanctioned linux portcitation needed id software has since publicly released the source code to quake quake 2 quake 3 and lastly doom 3 including later the bfg edition all under the gnu general public license gpl the doom source code was also rereleased under the gpl in 1999 the id tech 4 engine more commonly known as the doom 3 engine has also been released as open source under the gpl18 the source code for hovertank 3d and catacomb 3d as well as carmacks earlier catacomb was released in june 2014 by flat rock software with carmacks blessing19 on the other hand carmack has several times over the years voiced a skeptical opinion

in 2006 previously a plan an active twitter account and also occasionally posts comments to slashdot as a game developer carmack differs from many of his contemporaries by avoiding commitment to a
