council has been a primary partner of the palestine festival of literature since the festivals beginning in 2008 in 2009 the israeli police acting on a court order closed down the venue scheduled to host the festivals closing event since there was palestinian authority involvement but the british council stepped in and the evening was relocated to its grounds38 the british council supports the festival also known as palfest a controversial issue arose in 2012 because palfests website states that they endorse the 2004 palestinian call for the academic and cultural boycott of israel susanna nicklin the councils director of literature said in response the british council is a nonpolitical organisation and we believe that international cultural exchange makes a powerful contribution to a more peaceful tolerant and prosperous world therefore the british council does not support cultural or academic boycotts39 dissident chinese writersedit in april 2012 british council faced a storm of protest over the exclusion of dissident chinese writers from the london book fair in 2012 critics included english pen and journalist nick cohen writing in the observer – as well as alastair niven a

and southern asia this will largely be funded by cuts in other services libraries and office closures across europecitation neededneeds update in june 2007 mps were told of further closures in tel aviv and east jerusalem where there had been a british council library since 1946 the british council libraries in athens43 and in belgrade44 are also to close similarly in india the british council libraries at bhopal and trivandrum were closed despite protests from library users as part of the councils policy to reduce its physical presence in the country and to divert funds to mega projects in the fields of culture education science and research45 british council libraries and offices have also been closed in a number of other countries judged by the british council to be of little strategic or commercial importance as it refocused its activities on china and the persian gulf areacitation needed council offices were closed in lesotho swaziland ecuador and provincial länder in germany in 2000–2001 – as well as belarus – prompting parliamentary criticism subsequent promises by british council chair neil kinnock to a conference in edinburgh46 that the belarus closure would hopefully prove to be just a temporary withdrawal proved illusory the british council office in peru also closed in september 2006 as part of a rethink of its strategy in latin america in italy british council closed its offices in turin and bologna and reduced the size of offices in milan and rome with the closure of the library in the latter47 charles arnoldbaker author of the companion to british history said of the british councils shift in priorities this whole policy is misconstrued from top to bottom we are going somewhere where we cant succeed and neglecting our friends in europe who wish us well the only people who are going to read our books in beirut or baghdad are converts already48 the article also points out that the alliance française and the goetheinstitut unlike the british council are both expanding and replenishing libraries europewide france opened its new library in tel aviv in 2007 – just a few months after the british council closed there and shut down the british council library in west jerusalem49 in gaza the institut français supports the gaza municipal library in partnership with the local authority and a municipal twinning link between gaza city

more visible presence in glasgow than the british council53 there is now in contrast only one british council office left in germany – and that is in berlin54 accountabilityedit formally it is to its sponsoring department the foreign and commonwealth office that the uk parliamentary table office refers any parliamentary questions about the british council55 the effectiveness of british council efforts to promote higher education in china was examined in the uk by the house of commons select committee on education and skills in a report issued in august 200756 it expressed concern that in terms of joint educational programmes involving chinese universities the uk lagged behind australia usa hong kong canada and france in its evidence to this committee the british council had argued that uk degrees are highly valued by international students for their global recognition international students adopt an essentially utilitarian view of higher education which is likely to increasingly involve consideration of value for money including opting for programmes at least partly delivered offshore as their preferred marketing model the british council gave the example of india where their uk india education and research initiative57 is being championed by british multinational oil companies such as bp and shell the pharmaceutical giant gsk and arms company bae systems58 criticism of british council marketing efforts in this area have also come from scotland where the sunday herald obtained documents under the freedom of information act showing that the british councils marketing coordinator in the usa had been referring to the university of stirling as the university of sterling sic and also documenting tensions between scottish executive civil servants and british council in india and china over overseas promotion of universities in scotland where education is a devolved responsibility the sunday herald reported that these turf wars were undermining the scottish executives key fresh talent policy59 some of the activities of the british council were examined in 200708 by the national audit office nao the naos report the british council achieving impact concluded that the british council’s performance is strong and valued by its customers and stakeholders60 it also concluded however that its english classes are elitist and have unfair advantages over commercial providers as well as questioning thousands of unanswered phonecalls and emails to british council offices61 as part of its examination of the foreign and commonwealth office annual report the foreign affairs committee spends an hour each year examining witnesses from the british council but even this level of scrutiny is undermined by a commons ruling exempting mps from the requirement to declare overseas trips paid for by the british council36 two members of the public accounts committee nigel griffiths mp and ian davidson mp were officebearers in the british council associate parliamentary group62 nigel griffiths mp was vicechair of this british council lobby group until stepping down as an mp following a sex scandal on house of commons premises being exposed by a sunday newspaper63 in 2008 the british council was called before the public accounts committee pac following earlier publication of a national audit office report the subsequent pac report confirmed that nigel griffiths mp – vice chair of the british council associate parliamentary group – was part of the small number of pac members who approved this report on the british council despite not having been recorded as being present during the evidence session – in june 2008 – where the british councils chief executive was crossexamined64 mr griffiths had earlier travelled to russia and spoke favourably of british council activities there in january 1998 around the time that their man in st petersburg stephen kinnock was expelled61656667 in april 2009 the british council was told to clean up its act by the information commissioner after losing staff data that included details of their trade union affiliations and lying about the encryption status of the computer disc lost68 following the accusations made against the british council in russia see above trevor royle the experienced diplomatic editor of the sunday herald quoted a british diplomatic source admitting there is a widespread assumption that the british council is a wing of our secret intelligence services however minor officially it is no such thing but there are connections why should it be otherwise because all information is invaluable after all the british council also deals with trade missions and inevitably that involves lowgrade intelligencegathering69 in 2005 along with the alliance française the società dante alighieri the goetheinstitut the instituto cervantes and the instituto camões the british council shared in the prince of asturias award for the outstanding achievements of western europes national cultural agencies in communications and the humanities at the time of this joint award the full extent of the british councils closure policies in europe was not yet public knowledge in literatureedit royle also goes on to note that the novel the russia house by john le carré former consular official david cornwell opens with a reference to the british council the organisations first ever audio fair for the teaching of the english language and the spread of british culture is grinding to its excruciating end and one of its officials is packing away his stuff when he is approached by an attractive russian woman to undertake clandestine delivery of a manuscript which she claims is a novel to an english publisher who she says is her friend69 it is also featured in one of the scenes in graham greenes the third man – the character crabbin played by wilfrid hydewhite in the film worked for the british council in 1946 the writer george orwell advised serious authors not to work for it as a dayjob arguing that the effort of writing is too much to make if one has already squandered ones energies on semicreative work such as teaching broadcasting or composing propaganda for bodies such as the british council70 in her autobiography dame stella rimington the first woman head of mi5 mentions working for british council in india prior to joining the british intelligence servicescitation needed the british council has been referred to and its man onstation goole – frequently in a humorous way by lawrence durrell in his collection of

years of world war two burmaedit the role of british council in burma in 1947 came under scrutiny with release of classified documents to a bbc investigation by journalist feargal keane into the role of dissident british colonial officials in the assassination of the then burmese independence leader aung san father of aung san su kyi72 the bbc programme quoted from a 1948 document sent by the chief of police in rangoon to the british ambassador stating their belief that there had been british involvement in the assassination of aung san and his cabinet for which one of his political opponents was hanged and that the gobetween had been a british council official named in the programme libyaedit in august 2011 a journalist from the irish times discovered a certificate dated 2007
