background and writingedit for the duet ballad i just cant stop loving you michael jackson wanted to share vocals with barbra streisand or whitney houston both singers took a pass on the invitation3 the coduet duties were given to siedah garrett who had previously dueted on former temptations member dennis edwards dont look any further garrett first came to the attention of producer quincy jones after auditioning for and winning a spot in the group deco she later signed as a recording artist with jones warner brosdistributed qwest records3 the singer was constantly sent song demos including one for i just cant stop loving you though she didnt know that the demo was a song written and sung by jackson while reporting for a recording session garrett thought that she was summoned to do overdubs for a song shed cowritten titled man in the mirror instead she was surprised to learn that shed been chosen to sing a duet with jackson3 to some the wispy ballad was reminiscent of jacksons motown classic got to be there3 the original album version of the song opened with jackson cooing a tremulous spoken intro backed by a longer version of the opening music according to jackson he recorded that part of his song while lying in bed the intro went in part i just want to lay next to you for awhile you look so beautiful tonight a lot of people misunderstand me thats because they dont know me at all i just want to touch you and hold you4 this intro was mixed out on the 7 single on future releases of bad and on most compilation albums an alternate version of the single featuring the original mastered album version mix with the spoken word intro for i just cant stop loving you backed by the album outtake dont be messin round was released in select walmart stores in 2012 to mark the release of bad 25 critical receptionedit i just cant stop loving you received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics sputnikmusics staff gave to the song 4 out of 5 stars writing its not one the most fondly remembered songs on the album but ive come to appreciate it more as i listen to it especially the instrumentation at the start its a nice song really the lyrics are a bit soppy but still it adds something different to the album and the vocals are top notch5 richard cromelin from los angeles times was negative with the song and particularly the spoken word opening writing the soliloquy is meant to be revealing tender and vulnerable but with his quivering timbre and the haunting music behind it comes off a little creepy like norman bates gearing up for psycho iv4 davitt sigerson from rolling stone wrote a review about the song commenting churls may bemoan i just cant stop loving you jacksons duet with the often indistinguishable siedah garrett as a second unworthy entry without descending to musical mccarthyism and questioning the honor of anyone who can fault a record with both finger snaps and timpani it need only be asked who having heard the song at least twice can fail to remember that chorus6 chart performanceedit i just cant stop loving you was the lead single from jacksons muchanticipated bad album the single debuted on the us billboard hot 100 singles chart at 37 the week of august 8 1987 the single was the highest debuting single of 1987 and quickly traveled to the top quarter of the hot 100 advancing to 16 in its second week and soaring to 1 in its seventh week on the tally the week of september 19 1987 however due to the album title tracks quick release as a single it debuted on the hot 100 at 40 in the same week that i just

ranked it as 43 on the yearend hot 100 chart for 1987 the track spent three weeks at number one on billboards adult contemporary singles chart becoming only the second michael jackson single to top
