racial tension student population assignments and administrative scandal such incidences include a student boycott in 1966 and using racial tiebreakers which led to a 2007 supreme court casecitation needed early schoolsedit when the university of washington was founded as the territorial university in 1861 its initial class offerings were not at a level that would now be considered those of a college or university its first class offering was a primary school elementary school taught by asa mercer and for some years it was jointly supervised by the newly formed seattle school board its own board of regents it functioned as seattles first public school9 in 1867 the public school moved to what was then the county building on third avenue between james and jefferson the site of todays prefontaine fountain a year later the school moved to yeslers pavilion later yeslers hall at presentday first and cherry a year later the school moved again to a temporary building called bacons hall after its first teacher carrie bacon located at the site of the present king county court house in 1870 the first permanent school building the central school opened on third avenue between madison and spring streets it originally had two classrooms a third was built in its attic in 188110 meanwhile in 1873 the tworoom north school opened at third and pine11 and in 1875 the school district had purchased 14 acres 5700 m2 at 6th and madison where the sixth street school also known as eastern school opened promptly in a temporary building and grew into successively larger and betterbuilt buildings in 1877 and 1883 the latter an elegant wooden building with an imposing french mansard roof clock tower and tall central belfry superseded the old central school as well as the north school from 1884 it was known as the central school classes extended through 12th grade and the first class graduated from 12th grade in 1886 however the school burned in 188812 the district had in this period started a number of other schools including the even more imposing denny school on battery street between 5th and 6th avenues in belltown opened 1884 described as an architectural jewel the finest schoolhouse on the west coast it was demolished in 1928 as part of the denny regrade project13 when the central school burned in 1888 its high school and first grade classes were parcelled out to the denny school12 other classes to the former downtown building of the university9 with other classes going to temporary facilities some of which also burned in the great seattle fire12 a new brick central school opened in 1889 at seventh and madison and was repeatedly expanded with annexes and extensions after a separate high school opened in 1902 the central school was briefly known in 1903 as the washington school before returning to its older name the central school functioned as an elementary school until 1938 and then until 1949 as the central branch of the edison technical school the building was fatally damaged by the 1949 earthquake and razed in 1953 its site is now under interstate 512 20th centuryedit in 1919 there were 64 grammar schools six high schools two parental schools comparable to todays youth detention centers a school for the deaf and nine special schools for pupils who do not progress normally in regular classes1415 in the early 20th century seattle public schools were exemplary16 under the leadership 1901–1922 of superintendent frank b cooper and a series of civicminded progressives who served on the seattle school board16 21st centuryedit in 2005 it was revealed that a teacher at broadviewthomson elementary had been serially molesting children at the school for a period spanning several years the teacher laurence e shayne hill had been molesting children for at least four of the twelve years he worked at the school according to the seattle weekly17 the article also said that several school officials had known of the inappropriate touching and did nothing to stop it drawing outrage from concerned parents hill is serving his sentence as of 120205 and is facing anywhere from five years to life in june 2006 andrew j coulson of the cato institute wrote a column in the seattle post intelligencer taking the district to task for a page on equity and race relations on its website that indicated in his words that only whites can be racist in america and which among other things stated that emphasizing individualism as opposed to a more collective ideology and that this and preferring a future time orientation were forms of cultural racism18 the page19 was removed from the site the same day20 in june 2007 the united states supreme court decided the case of parents involved in community schools v seattle school district no 1 where they rejected seattle public schools longstanding use of racial tiebreakers in assigning students to schools the decision prohibited assigning students to public schools solely for the purpose of achieving racial integration and declined to recognize racial balancing as a compelling state interest in a fragmented opinion delivered by chief justice john roberts five justices held that the school boards did not present any compelling state interest that would justify the assignment of school seats on the basis of race chief justice roberts wrote that the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race associate justice anthony kennedy filed a concurrence that presented a more narrow interpretation stating that schools may use race conscious means to achieve diversity in schools but that the schools at issue in this case did not use a sufficient narrow tailoring of their plans to sustain their goals four justices dissented from the courts conclusions2122 in january 2013 the entire teaching body of garfield high school refused to administer the standardized measures of academic progress or map which is administered systemwide three times per year the teachers called the tests useless and a waste of instructional time23 the american federation of teachers has endorsed the schools boycott of the tests24 garfields boycott of the test quickly expanded to other seattle schools and drew national attention in may 2013 superintendent jose banda announced that the seattle school district will no longer require map tests at city high schools25 historic architectureedit several former seattle public schools buildings are on the national register of historic places nrhp broadway high school
