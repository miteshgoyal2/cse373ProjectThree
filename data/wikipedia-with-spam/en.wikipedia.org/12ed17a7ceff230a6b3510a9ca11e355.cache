the park itself occupies all of bailey peninsula a prominent forested peninsula that juts into lake washington the attached map is accurate broadly speaking in capturing greater seward park though real estate sites such as zillow will refer to the part of the neighborhood north of orcas street as lakewood which is reasonable since that neighborhood is the historic home of a community club which owns its own house and land once known as the lakewood community club built on or around the 1920s and now known as the lakewoodseward community club contents 1 neighborhood 2 environment 3

forest providing a glimpse of what some of the lake shore looked like before the growth of the city of seattle with trees older than 250 years the seward park forest is relatively young the forests of seattle before the city were fully mature up to 1000–2000 years old23 still there is no other forest within the city limits like seward parks you can wander trails where all you can see are towering softwoods mostly douglas firs but with other species present as well including western hemlock pacific madrona and alaskan cedar the park offers at least five distinct experiences which are further described under the entry for the park itself one of the earliest settlers e a clark was influential in the life of cheshiahud a young man at the time the mid1850s4 seward park is built on what may be one of the highest residential hills in seattle the hill is mounted by graham street earning it the name graham hillcitation needed in a series of annexations the neighborhood joined the town of southeast seattle which then joined the city of seattle in 19075 demographicsedit congregation bikur cholim machzikay hadath around a quarter of the residents are african american and another quarter
