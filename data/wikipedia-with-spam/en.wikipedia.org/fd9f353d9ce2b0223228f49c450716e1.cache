of energy to generate electricity or heat a photovoltaic pv module is a packaged connect assembly of typically 6x10 photovoltaic solar cells photovoltaic modules constitute the photovoltaic array of a photovoltaic system that generates and supplies solar electricity in commercial and residential applications each module is rated by its dc output power under standard test conditions stc and typically ranges from 100 to 365 watts w the efficiency of a module determines the area of a module given the same rated output – an 8 efficient 230 w module will have twice the area of a 16 efficient 230 w module there are a few commercially available solar modules that exceed efficiency of 221 and reportedly also exceeding 2423 a single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power most installations contain multiple modules a photovoltaic system typically includes an array of photovoltaic modules an inverter a battery pack for storage interconnection wiring and optionally a solar tracking mechanism the most common application of solar panels is solar water heating systems4 the price of solar power has continued to fall so that in many countries it is cheaper than ordinary

cell from a solar cell to a pv system photovoltaic modules use light energy photons from the sun to generate electricity through the photovoltaic effect the majority of modules use waferbased crystalline silicon cells or thinfilm cells the structural load carrying member of a module can either be the top layer or the back layer cells must also be protected from mechanical damage and moisture most modules are rigid but semiflexible ones are available based on thinfilm cells the cells must be connected electrically in series one to another externally most of photovoltaic modules use mc4 connectors type to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system modules electrical connections are made in series to achieve a desired output voltage andor in parallel to provide a desired current capability the conducting wires that take the current off the modules may contain silver copper or other nonmagnetic conductive transition metals bypass diodes may be incorporated or used externally in case of partial module shading to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated some special solar pv modules include concentrators in which light is focused by lenses or mirrors onto smaller cells this enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area such as gallium arsenide in a costeffective way efficienciesedit see also solar cell efficiency reported timeline of solar cell energy conversion efficiencies since 1976 national renewable energy laboratory depending on construction photovoltaic modules can produce electricity from a range of frequencies of light but usually cannot cover the entire solar range specifically ultraviolet infrared and low or diffused light hence much of the incident sunlight energy is wasted by solar modules and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with monochromatic light therefore another design concept is to split the light into different wavelength ranges and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those rangescitation needed this has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50 scientists from spectrolab a subsidiary of boeing have reported development of multijunction solar cells with an efficiency of more than 40 a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells6 the spectrolab scientists also predict that concentrator solar cells could achieve efficiencies of more than 45 or even 50 in the future with theoretical efficiencies being about 58 in cells with more than three junctions currently the best achieved sunlight conversion rate solar module efficiency is around 215 in new commercial products7 typically lower than the efficiencies of their cells in isolation the most efficient massproduced solar modulesdisputed – discuss have power density values of up to 175 wm2 1622 wft28 research by imperial college london has shown that the efficiency of a solar panel can be improved by studding the lightreceiving semiconductor surface with aluminum nanocylinders similar to the ridges on lego blocks the scattered light then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor which means that more photons can be absorbed and converted into current although these nanocylinders have been used previously aluminum was preceded by gold and silver the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface this the research argued could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver the research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without compromising power conversion efficiencies thus reducing material consumption9 efficiencies of solar panel can be calculated by mpp maximum power point value of solar panels solar inverters convert the dc power to ac power by performing mppt process solar inverter samples the output power iv curve from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance load to solar cells to obtain maximum power mpp maximum power point of the solar panel consists of mpp voltage v mpp and mpp current i mpp it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher mpp microinverted solar panels are wired in parallel which produces more output than normal panels which are wired in series with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel this is known as the christmas light effect microinverters work independently so each panel contributes its maximum possible output given the available sunlight10 technologyedit main articles crystalline silicon and thin film solar cell marketshare of pv technologies since 1990 most solar modules are currently produced from crystalline silicon csi solar cells made of multicrystalline and monocrystalline silicon in 2013 crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide pv production while the rest of the overall market is made up of thinfilm technologies using cadmium telluride cigs and amorphous silicon11 emerging third generation solar technologies use advanced thinfilm cells they produce a relatively highefficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies also highcost highefficiency and closepacked rectangular multijunction mj cells are preferably used in solar panels on spacecraft as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space mjcells are compound semiconductors and made of gallium arsenide gaas and other semiconductor materials another emerging pv technology using mjcells is concentrator photovoltaics cpv thin filmedit in rigid thinfilm modules the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line the cell is created on a glass substrate or superstrate and the electrical connections are created in situ a socalled monolithic integration the substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back sheet usually another sheet of glass the main cell technologies in this category are cdte or asi or asiucsi tandem or cigs or variant amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6–12 flexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the photoactive layer and other necessary layers on a flexible substrate if the substrate is an insulator eg polyester or polyimide film then monolithic integration can be used if it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used the cells are assembled into modules by laminating them to a transparent colourless fluoropolymer on the front side typically etfe or fep and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side smart solar modulesedit main articles smart module and solar microinverter several companies have begun embedding electronics into pv modules this enables performing maximum power point tracking mppt for each module individually and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level some of these solutions make use of power optimizers a dctodc converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems as of about 2010 such electronics can also compensate for shading effects wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero performance and degradationedit this section possibly contains original research

efficiency nominal voltage 12refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries the actual voltage output of the module changes as lighting temperature and load conditions change so there is never one specific voltage at which the module operates nominal voltage allows users at a glance to make sure the module is compatible with a given system open circuit voltage or voc is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system voc can be measured with a voltmeter directly on an illuminated modules terminals or on its disconnected cable the peak power rating wp is the maximum output under standard test conditions not the maximum possible output typical modules which could measure approximately 1 m × 2 m or 3 ft 3 in × 6 ft 7 in will be rated from as low as 75 w to as high as 350 w depending on their efficiency at the time of testing the test modules are binned according to their test results and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 w increments and either rate them at 3 5 30 or 5013141516 solar water heater the ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain hail heavy snow load and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer many crystalline silicon module manufacturers offer a limited warranty that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90 of rated power output and 25 years at 8017 installations intended to withstand extreme environments like large hail or heavy snow will require extra protection in the form of steep installations sturdy framing and stronger glazing18 potential induced degradation also called pid is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules caused by socalled stray currents 19this effect may cause power loss of up to 3020 the largest challenge for photovoltaic technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced new materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance the problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of doping the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons21 chemicals such as boron ptype are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor bands22 in doing so the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 112 ev to 005 ev since the potential difference eb is so low the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures this allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons solar power allows for greater efficiency than heat such as the generation of energy in heat engines the drawback with heat is that most of the heat created is lost to the surroundings thermal efficiency is as defined η t h ≡ w o u t q i n 1 − q o u t q i n displaystyle eta thequiv frac woutqin1frac qoutqin due to the inherent irreversibility of heat production for useful work efficiency levels are decreased on the other hand with solar panels there isnt a requirement to retain any heat and there are no drawbacks such as friction maintenanceedit solar panel conversion efficiency typically in the 20 range is reduced by dust grime pollen and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel a dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30 in high dustpollen or desert areas says seamus curran associate professor of physics at the university of houston and director of the institute for nanoenergy which specializes in the design engineering and assembly of nanostructures23 paying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment researchers found panels that had not been cleaned or rained on for 145 days during a summer drought in california lost only 74 of their efficiency overall for a typical residential solar system of 5 kw washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere 20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends—in about 2 ½ months for larger commercial rooftop systems the financial losses are bigger but still rarely enough to warrant the cost of washing the panels on average panels lost a little less than 005 of their overall efficiency per day24 recyclingedit most parts of a solar module can be recycled including up to 95 of certain semiconductor materials or the glass as well as large amounts of ferrous and nonferrous metals25 some private companies and nonprofit organizations are currently engaged in takeback and recycling operations for endoflife modules26 recycling possibilities depend on the kind of technology used in the modules silicon based modules aluminum frames and junction boxes are dismantled manually at the beginning of the process the module is then crushed in a mill and the different fractions are separated glass plastics and metals27 it is possible to recover more than 80 of the incoming weight28 this process can be performed by flat glass recyclers since morphology and composition of a pv module is similar to those flat glasses used in the building and automotive industry the recovered glass for example is readily accepted by the glass foam and glass insulation industry nonsilicon based modules they require specific recycling technologies such as the use of chemical baths in order to separate the different semiconductor materials29 for cadmium telluride modules the recycling process begins by crushing the module and subsequently separating the different fractions this recycling process is designed to recover up to 90 of the glass and 95 of the semiconductor materials contained30 some commercialscale recycling facilities have been created in recent years by private companies31 since 2010 there is an annual european conference bringing together manufacturers recyclers and researchers to look at the future of pv module recycling3233 productionedit see also list of photovoltaics

panels41 average pricing information divides in three pricing categories those buying small quantities modules of all sizes in the kilowatt range annually midrange buyers typically up to 10 mwp annually and large quantity buyers selfexplanatory—and with access to the lowest prices over the long term there is clearly a systematic reduction in the price of cells and modules for example in 2012 it was estimated that the quantity cost per watt was about us060 which was 250 times lower than the cost in 1970 of us1504243 a 2015 study shows pricekwh dropping by 10 per year since 1980 and predicts that solar could contribute 20 of total electricity consumption by 2030 whereas the international energy agency predicts 16 by 205044 real world energy production costs depend a great deal on local weather conditions in a cloudy country such as the united kingdom the cost per produced kwh is higher than in sunnier countries like spain following to rmi balanceofsystem bos elements this is nonmodule cost of nonmicroinverter solar modules as wiring converters racking systems and various components make up about half of the total costs of installations for merchant solar power stations where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network the cost of solar energy will need to match the wholesale electricity price this point is sometimes called wholesale grid parity or busbar parity5 some photovoltaic systems such as rooftop installations can supply power directly to an electricity user in these cases the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price at which the user pays for his electricity consumption this situation is sometimes called retail grid parity socket parity or dynamic grid parity45 research carried out by unenergy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices such as italy spain and australia and areas using diesel generators have reached retail grid parity5 mounting and
