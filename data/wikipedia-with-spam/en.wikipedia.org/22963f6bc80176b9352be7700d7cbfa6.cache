player records 51 career goals 52 season scoring leaders 6 references 7 external links formatedit the competition is a singleelimination tournament that has been contested by 80 teams since the 2014 edition this pool consists of the 38 american clubs in the three professional leagues which are major league soccer the north american soccer league and the united soccer league formerly usl pro as well as 42 amateur teams from the premier development league national premier soccer league the united states adult soccer association and us club soccer6 the first three rounds consisting of amateur and lowerleague teams are played during consecutive weekdays in may with amateur teams advancing to face usl and nasl clubs in geographical pairings in the third round the winner of each match progresses to the next round and the loser is eliminated from the tournament mls clubs enter play in the fourth round matched geographically with the winners of the third round to play on a date in

semifinal round in august and a final match to determine the champion in september every match including the final is a onelegged tie that lasts 90 minutes plus any additional stoppage time if no clear winner has been determined after 90 minutes of normal time 30 minutes of extra time is played if the score is still level after extra time then the winner is decided by a penalty shootout6 qualificationedit through the 2011 edition eight teams from each level of the american soccer pyramid took part in the competition proper with each league narrowing its delegation separately in the spring before the competition officially began in the summer in some cases additional teams played in qualifying rounds to gain entry one example was found with mls clubs as only the top six from the previous regular season received automatic bids while the bottom usbased mls teams faced each other to qualify for the remaining two mls slots beginning in 2012 the competition was expanded from its previous 40 teams to 64 with the qualifying process radically changed the national premier soccer league received six places plus the possibility of a seventh in a playoff against a team from the amateur us club soccer setup nine clubs from the usasa earned places as did 16 usl premier development league teams each of these organizations has its own qualifying process to determine its entrants these 32 teams competed in the first round of the cup with the winners meeting all 16 usl pro and nasl teams in the second round the 16 usbased mls teams entered in the third round in 2013 the competition was expanded to 68 teams all us based division i ii and iii teams participated in the tournament proper 16 from major league soccer six from the north american soccer league and 12 from usl pro the remaining 34 spots in the tournament field were filled by amateur teams from the adult council category–16 from the premier development league eight from us adult soccer association regional qualifying eight from the national premier soccer league one from us club soccer and one from the united states specialty sports association the process for determining the site for the open cup tournament semifinals and final was changed in 2013 in past years the sites for the final three matches of the tournament had been determined through a sealedbid process but in 2013 the hosts of those games were determined by a coin flip home teams throughout the entire tournament were determined by random selection2 since 2008 the champion of the us open cup has earned the right to play in the concacaf champions league the first team to represent the us as open cup champion was 2007s winner new england revolution3 starting in 2016 lowerdivision professional clubs owned by higherdivision professional clubs are no longer eligible to participate in the us open cup this serves to remove the mls reserve clubs in usl from the 2016 competition after issues of clubs holding back players from their usl sides in 2015 in order to keep them eligible to play for the parent mls club players are only allowed to play for one club in any us open cup season7 amateur clubs remain eligible to enter even if they are owned by professional clubs initially hybrid affiliate clubs—ie lowerdivision professional clubs that are staffed but not owned by higherdivision clubs—also remained eligible but those clubs were also banned effective with the 2016 competition this last change was proposed by the houston dynamo which were the senior club to rio grande valley fc toros in the first such arrangement in the us game8 historyedit main article history of the us open cup the sir thomas dewar cup the competition dates back to 191314 when it was known as the national challenge cup in 1999 us soccer honored one of american soccers most important patrons lamar hunt by changing the official title of the tournament to the lamar hunt us open cup the winners of the tournament were awarded the dewar cup donated by sir thomas dewar for the promotion of soccer in the united states in 1912 until it was retired due to poor condition in 1979 it was brought back into use by the united states adult soccer association in 1997 but is now back on permanent display at the national soccer hall of fame in oneonta new york and the recent winners of the tournament have been awarded a new different trophy despite this the name of each winning club is still added to the base of the original dewar cup trophy awarded to the rochester rhinos in 1999 the national challenge cup was the first truly national cup competition in the united states as previous cups had been effectively relegated to regional status by the difficulties in coordination and travel caused by the size of the united states in the early 1900s while us soccer had initially administered the competition in 1985 they handed over management to the usasa in 1995 us soccer resumed its administration of the competition9 maccabi los angeles of california and bethlehem steel of pennsylvania have both won the cup a record five times while greek american aa of new york and seattle sounders fc are tied for the record for most consecutive cup victories at three most of these records are likely to fall over time now that major league soccer offers a fully professional league and its teams typically dominate the competition the old nasl did not participate in the open cup10 since mls debut in 1996 mls clubs have won the cup in all but one of those years the rochester rhinos of the 2nd division aleague were surprise winners in 1999 defeating four mls clubs including the colorado rapids 2–0 in the championship match the first professional team to win in the modern era were the richmond kickers of the usisl the predecessor to the aleague later known as the usl first division usl pro and now as the united soccer league in 1995 one year before the start of mls dc united were the first mls team to win in 1996 hostingedit us soccer uses a simple coin toss to decide which team hosts each match all the way through the final11 up until the 2011 us open cup us soccer had used sealed bids to award home matches12 which resulted in certain clubs outbidding other teams from 2007 to 2011 mls side dc united hosted 17 straight matches including two finals and from 2008–2010 mls side seattle sounders fc hosted 11 of
