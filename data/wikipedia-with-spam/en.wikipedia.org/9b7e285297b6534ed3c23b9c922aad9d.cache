convention as of 2017update where the partys nominee was not decided before the primary process concluded oversized circular logo mounted on foam used for the 1976 republican national convention situation at the opening of the conventionedit going into the convention ford had won more primary delegates than reagan as well as a plurality in popular vote however ford did not have enough to secure the nomination and as the convention opened both candidates were seen as having a chance to win because of this both ford and reagan arrived in kansas city before the convention opened to woo the remaining uncommitted delegates in an effort to secure the nomination reagan benefited from his highly committed delegates notably reagans raiders of the texas delegation they and other conservative western and southern delegates particularly faulted the ford administrations foreign policy of détente towards the soviet union criticizing his signing of the helsinki accords and indirectly blaming him for the april 1975 fall of saigon the proreagan texas delegates worked hard to persuade delegates from other states to support reagan ford meanwhile used all of the perks and patronage of the presidency to win over wavering delegates including trips aboard air force one and personal meetings with ford himself white house chief of staff dick cheney proved to be an important figure in working to build support among those state delegations on the fence between ford and reagan including the mississippi delegation white house political advisor harry dent also played a central role in helping president ford work with the state delegations who met with ford and his aides in a presidential office set up onsite at the convention in kansas city headlines during the republican convention in kansas city hinted at the stillsimmering debates within the rankandfile of the republicans as to whether or not a new party might be formed out of the weaknesses of the republicans conservatives seek a new party if reagan loses the chicago tribunes wednesday august 18 1976 headlines told readers during the kansas city convention which quoted both white house aides as well as critics in the republican party who debated the possibility of a new party emerging out of that years division in the republican ranks newspaper headlines also told the story of the uncommitted delegates whose wavering at the convention made them the focus of both the ford and the reagan camps new stars stealing gop show the chicago tribunes wednesday august 18 1976 headlines told readers estimates ranged from 93 to as many as 115 delegates uncommitted at the time of the convention the largest block of uncommitted delegates were from mississippi and another block were from illinois delegation wednesday august 18 1976 saw the uncommitted delegates break on the 1st ballot for president gerald ford who won the nomination on the 1st roll call of delegates by a vote of 11871070 richard schweiker gambit and the search for an alternativeedit reagan had promised if nominated to name senator richard schweiker of pennsylvania as his running mate in a bid to attract liberals and centrists in the party this move backfired however as many conservatives such as senator jesse helms were infuriated by reagans choice of the liberal schweiker while few moderate delegates switched to reagan helms promptly began a movement to draft conservative senator james l buckley of new york as the presidential nominee platform and rules votesedit the key vote of the convention occurred when reagans managers proposed a rules change that would have required ford to publicly announce his running mate before the presidential balloting reagans managers hoped that when ford announced his choice for vicepresident it would anger one of the two factions of the party and thus help reagan fords supporters derisively described the proposed rules change as the misery loves company amendment1 the proposed rules change was defeated by a vote of 1180 to 1069 and ford gained the momentum he needed to win the nomination the balloting for president was still close however as ford won the nomination with 1187 votes to 1070 votes for reagan and one for elliot l richardson of massachusetts conservatives succeeded in inserting several key planks into the party platform some of which were implicitly critical of the presidents own policies2 reagan and north carolina senator jesse helms successfully had a moral foreign policy plank inserted in light of the 1973 roe v wade decision the 1976 republican platform became the first to advocate a human life amendment to the constitution nominationsedit both ford and reagans names were put into nomination reagan concedes

neglect the selection of a running mate especially with reagans schweiker ploy among the many people considered were representative john b anderson of illinois senator howard baker of tennessee

kansas senator robert j dole as his runningmate in preference to vice president nelson rockefeller rockefeller had announced that he did not wish to be a candidate for vice president in 1976 the previous fall in no small part because it was believed that rockefeller was too far to the left to be acceptable to the gop base some of the reagan delegates angry with the loss of their candidate decided to scatter their votes among over 30 people jesse helms name was put into nomination4 bob dole – 1921 8504 abstaining – 103 456 jesse helms – 103 456 ronald reagan – 27 120 phil crane – 23 102
