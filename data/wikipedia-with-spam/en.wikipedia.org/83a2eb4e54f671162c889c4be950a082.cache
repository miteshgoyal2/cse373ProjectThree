culture song popular culture or pop culture is the entirety of attitudes ideas images perspectives and other phenomena within the mainstream of a given culture especially western culture of the early to mid20th century and the emerging global mainstream of the late 20th and early 21st centurycitation needed heavily influenced by mass media this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of the society the most common pop culture categories are entertainment such as movies music television and video games sports news as in peopleplaces in news politics fashionclothes technology and slang1 popular culture has a way of influencing an individuals attitudes towards certain topics2 popular culture is sometimes viewed as being trivial and dumbed down in order to find consensual acceptance throughout the mainstream as a result it comes under heavy criticism from various nonmainstream sources most notably religious groups and countercultural groups which deem it superficial consumerist sensationalist or corrupt34567 contents 1 history and definitions 11 folklore 2 entertainment 21 television programs 22 music 3 sport 4 corporate branding 5 see also 6 notes 7 references 8 further reading 9 external links history and definitionsedit see also cultural history the term popular culture was coined in the 19th century or earlier8 traditionally popular culture was associated with poor education and the lower classes9 as opposed to the official culture and higher education of the upper classes1011 the stress in the distinction from official culture became more pronounced towards the end of the 19th century12need quotation to verify a usage that became established by the interbellum period13need quotation to verify from the end of world war ii following major cultural and social changes brought by mass media innovations the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with those of mass culture media culture image culture consumer culture and culture for mass consumption14 social and cultural changes in the united states were a pioneer in this with respect to other western countries the abbreviated form pop for popular as in pop music dates from the late 1950s15 although terms pop and popular are in some cases used interchangeably and their meaning partially overlap the term pop is narrower pop is specific of something containing qualities of mass appeal while popular refers to what has gained popularity regardless of its style1617 according to author john storey there are six definitions of popular culture18 the quantitative definition of culture has the problem that much high culture eg television dramatizations of jane austen is also popular pop culture is also defined as the culture that is left over when we have decided what high culture is however many works straddle the boundaries eg william shakespeare and charles dickens a third definition equates pop culture with mass culture and ideas this is seen as a commercial culture massproduced for mass consumption by mass media19 from a western european perspective this may be compared to american cultureclarification needed alternatively pop culture can be defined as an authentic culture of the people but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the peoplepage needed storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture neogramscian hegemony theory sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the resistance of subordinate groups in society and the forces of incorporation operating in the interests of dominant groups in society a postmodernist approach to popular culture would no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture storey claims that popular culture emerged from the urbanization of the industrial revolution studies of shakespeare by weimann barber or bristol for example locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in renaissance popular culture while contemporary practitioners like dario fo and john mcgrath use popular culture in its gramscian sense that includes ancient folk traditions the commedia dellarte for example2021need quotation to verify popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in place and time it forms currents and eddies and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways for example certain currents of pop culture may originate from or diverge into a subculture representing perspectives with which the mainstream popular culture has only limited familiarity items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the german researcher ronald daus who studies the impact of extraeuropean cultures in north america asia and especially in latin america folkloreedit adaptations based on traditional folklore provide a source of popular culture22 this early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today in a form separate from massproduced popular culture propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media eg in the form of jokes or urban legend with the widespread use of the internet from the 1990s the distinction between mass media and wordofmouth has become blurred although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subculture item sold moreover beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by wordofmouth and become modified in the process in the same manner that folklore evolves entertainmentedit television
