doing so in some traditions nothing is eaten until the first star appears in the evening sky in commemoration of the star of bethlehem the liturgical celebration begins earlier in the day with the celebration of the royal hours followed by the divine liturgy combined with the celebration of vespers during which a large number of passages from the old testament are chanted recounting the history of salvation after the dismissal at the end of the service a new candle is brought out into the center of the church and lit and all gather round and sing the troparion and kontakion of the feast in the evening the allnight vigil for the feast of the nativity is composed of great compline matins and the first hour the byzantine services of christmas eve are intentionally parallel to those of good friday illustrating the theological point that the purpose of the incarnation was to make possible the crucifixion and resurrection this is illustrated in eastern icons of the nativity on which the christ child is wrapped in swaddling clothes reminiscent of his burial wrappings the child is also shown lying on a stone representing the tomb of christ rather than a manger the cave of the nativity

born to which the one being greeted responds glorify him these are the opening words of the canon of the nativity that was chanted the night before during the vigil this greeting together with many of the hymns of the feast continue to be used until the leavetaking of the feast on 29 december the first three days of the feast are particularly solemn the second day is known as the synaxis of the theotokos and commemorates the role of the virgin mary in the nativity of jesus the third day is referred to simply as the third day of the nativity the saturday and sunday following 25 december have
