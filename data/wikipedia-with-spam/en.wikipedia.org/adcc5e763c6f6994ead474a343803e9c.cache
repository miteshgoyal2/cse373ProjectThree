corps of engineers approved the filling in of 25 acres of the wetlands to widen an access road in exchange for the creation of an additional 11 acres of new wetlands in a nearby area102 public records show no involvement of corker in the approval process103 in 2006 during corkers united states senate campaign against democrat harold ford jr a second lawsuit was filed by kurtz again represented by prochaska and the tennessee environmental council102 the lawsuit accused walmart of encroaching onto an adjacent protected nature area that was also held by a company owned by corker the suit alleged that corker did not fully disclose his interest in the property where the walmart was built or in the adjacent nature area at the time the deal was made the corker campaign countered that an article published on march 5 2003 in the chattanooga times free press publicly identified corkers ownership interest in the land through osborne enterprises and that as mayor a blind trust barred corker from being involved in issues like these that affected his business102103 on october 13 2006 lawyers involved in the case announced a settlement agreement details of the settlement were not announced but

appeal corker said that he thought the blind trust had worked very well and that he had sold most of his business holdings so that he could avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest in the senate106 volkswagenedit in 2014 corker a longtime opponent of unions in tennessee107 tried to influence a secretballot election of bluecollar workers at the chattanooga volkswagen plant whether to allow the united auto workers to represent them108 on the first day of the threeday election corker said that he had conversations and based on those am assured that should the workers vote against the uaw volkswagen will announce in the coming weeks that it will manufacture its new midsize suv here in chattanooga108 corkers public statement went counter to statements by volkswagen officials in the leadup to the vote that the outcome of the vote would not affect the determination of whether the suv would be made in chattanooga or at the puebla mexico plant108 national labor relations board expert kenneth g dauschmidt of indiana university bloomington said that corkers remarks were shocking and an attempt to intimidate workers into voting against uaw representation108 the uaw was dealt a
