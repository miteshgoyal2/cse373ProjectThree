technologies and aesthetics into more markets web applications and contexts including traditional institutions such as the library see google books library project1 the rapid rise of search media particularly google is part of new media history and draws attention to issue of access and to relationships between commercial interests and media2 contents 1 history of term 2 definition 3 development 4 criticisms of googlization 5 defense of googlization 6 see also 7 references 8 external links history of termedit in 2003 john battelle and alex salkever first introduced the term googlization to mean the dominance of google over nearly all forms of informational commerce on the web3 initially specializing in textbased internet searching google has expanded its services to include image searching webbased email online mapping video sharing news delivery instant messaging mobile phones and services aimed at the academic community google has entered partnerships with established media interests such as time warner aol news corporation the new york times and various news agencies such as associated press agence francepresse and the uk press association google has therefore become a giant with complex entanglements with traditional and new media2 definitionedit the term googlization is not universally accepted as a definition for this phenomenon according to harro haijboer googlization seems to be an undisputed term most of the time the term is taken for fact without critically investigating it “the term may be valid in current development but after a critical look at the history of search engines may not be as correctly formulated as one might think my main questions are if the term googlization is correct in a historical perspective if microsoft search engines msn live search and bing are googlized …or if google is microsoftized i suspected to find evidence that both search engines microsoft and google have had their influence onto each other there is no way of saying if googlization has fully taken place on microsoft search or that there has been a form of microsoftization on the part of google in this light the term googlization seems to be inappropriate and should be rethought of”4 many information professionals would define the term as ‘digitizing a library or making something into a google product’5 however the definition is constantly and rapidly changing googlization can also mean that ever increasing amounts of accessible information are available on the internet google makes it easy and convenient to find in one place however google only makes information which already exists more accessible rather than creating new information6 developmentedit since 2000 media scholars have analyzed and are aware of the impact of googlization to modern human societycitation needed geert lovink argues against the society’s growing dependency on google search retrieval7richard a rogers points out that googlization connotes media concentration—an important political economy style critique of google’s taking over of one service after another online1 liz losh also claims that the googlization of the bnf has brought considerable public attention in major magazine and newspapers in france8 the googlization of everything a book published in march 2011 by siva vaidhyanathan provides a critical interpretation of how google is disrupting culture commerce and community in vaidhyanathans own words the book will answer three key questions what does the world look like through the lens of google how is googles ubiquity affecting the production and dissemination of knowledge and how has the corporation altered the rules and practices that govern other companies institutions and states the author siva vaidhyanathan also has a blog where he documented the development of the book and any developments or news about googlization and google in general his basic argument is that we may approve of google today but the company very easily could use our information against us in ways that are beneficial to its business not society both the book and the blog are subtitled how one company is disrupting culture commerce and community… and why we should worry criticisms of googlizationedit the founders of google have encountered hostility to their enterprise almost since its inception both in the form of general press criticism and actual legal action various lawsuits have included infringement of copyright law its dealings with advertising companies and in the volume of advertising that its users encounter9 google has been notorious for its use of pagerank an algorithm used by google search to rank websites in their search engine results pagerank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages according to google pagerank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is the underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites 10 despite the pragmatic devotion to the technological virtues of speed precision comprehensiveness and honesty in computergenerated results google has on occasion imposed human intervention and judgement from within the system rather than rely on the slowchanging collective judgement of the users a prominent example of this occurred in april 2004 when the first search result wikipedia’s entry for jew was replaced with the homepage of an antisemitic website called jew watch google also intervened with the pagerank algorithm when pages denying that the slaughter of 6 million jews occurred during world war ii were high firstpage results for the google search holocaust or jew 10 another controversial event in googles past occurred in early february 2010 when google deleted years worth of archives from six popular music blogs due to receiving several dmca notices from music copyright holders alleging that music was being shared illegally 11 despite google’s general market dominance some of its offshoots and additional projects have been less than successful nexus one directtocustomer sales and google buzz social networking site all encountered problems when they were first established problems which they are still struggling with defense of googlizationedit googles corporate mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful12 amongst ordinary internet users google is viewed fairly favorably as a search tool and as a company in general about 82 percent of americans expressed a favorable opinion of google overall according to one national survey13 in late march 2010 google discontinued its local domain for china while continuing to offer their uncensored hong kongbased domain google had initially offered a censored version of their search engine in china they reversed this decision when they decided that it was in conflict with their mission and their ideals speaking for google one of its founders sergey brin said one of the reasons i am glad we are making this move in china is that the china situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewalls14 in another interview brin said for us it has always been a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the internet we believe that this is the best thing that we can do for preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the internet 15 when google went public in 2004 founders larry page and sergey brin promised google would commit to philanthropy by dedicating 1 of its profit 1 of its equity and its employees time to charitable effort including googleorg page wrote investors that google’s philanthropy could someday eclipse google itself in terms of overall world impact16 see alsoedit google portal cocacolonization criticism of google dont be evil glasshole mcdonaldization new media surveillance capitalism
