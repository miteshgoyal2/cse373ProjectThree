flawed in some essential way good a record of average worth but one that might possess considerable appeal for fans of a particular style mediocre a record that is artistically insubstantial though not truly wretched poor a record where even technical competence is at question or it was remarkably illconceived worthless a record that need never or should never have been created reserved for the

used in the third edition of the guide are3 classic albums in this category are essential listening for anyone interested in the artist under discussion or the style of music that artists work represents excellent four star albums represent peak performances in an artists career generally speaking albums that are granted four or more stars constitute the best introductions to an artists work for listeners who are curious average to good albums in the threestar range will primarily be of interest to established fans of the artist being discussed this midrange by its very nature requires the most discretion on the part of the consumer fair to poor albums in the twostar category either fall below an artists established standard or are in and of themselves failures disastrous albums in the range of one star or less are wastes of vital resources only masochists or completists need apply reviewersedit mark coleman jd considine paul evans david mcgee3 artists omitted from the
