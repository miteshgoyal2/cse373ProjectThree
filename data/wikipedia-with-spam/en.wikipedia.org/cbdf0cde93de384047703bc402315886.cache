inclusion the dominant customary international law standard of statehood is the declarative theory of statehood which was codified by the montevideo convention of 1933 the convention defines the state as a person of international law if it possesses the following qualifications a a permanent population b a defined territory c government and d a capacity to enter into relations with the other states so long as it was not obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms in threatening diplomatic representations or in any other effective coercive measure69 debate exists on the degree to which recognition should be included as a criterion of statehood the declarative theory of statehood argues that statehood is purely objective and recognition of a state by other states is irrelevant on the other end of the spectrum the constitutive theory of statehood defines a state as a person under international law only if it is recognised as sovereign by other states for the purposes of this list included are all states that either a consider themselves sovereign through a declaration of independence or some other means and are often regarded as satisfying the declarative theory of statehood or b are recognised as a sovereign state by at least one un member state note that in some cases there is a divergence of opinion over the interpretation of the first point and whether an entity satisfies it is disputed unique political entities which fail to meet the classification of a sovereign state are considered protostates7071 on the basis of the above criteria this
