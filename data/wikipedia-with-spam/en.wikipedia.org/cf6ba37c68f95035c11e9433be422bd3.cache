hunter elmer j fudd is a fictional cartoon character and one of the most famous looney tunes characters and the de facto archenemy of bugs bunny he has one of the more disputed origins in the warner

funnyeccentric clothing a voice like joe penner provided either by radio mimic danny webb3 or actor cliff nazarro2 and an eggshaped head many cartoon historians believe that egghead evolved into elmer over a period of a couple of years1 however animation historian michael barrier asserts the eggheadelmer story is actually a little messy my sense being that most of the people involved whether they were making the films or publicizing them not only had trouble telling the characters apart but had no idea why they should bother trying4 egghead made his second appearance in 1937s little red walking hood and then in 1938 teamed with warner bros newest cartoon star daffy duck in daffy duck and egghead1 egghead continued to make appearances in the warner cartoons in 1938 such as in the isle of pingo pongo and aladin bagdad1 in a feud there was 1938 egghead made his entrance riding a motor scooter with the words elmer fudd peacemaker displayed on the side the first onscreen use of that name egghead shifts from having a moe howard haircut to being bald and wears a brown derby a baggy suit and a highcollared shirt egghead returned decades later in the compilation film daffy ducks quackbusters more recently he also made a cameo appearance at the end of looney tunes back in action and was also given in his own story which starred him alongside pete puma in the looney tunes comic book one animation history suggests that the egghead character was based on ripleys believe it or not cartoonist and entertainer robert ripley5 while the name elmer fudd might have been a reference to the thenpopular hunter elmer keithcitation needed egghead has the distinction of being the first recurring character created for leon schlesingers merrie melodies series to be followed by such characters as sniffles inki and even bugs bunny which had previously contained only oneshot characters although during the harmanising era foxy goopy geer and piggy each appeared in a few merrie melodies in the 1939 cartoon dangerous dan mcfoo a new voice actor arthur q bryan was hired to provide the voice of the hero dog charactercitation needed it was in this cartoon that the popular milksop voice of elmer fudd was createdcitation needed elmer fudd has since been the chief antagonistic force in the majority of the bugs bunny cartoons initiating one of the most famous rivalries in the history of american cinema barrier notes elmer fudd was not a modified version of his fellow warner bros character egghead and that the two characters were always distinct that was evidenced by elmers being identified in a warner publicity sheet for cinderella meets fella filed with the library of congress as a copyright description as eggheads brother4 elmer emerges elmer fudd resembling egghead early in his career is annoyed by a rabbit in elmers candid camera in 1940 egghead–elmers appearance was refined giving him a chin and a less bulbous nose although still wearing eggheads clothing and arthur q bryans dan mcfoo voice in what most people consider elmer fudds first true appearance a chuck jones short entitled elmers candid camera the rabbit drives elmer insane later that year he appeared in friz frelengs confederate honey where hes called ned cutler and the hardship of miles standish where his voice and eggheadlike appearance were still the same jones would use this elmer one more time in 1941s elmers pet rabbit its other title character is labeled as bugs bunny but is also identical to his counterpart in camera in the interim the two starred in a wild hare bugs appears with a carrot new york accent and whats up doc catchphrase all in place for the first time although the voice and physique are as yet somewhat off elmer has a better voice a trimmer figure designed by robert givens which would be reused soon later in jones good night elmer this time without a red nose and his familiar hunting clothes he is much more recognizable as the elmer fudd of later cartoons than bugs is here in his earliest appearances elmer actually wikes wabbits either attempting to take photos of bugs or adopting bugs as his pet the rascally rabbit has the poor fudd so perplexed that there is little wonder as to why elmer would become a hunter and in some cases actually proclaim i hate wittle gway wabbits after pumping buckshot down a rabbit hole elmer in rabbit fire 1951 elmers role in these two films that of wouldbe hunter dupe and foil for bugs would remain his main role forever after and although bugs bunny was called upon to outwit many more worthy opponents elmer somehow remained bugs classic nemesis despite or because of his legendary gullibility small size short temper and shorter attention span in rabbit fire he declares himself vegetarian hunting for sport only6 elmer was usually cast as a hapless biggame hunter armed with a doublebarreled shotgun albeit one which could be fired much more than twice without being reloaded and creeping through the woods hunting wabbits in a few cartoons though he assumed a completely different persona—a wealthy industrialist type occupying a luxurious penthouse or in one episode involving a role reversal a sanitarium—which bugs would of course somehow find his way into in dog gone people he had an ordinary office job working for demanding boss mister cwabtwee in another cartoon mutt in a rut he appeared to work in an office and had a dog he called wover boy whom he took hunting though bugs did not appear elmer also has a hunting dog in to duck or not to duck in that film the dog is named laramore several episodes featured elmer differently one whats up doc 1950 has bugs bunny relating his life story to a biographer and recalling a time which was a downturn for the movie business elmer fudd is a wellknown entertainer who looking for a new partner for his act sees bugs bunny after passing caricatures of many other famous 1940s actors al jolson jack benny eddie cantor bing crosby who like bugs are also out of work elmer and bugs do a onejoke act crosscountry with bugs dressed like a pinhead and when he does not know the answer to a joke elmer gives it and hits him with a pie in the face bugs begins to tire of this gag and pulls a surprise on fudd answering the joke correctly and bopping elmer with a mallet which prompts the man to point his rifle at bugs the bunny asks nervously eh whats up doc which results in a huge round of applause from the audience bugs tells elmer they may be on to something and elmer with the vaudevillians instinct of sticking with a gag that catches on nods that they should reuse it according to this account the common elmerashunter episodes are entirely staged one episode where bugs lost in the hunting was hare brush 1956 here elmer has been committed to an insane asylum because he believes he is a rabbit though it is also revealed that he is a millionaire and owns a mansion and a yacht bugs bunny enters fudds room and elmer bribes him with carrots then leaves the way the real rabbit entered bugs acts surprisingly for him naïve assuming elmer just wanted to go outside for a while elmers psychiatrist arrives and thinking fudds delusion has affected his appearance drugs bugs and conditions him into believing that he is elmer fudd after which bugs starts wearing hunting clothes and acting like elmer hunting the rabbitcostumed fudd who is in turn acting like bugs their hunt is cut short when bugs is arrested by a government agent as elmer fudd is wanted for tax evasion after bugs is hauled away trying to explain that the rabbit is elmer fudd fudd breaks the fourth wall and tells the audience i may be a scwewy wabbit but im not going to alcatwaz as he hops away as if he had planned the whole thing elmer fudd has occasionally appeared in other costumes notably as cupid he tries to convince bugs about love but bugs is reluctant thinking to himself dont you look like some guy whos always after me and pictures the elmer in hunters clothes the cupid elmer plots to get even with bugs using his love arrows to make bugs fall in love with an artificial rabbit at a dog track elmer also appeared in this form opposite daffy duck in the stupid cupid 1944 the bugs–elmer partnership was so familiar to audiences that in a late 1950s cartoon bugs bonnets a character study is made of what happens to the relationship between the two when they each accidentally don a different selection of hats native american wig pilgrim hat military helmets bridal veil and top hat to name a few the result is comic mayhem a steady game of oneupmanship that ultimately leads to matrimony fat elmer for a short time in the 1941–1942 season elmers appearance was modified again for five cartoons wabbit twouble the wacky wabbit the wabbit who came to supper any bonds today and fresh hare he became a heavyset beerbellied character patterned after arthur q bryans reallife appearance and still chasing bugs or vice versa however audiences did not accept a fat fudd so ultimately the slimmer version returned for good this time period also saw a temporary change in elmers relationship with bugs bunny instead of being the hunter elmer was the victim of unprovoked pestering by bugs in wabbit twouble bugs plays a number of gags on elmer advising the audience i do dis kind o stuff to him all twough da picture a line somewhat ironically would later be said by cecil turtle as he and his friends cheat bugs out of winning a race another short the wacky wabbit finds elmer focused on prospecting for gold which would be used to fund the world war ii effort elmer sings a variation of the old prospectors tune oh susanna made just for this cartoon complete with the phrase v for victory with bugs joining in just before starting to hassle elmer he made a later appearance in an episode of the sylvester and tweety mysteries as a russian version with a simple name boris who owns another comedy club in russia elmerspeak he nearly always vocalised consonants r and l pronouncing them as w instead a trait that also characterized tweety bird when he would talk in his slightly raspy voice this trait was prevalent in the elmers candid camera and elmers pet rabbit cartoons where the writers would give him exaggerated lines such as my that weawwy was a dewicious weg of wamb to further exaggerate his qualities as a harmless nebbish that characteristic seemed to fit his somewhat timid and childlike persona and it worked the writers often gave him lines filled with those letters such as doing shakespeares romeo as what wight thwough yonduh window bweaks or wagners ride of the valkyries as kiww the wabbit kiww the wabbit kiww the wabbit or the beautifuw bwue danube by johann stwauss stage door cartoons line oh you dubbuhcwossing wabbit you tweachewous miscweant or the name of actress owivia dehaviwwand elmers speech impediment is so well known that google allows the user to change the search engine language to elmer fudd comedian robin williams often referred to the impediment as fudd syndrome whenever he accidentally slipped up and replaced an l or r with a w sound in a word part of the joke is that elmer is presumably incapable of pronouncing his own first name correctly occasionally elmer would properly pronounce an r or l sound depending on whether or not it was vital for the audience to understand what the word was for example in 1944s the old grey hare he clearly pronounces the r in the word picture usually elmer pronounces the r and l when one of those letters is in the last syllable of the word such as rascal which he says as wascal this doesnt occur in onesyllable words like last wast or in common words like hello hewwo later appearances elmer fudd made appearances in several television specials in the 1970s and 1980s and some cameo roles in two of the looney tunes featurefilm compilations elmer would also appear frequently on the animated series tiny toon adventures as a teacher at acme looniversity where he was the idol and favorite teacher of elmyra duff the slightly deranged animal lover who resembles elmer in basic head design name and

art styles as they do so at the end elmer forgets to change back to his normal style after jumping out of the pointillism painting sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte by georges seurat allowing bugs to easily disintegrate elmer by blowing a fan at him a fouryearold version of elmer was featured in the baby looney tunes episode a bully for bugs where he kept taking all of bugs candy and also bullied the rest of his friends he was also shown with short blond hair he appeared in most of the songs an even more villainous elmer appeared in two episodes of duck dodgers as the mother fudd an alien who would spread a disease that caused all affected by it to stand around laughing like elmer a parody of the flood in halo and the borg in star trek in loonatics unleashed his descendant electro j fudd tried to prove himself the universes greatest hunter by capturing ace bunny but settled for danger duck instead elmer himself also makes an appearance in the form of a photo

comicslooney tunes crossover books an alternate version of elmer fudd was created for a story in which the character was designed more for the dc universe and was pitted against batman in the batmanelmer fudd special in the story elmer is a bounty hunter that originated from the country side before he moved to gotham to make ends meet he considered putting the shotgun away for good when he fell in love with silver st cloud but she was killed by hitman bugs the bunny he goes to a bar called porkys which has attendants that are humanoid versions of other famous looney tunes stars to kill

replacing daffy as bugs tells elmer its bat season after getting shot by elmer too many times batman takes bugs advice and makes it robin season causing elmer to pursue the dark knights sidekicks instead8 portrayal fudd was originally voiced by radio actor arthur q bryan but three times in bryans lifetime the voice was provided by the versatile mel blanc in to duck or not to duck blanc spoke as fudd saying that one in the scarlet pumpernickel 1950 only a single line was needed and bringing in bryan was not cost effective and in whats opera doc elmers furious scream smog was dubbed by mel blanc although bryan had voiced the rest of the part later during the musicians union strike of 1958 another artist did the voice for elmers costarring appearance in prehysterical hare there is no documented reason for bryans absence leaving some fans to speculate that he refused to cross the picket lines in 1959 bryan died aged 60 and hal smith was selected to replace him as elmer but after just two cartoons were recorded by the new actor and another was made in which fudd has no lines and therefore no voice the character was soon retired although in more recent years other voice actors have alternated as elmers voice bryans characterization remains the definitive one he was never credited onscreen because blanc had a clause in his contract that required him to receive a screen credit and perhaps inadvertently denied the same to other voice performers blanc would take on the role regularly in the 1970s and 1980s supplying elmers voice for new footage in compilation feature films and similar tv specials as well as some allnew specials he admitted in his autobiography that he found the voice difficult to get right never quite making it his own in speechless the famous lithograph issued following blancs death elmer is not shown among the characters bowing their heads in tribute to blanc other voice actors besides arthur q bryan other actors have voiced elmer danny
