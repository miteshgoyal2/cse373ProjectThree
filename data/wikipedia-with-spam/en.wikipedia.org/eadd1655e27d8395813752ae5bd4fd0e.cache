portal category v t e computer science deals with the theoretical foundations of information and computation together with practical techniques for the implementation and application of these foundations computer science is the study of the theory experimentation and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers it is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility structure expression and mechanization of the methodical procedures or algorithms that underlie the acquisition representation processing storage communication of and access to information an alternate more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale a computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems1 its fields can be divided into a variety of theoretical and practical disciplines some fields such as computational complexity theory which explores the fundamental properties of computational and intractable problems are highly abstract while fields such as computer graphics emphasize realworld visual applications other fields still focus on challenges in implementing computation for example programming language theory considers various approaches to the description of computation while the study of computer programming itself investigates various aspects of the use of programming language and complex systems human–computer interaction considers the challenges in making computers and

lovelace is credited with writing the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer3 the earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity aiding in computations such as multiplication and division further algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment wilhelm schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 16234 in 1673 gottfried leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator called the stepped reckoner5 he may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist for among other reasons documenting the binary number system in 1820 thomas de colmar launched the mechanical calculator industrynote 1 when he released his simplified arithmometer which was the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment charles babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator his difference engine in 1822 which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator his analytical engine6 he started developing this machine in 1834 and in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer7 a crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the jacquard loom7 making it infinitely programmablenote 2 in 1843 during the translation of a french article on the analytical engine ada lovelace wrote in one of the many notes she included an algorithm to compute the bernoulli numbers which is considered to be the first computer program8 around 1885 herman hollerith invented the tabulator which used punched cards to process statistical information eventually his company became part of ibm in 1937 one hundred years after babbages impossible dream howard aiken convinced ibm which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business9 to develop his giant programmable calculator the asccharvard mark i based on babbages analytical engine which itself used cards and a central computing unit when the machine was finished some hailed it as babbages dream come true10 during the 1940s as new and more powerful computing machines were developed the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors11 as it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s1213 the worlds first computer science degree program the cambridge diploma in computer science began at the university of cambridge computer laboratory in 1953 the first computer science degree program in the united states was formed at purdue university in 196214 since practical computers became available many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population1516 it is the now wellknown ibm brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time ibm short for international business machines released the ibm 70417 and later the ibm 70918 computers which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices still working with the ibm computer was frustrating … if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction the program would crash and you would have to start the whole process over again15 during the late 1950s the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages and such issues were commonplace16 time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of computing technology19 modern society has seen a significant shift in the users of computer technology from usage only by experts and professionals to a nearubiquitous user base initially computers were quite costly and some degree of human aid was needed for efficient use—in part from professional computer operators as computer adoption became more widespread and affordable less human assistance was needed for common usage see also history of computing and history of informatics contributions the german military used the enigma machine shown here during world war ii for communications they wanted kept secret the largescale decryption of enigma traffic at bletchley park was an important factor that contributed to allied victory in wwii20 despite its short history as a formal academic discipline computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society—in fact along with electronics it is a founding science of the current epoch of human history called the information age and a driver of the information revolution seen as the third major leap in human technological progress after the industrial revolution 1750–1850 ce and the agricultural revolution 8000–5000 bc these contributions include the start of the digital revolution which includes the current information age and the internet21 a formal definition of computation and computability and proof that there are computationally unsolvable and intractable problems22 the concept of a programming language a tool for the precise expression of methodological information at various levels of abstraction23 in cryptography breaking the enigma code was an important factor contributing to the allied victory in world war ii20 scientific computing enabled practical evaluation of processes and situations of great complexity as well as experimentation entirely by software it also enabled advanced study of the mind and mapping of the human genome became possible with the human genome project21 distributed computing projects such as foldinghome explore protein folding algorithmic trading has increased the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets by using artificial intelligence machine learning and other statistical and numerical techniques on a large scale24 high frequency algorithmic trading can also exacerbate volatility25 computer graphics and computergenerated imagery have become ubiquitous in modern entertainment particularly in television cinema advertising animation and video games even films that feature no explicit cgi are usually filmed now on digital cameras or edited or postprocessed using a digital video editor2627 simulation of various processes including computational fluid dynamics physical electrical and electronic systems and circuits as well as societies and social situations notably war games along with their habitats among many others modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are spice as well as software for physical realization of new or modified designs the latter includes essential design software for integrated circuitscitation needed artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important as it gets more efficient and complex there are many applications of ai some of which can be seen at home such as robotic vacuum cleaners it is also present in video games and on the modern battlefield in drones antimissile systems and squad support robots humancomputer interaction combines novel algorithms with design strategies that enable rapid human performance low error rates ease in learning and high satisfaction researchers use ethnographic observation and automated data collection to understand user needs then conduct usability tests to refine designs key innovations include the direct manipulation selectable web links touchscreen designs mobile applications and virtual reality etymology see also informatics § etymology although first proposed in 195616 the term computer science appears in a 1959 article in communications of the acm28 in which louis fein argues for the creation of a graduate school in computer sciences analogous to the creation of harvard business school in 192129 justifying the name by arguing that like management science the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline28 his efforts and those of others such as numerical analyst george forsythe were rewarded universities went on to create such programs starting with purdue in 196230 despite its name a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves because of this several alternative names have been proposed31 certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science to emphasize precisely that difference danish scientist peter naur suggested the term datalogy32 to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment while not necessarily involving computers the first scientific institution to use the term was the department of datalogy at the university of copenhagen founded in 1969 with peter naur being the first professor in datalogy the term is used mainly in the scandinavian countries an alternative term also proposed by naur is data science this is now used for a distinct field of data analysis including statistics and databases also in the early days of computing a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the communications of the acm—turingineer turologist flowchartsman applied metamathematician and applied epistemologist33 three months later in the same journal comptologist was suggested followed next year by hypologist34 the term computics has also been suggested35 in europe terms derived from contracted translations of the expression automatic information eg informazione automatica in italian or information and mathematics are often used eg informatique french informatik german informatica italian dutch informática spanish portuguese informatika slavic languages and hungarian or pliroforiki πληροφορική which means informatics in greek similar words have also been adopted in the uk as in the school of informatics of the university of edinburgh36 in the us however informatics is linked with applied computing or computing in the context of another domain37 a folkloric quotation often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—edsger dijkstra states that computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopesnote 3 the design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science for example the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems however there has been much crossfertilization of ideas between the various computerrelated disciplines computer science research also often intersects other disciplines such as philosophy cognitive science linguistics mathematics physics biology statistics and logic computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science12 early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as kurt gödel alan turing rózsa péter and alonzo church and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic category theory domain theory and algebra16 the relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue which is further muddied by disputes over what the term software engineering means and how computer science is defined38 david parnas taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals making the two separate but complementary disciplines39 the academic political and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research philosophy main article philosophy of computer science a number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science peter wegner argued that those paradigms are science technology and mathematics40 peter dennings working group argued that they are theory abstraction modeling and design41 amnon h eden described them as the rationalist paradigm which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics which is prevalent in theoretical computer science and mainly employs deductive reasoning the technocratic paradigm which might be found in engineering approaches most prominently in software engineering and the scientific paradigm which approaches computerrelated artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence42 areas of computer science further information outline of computer science as a discipline computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software4344 csab formerly called computing sciences accreditation board—which is made up of representatives of the association for computing machinery acm and the ieee computer society ieee cs45—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science theory of computation algorithms and data structures programming methodology and languages and computer elements and architecture in addition to these four areas csab also identifies fields such as software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking and communication database systems parallel computation distributed computation human–computer interaction computer graphics operating systems and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science43 theoretical computer science main article theoretical computer science theoretical computer science is mathematical and abstract in spirit but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation its aim is to understand the nature of computation and as a consequence of this understanding provide more efficient methodologies all studies related to mathematical logic and formal concepts and methods could be considered as theoretical computer science provided that the motivation is clearly drawn from the field of computing data structures and algorithms data structures and algorithms is the study of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency on2 analysis of algorithms algorithms data structures combinatorial optimization computational geometry theory of computation main article theory of computation according to peter denning the fundamental question underlying computer science is what can be efficiently automated12 theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations in an effort to answer the first question computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation the second question is addressed by computational complexity theory which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems the famous p np problem one of the millennium prize problems46 is an open problem in the theory of computation p np gnitirwterces automata theory computability theory computational complexity theory cryptography quantum computing theory information and coding theory main articles information theory and coding theory information theory is related to the quantification of information this was developed by claude shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data47 coding theory is the study of the properties of codes systems for converting information from one form to another and their fitness for a specific application codes are used for data compression cryptography error detection and correction and more recently also for network coding codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods programming language theory main article programming language theory programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design implementation analysis characterization and classification of programming languages and their individual features it falls within the discipline of computer science both depending on and affecting mathematics software engineering and linguistics it is an active research area with numerous dedicated academic journals γ ⊢ x int displaystyle gamma vdash xtextint type theory compiler design programming languages formal methods main article formal methods formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification development and verification of software and hardware systems the use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that as in other engineering disciplines performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design they form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering especially where safety or security is involved formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing for industrial use tool support is required however the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of highintegrity and lifecritical systems where safety or security is of utmost importance formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals in particular logic calculi formal languages automata theory and program semantics but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification computer systems computer architecture and computer engineering main articles computer architecture and computer engineering computer architecture or digital computer organization is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system it focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory48 the field often involves disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional performance and cost goals digital logic microarchitecture multiprocessing ubiquitous computing systems architecture operating systems computer performance analysis main article computer performance computer performance analysis is the study of work flowing through computers with the general goals of improving throughput controlling response time using resources efficiently eliminating bottlenecks and predicting performance under anticipated peak loads49 concurrent parallel and distributed systems main articles concurrency computer science and distributed computing concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously and potentially interacting with each other a number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including petri nets process calculi and the parallel random access machine model a distributed system extends the idea of concurrency onto multiple computers connected through a network computers within the same distributed system have their own private memory and information is often exchanged among themselves to achieve a common goal computer networks main article computer network this branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide computer security and cryptography main articles computer security and cryptography computer security is a branch of computer technology whose objective includes protection of information from unauthorized access disruption or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users cryptography is the practice and study of hiding encryption and therefore deciphering decryption information modern cryptography is largely related to computer science for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity databases main article database a database is intended to organize store and retrieve large amounts of data easily digital databases are managed using database management systems to store create maintain and search data through database models and query languages computer applications computer graphics and visualization main article computer graphics computer science computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves synthesis and manipulation of image data the study is connected to many other fields in computer science including computer vision image processing and computational geometry and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and video games humancomputer interaction main article humancomputer interaction research that develops theories principles and guidelines for user interface designers so they can create satisfactory user experiences with desktop laptop and mobile devices scientific computing scientific computing or computational science is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems in practical use it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation to problems in various scientific disciplines numerical analysis computational physics computational chemistry bioinformatics artificial intelligence main article artificial intelligence artificial intelligence ai aims to or is required to synthesize goalorientated processes such as problemsolving decisionmaking environmental adaptation learning and communication found in humans and animals from its origins in cybernetics and in the dartmouth conference 1956 artificial intelligence research has been necessarily crossdisciplinary drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics symbolic logic semiotics electrical engineering philosophy of mind neurophysiology and social intelligence ai is associated in the popular mind with robotic development but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development which require computational understanding the startingpoint in the late 1940s was alan turings question can computers think and the question remains effectively unanswered although the turing test is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence but the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex realworld data machine learning computer vision image processing pattern recognition data mining evolutionary computation knowledge representation and reasoning natural language processing robotics software engineering main article software engineering see also computer programming software engineering is the study of designing implementing and modifying software in order to ensure it is of high quality affordable maintainable and fast to build it is a systematic approach to software design involving the application of engineering practices to software software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it doesnt just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software but its internal maintenance and arrangement both computer applications software engineers and computer systems software engineers are projected to be among the fastest growing occupations from 2008 to 2018 the great insights of computer science the philosopher of computing bill rapaport noted three great insights of computer science50 gottfried wilhelm leibnizs george booles alan turings claude shannons and samuel morses insight there are only two objects that a computer has to deal with in order to represent anything all the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 or any other bistable pair that can flipflop between two easily distinguishable states such as onoff magnetizeddemagnetized highvoltagelowvoltage etc see also digital physics alan turings insight there are only five actions that a computer has to perform in order to do anything every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions move left one location move right one location read symbol at current location print 0 at current location print 1 at current location see also turing machine corrado böhm and giuseppe jacopinis insight there are only three ways of combining these actions into more complex ones that are needed in order for a computer to do anything only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones sequence first do this then do that selection if suchandsuch is the case then do this else do that repetition while suchandsuch is the case do this note that the three rules of boehms and jacopinis insight can be further simplified with the use of goto which means it is more elementary than structured programming see also elementary function arithmetic § friedmans grand conjecture academia further information list of computer science conferences and categorycomputer science journals conferences are important events for computer science research during these conferences researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet unlike in most other academic fields in computer science the prestige of conference papers is greater than that of journal publications5152 one proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results a task better handled by conferences than by journals53 education since computer science is a relatively new field it is not as widely taught in schools and universities as other academic subjects for example in 2014 codeorg estimated that only 10 percent of high schools in the united states offered computer science education54 a 2010 report by association for computing machinery acm and computer science teachers association csta revealed that only 14 out of 50 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science55 however computer science education is growing56 some countries such as israel new zealand and south korea have already included computer science in their respective national secondary education curriculum5758 several countries are following suit59 in most countries there is a significant gender gap in computer science education for example in the us about 20 of computer science degrees in 2012 were conferred to women60 this gender gap also exists in other western countries61 however in some parts of the world the gap is small or nonexistent in 2011 approximately half of all computer science degrees in malaysia were conferred to women62 in 2001 women made up 545 of computer science graduates in guyana61 see also main article outline of computer science computer science

technology transfer in computer science turing award computer science – wikipedia book notes in 1851 the introduction of punched cards into the new engine was important not only as a more convenient form of control than the drums or because programs could now be of unlimited extent and could be stored and repeated without the danger of introducing errors in setting the machine by hand it was important also because it served to crystallize babbages feeling that he had invented something really new something much more than a sophisticated calculating machine bruce collier 1970 see the entry
