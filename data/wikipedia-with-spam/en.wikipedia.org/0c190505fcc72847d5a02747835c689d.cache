river slaney in county wexford ireland after missing a shot at a golden plover he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in europe the golden plover or the red grouse it is the plover4 that evening at castlebridge house he realized that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was europes fastest game bird56 beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout ireland and abroad but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records he realized then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful7 beavers idea became reality when guinness employee christopher chataway recommended university friends norris and ross mcwhirter who had been running a factfinding agency in london the twin brothers were commissioned to compile what became the guinness book of records in august 1954 a thousand copies were printed and given away8 after the founding of the guinness book of records at 107 fleet street the first 198page edition was bound on 27 august 1955 and went to the top of the british best seller lists by christmas the following year it launched in the us and sold 70000 copies since then guinness world records has become a household name and the global leader in world records the book has gone on to become a record breaker in its own right with sales of more than 100 million copies in 100 different countries and 37 languages guinness world records is the worlds best selling copyright book ever9 because the book became a surprise hit many further editions were printed eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year published in septemberoctober in time for christmas the mcwhirters continued to compile it for many years both brothers had an encyclopedic memory on the tv series record breakers based upon the book they would take questions posed by children in the audience on various world records and were able to give the correct answer ross mcwhirter was assassinated by the provisional irish republican army in 197510 following ross assassination the feature in the show where questions about records posed by children were answered was called norris on the spot guinness superlatives later guinness world records limited was formed in 1954 to publish the first book sterling publishing owned the rights to the guinness book in the us for decades the group was owned by guinness plc and subsequently diageo until 2001 when it was purchased by gullane entertainment gullane was itself purchased by hit entertainment in 2002 in 2006 apax partners purchased hit and subsequently sold guinness world records in early 2008 to the jim pattison group the parent company of ripley entertainment which is licensed to operate guinness world records attractions with offices in new york city and tokyo guinness world records global headquarters remain in london while its museum attractions are based at ripley headquarters in orlando florida us evolutionedit lucky diamond rich is the worlds most tattooed person and has tattoos covering his entire body he holds the guinness world record as of 2006update being 100 percent tattooed recent editions have focused on record feats by person competitors competitions range from obvious ones such as olympic weightlifting to the longest egg tossing distances or for longest time spent playing grand theft auto iv or the number of hot dogs that can be consumed in ten minutes although eating and alcohol consumption entries are no longer accepted possibly for fear of litigation besides records about competitions it contains such facts as the heaviest tumour the most poisonous plant the shortest river roe river the two longestrunning dramas general hospital and guiding light in the us and the worlds most successful salesman joe girard among others many records also relate to the youngest person who achieved something such as the youngest person to visit all nations of the world being maurizio giuliano11 clyde beatty holds the record for mixing 40 lions and tigers in one cage with himself each edition contains a selection of the records from the guinness database as well as select new records the criteria for inclusion having changed over the years the ousting of norris mcwhirter from his consulting role in 1995 and the subsequent decision by diageo plc to sell the guinness world records brand have shifted it from a textoriented to an illustrated reference book style over substance the majority of world records are no longer listed in the book or on the website and can only be determined by a written application to guinness to break the record for those unable to wait the 4–6 weeks for a reply guinness will process a fasttrack application for £300 us450 the guinness book of records is the worlds most sold copyrighted book earning it an entry within its own pages a number of spinoff books and television series have also been produced guinness world records bestowed the record of person with the most records on ashrita furman of queens ny in april 2009 at that time he held 100 records12 in 2005 guinness designated 9 november as international guinness world records day to encourage breaking of world records13 in 2006 an estimated 100000 people participated in over 10 countries guinness reported 2244 new records in 12 months which was a 173 increase over the previous year13 in february 2008 nbc aired the top 100 guinness world records of all time and guinness world records made the complete list available on their website14 defining recordsedit sultan kösen turkey is the tallest living person since 17 september 2009 as verified by guinness world records play media cracking open a wheel of parmigianoreggiano cheese as a part of a 2013 world record by whole foods market15 for many records guinness world records is the effective authority on the exact requirements for them and with whom records reside the company providing adjudicators to events to determine the veracity of record attempts the list of records which the guinness world records covers is not fixed records may be added and also removed for various reasons the public are invited to submit applications for records which can be either the bettering of existing records or substantial achievements which could constitute a new record2 the company also provides corporate services for companies to harness the power of recordbreaking to deliver tangible success for their businesses16 ethical and safety issuesedit steven petrosino drinking 1 litre of beer in 13 seconds in june 19771718 petrosino set record times for 250 ml 500 ml and 15 liters as well but guinness accepted only the record for one liter they later dropped all beer and alcohol records from their compendium in 1991 and reinstated the records in 2008 guinness world records states several types of records it will not accept for ethical reasons such as those related to the killing or harming of animals19 several world records that were once included in the book have been removed for ethical reasons including concerns for the well being of potential record breakers for example following publication of a heaviest fish record many fish owners overfed their pets beyond the bounds of what was healthy and therefore such entries were removed20 the guinness book also dropped records within their eating and drinking records section of human achievements in 1991 over concerns that potential competitors could harm themselves and expose the publisher to potential litigation21 these changes included the removal of all liquor wine and beer drinking records along with other unusual records for consuming such unlikely things as bicycles and trees21 other records such as sword swallowing and rally driving on public roads were closed from further entry as the current holders had performed beyond what are considered safe human tolerance levels there have been instances of closed records being reopened for example the sword swallowing record was listed as closed in the 1990 guinness book of world records but the guinness world records primetime tv show which started in 1998 accepted three sword swallowing challenges and so did the 2007 edition of the guinness world records onwards similarly the speed beer drinking records which were dropped from the book in 1991 reappeared 17 years later in the 2008 edition but were moved from the human achievements section of the older book22 to the modern society section of the newer edition23 as of 2011update it is required in the guidelines of all large food type records that the item be fully edible and distributed to the public for consumption to prevent food wastage2dead link chain letters are also not allowed guinness world records does not accept any records relating to chain letters sent by post or email if you receive a letter or an email which may promise to publish the names of all those who send it on please destroy it it is a hoax no matter if it says that guinness world records and the postal service are involved they are not2 difficulty in defining recordsedit for some potential categories guinness world records has declined to list some records that are too difficult or impossible to determine for example its website states we do not accept any claims for beauty as it is not objectively measurable19 on 10 december 2010 guinness world records stopped its new dreadlock category after investigation of its first and only female title holder asha mandela determining it was impossible to judge this record accurately24 verifying existing recordsedit guinness world records website publishes selected records and is not supposed to be used for the record verification purposes as it explains there are more than 40000 current records in our database and we try our best to feature as many as possible online we currently include over 15000 records online which we update every week so make sure to check the site regularly the book printed annually contains only 4000 records the only way to verify a record is by contacting guinness expecting average response time of 2 weeks25 museumsedit guinness museum in hollywood in 1976 a guinness book of world records museum opened in
