in 192911 on november 23 1935 she married henry harry robinson luce the publisher of time life and fortune she thereafter called herself clare boothe luce a frequently misspelled name that was often confused with that of her exact contemporary claire luce a stage and film actress as a professional writer luce continued to use her maiden name on january 11 1944 her only child ann clare brokaw a 19yearold senior at stanford university was killed in an automobile accident12 as a result of the tragedy luce explored psychotherapy and religion after grief counseling with radio priest fulton sheen

daughter beginning in 1949 she funded the construction of a catholic church in palo alto for use by the stanford campus ministry the new saint ann chapel was dedicated in 1951 it was sold by the diocese in 1998 and in 2003 became a church of the anglican province of christ the king14 marriage to henry luceedit the marriage between clare and henry was difficult henry was by any standard extremely successful but his physical awkwardness lack of humor and newsmans discomfort with any conversation that was not strictly factual put him in awe of his beautiful wifes social poise wit and fertile imagination15 clares years as managing editor of vanity fair left her with an avid interest in journalism she suggested the idea of life magazine to her husband before it was developed internally16 henry himself was generous in encouraging her to write for life but the question of how much coverage she should be accorded in time as she grew more famous was always a careful balancing act for henry since he did not want to be accused of nepotism in the early 1960s both luces were friends of philosopher author and lsd advocate gerald heard17 they tried lsd one time under his careful supervision although taking lsd never turned into a habit for either of the luces a friend and biographer of clare wilfred sheed wrote that clare made use of it at least several times18 the luces stayed together until henrys death from a heart attack in 1967 as one of the great power couples in american history they were welded by their mutual interests and complementary if contrasting characters they treated each other with unfailing respect in public never more so than when he willingly acted as his wifes consort during her years as ambassador to italy she was never able to convert him to catholicism he was the son of a presbyterian missionary but he did not question the sincerity of her faith often attended mass with her and defended her when she was criticized by his fellow protestants in the early years of her widowhood she retired to the luxurious beach house that she and her husband had planned in honolulu but boredom with life in what she called this furlined rut19 brought her back to washington dc for increasingly long periods she made her final home there in 1983 writing careeredit poster from the 1939 film the women a writer with considerable powers of invention and wit luce published stuffed shirts a promising volume of short stories in 1931 scribners magazine compared the work to evelyn waughs vile bodies for its bitter humor the new york times found it socially superficial but praised its lovely festoons of epigrams and beguiling stylishness what malice there may be in these pages has a felinity that is the purest angoran20 the books device of characters interlinked from story to story was borrowed from sherwood andersons winesburg ohio 1919 but it impressed andre maurois who asked luces permission to imitate it21 luce also published many magazine articles her real talent however was as a playwright after the failure of her initial stage effort the marital melodrama abide with me 1935 she rapidly followed up with a satirical comedy the women deploying a cast of no fewer than 40 actresses who discussed men in often scorching language it became a broadway smash in 1936 and three years later a successful hollywood movie toward the end of her life luce claimed that for half a century she had steadily received royalties from productions of the women all around the world later in the 1930s she wrote two more successful but less durable plays also both made into movies kiss the boys goodbye and margin for error the latter work presented an allout attack on the nazis racist philosophy22 its opening night in princeton new jersey on october 14 1939 was attended by albert einstein and thomas mann otto preminger directed and starred in both the broadway production and screen adaptation23 much of luces famously acid wit no good deed goes unpunished24 widowhood is a fringe benefit of marriage a hospital is no place to be sick can be traced back to the days when as a wealthy young divorcee in the early 1930s she became a caption writer at vogue and then associate editor and managing editor of vanity fair she not only edited the works of such great humorists as p g wodehouse and corey ford but contributed many comic pieces of her own signed and unsigned her humor which she retained into old age was one of the pillars of clares character general chiang kaishek and soong meiling welcome clare boothe luce april 1942 another branch of luces literary career was that of war journalism europe in the spring was the result of a fourmonth tour of britain belgium the netherlands italy and france in 1939–1940 as a correspondent for life magazine she described the widening battleground of world war ii as a world where men have decided to die together because they are unable to find a way to live together25 in 1941 luce and her husband toured china and reported on the status of the country and its war with japan her profile of general douglas macarthur was on the cover of life on december 8 1941 the day after the japanese attacked pearl harbor after the united states entered the war luce toured military installations in africa india china and burma compiling a further series of reports for life she published interviews with general harold alexander commander of british troops in the middle east chiang kaishek jawaharlal nehru and general stilwell commander of american troops in the chinaburmaindia theater25 her lifelong instinct for being in the right place at the right time and easy access to key commanders made her an influential figure on both sides of the atlantic she endured bombing raids and other dangers in europe and the far east she did not hesitate to criticize the unwarlike lifestyle of general sir claude auchinlecks middle east command in language that recalled the barbs of her best playwriting one draft article for life noting that the general lived far from the egyptian front in a houseboat and mocking raf pilots as flying fairies was discovered by british customs when she passed through trinidad in april 1942 it caused such allied consternation that she briefly faced house arrest26 coincidentally or not auchinleck was fired a few months later by winston churchill her varied experiences in all the major war theaters qualified her for a seat the following year on the house military affairs committee luce never wrote her autobiography she however willed her enormous archive of personal papers to the library of congress political careeredit house of representativesedit in 1942 luce won a republican seat in the united states house of representatives representing fairfield county connecticut the 4th congressional district she based her platform on three goals one to win the war two to prosecute that war as loyally and effectively as we can as republicans three to bring about a better world and a durable peace with special attention to postwar security and employment here at home27 she took up the seat formerly held by her late stepfather dr albert austin an outspoken critic of roosevelts foreign policy27 luce was supported by isolationists and conservatives in congress and she was appointed early to the prestigious house military affairs committee although she was by no means the only female representative on the floor her beauty wealth and penchant for slashing witticisms caused her to be treated patronizingly by colleagues of both sexes28 she made a sensational debut in her maiden speech coining the phrase globaloney to disparage vice president henry wallaces recommendation for airlines of the world to be given free access to us airports29 she called for repeal of the chinese exclusion act comparing its doctrine of race theology to adolf hitlers30 advocated aid for war victims abroad and sided with the administration on issues such as infantcare and maternity appropriations for the wives of enlisted men nevertheless roosevelt took a dislike to her and campaigned in 1944 to attempt to prevent her reelection publicly calling her a sharptongued glamor girl of forty31 she retaliated by accusing roosevelt of being the only american president who ever lied us into a war because he did not have the political courage to lead us into it32 during her second term luce was instrumental in the creation of the atomic energy commission33 and during the course of two tours of allied battlefronts in europe she campaigned for more support of what she considered to be americas forgotten army in italy she was present at the liberation of several nazi concentration camps in april 1945 and after ve day she began warning against the rise of international communism as another form of totalitarianism likely to lead to world war iii27 in 1946 she was the coauthor of the luceceller act of 1946 which increased the numbers of indians and filipinos permitted to immigrate to the us previously limited to only 100 per year and allowed them ultimately to become naturalized citizens republican national conventionsedit clare boothe luces emergence as a formidable political orator in congress made her a candidate to deliver the keynote speech at the 1944 republican national convention she did not however win that honor as many reports erroneously state nor was she the first woman to address a national political convention corinne roosevelt robinson did so in 1920 governor earl warren of california was ultimately selected as keynote speaker and luce was asked to introduce herbert hoover after seeing a draft of her proposed remarks hoover suggested that for him to introduce her34 luces subsequent address invoked an allegorical figure gi jim as gi joes less celebrated comradeinarms a victim of the roosevelt administrations tardy preparation for world war ii she reproved president roosevelt for practicing oneman diplomacy and claimed that american democracy was becoming a dictatorial bumbledom she was rewarded with a vast ovation35 the convention nominated governor thomas e dewey of new york for the presidency at the republican national convention in 1948 luce delivered a similarly scathing speech castigating president harry s truman and his administration philadelphia evening bulletin june 22 1948 e36 again the applause was great but most press comments afterwards were negative as a passionate convert to roman catholicism and dedicated cold warrior luce was by now moving toward the extreme right of her party ignoring luces clear preference for senator arthur vandenberg as a candidate the convention renominated dewey to run against truman ambassador to italyedit clare boothe luce ambassador to italy with husband henry luce 1954 luce returned to politics during the 1952 presidential election and she campaigned on behalf of republican candidate dwight eisenhower giving more than 100 speeches on his behalf her anticommunist speeches on the stump radio and television were effective in persuading a large number of traditionally democratvoting catholics to switch parties and vote eisenhower for her contributions luce was rewarded with an appointment as ambassador to italy a post that oversaw 1150 employees 8 consulates and 9 information centers she was confirmed by the senate in march 1953 the first american woman ever to hold such an important diplomatic post italians reacted skeptically at first to the arrival of a female ambassador in rome but luce soon convinced those of moderate and conservative temper that she favored their civilization and religion her admirers in italyand she had millions fondly referred to her as la signora the lady37 the countrys large communist minority however regarded her as a foreign meddler in italian affairs she was no stranger to pope pius xii who welcomed her as a friend and faithful acolyte38 over the course of several audiences since 1940 luce had impressed pius xii as one of the most effective secular preachers of catholicism in america39 her principal achievement as ambassador was to play a vital role in negotiating a peaceful solution to the trieste crisis of 1953–1954 a border dispute between italy and yugoslavia that she saw as potentially escalating into a war between east and west her sympathies throughout were with the christian democratic government of giuseppe pella and she was influential on the mediterranean policy of secretary of state john foster dulles another anticommunist although luce regarded the abatement of the acute phase of the crisis in december 1953 as a triumph for herself the main work of settlement finalized in october 1954 was undertaken by professional representatives of the five concerned powers britain france the united states italy and yugoslavia meeting in london40 as ambassador luce consistently overestimated the possibility that the italian left would mount a governmental coup and turn the country communist unless the democratic center was buttressed with generous american aid nurturing an image of her own country as a haven of social peace and prosperity she threatened to boycott the 1955 venice film festival if the american juvenile delinquent film blackboard jungle was shown41 around the same time she fell seriously ill with arsenic poisoning sensational rumors circulated that the ambassador was the target of extermination by agents of the soviet union medical analysis eventually determined that the poisoning was caused by arsenate of lead in paint dust falling from the stucco that decorated her bedroom ceiling the episode debilitated luce physically and mentally and she resigned her post in december 195642 upon her departure romes il tempo concluded she has given a notable example of how well a woman can discharge a political post of grave responsibility43 ambassador to braziledit in 1959 president eisenhower nominated a recovered luce to be the us ambassador to brazil she began to learn enough of the portuguese language in preparation for the job but she was by now so conservative that her appointment met with strong opposition from a small number of democratic senators leading the charge was oregon senator wayne morse still luce was confirmed by a 79 to 11 vote her husband urged her to decline the appointment noting that it would be difficult for her to work with morse who chaired the senate subcommittee on latin american affairs luce eventually sent eisenhower a letter explaining that she felt that the controversy surrounding her appointment would hinder her abilities to be respected by both her brazilian and us coworkers and resigned from her position as ambassador she had served only four days from april 28 to may 1 195944 and she had never left american soil political life after officeedit after fidel castro led a revolution in cuba in 1959 luce and her husband began to sponsor anticommunist groups this support included funding cuban exiles in commando speedboat raids against cuba in the early 1960s4546 luces continuing anticommunism as well as her advocacy of conservatism led her to support senator barry goldwater of arizona as the republican candidate for president in 1964 she also considered but rejected a candidacy for the united states senate from new york on the conservative party ticket that same year which also saw the political emergence of her future friend ronald reagan marked the voluntary end of henry luces tenure as editorinchief of time the luces retired together establishing a winter home in arizona and planning a final move to hawaii her husband henry died in 1967 before that dream

to cosponsor a submission of the equal rights amendment offered by representative louis ludlow of indiana but claimed that the invitation got lost in her mail50 luce never ceased to advise women to marry and provide supportive homes for their husbands during her ambassadorial years at a dinner in luxembourg attended by many european dignitaries luce was heard declaiming that all women wanted from men was babies and security51 yet her own professional career as a successful editor writer playwright reporter legislator and diplomat remarkably showed how a woman of humble origins and no college education could raise herself to an escalating series of public heights luce bequeathed a large part of her personal fortune of some 50 million to an academic program the clare boothe luce program designed to encourage the entry of women into technological fields traditionally dominated by men because of her determination and unwillingness to let her gender stand in the way of her personal and professional achievements luce is considered to be an influential role model by many women starting from humble beginnings luce never allowed her initial poverty or her male counterparts
