in what is now the united states at least 15000 years ago possibly much longer from asia through beringia a vast variety of peoples societies and cultures subsequently developed native americans were greatly affected by the european colonization of the americas which began in 1492 and their population declined precipitously due to introduced diseases warfare and slavery after the founding of the united states many native american peoples were subjected to warfare removals and onesided treaties and they continued to suffer from discriminatory government policies into the 20th century since the 1960s the selfdetermination movement has resulted in many changes to the lives of native americans today there are over five million native americans in the united states contents 1 background 2

centuries of population cultural and agricultural transfer and adjustment between old and new world societies a process known as the columbian exchange most native american groups had historically preserved their histories by oral traditions and artwork which has resulted in the first written sources on the conflict being authored by europeans3 at the time of first contact the indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the protoindustrial and mostly christian immigrants some of the northeastern and southwestern cultures in particular were matrilineal and operated on a more collective basis than the europeans were familiar with the majority of indigenous american tribes maintained their hunting grounds and agricultural lands for use of the entire tribe europeans at that time had patriarchal cultures and had developed concepts of individual property rights with respect to land that were extremely different the differences in cultures between the established native americans and immigrant europeans as well as shifting alliances among different nations in times of war caused extensive political tension ethnic violence and social disruption even before the european settlement of what is now the united states native americans suffered high fatalities from contact with european diseases spread throughout the americas by the spanish to which they had not yet acquired immunity smallpox epidemics are thought to have caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations although estimates of the precolumbian population of what today constitutes the us vary significantly from 125 million to one hundred million45 after the thirteen colonies revolted against great britain and established the united states president george washington and henry knox conceived of the idea of civilizing native americans in preparation for assimilation as us citizens678910 assimilation whether voluntary as with the choctaw1112 or forced became a consistent policy through american administrations during the 19th century the ideology of manifest destiny became integral to the american nationalist movement expansion of europeanamerican populations to the west after the american revolution resulted in increasing pressure on native american lands warfare between the groups and rising tensions in 1830 the us congress passed the indian removal act authorizing the government to relocate native americans from their homelands within established states to lands west of the mississippi river accommodating europeanamerican expansion this resulted in the ethnic cleansing of many tribes with the brutal forced marches coming to be known as the trail of tears as american expansion reached into the west settler and miner migrants came into increasing conflict with the great basin great plains and other western tribes these were complex nomadic cultures based on introduced horse culture and seasonal bison hunting they carried out resistance against united states incursion in the decades after the end of the civil war and the completion of the transcontinental railroad in a series of indian wars which were frequent up until the 1890s but continued into the 20th century over time the united states forced a series of treaties and land cessions by the tribes and established reservations for them in many western states us agents encouraged native americans to adopt europeanstyle farming and similar pursuits but europeanamerican agricultural technology of the time was inadequate for often dry reservation lands leading to mass starvation in 1924 native americans who were not already us citizens were granted citizenship by congress contemporary native americans have a unique relationship with the united states because they may be members of nations tribes or bands with sovereignty and treaty rights cultural activism since the late 1960s has increased political participation and led to an expansion of efforts to teach and preserve indigenous languages for younger generations and to establish a greater cultural infrastructure native americans have founded independent newspapers and online media recently including first nations experience the first native american television channel13 established native american studies programs tribal schools and universities and museums and language programs and have increasingly been published as authors the terms used to refer to native americans have at times been controversial the ways native americans refer to themselves vary by region and generation with many older native americans selfidentifying as indians or american indians while younger native americans often identify as indigenous or aboriginal the term native american has not traditionally included native hawaiians or certain alaskan natives such as aleut yupik or inuit peoples by comparison the indigenous peoples of canada are generally known as first nations14 historyedit main article history of native americans in the united states precolumbian eraedit main articles paleoindians and precolumbian era this map shows the approximate location of the icefree corridor and specific paleoindian sites clovis theory it is not definitively known how or when the native americans first settled the americas and the presentday united states the prevailing theory proposes that people migrated from eurasia across beringia a land bridge that connected siberia to presentday alaska during the ice age and then spread southward throughout the americas over the subsequent generations genetic evidence suggests at least three waves of migrants arrived from asia with the first occurring at least 15 thousand years ago15 these migrations may have begun as early as 30000 years ago16 and continued through to about 10000 years ago when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the ending of the last glacial period17 these early inhabitants called paleoamericans soon diversified into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes the precolumbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the americas before the appearance of significant european influences on the american continents spanning the time of the original settlement in the upper paleolithic period to european colonization during the early modern period while technically referring to the era before christopher columbus voyages of 1492 to 1504 in practice the term usually includes the history of american indigenous cultures until they were conquered or significantly influenced by europeans even if this happened decades or even centuries after columbus initial landing settlement of the americasedit native development prior to european contactedit the cultural areas of precolumbian north america according to alfred kroeber native american cultures are not normally included in characterizations of advanced stone age cultures as neolithic which is a category that more often includes only the cultures in eurasia africa and other regions the archaeological periods used are the classifications of archaeological periods and cultures established in gordon willey and philip phillips 1958 book method and theory in american archaeology they divided the archaeological record in the americas into five phases18 see archaeology of the americas the clovis culture a megafauna hunting culture is primarily identified by use of fluted spear points artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near clovis new mexico the clovis culture ranged over much of north america and also appeared in south america the culture is identified by the distinctive clovis point a flaked flint spearpoint with a notched flute by which it was inserted into a shaft dating of clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of carbon dating methods recent reexaminations of clovis materials using improved carbondating methods produced results of 11050 and 10800 radiocarbon years bp roughly 9100 to 8850 bce numerous paleoindian cultures occupied north america with some arrayed around the great plains and great lakes of the modern united states and canada as well as adjacent areas to the west and southwest according to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the americas they have been living on this continent since their genesis described by a wide range of traditional creation stories other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river believed to be the mississippi river19 genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast asians archeological and linguistic data has enabled scholars to discover some of the migrations within the americas a folsom point for a spear the folsom tradition was characterized by use of folsom points as projectile tips and activities known from kill sites where slaughter and butchering of bison took place folsom tools were left behind between 9000 bce and 8000 bce20 nadenéspeaking peoples entered north america starting around 8000 bce reaching the pacific northwest by 5000 bce21 and from there migrating along the pacific coast and into the interior linguists anthropologists and archaeologists believe their ancestors comprised a separate migration into north america later than the first paleoindians they migrated into alaska and northern canada south along the pacific coast into the interior of canada and south to the great plains and the american southwest they were the earliest ancestors of the athabascanspeaking peoples including the presentday and historical navajo and apache they constructed large multifamily dwellings in their villages which were used seasonally people did not live there yearround but for the summer to hunt and fish and to gather food supplies for the winter22 the oshara tradition people lived from 5500 bce to 600 ce they were part of the southwestern archaic tradition centered in northcentral new mexico the san juan basin the rio grande valley southern colorado and southeastern utah since the 1990s archeologists have explored and dated eleven middle archaic sites in presentday louisiana and florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple earthwork mounds they were societies of huntergatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of neolithic revolution to sustain such large villages over long periods the prime example is watson brake in northern louisiana whose 11mound complex is dated to 3500 bce making it the oldest dated site in the americas for such complex construction it is nearly 2000 years older than the poverty point site construction of the mounds went on for 500 years until was abandoned about 2800 bce probably due to changing environmental conditions23 poverty point culture is a late archaic archaeological culture that inhabited the area of the lower mississippi valley and surrounding gulf coast the culture thrived from 2200 bce to 700 bce during the late archaic period24 evidence of this culture has been found at more than 100 sites from the major complex at poverty point louisiana a unesco world heritage site across a 100mile 160 km range to the jaketown site near belzoni mississippi totem poles in wrangell alaska poverty point is a 1 square mile 26 km2 complex of six major earthwork concentric rings with additional platform mounds at the site artifacts show the people traded with other native americans located from georgia to the great lakes region this is one among numerous mound sites of complex indigenous cultures throughout the mississippi and ohio valleys they were one of several succeeding cultures often referred to as mound builders the woodland period of north american precolumbian cultures refers to the time period from roughly 1000 bce to 1000 ce in the eastern part of north america the term woodland was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites dated between the archaic period and the mississippian cultures the hopewell tradition is the term for the common aspects of the native american culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern united states from 200 bce to 500 ce25 the indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast were of many nations and tribal affiliations each with distinctive cultural and political identities but they shared certain beliefs traditions and practices such as the centrality of salmon as a resource and spiritual symbol their giftgiving feast potlatch is a highly complex event where people gather in order to commemorate special events these events include the raising of a totem pole or the appointment or election of a new chief the most famous artistic feature of the culture is the totem pole with carvings of animals and other characters to commemorate cultural beliefs legends and notable events the hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society but a widely dispersed set of related populations who were connected by a common network of trade routes26 known as the hopewell exchange system at its greatest extent the hopewell exchange system ran from the southeastern united states into the southeastern canadian shores of lake ontario within this area societies participated in a high degree of exchange most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes the hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over the united states major culturesedit adena cultureedit grave creek mound located in moundsville west virginia is one of the largest conical mounds in the united states it was built by the adena culture adena culture the adena culture was a native american culture that existed from 1000 bc to 200 bc in a time known as the early woodland period the adena culture refers to what were probably a number of related native american societies sharing a burial complex and ceremonial system a map showing the extent of the coles creek cultural period and some important sites coles creek culture the coles creek culture is an indigenous development of the lower mississippi valley that took place between the terminal woodland period and the later plaquemine culture period the period is marked by the increased use of flattopped platform mounds arranged around central plazas more complex political institutions and a subsistence strategy still grounded in the eastern agricultural complex and hunting rather than on the maize plant as would happen in the succeeding plaquemine mississippian period the culture was originally defined by the unique decoration on grogtempered ceramic ware by james a ford after his investigations at the mazique archeological site he had studied both the mazique and coles creek sites and almost went with the mazique culture but decided on the less historically involved sites name it is ancestral to the plaquemine culture hohokam cultureedit the great house at the casa grande ruins national monument hohokam culture the hohokam was a culture centered along american southwest27 the early hohokam founded a series of small villages along the middle gila river they raised corn squash and beans the communities were located near good arable land with dry farming common in the earlier years of this period27 they were known for their pottery using the paddleandanvil technique the classical period of the culture saw the rise in architecture and ceramics buildings were grouped into walled compounds as well as earthen platform mounds platform mounds were built along river as well as irrigation canal systems suggesting these sites were administrative centers allocating water and coordinating canal labor polychrome pottery appeared and inhumation burial replaced cremation trade included that of shells and other exotics social and climatic factors led to a decline and abandonment of the area after 1400 ad ancestral puebloan archeological sites the great kiva of chetro ketl at the chaco culture national historical park unesco

puebloan culture covered presentday four corners region of the united states comprising southern utah northern arizona northwestern new mexico and southwestern colorado28 it is believed that the ancestral puebloans developed at least in part from the oshara tradition who developed from the picosa culture they lived in a range of structures that included small family pit houses larger clan type structures grand pueblos and cliff sited dwellings the ancestral puebloans possessed a complex network that stretched across the colorado plateau linking hundreds of communities and population

cultureedit mississippian culture the mississippian culture which extended throughout the ohio and mississippi valleys and built sites throughout the southeast created the largest earthworks in north america north of mexico most notably at cahokia on a tributary of the mississippi river in presentday illinois the tenstory monks mound at cahokia has a larger circumference than the pyramid of the sun at teotihuacan or the great pyramid of egypt the 6 square miles 16 km2 city complex was based on the cultures cosmology it included more than 100 mounds positioned to support their sophisticated knowledge of astronomy and built with knowledge of varying soil types the society began building at this site about 950 ce and reached its peak population in 1250 ce of 20000–30000 people which was not equalled by any city in the presentday united states until after 1800 cahokia was a major regional chiefdom with trade and tributary chiefdoms located in a range of areas from bordering the great lakes to the gulf of mexico kincaid29 c 10501400 ad30 is one of the largest settlements of the mississippian culture it was located at the southern tip of presentday us state of illinois kincaid mounds has been notable for both its significant role in native north american prehistory and for the central role the site has played in the development of modern archaeological techniques the site had at least 11 substructure platform mounds ranking fifth for moundculture pyramids artifacts from the settlement link its major habitation and the construction of the mounds to the mississippian period but it was also occupied earlier during the woodland period the mississippian culture developed the southeastern ceremonial complex the name which archeologists have given to the regional stylistic similarity of artifacts iconography ceremonies and mythology the rise of the complex culture was based on the peoples adoption of maize agriculture development of greater population densities and chiefdomlevel complex social organization from 1200 ce to 1650 ce3132 the mississippian pottery are some of the finest and most widely spread ceramics north of mexico cahokian pottery was espically fine with smooth surfaces very thin walls and distinctive tempering slips and coloring33 iroquois cultureedit map of the five nations of the iroquois from the darlington collection iroquois culture the iroquois league of nations or people of the long house based in presentday upstate and western new york had a confederacy model from the mid15th century it has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the later united states government their system of affiliation was a kind of federation different from the strong centralized european monarchies343536 leadership was restricted to a group of 50 sachem chiefs each representing one clan within a tribe the oneida and mohawk people had nine seats each the onondagas held fourteen the cayuga had ten seats and the seneca had eight representation was not based on population numbers as the seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others when a sachem chief died his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan property and hereditary leadership were passed matrilineally decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making with each sachem chief holding theoretical veto power the onondaga were the firekeepers responsible for raising topics to be discussed they occupied one side of a threesided fire the mohawk and seneca sat on one side of the fire the oneida and cayuga sat on the third side36 elizabeth tooker an anthropologist has said that it was unlikely the us founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the united states for example it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership selected by female members of the tribes consensus decisionmaking regardless of population size of the tribes and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body36 longdistance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where europeans encountered them the iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the ohio river area of presentday kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th century or in the 17th century beaver wars37 through warfare the iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the mississippi river tribes originating in the ohio valley who moved west included the osage kaw ponca and omaha people by the mid17th century they had resettled in their historical lands in presentday kansas nebraska arkansas and oklahoma the osage warred with caddospeaking native americans displacing them in turn by the mid18th century and dominating their new historical territories37 european exploration and colonizationedit main

first major contacts were in florida and the gulf coast by spanish explorers38 impact on native populationsedit main article population history of indigenous peoples of the americas from the 16th through the 19th centuries the population of indians sharply declined39 most mainstream scholars believe that among the various contributing factors40 epidemic disease was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the native americans because of their lack of immunity to new diseases brought from europe41424344 it is difficult to estimate the number of precolumbian native americans who were living in what is today the united states of america45 estimates range from a low of 21 million to a high of 18 million dobyns 19834546 by 1800 the native population of the presentday united states had declined to approximately 600000 and only 250000 native americans remained in the 1890s47 chicken pox and measles endemic but rarely fatal among europeans long after being introduced from asia often proved deadly to native americans48495051 in the 100 years following the arrival of the spanish to the americas large disease epidemics depopulated large parts of the eastern united states in the 16th century52 there are a number of documented cases where diseases were deliberately spread among native americans as a form of biological warfare the most well known example occurred in 1763 when sir jeffrey amherst commanderinchief of the forces of the british army wrote praising the use of smallpox infected blankets to extirpate the indian race blankets infected with smallpox were given to native americans besieging fort pitt the effectiveness of the attempt is unclear535455 in 1634 fr andrew white of the society of jesus established a mission in what is now the state of maryland and the purpose of the mission stated through an interpreter to the chief of an indian tribe there was to extend civilization and instruction to his ignorant race and show them the way to heaven56 fr andrews diaries report that by 1640 a community had been founded which they named st marys and the indians were sending their children there to be educated among the english57 this included the daughter of the piscataway indian chief tayac which exemplifies not only a school for indians but either a school for girls or an early coed school the same records report that in 1677 a school for humanities was opened by our society in the centre of maryland directed by two of the fathers and the native youth applying themselves assiduously to study made good progress maryland and the recently established school sent two boys to st omer who yielded in abilities to few europeans when competing for the honor of being first in their class so that not gold nor silver nor the other products of the earth alone but men also are gathered from thence to bring those regions which foreigners have unjustly called ferocious to a higher state of virtue and cultivation58 through the mid 17th century the beaver wars were fought over the fur trade between the iroquois and the hurons the northern algonquians and their french allies during the war the iroquois destroyed several large tribal confederacies—including the huron neutral erie susquehannock and shawnee and became dominant in the region and enlarged their territory in 1727 the sisters of the order of saint ursula founded ursuline academy in new orleans which is currently the oldest continuously operating school for girls and the oldest catholic school in the united states from the time of its foundation it offered the first classes for native american girls and would later offer classes for female africanamerican slaves and free women of color 1882 studio portrait of the then last surviving six nations warriors who fought with the british in the war of 1812 between 1754 and 1763 many native american tribes were involved in the french and indian warseven years war those involved in the fur trade tended to ally with french forces against british colonial militias the british had made fewer allies but it was joined by some tribes that wanted to prove assimilation and loyalty in support of treaties to preserve their territories they were often disappointed when such treaties were later overturned the tribes had their own purposes using their alliances with the european powers to battle traditional native enemies some iroquois who were loyal to the british and helped them fight in the american revolution fled north into canada after european explorers reached the west coast in the 1770s smallpox rapidly killed at least 30 of northwest coast native americans for the next eighty to one hundred years smallpox and other diseases devastated native populations in the region59 puget sound area populations once estimated as high as 37000 people were reduced to only 9000 survivors by the time settlers arrived en masse in the mid19th century60 smallpox epidemics in 1780–82 and 1837–38 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the plains indians6162 by 1832 the federal government established a smallpox vaccination program for native americans the indian vaccination act of 1832 it was the first federal program created to address a health problem of native americans6364 animal introductionsedit with the meeting of two worlds animals insects and plants were carried from one to the other both deliberately and by chance in what is called the columbian exchange65 in the 16th century spaniards and other europeans brought horses to mexico some of the horses escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild as native americans adopted use of the animals they began to change their cultures in substantial ways especially by extending their nomadic ranges for hunting the reintroduction of the horse to north america had a profound impact on native american culture of the great plains 17th centuryedit king philips waredit main article king philips war king

georgia in england july 1734 the painting shows a native american boy in a blue coat and woman in a red dress in european clothing during the american revolution the newly proclaimed united states competed with the british for the allegiance of native american nations east of the mississippi river most native americans who joined the struggle sided with the british based both on their trading relationships and hopes that colonial defeat would result in a halt to further colonial expansion onto native american land the first native community to sign a treaty with the new united states government was the lenape in 1779 the sullivan expedition was carried out during the american revolutionary war against the british and the four allied nations of the iroquois george washington gave orders that made it clear he wanted the iroquois threat completely eliminated the expedition you are appointed to command is to be directed against the hostile tribes of the six nations of indians with their associates and adherents the immediate objects are the total destruction and devastation of their settlements and the capture of as many prisoners of every age and sex as possible it will be essential to ruin their crops now in the ground and prevent their planting more69 the british made peace with the americans in the treaty of paris 1783 through which they ceded vast native american territories to the united states without informing or consulting with the native americans the united statesedit the united states was eager to expand to develop farming and settlements in new areas and to satisfy land hunger of settlers from new england and new immigrants the national government initially sought to purchase native american land by treaties the states and settlers were frequently at odds with this policy70 united states policy toward native americans continued to evolve after the american revolution george washington and henry knox believed that native americans were equals but that their society was inferior washington formulated a policy to encourage the civilizing process7 washington had a sixpoint plan for civilization which included impartial justice toward native americans regulated buying of native american lands promotion of commerce promotion of experiments to civilize or improve native american society presidential authority to give presents punishing those who violated native american rights9 benjamin hawkins seen here on his plantation teaches creek native americans how to use european technology painted in 1805 in the late 18th century reformers starting with washington and knox71 supported educating native children and adults in efforts to civilize or otherwise assimilate native americans to the larger society as opposed to relegating them to reservations the civilization fund act of 1819 promoted this civilization policy by providing funding to societies mostly religious who worked on native american improvement72 19th centuryedit following the us takeover of california famine violence and starvation caused the reduction of the indigenous population of california from 150000 in 1848 to just 15000 in 1900 during the california gold rush many natives were killed by incoming settlers as well as by militia units financed and organized by the california government73 some scholars contend that the state financing of these militias as well as the us governments role in other massacres in california such as the bloody island and yontoket massacres in which up to 400 or more natives were killed in each massacre constitutes a campaign of genocide against the native people of california7475 westward expansionedit tecumseh was the shawnee leader of tecumsehs war who attempted to organize an alliance of native american tribes throughout north america76 as american expansion continued native americans resisted settlers encroachment in several regions of the new nation and in unorganized territories from the northwest to the southeast and then in the west as settlers encountered the tribes of the great plains east of the mississippi river an intertribal army led by tecumseh a shawnee chief fought a number of engagements in the northwest during the period 1811–12 known as tecumsehs war during the war of 1812 tecumsehs forces allied themselves with the british after tecumsehs death the british ceased to aid the native americans south and west of upper canada and american expansion proceeded with little resistance conflicts in the southeast include the creek war and seminole wars both before and after the indian removals of most members of the five civilized tribes in the 1830s president andrew jackson signed the indian removal act of 1830 a policy of relocating indians from their homelands to indian territory and reservations in surrounding areas to open their lands for nonnative settlements77 this resulted in the trail of tears mass grave for the dead lakota following the 1890 wounded knee massacre which took place during the indian wars in the 19th century in july 1845 the new york newspaper editor john l osullivan coined the phrase manifest destiny as the design of providence supporting the territorial expansion of the united states78 manifest destiny had serious consequences for native americans since continental expansion for the united states took place at the cost of their occupied land79 a justification for the policy of conquest and subjugation of the indigenous people emanated from the stereotyped perceptions of all native americans as merciless indian savages as described in the united states declaration of independence80 the indian appropriations act of 1851 set the precedent for modernday native american reservations through allocating funds to move western tribes onto reservations since there were no more lands available for relocation native american nations on the plains in the west continued armed conflicts with the us throughout the 19th century through what were called generally indian wars81 notable conflicts in this period include the dakota war great sioux war snake war and colorado war expressing the frontier antiindian sentiment theodore roosevelt believed the indians were destined to vanish under the pressure of white civilization stating in an 1886 lecture i dont go so far as to think that the only good indians are dead indians but i believe nine out of ten are and i shouldnt like to inquire too closely into the case of the tenth82 the ghost dance ritual which the lakota believed would reunite the living with spirits of the dead cause the white invaders to vanish and bring peace prosperity and unity to indian peoples throughout the region among the most notable events during the wars was the wounded knee massacre in 189083 in the years leading up to it the us government had continued to seize lakota lands a ghost dance ritual on the northern lakota reservation at wounded knee south dakota led to the us armys attempt to subdue the lakota the dance was part of a religious movement founded by the northern paiute spiritual leader wovoka that told of the return of the messiah to relieve the suffering of native americans and promised that if they would live righteous lives and perform the ghost dance properly the european american colonists would vanish the bison would return and the living and the dead would be reunited in an edenic world83 on december 29 at wounded knee gunfire erupted and us soldiers killed up to 300 indians mostly old men women and children83 civil waredit for more details on

native americans served in both the union and confederate military during the american civil war at the outbreak of the war for example the minority party of the cherokees gave its allegiance to the confederacy while originally the majority party went for the north85 native americans fought knowing they might jeopardize their independence unique cultures and ancestral lands if they ended up on the losing side of the civil war8586 28693 native americans served in the union and confederate armies during the civil war participating in battles such as pea ridge second manassas antietam spotsylvania cold harbor and in federal assaults on petersburg8687 a few native american tribes such as the creek and the choctaw were slaveholders and found a political and economic commonality with the confederacy88 the choctaw owned over 2000 slaves89 removals and reservationsedit main article cultural assimilation of native americans further information list of indian reservations in the united states further information native american reservation politics in the 19th century the incessant westward expansion of the united states incrementally compelled large numbers of native americans to resettle further west often by force almost always reluctantly native americans believed this forced relocation illegal given the treaty of hopewell of 1785 under president andrew jackson united states congress passed the indian removal act of 1830 which authorized the president to conduct treaties to exchange native american land east of the mississippi river for lands west of the river as many as 100000 native americans relocated to the west as a result of this indian removal policy in theory relocation was supposed to be voluntary and many native americans did remain in the east in practice great pressure was put on native american leaders to sign removal treaties the most egregious violation the trail of tears was removal of the cherokee by president jackson to indian territory90 the 1864 deportation of the navajos by the us government occurred when 8000 navajos were forced to an internment camp in bosque redondo91 where under armed guards more than 3500 navajo and mescalero apache men women and children died from starvation and disease91 native americans and us citizenshipedit in 1817 the cherokee became the first native americans recognized as us citizens under article 8 of the 1817 cherokee treaty upwards of 300 cherokees heads of families in the honest simplicity of their souls made an election to become american citizens1292 factors establishing citizenship included treaty provision as with the cherokee registration and land allotment under the dawes act of february 8 1887 issuance of patent in fee simple adopting habits of civilized life

states that all persons born in the united states and not subject to any foreign power excluding indians not taxed are hereby declared to be citizens of the united states93 indian appropriations act of 1871edit in 1871 congress added a rider to the indian appropriations act signed into law by president ulysses s grant ending united states recognition of additional native american tribes or independent nations and prohibiting additional treaties94 educationedit main article indian boarding schools after the indian wars in the late 19th century the government established native american boarding schools initially run primarily by or affiliated with christian missionaries95 at this time american society thought that native american children needed to be acculturated to the general society the boarding school experience was a total immersion in modern american society but it could prove traumatic to children who were forbidden to speak their native languages they were taught christianity and not allowed to practice their native religions and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their native american identities969798 before the 1930s schools on the reservations provided no schooling beyond the sixth grade to obtain more boarding school was usually necessary99 small reservations with a few hundred people usually sent their children to nearby public schools the indian new deal of the 1930s closed many of the boarding schools and downplayed the assimilationist goals the indian division of the civilian conservation corps operated largescale construction projects on the reservations building thousands of new schools and community buildings under the leadership of john collier the bia brought in progressive educators to reshape indian education the bureau of indian affairs bia by 1938 taught 30000 students in 377 boarding and day schools or 40 of all indian children in school the navajo largely opposed schooling of any sort but the other tribes accepted the system there were now high schools on larger reservations educating not only teenagers but also an adult audience there were no indian facilities for higher education100101 they deemphasized textbooks emphasized selfesteem and started teaching indian history they promoted traditional arts and crafts of the sort that could be conducted on the reservations such as making jewelry the new deal reformers met significant resistance from parents and teachers and had mixed results world war ii brought younger indians in contact with the broader society through military service and work in the munitions industries the role of schooling was changed to focus on vocational education for jobs in urban america102 since the rise of selfdetermination for native americans they have generally emphasized education of their children at schools near where they live in addition many federally recognized tribes have taken over operations of such schools and added programs of language retention and revival to strengthen their cultures beginning in the 1970s tribes have also founded colleges at their reservations controlled and operated by native americans to educate their young for jobs as well as to pass on their cultures 20th centuryedit charles curtis of kaw osage potawatomi french and british ancestry from kansas was 31st vice president of the united states 1929–1933 serving with herbert hoover on august 29 1911 ishi generally considered to have been the last native american to live most of his life without contact with europeanamerican culture was discovered near oroville california103104105 in 1919 the united states under president woodrow wilson granted citizenship to all native americans who had served in world war i nearly 10000 men had enlisted and served a high number in relation to their population106 despite this in many areas native americans faced local resistance when they tried to vote and were discriminated against with barriers to voter registration on june 2 1924 us president calvin coolidge signed the indian citizenship act which made all native americans born in the united states and its territories american citizens prior to passage of the act nearly twothirds of native americans were already us citizens through marriage military service or accepting land allotments107108 the act extended citizenship to all noncitizen indians born within the territorial limits of the united states106 charles curtis a congressman and longtime us senator from kansas was of kaw osage potawatomi and european ancestry after serving as a united states representative and being repeatedly reelected as united states senator from kansas curtis served as senate minority whip for 10 years and as senate majority leader for five years he was very influential in the senate in 1928 he ran as the vicepresidential candidate with herbert hoover for president and served from 1929 to 1933 he was the first person with significant native american ancestry and the first person with acknowledged noneuropean ancestry to be elected to either of the highest offices in the land american indians today in the united states have all the rights guaranteed in the us constitution can vote in elections and run for political office controversies remain over how much the federal government has jurisdiction over tribal affairs sovereignty and cultural practices109 midcentury the indian termination policy and the indian relocation act of 1956 marked a new direction for assimilating native americans into urban life the census counted 332000 indians in 1930 and 334000 in 1940 including those on and off reservations in the 48 states total spending on indians averaged 38 million a year in the late 1920s dropping to a low of 23 million in 1933 and returning to 38 million in 1940110 world war iiedit for more details on this topic see native americans and world war ii general douglas macarthur meeting navajo pima pawnee and other native american troops some 44000 native americans served in the united states military during world war ii at the time onethird of all ablebodied indian men from eighteen to fifty years of age111 described as the first largescale exodus of indigenous peoples from the reservations since the removals of the 19th century the mens service with the us military in the international conflict was a turning point in native american history the overwhelming majority of native americans welcomed the opportunity to serve they had a voluntary enlistment rate that was 40 higher than those drafted112 their fellow soldiers often held them in high esteem in part since the legend of the tough native american warrior had become a part of the fabric of american historical legend white servicemen sometimes showed a lighthearted respect toward native american comrades by calling them chief the resulting increase in contact with the world outside of the reservation system brought profound changes to native american culture the war said the us indian commissioner in 1945 caused the greatest disruption of native life since the beginning of the reservation era affecting the habits views and economic wellbeing of tribal members113 the most significant of these changes was the opportunity—as a result of wartime labor shortages—to find wellpaying work in cities and many people relocated to urban areas particularly on the west coast with the buildup of the defense industry there were also losses as a result of the war for instance a total of 1200 pueblo men served in world war ii only about half came home alive in addition many more navajo served as code talkers for the military in the pacific the code they made although cryptologically very simple was never cracked by the japanese selfdeterminationedit main articles native american selfdetermination and native american civil rights military service and urban residency contributed to the rise of american indian activism particularly after the 1960s and the occupation of alcatraz island 1969–1971 by a student indian group from san francisco in the same period the american indian movement aim was founded in minneapolis and chapters were established throughout the country where american indians combined spiritual and political activism political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the american public through the mid1970s conflicts between governments and native americans occasionally erupted into violence a notable late 20thcentury event was the wounded knee incident on the pine ridge indian reservation upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights about 300 oglala lakota and aim activists took control of wounded knee on february 27 1973114 indian activists from around the country joined them at pine ridge and the occupation became a symbol of rising american indian identity and power federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town and the two sides had a standoff for 71 days during much gunfire one united states marshal was wounded and paralyzed in late april a cherokee and local lakota man were killed by gunfire the lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost114 in june 1975 two fbi agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at pine ridge reservation were wounded in a firefight and killed at close range the aim activist leonard peltier was sentenced in 1976 to two consecutive terms of life in prison in the fbi deaths115 in 1968 the government enacted the indian civil rights act this gave tribal members most of the protections against abuses by tribal governments that the bill of rights accords to all us citizens with respect to the federal government116 in 1975 the us government passed the indian selfdetermination and education assistance act marking the culmination of fifteen years of policy changes it resulted from american indian activism the civil rights movement and community development aspects of president lyndon johnsons social programs of the 1960s the act recognized the right and need of native americans for selfdetermination it marked the us governments turn away from the 1950s policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government the us government encouraged native americans efforts at selfgovernment and determining their futures tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social welfare and housing programs for instance tribal selfdetermination has created tension with respect to the federal governments historic trust obligation to care for indians however the bureau of indian affairs has never lived up to that responsibility117 tribal collegesedit main article tribal colleges and universities navajo community college now called diné college the first tribal college was founded in tsaile arizona in 1968 and accredited in 1979 tensions immediately arose between two philosophies one that the tribal colleges should have the same criteria curriculum and procedures for educational quality as mainstream colleges the other that the faculty and curriculum should be closely adapted to the particular historical culture of the tribe there was a great deal of turnover exacerbated by very tight budgets118 in 1994 the us congress passed legislation recognizing the tribal colleges as landgrant colleges which provided opportunities for largescale funding thirtytwo tribal colleges in the united states belong to the american indian higher education consortium by the early 21st century tribal nations had also established numerous language revival programs in their schools in addition native american activism has led major universities across the country to establish native american studies programs and departments increasing awareness of the strengths of indian cultures providing opportunities for academics and deepening research on history and cultures in the united states native americans have entered academia journalism and media politics at local state and federal levels and public service for instance influencing medical research and policy to identify issues related to american indians 21st centuryedit byron mallott an alaska native is the current democratic lieutenant governor of alaska in 2009 an apology to native peoples of the united states was included in the defense appropriations act it states that the us apologizes on behalf of the people of the united states to all native peoples for the many instances of violence maltreatment and neglect inflicted on native peoples by citizens of the united states119 in 2013 jurisdiction over persons who were not tribal members under the violence against women act was extended to indian country this closed a gap which prevented arrest or prosecution by tribal police or courts of abusive partners of tribal members who were not native or from another tribe120121 migration to urban areas continued to grow with 70 of native americans living in urban areas in 2012 up from 45 in 1970 and 8 in 1940 urban areas with significant native american

the united states these tribes possess the right to form their own governments to enforce laws both civil and criminal within their lands to tax to establish requirements for membership to license and regulate activities to zone and to exclude persons from tribal territories limitations on tribal powers of selfgovernment include the same limitations applicable to states for example neither tribes nor states have the power to make war engage in foreign relations or coin money this includes paper currency134 many native americans and advocates of native american rights point out that the us federal governments claim to recognize the sovereignty of native american peoples falls short given that the united states wishes to govern native american peoples and treat them as subject to us law135 such advocates contend that full respect for native american sovereignty would require the us government to deal with native american peoples in the same manner as any other sovereign nation handling matters related to relations with native americans through the secretary of state rather than the bureau of indian affairs the bureau of indian affairs reports on its website that its responsibility is the administration and management of 55700000 acres 225000 km2 of land held in trust by the united states for american indians indian tribes and alaska natives136 many native americans and advocates of native american rights believe that it is condescending for such lands to be considered held in trust and regulated in any fashion by other than their own tribes whether the us or canadian governments or any other nonnative american authority as of 2000 the largest groups in the united states by population were navajo cherokee choctaw sioux chippewa apache blackfeet iroquois and pueblo in 2000 eight of ten americans with native american ancestry were of mixed ancestry it is estimated that by 2100 that figure will rise to nine out of ten137 in addition there are a number of tribes that are recognized by individual states but not by the federal government the rights and benefits associated with state recognition vary from state to state some tribal groups have been unable to document the cultural continuity required for federal recognition the muwekma ohlone of the san francisco bay area are pursuing litigation in the federal court system to establish recognition138 many of the smaller eastern tribes long considered remnants of extinct peoples have been trying to gain official recognition of their tribal status several tribes in virginia and north carolina have gained state recognition federal recognition confers some benefits including the right to label arts and crafts as native american and permission to apply for grants that are specifically reserved for native americans but gaining federal recognition as a tribe is extremely difficult to be established as a tribal group members have to submit extensive genealogical proof of tribal descent and continuity of the tribe as a culture native peoples are concerned about the effects of abandoned uranium mines on or near their lands in july 2000 the washington state republican party adopted a resolution recommending that the federal and legislative branches of the us government terminate tribal governments139 in 2007 a group of democratic party congressmen and congresswomen introduced a bill in the us house of representatives to terminate the cherokee nation140 this was related to their voting to exclude cherokee freedmen as members of the tribe unless they had a cherokee ancestor on the dawes rolls although all cherokee freedmen and their descendants had been members since 1866 as of 2004 various native americans are wary of attempts by others to gain control of their reservation lands for natural resources such as coal and uranium in the west141142 in the state of virginia native americans face a unique problem virginia has no federally recognized tribes but the state has recognized eight this is related historically to the greater impact of disease and warfare on the virginia indian populations as well as their intermarriage with europeans and africans some people confused the ancestry with culture but groups of virginia indians maintained their cultural continuity most of their early reservations were ended under the pressure of early european settlement some historians also note the problems of virginia indians in establishing documented continuity of identity due to the work of walter ashby plecker 1912–1946 as registrar of the states bureau of vital statistics he applied his own interpretation of the onedrop rule enacted in law in 1924 as the states racial integrity act it recognized only two races white and colored plecker a segregationist believed that the states native americans had been mongrelized by intermarriage with african americans to him ancestry determined identity rather than culture he thought that some people of partial black ancestry were trying to pass as native americans plecker thought that anyone with any african heritage had to be classified as colored regardless of appearance amount of european or native american ancestry and culturalcommunity identification plecker pressured local governments into reclassifying all native americans in the state as colored and gave them lists of family surnames to examine for reclassification based on his interpretation of data and the law this led to the states destruction of accurate records related to families and communities who identified as native american as in church records and daily life by his actions sometimes different members of the same family were split by being classified as white or colored he did not allow people to enter their primary identification as native american in state records143 in 2009 the senate indian affairs committee endorsed a bill that would grant federal recognition to tribes in virginia144 to achieve federal recognition and its benefits tribes must prove continuous existence since 1900 the federal government has maintained this requirement in part because through participation on councils and committees federally recognized tribes have been adamant about groups satisfying the same requirements as they did143 contemporary issuesedit main article contemporary

lone ranger television series 1949–57 came to prominence roles of native americans were limited and not reflective of native american culture by the 1970s some native american film roles began to show more complexity such as those in little big man 1970 billy jack 1971 and the outlaw josey wales 1976 which depicted native americans in minor supporting roles for years native people on us television were relegated to secondary subordinate roles during the years of the series bonanza 1959–1973 no major or secondary native characters appeared on a consistent basis the series the lone ranger 1949–1957 cheyenne 1955–1963 and law of the plainsman 1959–1963 had native characters who were essentially aides to the central white characters this continued in such series as how the west was won these programs resembled the sympathetic yet contradictory film dances with wolves of 1990 in which according to ella shohat and robert stam the narrative choice was to relate the lakota story as told through a euroamerican voice for wider impact among a general audience156 like the 1992 remake of the last of the mohicans and geronimo an american legend 1993 dances with wolves employed a number of

american indians the term native american was introduced in the united states in preference to the older term indian to distinguish the indigenous peoples of the americas from the people of india and to avoid negative stereotypes associated with the term indian many indigenous americans however prefer the term american indian158 and many tribes include the word indian in their formal title criticism of the neologism native american comes from diverse sources russell means an american indian activist opposed the term native american because he believed it was imposed by the government without the consent of american indians he has also argued that the use of the word indian derives not from a confusion with india but from a spanish expression en dio meaning in god159 a 1995 us census bureau survey found that more native americans in the united states preferred american indian to native american158 most american indians are comfortable with indian american indian and native american and the terms are often used interchangeably160 the traditional term is reflected in the name chosen for the national museum of the american indian which opened in 2004 on the mall in

culture from the inside out these tribes refuse to participate in the gambling industry financial servicesedit numerous tribes around the country have entered the financial services market including the otoemissouria tunicabiloxi and the rosebud sioux because of the challenges involved in starting a financial services business from scratch many tribes hire outside consultants and vendors to help

have higher rates of substance and alcohol abuse deaths than the general population180 many american indians can trace the beginning of their substance and alcohol abuse to a traumatic event related to their offenders own substance abuse181 a person’s substance abuse can be described as a defense mechanism against the user’s emotions and trauma182 for american indians alcoholism is a symptom of

shame among american indians can be attributed to the hundreds of years of discrimination182 solutionsedit american indians do not view mind body and soul as separate from each other or themselves as the western worldview does american indians believe all is connected and related to each other182 american indian psychologists have been asked to use mental health practices that cultivate american indian values rather than using conventional ways of counseling185 the wellbriety movement creates a space for american indians to learn how to reconnect with their culture by using culturally specific principles to become and remain sober180 some examples are burning sage cedar and sweetgrass as a means to cleanse physical and spiritual spaces verbally saying prayers and singing in one’s

through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home190 this plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years will result in 80 or more of the cherokee people being fluent in the language191 the cherokee preservation foundation has invested 3 million in opening schools training teachers and developing curricula for language education as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used191 formed in 2006 the kituwah preservation education program kpep on the qualla boundary focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to fifth grade developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the cherokee language among adults192

varying climate some ingenuity was needed for agriculture to be successful the climate in the southwest ranged from cool moist mountains regions to dry sandy soil in the desert some innovations of the time included irrigation to bring water into the dry regions and the selection of seed based on the traits of the growing plants that bore them in the southwest they grew beans that were selfsupported much like the way they are grown today in the east however they were planted next to corn in order for the vines to be able to climb the cornstalks the most important crop the native americans raised was maize it was first started in mesoamerica and spread north about 2000 years ago it reached eastern america this crop was important to the native americans because it was part of their everyday

was an immense chore since the native americans rotated fields frequently there is a tradition that squanto showed the pilgrims in new england how to put fish in fields to act like a fertilizer but the truth of this story is debated native americans did plant beans next to corn the beans would replace the nitrogen which the corn took from the ground as well as using corn stalks for support for climbing native americans used controlled fires to burn weeds and clear fields this would put nutrients back into the ground if this did not work they would simply abandon the field to let it be fallow and find a new spot for cultivation europeans in the eastern part of the continent observed that native americans cleared large areas for cropland their fields in new england sometimes covered hundreds of acres colonists in virginia noted thousands of acres under cultivation by native americans196 native americans commonly used tools such as the hoe maul and dibber the hoe was the main tool used to till the land and prepare it for planting then it was used for weeding the first versions were made out of wood and stone when the settlers brought iron native americans switched to iron hoes and hatchets the dibber was a digging stick used to plant the seed once the plants were harvested women prepared the produce for eating they used the maul to grind the corn into mash it was cooked and

case of conflicts between the couple if a couple separates or the man dies the woman has her family to assist her in matrilineal cultures the mothers brothers are usually the leading male figures in her childrens lives fathers have no standing in their wife and childrens clan as they still belong to their own mothers clan hereditary clan chief positions pass through the mothers line and chiefs have historically been selected on recommendation of women elders who also could disapprove of a chief in the patrilineal tribes such as the omaha osage and ponca hereditary leadership passes through the male line and children are considered to belong to the father and his clan in patrilineal tribes if a woman marries a nonnative she is no longer considered part of the tribe and her children are considered to share the ethnicity and culture of their father200 in some tribes men have historically hunted traded and made war while as lifegivers women have primary responsibility for the survival and welfare of the families and future of the tribe in many tribes women gather and cultivate plants use plants and herbs to treat illnesses care for the young and the elderly make all the clothing and instruments and process and cure meat and skins from the game some mothers use cradleboards to carry an infant while working or traveling201 in other tribes the gender roles are not so clearcut and are even less so in the modern era at least several dozen tribes allowed polygyny to sisters with procedural and economic limits189 apart from making homes women have many additional tasks that are also essential for the survival of the tribes historically they have made weapons and tools they take care of the roofs of their homes and often help the men hunt and fish202 in many tribes

skills technical expertise and the means to develop it reservations lack effective planning reservations are poor in natural resources reservations have natural resources but lack sufficient control over them reservations are disadvantaged by their distance from markets and the high costs of transportation teacher with picture cards giving english instruction to navajo day school students tribes

development tribal politicians and bureaucrats are inept or corrupt onreservation factionalism destroys stability in tribal decisions the instability of tribal government keeps outsiders from investing many tribes adopted constitutions by the 1934 indian reorganization act model with twoyear terms for elected positions of chief and council members deemed too short by the authors for getting things done entrepreneurial skills and experience are scarce tribal cultures get in the way a major barrier to development is the lack of entrepreneurial knowledge and experience within indian reservations a general lack of education and experience about business is a significant challenge to prospective entrepreneurs was the report on native american entrepreneurship by the northwest area foundation in 2004 native american communities that lack entrepreneurial traditions and recent experiences typically do not provide the support that entrepreneurs need to thrive consequently experiential entrepreneurship education needs to be embedded into school curricula and afterschool and other community activities this would allow students to learn the essential elements of entrepreneurship from a young age and encourage them to apply these elements throughout life222 rez biz magazine addresses these issues lillian gross described as a mixed blood by the smithsonian

immediate widespread and profound already during the early years of colonization and nationhood europeans living among native americans were often called white indians they lived in native communities for years learned native languages fluently attended native councils and often fought alongside their native companions226 early contact was often charged with tension and emotion but also had moments of friendship cooperation and intimacy227 marriages took place in english spanish and french colonies between native americans and europeans given the preponderance of men among the colonists in the early years generally european men married american indian women five indians and a captive painted by carl wimar 1855 there was fear on both sides as the different peoples realized how different their societies were227 the whites regarded the indians as savage because they were not christian they were suspicious of cultures which they did not understand227 the native american author andrew j blackbird wrote in his history of the ottawa and chippewa indians of michigan 1897 that white settlers introduced some immoralities into native american tribes many indians suffered because the europeans introduced alcohol and the whiskey trade resulted in alcoholism among the people who were alcoholintolerant227 blackbird wrote the ottawas and chippewas were quite virtuous in their primitive state as there were no illegitimate children reported in our old traditions but very lately this evil came to exist among the ottawasso lately that the second case among the ottawas of arbor croche is yet living in 1897 and from that time this evil came to be quite frequent for immorality has been introduced among these people by evil white persons who bring their vices into the tribes227 the us government had two purposes when making land agreements with native americans to open it up more land for white settlement227 and to ease tensions between whites and native americans by forcing the native americans to use the land in the same way as did the whites—for subsistence farms227 the government used a variety of strategies to achieve these goals many treaties required native americans to become farmers in order to keep their land227 government officials often did not translate the documents which native americans were forced to sign and native chiefs often had little or no idea what they were signing227 charles eastman was one of the first native americans to become certified as a medical doctor after he graduated from boston university228229 for a native american man to marry a white woman he had to get consent of her parents as long as he can prove to support her as a white woman in a good home230 in the early 19th century the shawnee tecumseh and blonde hair blueeyed rebbecca galloway had an interracial affair in the late 19th century three europeanamerican middleclass women teachers at hampton institute married native american men whom they had met as students231 as europeanamerican women started working independently at missions and indian schools in the western states there were more opportunities for their meeting and developing relationships with native american men for instance charles eastman a man of european and lakota descent whose father sent both his sons to dartmouth college got his medical degree at boston university and returned to the west to practice he married elaine goodale whom he met in south dakota he was the grandson of seth eastman a military officer from maine and a chiefs daughter goodale was a young

slavery dramatically native americans began selling war captives to europeans rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before as the demand for labor in the west indies grew with the cultivation of sugar cane europeans enslaved native americans for the thirteen colonies and some were exported to the sugar islands the british settlers especially those in the southern colonies purchased or captured native americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco rice and indigo accurate records of the numbers enslaved do not exist scholars estimate tens of thousands of native americans may have been enslaved by the europeans being sold by native americans themselves slaves became a caste of people who were foreign to the english native americans africans and

happen to be killed in such correction  the master shall be free of all punishment  as if such accident never happened — virginia general assembly declaration 1705232 the slave trade of native americans lasted only until around 1730 it gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes including the yamasee war the indian wars of the early 18th century combined with the increasing importation of african slaves effectively ended the native american slave trade by 1750 colonists found that native american slaves could easily escape as they knew the country the wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies the remaining native american groups banded together to face the europeans from a position of strength many surviving native american peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the choctaw the creek and the catawba for protection native american women were at risk for rape whether they were enslaved or not during the early colonial years settlers were disproportionately male they turned to native women for sexual relationships233 both native american and african enslaved women suffered rape and sexual harassment by male slaveholders and other white men233 native american slaveryedit further information slavery among native americans in the united states and slavery among indigenous peoples of the americas traditions of native american slaveryedit the majority of native american tribes did practice some form of slavery before the european introduction of african slavery into north america but none exploited slave labor on a large scale most native american tribes did not barter captives in the precolonial era although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for their own members234 the conditions of enslaved native americans varied among the tribes in many cases young enslaved captives were adopted into the tribes to replace warriors killed during warfare or by disease other tribes practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal members who had committed crimes but this status was only temporary as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society234 other native american groups such as those of the pacific northwest tended to own slaves with up to a quarter of some tribal populations consisting of slaves they were typically captured by raids on enemy tribes or purchased on intertribal slave markets slaves would often be killed in potlatches to signify the owners contempt for property slave raids especially among the haida of canada and alaska would often go far off from the points of origin with some slave raids going as far south as california slavery was a hereditary position—children of slaves were fated to be slaves themselves235 native american and african relationsedit further information black indians african and native americans have interacted for centuries the earliest record of native american and african contact occurred in april 1502 when spanish colonists transported the first africans to hispaniola to serve as slaves236 buffalo soldiers 1890 the nickname was given to the black cavalry by the native american tribes they fought sometimes native americans resented the presence of african americans237 the catawaba tribe in 1752 showed great anger and bitter resentment when an african american came among them as a trader237 to gain favor with europeans the cherokee exhibited the strongest color prejudice of all native americans237 he contends that because of european fears of a unified revolt of native americans and african americans the colonists encouraged hostility between the ethnic groups whites sought to convince native americans that african americans worked against their best interests238 in 1751 south carolina law stated the carrying of negroes among the indians has all along been thought detrimental as an intimacy ought to be avoided239 in addition in 1758 the governor of south carolina james glen wrote it has always been the policy of this government to create an aversion in them indians to negroes240 europeans considered both races inferior and made efforts to make both native americans and africans enemies241 native americans were rewarded if they returned escaped slaves and african americans were rewarded for fighting in the late 19thcentury indian wars241242243 ras kdee pomokenyan singer and editor from california native americans during the transitional period of africans becoming the primary race enslaved were enslaved at the same time and shared a common experience of enslavement they worked together lived together in communal quarters produced collective recipes for food shared herbal remedies myths and legends and in the end they intermarried244245 because of a shortage of men due to warfare many tribes encouraged marriage between the two groups to create stronger healthier children from the unions246 in the 18th century many native american women married freed or runaway african men due to a decrease in the population of men in native american villages241 records show that many native american women bought african men but unknown to the european sellers the women freed and married the men into their tribe241 when african men married or had children by a native american woman their children were born free because the mother was free according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem which the colonists incorporated into law241 european colonists often required the return of runaway slaves to be included as a provision in treaties with american indians in 1726 the british governor of new york exacted a promise from the iroquois to return all runaway slaves who had joined up with them247 in the mid1760s the government requested the huron and delaware to return runaway slaves but there was no record of slaves having been returned248 colonists placed ads about runaway slaves while numerous tribes used captive enemies as servants and slaves they also often adopted younger captives into their tribes to replace members who had died in the southeast a few native american tribes began to adopt a slavery system similar to that of the american colonists buying african american slaves especially the cherokee choctaw and creek though less than 3 of native americans owned slaves divisions grew among the native americans over slavery249 among the cherokee records show that slave holders in the tribe were largely the children of european men that had shown their children the economics of slavery242 as european colonists took slaves into frontier areas there were more opportunities for relationships between african and native american peoples241 based on the work of geneticists a pbs series on african americans explained that while most african americans are racially mixed it is relatively rare that they have native american ancestry250251 according to the pbs series the most common nonblack mix is english and scotsirish250251 some critics thought the pbs series did not sufficiently explain the limitations of dna testing for assessment of heritage252 another study suggests that relatively few native americans have africanamerican heritage253 a study reported in the american journal of human genetics stated we analyzed the european genetic contribution to 10 populations of african descent in the united states maywood illinois detroit new york philadelphia pittsburgh baltimore charleston south carolina new orleans and houston  mtdna haplogroups analysis shows no evidence of a significant maternal amerindian contribution to any of the 10 populations254 a few writers persist in the myth that most african americans have native american heritage255 dna testing has limitations and should not be depended on by individuals to answer all their questions about heritage252256 so far such testing cannot distinguish among the many distinct native american tribes no tribes accept dna testing to satisfy their differing qualifications for membership usually based on documented blood quantum or descent from ancestors listed on the dawes rolls257 native american adoption of african slaveryedit further information cherokee freedmen controversy native americans interacted with enslaved africans and african americans on many levels over time all the cultures interacted native americans began slowly to adopt white culture241 native americans in the south shared some experiences with africans especially during the period primarily in the 17th century when both were enslaved the colonists along the atlantic coast had begun enslaving native americans to ensure a source of labor at one time the slave trade was so extensive that it caused increasing tensions with the various algonquian tribes as well as the iroquois based in new york and pennsylvania they had threatened to attack colonists on behalf of the related iroquoian tuscarora before they migrated out of the south in the early 1700s244 in the 1790s benjamin hawkins was assigned as the us agent to the southeastern tribes who became known as the five civilized tribes for their adoption of numerous angloeuropean practices he advised the tribes to take up slaveholding to aid them in europeanstyle farming and plantations he thought their traditional form of slavery which had looser conditions was less efficient than chattel slavery240 in the 19th century some members of these tribes who were more closely associated with settlers began to purchase africanamerican slaves for workers they adopted some europeanamerican ways to benefit their people from the late 1700s to the 1860s the five civilized tribes were involved in the institution of african slavery as planters258 for example cherokee leader joseph vann owned more than 100 slaves the proportion of cherokee families who owned slaves did not exceed ten percent and was comparable to the percentage among white families across the south where a slaveholding elite owned most of the laborers259 the writer william loren katz contends that native americans treated their slaves better than did the typical white american in the deep south249 though less than 3 of native americans owned slaves bondage created destructive cleavages among those who were slaveholders among the five civilized tribes mixedrace slaveholders were generally part of an elite hierarchy often based on their mothers clan status as the societies had matrilineal systems as did benjamin hawkins european fur traders and colonial officials tended to marry highstatus women in strategic alliances seen to benefit both sides the choctaw creek and cherokee believed they benefited from stronger alliances with the traders and their societiescitation needed the womens sons gained their status from their mothers families they were part of hereditary leadership lines who exercised power and accumulated personal wealth in their changing native american societies the historian greg obrien calls them the creole generation to show that they were part of a changing societycitation needed the chiefs of the tribes believed that some of the new generation of mixedrace bilingual chiefs would lead their people into the future and be better able to adapt to new conditions influenced by european americans249 proposals for indian removal heightened the tensions of cultural changes due to the increase in the number of mixedrace native americans in the south full bloods who tended to live in areas less affected by colonial encroachment generally worked to maintain traditional ways including control of communal lands while the traditional members often resented the sale of tribal lands to angloamericans by the 1830s they agreed it was not possible to go to war with the colonists on this issue racial identityedit in the 2010 census nearly 3 million people indicated that their race was native american including alaska native260 of these more than 27 specifically indicated cherokee as their ethnic origin261262 many of the first families of virginia claim descent from pocahontas or some other indian princess this phenomenon has been dubbed the cherokee syndrome263 across the us numerous individuals cultivate an opportunistic ethnic identity as native american sometimes through cherokee heritage groups or indian wedding blessings264 many tribes especially those in the eastern united states are primarily made up of individuals with an unambiguous native american identity despite being predominantly of european ancestry264 point in case more than 75 of those enrolled in the cherokee nation have less than onequarter cherokee blood265 and the current principal chief of the cherokee nation bill john baker is 132 cherokee amounting to about 3 historically numerous native americans assimilated into colonial and later american society eg through adopting english and converting to christianity in many cases this process occurred through forced assimilation of children sent off to special boarding schools far from their families those who could pass for white had the advantage of white privilege264 today after generations of racial whitening through hypergamy many native americans are visually indistinguishable from white americans unlike mestizos in the united states who may in fact have little or no nonindigenous ancestry266 native americans are more likely than any other racial group to practice racial exogamy resulting in an everdeclining proportion of indigenous blood among those who claim a native american identity267 some tribes will even resort to disenrollment of tribal members unable to provide scientific proof of native ancestry usually through a certificate of degree of indian blood disenrollment has become a contentious issue in native american reservation politics268269 admixture and geneticsedit members of the creek muscogee nation in oklahoma around 1877 they include men with some european and african ancestry270 intertribal mixing was common among many native american tribes prior to european contact as they would adopt captives taken in warfare individuals often had ancestry from more than one tribe particularly after tribes lost so many members from disease in the colonial era and after40 bands or entire tribes occasionally split or merged to form more viable groups in reaction to the pressures of climate disease and warfare271 a number of tribes traditionally adopted captives into their group to replace members who had been captured or killed in battle such captives were from rival tribes and later were taken from raids on european settlements some tribes also sheltered or adopted white traders and runaway slaves and others owned slaves of their own tribes with long trading histories with europeans show a higher rate of european admixture reflecting years of intermarriage between native american women and european men often seen as advantageous to both sides271 a number of paths to genetic and ethnic diversity among native americans have occurred in recent years genetic genealogists have been able to determine the proportion of native american ancestry carried by the africanamerican population the literary and history scholar henry louis gates jr had experts on his tv programs who discussed africanamerican ancestry they stated that 5 of african americans have at least 125 native american ancestry or the equivalent to one greatgrandparent which may represent more than one distant ancestor a greater percentage could have a smaller proportion of indian ancestry but their conclusions show that popular estimates of native american admixture may have been too high272 dna testing is not sufficient to qualify a person for specific tribal membership as it cannot distinguish among native american tribes native american identity has historically been based on culture not just biology as many american indian peoples adopted captives from their enemies and assimilated them into their tribes the indigenous peoples council on biocolonialism ipcb notes that native american markers are not found solely among native americans while they occur more frequently among native americans they are also found in people in other parts of the world273 geneticists state not all native americans have been tested especially with the large number of deaths due to disease such as smallpox it is unlikely that native americans only have the genetic markers they have identified so far even when their maternal or paternal bloodline does not include a known nonnative american252256 tribal membershipedit to receive tribal services a native american must be a certified or enrolled member of a federally recognized tribal organization each tribal government makes its own rules for eligibility of citizens or tribal members among tribes qualification for enrollment may be based upon a required percentage of native american blood or the blood quantum of an individual seeking recognition or documented descent from an ancestor on the dawes rolls or other registers but the federal government has its own standards related to who qualifies for services available to certified native americans for instance federal scholarships for native americans require the student both to be enrolled in a federally recognized tribe and to be of at least onequarter native american descent equivalent to one grandparent attested to by a certificate of degree of indian blood cdib card issued by the federal government some tribes have begun requiring genealogical dna testing of individuals applying for membership but this is usually related to an individuals proving parentage or direct descent from a certified member274 requirements for tribal membership vary widely by tribe the cherokee require documented direct genealogical descent from a native american listed on the early 1906 dawes rolls tribal rules regarding recognition of members who have heritage from multiple tribes are equally diverse and complex tribal membership conflicts have led to a number of legal disputes court cases and the formation of activist groups one example of this are the cherokee freedmen today they include descendants of african americans once enslaved by the cherokees who were granted by federal treaty citizenship in the historic cherokee nation as freedmen after the civil war the modern cherokee nation in the early 1980s passed a law to require that all members must prove descent from a cherokee native american not cherokee freedmen listed on the dawes rolls resulting in the exclusion of some individuals and families who had been active in cherokee culture for years increased selfidentificationedit since the census of 2000 people may identify as being of more than one race127 since the 1960s the number of people claiming native american ancestry has grown significantly and by the 2000 census the number had more than doubled sociologists attribute this dramatic change to ethnic shifting or ethnic shopping they believe that it reflects a willingness of people to question their birth identities and adopt new ethnicities which they find more compatible the author jack hitt writes the reaction from lifelong indians runs the gamut it is easy to find native americans who denounce many of these new indians as members of the wannabe tribe but it is also easy to find indians like clem iron wing an elder among the lakota who sees this flood of new ethnic claims as magnificent a surge of indians trying to come home those indians who ridicule iron wings lax sense of tribal membership have retrofitted the old genocidal system of blood quantum—measuring racial purity by blood—into the new standard for real indianness a choice rich with paradox126 the journalist mary annette pember notes that identifying with native american culture may be a result of a persons increased interest in genealogy the romanticization of the lifestyle and a family tradition of native american ancestors in the distant past there are different issues if a person wants to pursue enrollment as a member of a tribe different tribes have different requirements for tribal membership in some cases persons are reluctant to enroll seeing it as a method of control initiated by the federal government and there are individuals who are 100 native american but because of their mixed tribal heritage do not qualify to belong to any individual tribe pember concludes the subjects of genuine american indian blood cultural connection and recognition by the community are extremely contentious issues hotly debated throughout indian country and beyond the whole situation some say is ripe for misinterpretation confusion and ultimately exploitationcitation needed geneticsedit main article genetic history of indigenous peoples of the americas see also ydna haplogroups in indigenous peoples of the americas the genetic history of indigenous peoples of the americas primarily focuses on human ychromosome dna haplogroups and human mitochondrial dna haplogroups ydna is passed solely along the patrilineal line from father to son while mtdna is passed down the matrilineal line from mother to offspring of both sexes neither recombines and thus ydna and mtdna change only by chance mutation at each generation with no intermixture between parents genetic material275 autosomal atdna markers are also used but differ from mtdna or ydna in that they overlap significantly276 autosomal dna is generally used to measure the average continentofancestry genetic admixture in the entire human genome and related isolated populations276 the genetic pattern indicates indigenous americans experienced two very distinctive genetic episodes first with the initialpeopling of the americas and secondly with european colonization of the americas277278279 the former is the determinant factor for the number of gene lineages zygosity mutations and founding haplotypes present in todays indigenous amerindian populations278 human settlement of the new world occurred in stages from the bering sea coast line with an initial 15000 to 20000year layover on beringia for the small founding population277280281 the microsatellite diversity and distributions of the y lineage specific to south america indicates that certain amerindian populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region282 the nadené inuit and indigenous alaskan populations exhibit haplogroup qm242 ydna mutations however that are distinct from other indigenous amerindians and that have various mtdna and atdna mutations283284285 this suggests that the paleoindian migrants into the northern extremes of north america and greenland were descended from a later independent migrant population286287 see alsoedit
