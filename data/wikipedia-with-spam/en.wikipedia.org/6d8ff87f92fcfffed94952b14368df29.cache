of what would become tv guide magazine was developed by lee wagner 1910–19934 who was the circulation director of macfadden publications in new york city in the 1930s – and later by the time of the predecessor publications creation for cowles media company – distributing magazines focusing on movie celebrities in 1948 he printed new york city area listings magazine the television guide silent film star gloria swanson who then starred of the shortlived variety series the gloria swanson hour appeared on the cover of the first issue wagner later began publishing regional editions of the television guide for new england and the baltimore–washington area five years later he sold the editions to walter annenberg who folded it into his publishing and broadcasting company triangle publications but remained as a consultant for the magazine until 19635 annenbergtriangle eraedit the national tv guides first issue was released on april 3 1953 the inaugural cover featured a photograph of lucille balls newborn son desi arnaz jr with a downscaled photo of ball placed in the top corner under the issues headline lucys 50000000 baby6 the magazine was published in digest size which remained its printed format for 52 years from its first issue until the issue of july 28 1954 listings within each edition of tv guide began on friday and ended on thursday the issue of july 916 began on a friday and ended on the following friday then beginning with the july 1723 1954 issue the listings in each weeks issue changed to start on saturday and end on friday which remained the listings format for all local editions until april 2004citation needed the formation of tv guide as a national publication resulted from triangle publications purchase of numerous regional television listing publications such as tv forecast tv digest television guide and tv guide the launch as a national magazine with local listings in april 1953 became an almost instant success with tv guide becoming the most read and circulated magazine in the united states by the 1960s the initial cost of each issue was 15¢ per copy equivalent to 134 today the price of each issue has gradually risen over the years selling for 499 per copy as of 2017 in addition to subscriptions tv guide was sold at the checkout counters of grocery stores nationwide until the 1980s the feature pieces included in each issue were promoted in a television commercial under triangle tv guide continued to grow not only in circulation but in recognition as the authority on television programming with articles – the majority of which typically appear in the color section – from both staff and contributing writers past logos used by the publication l–r 1953–1962 1962–1968 1968–1988 and 1988–2003 over the decades the shape of the tv guide logo has changed to reflect the modernization of the television screen eventually adopting its current widescreen appearance in september 2003 different versions of the logo – the only cosmetic difference being the utilization of different typefaces – are currently used respectively for the magazine and the separately owned cbsmanaged digital properties at first the logo had various colored backgrounds usually black white blue or green until the familiar red background became the standard in the 1960s with occasional changes used for special editions the magazine was first based in a small office in downtown philadelphia before moving to more spacious national headquarters in radnor pennsylvania in the late 1950s the new facility complete with a large lighted tv guide logo at the buildings entrance based its management editors production personnel and subscription processors as well as a vast computer system holding data on every television show and movie available for listing in the popular weekly publication printing of the national color section of tv guide – which incorporates televisionrelated stories and select feature columns such as program reviews – took place at triangles gravure division plant – which was known for performing some of the highest quality printing in the industry with almost always perfect registration – located adjacent to the companys landmark philadelphia inquirer building on north broad street in philadelphia the color section was then sent to regional printers to be wrapped around the local listing sections in addition to tv guide and its flagship newspaper the philadelphia inquirer triangle publications also owned the philadelphia daily news ten radio and six television stations wfil amfmtv in philadelphia wnhc amfmtv in new haven connecticut kfre amfmtv in fresno california wnbf amfmtv in binghamton new york wfbg amfmtv in altoona pennsylvania and wlyhtv in lancaster–lebanon pennsylvania the daily racing form the morning telegraph seventeen and various cable television interests it was under triangles ownership of wfiltv that dick clark and american bandstand came to popularity triangle publications sold its philadelphia newspapers to knight newspapers in 1969 its radio and television stations during the early 1970s to capital cities communications the television stations that are now known as kfsntv and wpvitv were subsequently acquired by abc through its 1986 merger with capital cities and various other interests retaining only tv guide seventeen and the daily racing form for the magazines first 52 years of publication listings information was displayed in a log format a mainly textbased list of programs organized by both start time and channel which was the sole method – eventually primary once prime time grids were incorporated and later secondary for the final two years of its inclusion of local listings – of displaying program information in tv guide until the switch to national listings in 2005 this allowed for the display of full titles for each program as well as the inclusion of synopses for movies and most programs most listing entries in the log included program genres and for national news programs anchors after the programs title while its running time which was mentioned only if a program lasted a minimum of one hour – later 35 minutes – in length was listed in the synopses originally the majority of programs listed in the log each issue featured brief synopses except for local and national newscasts and programs airing on certain stations in various timeslots as other broadcast television stations and cable channels were added due to set space requirements for the local listings section detailed synopses were gradually restricted to series and specials – usually those airing in evening timeslots – as well as movies airing on broadcast television while shorter synopses were used for programs seen on broadcast stations outside of the editions home market and select cable channels and only the title along with supplementary information such as genre andor program length for most other broadcast and cable programs in addition blackandwhite ads for programs scheduled to air on broadcast stations – and later cable channels – during prime time with local airtimes and for broadcast stations information for networkaffiliated stations featured in the edition which were scheduled to air the advertised show were included within the listings a regular feature of the listings section was closeup which provided expanded reviews of select programs airing each day various editions of closeup were eventually used for different types of programs from premieres of new series to shows airing on cable over time other regular and recurring features most of them televisionrelated were included alongside the listings including insider a television news and interview section in the lead pages of the color section cheers and jeers a critique page about various aspects of television programming hits and misses featuring brief reviews of select programs in the coming week rated on a score from 0 to 10 guidelines a halfpage daily section featuring highlights of five or six programs of interest horoscopes recaps of the previous weeks storylines on network daytime soap operas a page reviewing new home video and later dvd releases dedicated pages that respectively listed select sporting events childrens programs and fourstar movies being broadcast during that week and crossword puzzles although its issues usually focus on different televisionrelated stories week to week tv guide also incorporates recurring issues that appear a few times each year most notably the fall preview an issue featured since the magazines inaugural year in 1953 which features reviews of new series premiering during the fall television season returning favorites first published in 1996 featuring previews of series renewed from the previous television season returning for the upcoming fall schedule winter preview first published in 1994 and later known as the year tv preview from 2006 to 2009 featuring previews of midseason series and the best childrens shows on tv first published in 1989 and later renamed the parents guide to childrens television in 1990 the parents guide to childrens entertainment in 1993 and finally as the parents guide to kids tv in 1994 featuring stories and reviews on familyoriented programs the advent of cable television would become hard on tv guide cable channels began to be listed in the magazine in 1980 or 1981 depending on the edition regional and national superstations available on cable systems in the designated market of many editions were the only cable channels listed initially with cableoriginated channels such as hbo and cnn – which the magazine originally promoted mainly in fullpage advertisements – being added later channels that were listed also differed depending on the edition as the years went on more cable channels were added into the listings of each edition to help offset this the may 11–17 1985 issue introduced a smaller helvetica font for the log along with some other cosmetic changes in particular a shows length began to be listed after the shows title instead of at the end of its synopsis upon those channels incorporation in the listings the outlined bullets that were originally used only for outofmarket television stations were also assigned to cable channels containing threeletter abbreviations in a condensed typeface for identification for example esn represented espn dsc represented the discovery channel and nik represented nickelodeonnick at nite e and fx later became exceptions as those channels were identified by twocharacter abbreviations in certain cases the abbreviation used such as amc for american movie classics tnt for turner network television and mtv for music television was that which the channel had already branded by two pay cable networks cinemax and showtime eventually rebranded in 1997 so that their respective tv guide abbreviations – max and sho – became the focal point of their logos outofmarket superstations were first identified with a combination of their channel number and a letter representing their originating market city following the incorporation of cable listings wkbdtv in detroit which effectively served as the fox affiliate for most of michigan until december 1994 via cable was listed as 50d for instance these identifiers were also used in some regional editions to disambiguate broadcast stations with identical channel numbers in genrebased listings pages such as the sports guide and crossreferences in the pages preceding the local listings with the numeric identifier used for either a local or outofmarket station and the alphanumeric identifier for an outofmarket station the three major national superstations at the time tbs wgn and wor which were respectively identified as 17a 9c and 9n were eventually given conventional threeletter abbreviations in line with other cable channels news corporation eraedit on august 7 1988 triangle publications was sold to the news america corporation arm of news corporation for 3 billion78 one of the largest media acquisitions of the time and the most expensive publication transaction at the time to save channel space tv guide eventually incorporated a grid a rowed display of listings for programs scheduled to air during the evening hours each night primarily organized by channel from 500 to 1100 pm or 600 pm to 1200 am depending on the start of prime time within a given time zone into the listings by the late 1980sspecify some cable channels – mainly premium channels – had an asterisk displayed by them in that editions channel lineup page which meant that it was only listed in the evening grid and later the paytv later premium channels movie guide a feature placed within the final pages of the listing section that incorporated synopses for films being aired as well as a list of films scheduled to premiere that week on the premium channels included in both the log and grid listings excluding those featured exclusively in the grids channels like cinemax and the disney channel initially started only in the grids but later expanded to the log listings as well by the mid1990s most editions of tv guide incorporated nearly all cable channels each issue provided program listings for in both the grids and the log listings although some editions continued to list at least one channel such as the movie channel the only pay service that was excluded from the log listings in many editions by that point – though its inclusion in the log as with select other cable channels varied by market – until the september 1998 additions of starz encore and hbo multiplex channels hbo plus now hbo2 and hbo3 now hbo signature to the listings in the grids only another change to the listings took place in 1996 the shows title was no longer displayed in alluppercase but a mixed case font which changed to franklin gothic in addition the generic title movie that appeared before a films synopsis was replaced with the movies actual title which had previously been displayed within the film description and began to appear italicized with the move beginning with the january 4 1997 issue the log listings began incorporating content ratings for programs assigned through the newly implemented tv parental guidelines system the systems content ratings were subsequently added upon their introduction in october 1998 gemstar eraedit news corporation sold tv guide to the united video satellite group parent company of prevue networks on june 11 1998 for 800 million and 60 million shares of stock worth an additional 12 billion this followed an earlier merger attempt between the two companies in 1996 that eventually fell apart910 following the sale reports suggested that tv guide would remove program listings from the magazine shifting them entirely to its new sister cable network prevue channel which would be rebranded as a result of united videos purchase of tv guide magazine news corporation executives later stated that listings information would remain part of the magazine11 that year united video acquired tvsm inc publishers of competing listings guides total tv and the cable guide in a 75 million allcash acquisition as a result tv guide merged with total tv and began printing a version of the magazine in the latter magazines fullsize format while retaining the original digest size version effective with the july 11 1998 issue1213 because most cable systems published their own listing magazine reflecting their channel lineup and now had a separate guide channel or an electronic program guide that can be activated by remote and provide the same information in a more detailed manner – with additional competition coming in the late 1990s from websites that also specialize in providing detailed television program information such as tvguidecom then jointly operated with tv guide magazine and zap2it a printed listing of programming in a separate magazine became less valuable the sheer amount and diversity of cable television programming made it hard for tv guide to provide listings of the extensive array of programming that came directly over the cable system tv guide also could not match the ability of the cable box to store personalized listings nevertheless beginning with the september 12 1998 issue the magazine added several new channels to many of its editions including those that had previously been mentioned only in a foreword on the channel lineup page as well as those that were available mainly on digital cable and satellite although most of these newly added channels were placed within the prime time grids only a few such as animal planet and msnbc were also incorporated into the log listings some of the channels that were added to the grids beginning with the expansion were identified by four character abbreviations such as bbca for bbc america and hbos for hbo signature features in the magazine were also revamped with the additions of the robins report a review column by writer j max robins family page featuring reviews of familyoriented programs and picks of select classic films airing that week as well as the removal of the guidelines feature in the listings section in favor of the new highlight page dont miss listing choice programs selected by the magazines staff for the coming week in the national color section listings for movies within the log also began identifying madefortv and directtovideo films as well as quality ratings on a scale of one to four stars signifying movies that have received poor to excellent reviews the evening grids were also reduced to the designated prime time hours 800 to 1100 pm or 700 to 1000 pm monday through saturdays and 700 to 1100 pm or 600 to 1000 pm on sundays in 1999 the magazine began hosting the tv guide awards an awards show which was telecast on fox honoring television programs and actors with the winners being chosen by tv guide subscribers through a nominee ballot inserted in the magazine the telecast was discontinued after the 2001 event on october 5 1999 gemstar international group ltd the maker of the vcr plus device and schedule system whose channel and program codes for vcrs using the system for timed recordings were incorporated into the magazines listings in 1988 and which incidentally was partially owned by news corporation purchased united video satellite group the two companies had previously been involved in a legal battle over the intellectual property rights for their respective interactive program guide systems vcr plus and tv guide on screen that began in 19941415 that month tv guide debuted a 16page insert into editions in 22 markets with large hispanic populations titled tv guide en español which provided programming information from national spanish language networks such as univision and telemundo as well as special sections with reviews of the weeks notable programs the magazine discontinued the insert in march 2000 due to difficulties resulting from confusion by advertisers over its marketing as the first weekly spanishlanguage magazine despite its structure as an insert within the main tv guide publication16 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of tv guide as a national magazine in 2002 the magazine published six special issues tv well always remember april 6–12 our

28–october 4 charisma curves confidence charm could we be having any more fun by 2003 the number of cable channels that were only listed in the grids expanded with the addition of channels such as bbc america soapnet and the national geographic channel some editions also featured a limited amount of broadcast stations – either inmarket outofmarket or both – exclusively in the grids conversely sister cable network tv guide channel whose listings were added to the magazine after the gemstar purchase was relegated from the log listings to the grids in most editions from its inception until 2003 tv guide had offered listings for the entire week 24 hours a day numerous changes to the local listings took place beginning with the june 21 2003 issue – in just a few select markets when the 500 am to 500 pm monday through friday listings were condensed down to four grids these ran from 500 to 800 am 800 to 1100 am 1100 am to 200 pm and 200 to 500 pm if programming differed from one weekday to the next the generic descriptor various programs was listed the weekday grid maintained daytoday listings for certain cable channels primarily movie channels as well as a limited number of basic cable channels such as lifetime the history channel and usa network which were organized separately from the other channels these changes became permanent in all tv guide editions beginning with the september 13 2003 fall preview issue other changes were made to the magazine beginning with the june 21 issue in select markets and the 2003 fall preview issue elsewhere a halfpage daily prime time highlights section featuring the evenings notable shows movies and sports events – similar to the former guidelines feature – was readded to the listings section a fullpage weekday highlights page was also added featuring guest and topical information for the weeks daytime talk and morning shows as well as picks for movies airing during the day on broadcast and cable channels in addition while log listings continued in use for prime time listings program synopses were added to the grids and log as well as a new indicator for firstrun episodes replacing the repeat indicator in the logs synopses the premium channels movie guide was also restructured as the big movie guide with film listings being expanded to include those airing on all broadcast networks and cable channels featured in each edition as well as some that were not listed in a particular local edition as well as movies that were available on payperview page references to the films included in this section were also incorporated into the prime time grids and log listings beginning in january 2004 the midnight to 500 am listings as well as the saturday and sunday 500 to 800 am listings ceased to include any broadcast stations outside of the editions home market leaving only program information for stations within the home market and for cable channels the magazines format was changed beginning with the

within the contiguous united states one for the eastern and central time zones and one for the pacific and mountain time zones which had existed separately from the local editions prior to the change although their distribution was primarily limited to hotels the change in format was attributed to the increase in the internet cable television channels like tv guide network electronic program guides and digital video recorders as the sources of choice for viewers program listings the new version of tv guide went on sale on october 17 2005 and featured extreme makeover home edition host ty pennington on the cover the listings format now consisting entirely of grids also changed to start the listings in each weeks issue on monday rather than sunday as a result of the elimination of the local editions broadcast stations were replaced by broadcast network schedules with the description local programming being used to denote time periods in which syndicated locally produced or paid programs would air instead of network shows in september 2006 tv guide launched a redesigned website with expanded original editorial and usergenerated content not included in the print magazine on december 22 2006 tv guide introduced the magazines first ever twoweek edition the edition which featured rachael ray on the cover was issued for the period from december 25 2006 to january 7 2007 in early 2008 the monday through friday daytime and daily late night grids were eliminated from the listings section and the television highlights section was compressed into a sixpage review of the week rather than the previous two pages for each night by 2007 tv guides circulation had decreased to less than three million copies from a peak of almost 20 million in 1970 with the 28 billion acquisition of gemstartv guide by macrovision on may 2 200818 that company which purchased the former mostly to take advantage of their lucrative and profitable vcr plus and electronic program guide patents stated it wanted to sell both the magazine and tv guide network along with the companys horse racing channel tvg network to other parties tv guide talkedit on may 18 2005 tv guide talk a weekly

mitovich19 angel cohn daniel manu and maitland mcdonagh each episode featured commentary from tv guide staff on the weeks entertainment news stories television programs and film releases as well as occasional interviews with actors producers and executives on april 4 2008 following ausiellos move to entertainment weekly it was announced that the podcast would be ending20 and the final episode episode no 139 was released on april 10 200821 tv guide talk podcasts were released every friday afternoon and averaged an hour in length they featured the participants discussing and commenting on the past week in television and the entertainment industry in general the beginning of each podcast was devoted to indepth discussion on the weeks biggest new story in the entertainment industry whether it be a television program or something outside the scope of television show or movie such as the academy awards or the emmys the middle part was devoted to discussion and commentary on individual shows the podcast emphasized programs that tend to have a large online following even if that following is not necessarily reflected in the programs nielsen rating examples include american idol heroes lost survivor gilmore girls veronica mars and project runway the latter three being examples a lowrated shows which nevertheless have sizable online followings each podcast also ended with

pop from march 2010 until it rebranded as tvgn on april 14 2013 on october 13 2008 macrovision sold the moneylosing magazine which was reportedly posting revenue losses of 20 million per year by that point to beverly hillsbased equity fund opengate capital for 1 and a 95 million loan at 3 interest22 as part of the sale however macrovision retained ownership of the companion website23 – which was then sold to equity firm one equity partners for 300 million –2425 which severed all editorial connections between the magazine and website including the end of critic matt roushs presence on tvguidecom26 the editorial content of the magazine was launched on a new site tvguidemagazinecom which did not feature tv guides listings in any form tvguidemagazinecom was later shut down on june 1 2010 tv guide magazine and tvguidecom then entered into a deal to restore content from the magazine to the latter website27 which lionsgate entertainment had bought along with the tv guide network in january 200928 in january 2009 the magazine cut several networks from its grid listings – including mtv and diy network – citing space concerns however two cuts those of the cw and tv guide network2930 were seen as suspicious and arbitrary as the magazine carries several channels which have the same schedule night after night or have low viewership and could have easily been cut while several foxowned networks continued to be listed due to agreements with the former news corporation ownership it is likely that tv guide networks removal from tv guides listings was related to the divorce of the website and network from the magazine in early february 2009 the cw and mtv were brought back to the listings after the magazine received numerous emails protesting the move as a consequence listings for several lowrated networks were removed31 the other channels previously incorporated into the listings before their removal were slowly readded until tv guide networks schedule returned to the listings pages in june 2010 with its logo prominent within the grids as part of the deal with lionsgates tv guide division under opengate ownership tv guide slowly returned to profitability mainly through cost reductions instituted by its venture capital parent making significant staffing reductions and switching to biweekly editions fulltime reducing the number of issues it published to 29 per year in march 2013 cbs corporation acquired one equity partners stake of their tv guide assets32 the cbs acquisition was finalized later that month for 100 million3 on may 31

undergo a major redesign beginning with the august 11 issue the magazine eliminated 14 pages of listings with the listings pages that remained displaying programming information for only toprated broadcast and cable networks it also added enhanced editorial features including recommendation sections focusing on traditional television and online programming – such as additional content from

agreements with 160 newspapers throughout the country in which they are distributed as supplementary publications incorporated within each papers sunday editions – listings customized for individual regions the company began distributing its listings magazines in this manner in 2008 as newspapers began to cease publication of their proprietary television listings magazines due to costcutting measures spurred by declining circulation and revenue it also publishes listings publications for pay television providers such as comcast time warner cable and dish network as such it is undetermined whether ntvb will reach deals to distribute tv guide to newspapers on a separate basis or extend the name to its existing television publications staff with tv guide and ntvbs other titles will

article list of tv guide editions from the magazines inception until the october 2005 conversion to national listings based on time zone tv guide maintained a localnational hybrid format with local editions tailored to a specific region or individual market each regional edition generally served either a single city a large market and certain smaller adjacent markets or a single or multiple neighboring states or provinces south dakota delaware and the us territories did not have their own editions during the local listings era in the case of the two us states rapid city and sioux falls south dakota were presumably both considered too small to have their own editions and were located too far away from one another to be included in one edition delaware is split between two markets – new castle and kent counties are part of the philadelphia market while sussex county is part of the salisbury maryland market some editions that once provided statewide listings were eventually split off into separate editions that only provided listings for a specific region in addition certain markets have been added or dropped from some editions by the mid1990s nearly 150 editions of the magazine were published during that decade tv guide began to diversify its editions from those for individual cities and multiple media markets within a given state or multistate region to include editions for certain cable providers in larger television markets41 – which were later branded as ultimate cable editions – as well as editions for satellite providers such as directv and dish network which were published in addition to the listings magazines that both providers produced themselves each channel in the listings section was designated by a bullet – which like the magazines logo also resembled a television screen bullets used for broadcast stations contained a channel number and in many editions were displayed as a filled black screen for local stations and as a screen outline for most outofmarket stations the outlined bullets were also used to identify black and white and by 1985 colorized programs if a certain edition featured more than one station that transmitted on the same channel but served different markets the primary station in the edition was displayed as a black bullet with a white number while the other shown as a white bullet with a black number some editions have also used a split half for stations broadcasting on frequencies from channel 10 and up three split with the channel number in the middle or vertical channel bullet if it covered a large area outofmarket stations and originally superstations featured an alphanumeric identifier with a letter next to the channel number to disambiguate it from a local station particularly in feature pages preceding the main listings such as in the northern wisconsin edition in which 6m was used to disambiguate wluctv in marquette michigan from witi in milwaukee which only used a 6 as its identifier if the same program or episode was scheduled to air in the same timeslot on more than one channel two or more bullets identifying each channel would precede the program title listed in a particular time entry the usage of multiple bullets to denote stations airing the same program was a more common occurrence in instances where multiple broadcast stations aired the same network program or their respective local news programs at the same time although this also applied to broadcast andor cable channels carrying the same episode of a syndicated program separate time entries would only be used in this situation if the program had differing running times between channels the grouping of bullets based on a stations affiliated network was later applied to the prime time grids beginning in september 2003 there were some exceptions to this formatting for example the hawaii edition had the primary honolulubased stations listed first followed by their satellite sister stations while the pittsburgh pennsylvania edition had that markets primary stations listed first followed by the outofmarket outlets the latter being unique with having the other stations listed below wpgh channel 53 when it listed a show during nonnetwork hours and during a networkscheduled lineup – in this case nbc – the primary station and channel being listed first – wpxi 11 followed by wjactvjohnstown 6 wtovtvsteubenville 9 wboytvclarksburg west virginia 12 and wfmjtvyoungstown ohio 21 – instead of by order of overtheair channel number for all stations for much of the log listings era the actual listings were immediately preceded by a channel lineup page which listed the broadcast stations – and later cable channels – whose program information was provided in each edition organized numerically for broadcast stations and alphabetically by abbreviation for cable channels as cable channels were gradually added to the magazine a foreword was added below the listed channels in the lineup page that provided descriptions of channels that were not included in each issue this foreword was removed beginning with the september 12 1998 issue as the magazine began adding many of the channels mentioned in that notation in some editions particularly the ultimate cable and satellite editions the channel lineup was diagrammed in the form of a conversion chart that listed each channels assigned placement on cable and satellite providers as well as their vcr plus code number the lineup pages in some of the local editions switched to these charts beginning in 2003 listing
