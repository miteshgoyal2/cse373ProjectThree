scientist mathematician logician cryptanalyst philosopher and theoretical biologist turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the turing machine which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer456 turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence7 during the second world war turing worked for the government code and cypher school gccs at bletchley park britains codebreaking centre that produced ultra intelligence for a time he led hut 8 the section which was responsible for german naval cryptanalysis here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of german ciphers including improvements to the prewar polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the enigma machine turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the allies to defeat the nazis in many crucial engagements including the battle of the atlantic and in so doing helped win the war89 counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect ultra intelligence had on the length of the war10 but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives8 after the war turing worked at the national physical laboratory where he designed the ace among the first designs for a storedprogram computer in 1948 turing joined max newmans computing machine laboratory at the victoria university of manchester where he helped develop the manchester computers11 and became interested in mathematical biology he wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the belousov–zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts when by the labouchere amendment gross indecency was criminal in the uk he accepted chemical castration treatment with des as an alternative to prison turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning an inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning12 in 2009 following an internet campaign british prime minister gordon brown made an official public apology on behalf of the british government for the appalling way he was treated queen elizabeth ii granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013131415 the alan turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the united kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts16

1873–1947 was on leave from his position with the indian civil service ics at chhatrapur bihar and orissa province in british india1718 turings father was the son of a clergyman the rev john robert turing from a scottish family of merchants that had been based in the netherlands and included a baronet turings mother julius wife was ethel sara née stoney 1881–1976 daughter of edward waller stoney chief engineer of the madras railways the stoneys were a protestant angloirish gentry family from both county tipperary and county longford while ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in county clare19 julius work with the ics brought the family to british india where his grandfather had been a general in the bengal army however both julius and ethel wanted their children to be brought up in britain so they moved to maida vale20 london where alan turing was born on 23 june 1912 as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth2122 later the colonnade hotel1723 turing had an elder brother john the father of sir john dermot turing 12th baronet of the turing baronets24 turings fathers civil service commission was still active and during turings childhood years turings parents travelled between hastings in england25 and india leaving their two sons to stay with a retired army couple at hastings turing stayed at baston lodge upper maze hill st leonardsonsea now marked with a blue plaque26 the plaque was unveiled on 23 june 2012 the centenary of turings birth27 very early in life turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently28 his parents purchased a house in guildford in 1927 and turing lived there during school holidays the location is also marked with a blue plaque29 education school turings parents enrolled him at st michaels a day school at 20 charles road st leonardsonsea at the age of six the headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent teachers between january 1922 and 1926 turing was educated at hazelhurst preparatory school an independent school in the village of frant in sussex now east sussex30 in 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to sherborne school a boarding independent school in the market town of sherborne in dorset the first day of term coincided with the 1926 general strike in britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles 97 km from southampton to sherborne stopping overnight at an inn31 turings natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics his headmaster wrote to his parents i hope he will not fall between two stools if he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated if he is to be solely a scientific specialist he is wasting his time at a public school32 despite this turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus in 1928 aged 16 turing encountered albert einsteins work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce einsteins questioning of newtons laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit33 christopher morcom at sherborne turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil christopher morcom who has been described as turings first love their relationship provided inspiration in turings future endeavours but it was cut short by morcoms death in february 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cows milk some years previously343536 the event caused turing great sorrow he coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with morcom in a letter to morcoms mother turing said i am sure i could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited i regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and i think he felt a little the same about me  i know i must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do37 some have speculated that morcoms death was the cause of turings atheism and materialism38 apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death in a later letter also written to morcoms mother turing said personally i believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body  as regards the actual connection between spirit and body i consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected when the body is asleep i cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately39 university and work on computability after sherborne turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at kings college cambridge where he gained firstclass honours in mathematics in 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of kings on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem40 unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by jarl waldemar lindeberg41 in 1936 turing published his paper on computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem 193642 in this paper turing reformulated kurt gödels 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing gödels universal arithmeticbased formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as turing machines the entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by german mathematician david hilbert in 1928 turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm he went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for turing machines is undecidable it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a turing machine will ever halt kings college cambridge where turing was a student in 1931 and became a fellow in 1935 the computer room is named after him although turings proof was published shortly after alonzo churchs equivalent proof using his lambda calculus43 turings approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than churchs44 it also included a notion of a universal machine now known as a universal turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could churchs lambda calculus according to the church–turing thesis turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable john von neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to turings paper45 to this day turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation from september 1936 to july 1938 turing spent most of his time studying under church at princeton university in the second year as a jane eliza procter visiting fellow in addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electromechanical binary multiplier46 in june 1938 he obtained his phd from princeton47 his dissertation systems of logic based on ordinals4849 introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing where turing machines are augmented with socalled oracles allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by turing machines john von neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to england50 when turing returned to cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by ludwig wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics51 remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from turing and other students from students notes52 turing and wittgenstein argued and disagreed with turing defending formalism and wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them53 cryptanalysis during the second world war turing was a leading participant in the breaking of german ciphers at bletchley park the historian and wartime codebreaker asa briggs has said you needed exceptional talent you needed genius at bletchley and turings was that genius54 from september 1938 turing had been working parttime with the gccs the british codebreaking organisation he concentrated on cryptanalysis of the enigma with dilly knox a senior gccs codebreaker55 soon after the july 1939 warsaw meeting at which the polish cipher bureau had provided the british and french with the details of the wiring of enigma rotors and their method of decrypting enigma code messages turing and knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem56 the polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the germans were likely to change which they did in may 1940 turings approach was more general using cribbased decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the polish bomba57 two cottages in the stable yard at bletchley park turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to hut 8 on 4 september 1939 the day after the uk declared war on germany turing reported to bletchley park the wartime station of gccs58 specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that turing made during the war the others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the german navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the lorenz sz 4042 tunny dubbed turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at hanslope park that was codenamed delilah by using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process turing made an innovative contribution to the subject he wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled the applications of probability to cryptography59 and paper on statistics of repetitions60 which were of such value to gccs and its successor gchq that they were not released to the uk national archives until april 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth a gchq mathematician who identified himself only as richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to postwar cryptanalysis61 he said the fact that the contents had been restricted shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject the papers detailed using mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible richard said that gchq had now squeezed the juice out of the two papers and was happy for them to be released into the public domain turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at bletchley park he was known to his colleagues as prof and his treatise on enigma was known as the profs book62 jack good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by ronald lewin as having said of turing in the first week of june each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off his bicycle had a fault the chain would come off at regular intervals instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen63 while working at bletchley turing who was a talented longdistance runner occasionally ran the 40 miles 64 km to london when he was needed for highlevel meetings64 and he was capable of worldclass marathon standards6566 turing tried out for the 1948 british olympic team hampered by an injury his tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than british silver medallist thomas richards olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes he was walton athletic clubs best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone676869 in 1946 turing was appointed an officer of the order of the british empire obe by king george vi for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years7071 bombe within weeks of arriving at bletchley park58 turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break enigma more effectively than the polish bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived the bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician gordon welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack enigmaenciphered messages jack good opined turings most important contribution i think was of part of the design of the bombe the cryptanalytic machine he had the idea that you could use in effect a theorem in logic which sounds to the untrained ear rather absurd namely that from a contradiction you can deduce everything72 a complete and working replica of a bombe at the national codes centre at bletchley park the bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an enigma message ie rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib a fragment of probable plaintext for each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 1019 states or 1022 states for the fourrotor uboat variant73 the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically the bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail a contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter—this simply wasnt possible with the enigma the first bombe was installed on 18 march 194074 by late 1941 turing and his fellow cryptanalysts gordon welchman hugh alexander and stuart milnerbarry were frustrated building on the work of the poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals in the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100000 tons a month but they were still on a knifeedge they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of german adjustments they had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere finally breaking all the rules on 28 october they wrote directly to winston churchill spelling out their difficulties with turing as the first named they emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces75 as andrew hodges biographer of turing later wrote this letter had an electric effect76 churchill wrote a memo to general ismay which read action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done on 18 november the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken76 the cryptographers at bletchley park did not know of the prime ministers response but as milnerbarry later recalled all that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth77 more than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war78 statue of turing by stephen kettle at bletchley park commissioned by sidney frank built from half a million pieces of welsh slate79 hut 8 and the naval enigma turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of german naval enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and i could have it to myself80 in december 1939 turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services8081 that same night he also conceived of the idea of banburismus a sequential statistical technique what abraham wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval enigma though i was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken80 for this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes in 1941 turing proposed marriage to hut 8 colleague joan clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was shortlived after admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage82 turing travelled to the united states in november 194283 and worked with us navy cryptanalysts on the naval enigma and bombe construction in washington he also visited their computing machine laboratory in dayton ohio turings reaction to the american bombe design was far from enthusiastic the american bombe programme was to produce 336 bombes one for each wheel order i used to smile inwardly at the conception of bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it84 during this trip he also assisted at bell labs with the development of secure speech devices85 he returned to bletchley park in march 1943 during his absence hugh alexander had officially assumed the position of head of hut 8 although alexander had been de facto head for some time turing having little interest in the daytoday running of the section turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at bletchley park alexander wrote this about turings contribution there should be no question in anyones mind that turings work was the biggest factor in hut 8s success in the early days he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the hut but he also shared with welchman and keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe it is always difficult to say that anyone is absolutely indispensable but if anyone was indispensable to hut 8 it was turing the pioneers work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in hut 8 felt that the magnitude of turings contribution was never fully realised by the outside world86 turingery in july 1942 turing devised a technique termed turingery or jokingly turingismus87 for use against the lorenz cipher messages produced by the germans new geheimschreiber secret writer machine this was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed tunny at bletchley park turingery was a method of wheelbreaking ie a procedure for working out the cam settings of tunnys wheels88 he also introduced the tunny team to tommy flowers who under the guidance of max newman went on to build the colossus computer the worlds first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the heath robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages89 some have mistakenly said that turing was a key figure in the design of the colossus computer turingery and the statistical approach of banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher9091 but he was not directly involved in the colossus development92 delilah following his work at bell labs in the us93 turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the secret services radio security service later hmgcc at hanslope park there he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer donald bayley together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed delilah94 it was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with longdistance radio transmissions and in any case delilah was completed too late to be used during the war though the system worked fully with turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a winston churchill speech delilah was not adopted for use95 turing also consulted with bell labs on the development of sigsaly a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war early computers and the turing test plaque 78 high street hampton between 1945 and 1947 turing lived in hampton london96 while he worked on the design of the ace automatic computing engine at the national physical laboratory npl he presented a paper on 19 february 1946 which was the first detailed design of a storedprogram computer97 von neumanns incomplete first draft of a report on the edvac had predated turings paper but it was much less detailed and according to john r womersley superintendent of the npl mathematics division it contains a number of ideas which are dr turings own98 although ace was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at bletchley park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned in late 1947 he returned to cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on intelligent machinery that was not published in his lifetime99 while he was at cambridge the pilot ace was being built in his absence it executed its first program on 10 may 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the english electric deuce and the american bendix g15 the full version of turings ace was not built until after his death100 according to the memoirs of the german computer pioneer heinz billing from the max planck institute for physics published by genscher düsseldorf there was a meeting between alan turing and konrad zuse101 it took place in göttingen in 1947 the interrogation had the form of a colloquium participants were womersley turing porter from england and a few german researchers like zuse walther and billing for more details see herbert bruderer konrad zuse und die schweiz in 1948 turing was appointed reader in the mathematics department at the victoria university of manchester in 1949 he became deputy director of the computing machine laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest storedprogram computers—the manchester mark 1 during this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics102 and in computing machinery and intelligence mind october 1950 turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence and proposed an experiment that became known as the turing test an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent the idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being103 in the paper turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a childs mind and then to subject it to a course of education a reversed form of the turing test is widely used on the internet the captcha test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer in 1948 turing working with his former undergraduate colleague d g champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist by 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the turochamp104 in 1952 he tried to implement it on a ferranti mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program instead turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move the game was recorded105 the program lost to turings colleague alick glennie although it is said that it won a game against champernownes wife his turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century106 he also invented the lu decomposition method in 1948102 used today for solving matrix equations107 pattern formation and mathematical biology in 1951 when turing was 39 years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece the chemical basis of morphogenesis in january 1952 he was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms among other things he wanted to understand fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of fibonacci numbers in plant structures108 he suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reactiondiffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis109 he used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions for example if a catalyst a is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst a then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst a but also produced an inhibitor b that slowed down the production of a if a and b then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where a dominated and some where b did in order to calculate the extent of this turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots the russian biochemist boris belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics for a modern view of living organisms and the second law see second law of thermodynamicsliving organisms unfortunately belousov was not aware of turings paper in the philosophical transactions of the royal society110 although published before the structure and role of dna was understood turings work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology111 one of the early applications of turings paper was the work by james murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small112113114 further research in the area suggests that turings work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the leftright asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest115 in 2012 sheth et al found that in mice removal of hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb suggesting that hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a turingtype mechanism116 later papers were not available until collected works of a m turing was published in 1992117 conviction for indecency in january 1952 turing then 39 started a relationship with arnold murray a 19yearold unemployed man turing had met murray just before christmas outside the regal cinema when walking down manchesters oxford road and invited him to lunch on 23 january turings house was burgled murray told turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and turing reported the crime to the police during the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with murray homosexual acts were criminal offences in the united kingdom at that time118 and both men were charged with gross indecency under section 11 of the criminal law amendment act 1885119 initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 february during which turings solicitor reserved his defence ie did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor turing entered a plea of guilty120 the case regina v turing and murray was brought to trial on 31 march 1952121 turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido he accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or des a synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year the treatment rendered turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia122 fulfilling in the literal sense turings prediction that no doubt i shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who ive not found out123124 murray was given a conditional discharge125 turings conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the government communications headquarters gchq the british signals intelligence agency that had evolved from gccs in 1946 though he kept his academic job he was denied entry into the united states after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other european countries turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at bletchley park he was prevented by the official secrets act from discussing his war work126 chess algorithm alan turing is credited with designing the first computer chess program in 1953 turing first worked on the algorithm in 1948 the program did not run on a computer turing ran the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard according to garry kasparov turings program played a recognizable game of chess127 death on 8 june 1954 turings housekeeper found him dead he had died the previous day a postmortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning128 when his body was discovered an apple lay halfeaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide129 it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed an inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at woking crematorium on 12 june 1954130 turings ashes were scattered there just as his fathers had been andrew hodges and another biographer david leavitt have both suggested that turing was reenacting a scene from the walt disney film snow white and the seven dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in leavitts words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the wicked queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew131 philosophy professor jack copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroners historical verdict he suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of turings death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold

and describing the treatment of turing as appalling185187 thousands of people have come together to demand justice for alan turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated while turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we cant put the clock back his treatment was of course utterly unfair and i am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry i and we all are for what happened to him  so on behalf of the british government and all those who live freely thanks to alans work i am very proud to say were sorry you deserved so much better185188 john leech the mp for manchester withington 2005–15 was the first mp to formally submit a bill to pardon turing leech said it was ultimately just embarrassing that the conviction still stood189 in december 2011 william jones created an epetition190 requesting the british government pardon turing for his conviction of gross indecency191 we ask the hm government to grant a pardon to alan turing for the conviction of gross indecency in 1952 he was convicted of gross indecency with another man and was forced to undergo socalled organotherapy—chemical castration two years later he killed himself with cyanide aged just 41 alan turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation hed done so much to save this remains a shame on the british government and british history a pardon can go some way to healing this damage it may act as an apology to many of the other gay men not as wellknown as alan turing who were subjected to these laws190 the petition gathered over 37000 signatures15190 but the request was discouraged by lord mcnally who gave the following opinion in his role as the justice minister192 a posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as alan turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence he would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted it is tragic that alan turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort however the law at the time required a prosecution and as such longstanding policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right ensure instead that we never again return to those times193 john leech the mp for manchester withington 2005–15 submitted several bills to parliament194 and campaigned with william jones to secure the pardon leech made the case in the house of commons that turings contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was ultimately just embarrassing that the conviction still stood189 leech continued to take the bill through parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed195 on 26 july 2012 a bill was introduced in the house of lords to grant a statutory pardon to turing for offences under section 11 of the criminal law amendment act 1885 of which he was convicted on 31 march 1952196 late in the year in a letter to the daily telegraph the physicist stephen hawking and 10 other signatories including the astronomer royal lord rees president of the royal society sir paul nurse lady trumpington who worked for turing during the war and lord sharkey the bills sponsor called on prime minister david cameron to act on the pardon request197 the government indicated it would support the bill198199200 and it passed its third reading in the lords in october201 before the bill could be debated in the house of commons202 the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy on 24 december 2013 queen elizabeth ii signed a pardon14 for turings conviction for gross indecency with immediate effect announcing the pardon justice secretary chris grayling said turing deserved to be remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and not for his later criminal conviction1315 the queen officially pronounced turing pardoned in august 2014203 the queens action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the second world war204 this case is unusual in that pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent and a request has been made by the family or other interested party neither condition was met in regard to turings conviction205 in a letter to prime minister david cameron after announcement of the pardon human rights advocate peter tatchell criticised the decision to single out turing due to his fame and achievements when thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received pardons206 tatchell also called for a new investigation into turings death a new inquiry is long overdue even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death—including speculation that he was murdered by the security services or others i think murder by state agents is unlikely there is no known evidence pointing to any such act however it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated207 in september 2016 the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences in what was described as an alan turing law208209 the alan turing law is now an informal term for the law in the united kingdom contained in the policing and crime act 2017 which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed
