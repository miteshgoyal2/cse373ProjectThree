namesake from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for other uses see namesake disambiguation not to be confused with eponym a namesake is a person named after another1234 namesake may also refer to a thing such as a company place ship building or concept named after a person35 in general the second recipient of a name named for the first is said to be the namesake of the first the attribution can however go in the opposite direction with namesake referring to the original holder of the name the eponym3 the word is first recorded in the midseventeenth century and probably comes from the phrase for the my his her names sake2346 usageedit naming a child after a relative friend or wellknown person is a common practice in the englishspeaking world when a son is named for his father it is customary primarily in the united states to add jr iii or another name suffix to the name of the son and sometimes sr or a prior number to the fathers name in order to distinguish between individuals especially if both father and son become famous as in the case of poet oliver wendell holmes sr and his son oliver wendell holmes jr an associate justice of the united states supreme court sometimes the jr or sr suffix is applied even when the childs legal name differs from that of the parent one notable example is that of the singer hiram king williams known professionally as hank williams and his son randall hank williams known professionally as hank williams jr nothing prohibits girls named for their mothers from using similar suffixes but no such tradition has become established a more archaic method of distinguishing father from son was to follow the name with the elder or the younger respectively eg william pitt the elder and william pitt the younger among ashkenazi jews it is customary to name a child after a dead parent ie the childs grandparent but never after a living person7 sephardic jews traditionally are encouraged to name their children after relatives living or dead7 greek families traditionally name a child after its paternal grandparents and the second child of the same sex is named after its maternal grandparents strictly speaking a namesake is only a person12 named for another person—ie for the sake of the others name to keep it alive4 many dictionaries however following colloquial usage acknowledge that things as well as persons may be or have namesakes25 and usually in a secondary definition that the other for whom the person or thing is named strictly the latters eponym may be called its namesake135 buildings such as the trump tower and companies like the ford motor company are often named for their founders or owners biologic species and celestial bodies are frequently named for their discoverers8 alternatively their discoverers may name them in honor of others9 occasionally material goods such as toys or garments may be named for persons closely associated with them in the public mind the teddy bear for example was named for president theodore teddy roosevelt because of a popular story in which the thenpresident objected to cruel treatment of a bear by hunters10 the fedora hat may be considered the namesake of a fictional character princess fédora romanoff from an 1887 play fédora by victorien sardou in her famous portrayal of that character sarah bernhardt wore a soft felt hat with a center crease which became known popularly as a fedora11 see alsoedit look up namesake in wiktionary the free dictionary code name word or name used clandestinely to refer to
