webbased freecontent encyclopedia project supported by the wikimedia foundation and based on a model of openly editable content the name wikipedia is a portmanteau of the words wiki a technology for creating collaborative websites from the hawaiian word wiki meaning quick and encyclopedia wikipedias articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay anyone with internet access can write and make changes to wikipedia articles except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism users can contribute anonymously under a pseudonym or if they choose to with their real identity the fundamental principles by which wikipedia operates are the five pillars the wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines to improve the encyclopedia however it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with them before contributing since its creation in 2001 wikipedia has grown rapidly into one of the largest reference websites attracting 374 million unique visitors monthly as of september 2015update1 there are about 71000 active contributors working on more than 46000000 articles in 299 languages as of today there are 5505977 articles in english every day hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world collectively make tens of thousands of edits and create thousands of new articles to augment the knowledge held by the wikipedia encyclopedia see the statistics page for more information people of all ages cultures and backgrounds can add or edit article prose references images and other media here what is contributed is more important than the expertise or qualifications of the contributor what will remain depends upon whether the content is free of copyright restrictions and contentious material about living people and whether it fits within wikipedias policies including being verifiable against a published reliable source thereby excluding editors opinions and beliefs and unreviewed research contributions cannot damage wikipedia because the software allows easy reversal of mistakes and many experienced editors are watching to help ensure that edits are cumulative improvements begin by simply clicking the edit link at the top of any editable page wikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paperbased reference sources in important ways unlike printed encyclopedias wikipedia is continually created and updated with articles on historic events appearing within minutes rather than months or years because everybody can help improve it wikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia in addition to quantity its contributors work on improving quality as well wikipedia is a workinprogress with articles in various stages of completion as articles develop they tend to become more comprehensive and balanced quality also improves over time as misinformation and other errors are removed or repaired however because anyone can click edit at any time and add stuff in any article may contain undetected misinformation errors or vandalism

grown to 5505977 articles equivalent to over 2000 print volumes of the encyclopædia britannica including all language editions wikipedia has over 38 million articles equivalent to over 15000 print volumes wikipedia was founded as an offshoot of nupedia a nowabandoned project to produce a free encyclopedia begun by the online media company bomis nupedia had an elaborate system of peer review and required highly qualified contributors but the writing of articles was slow during 2000 jimmy wales founder of nupedia and cofounder of bomis and larry sanger whom wales had employed to work on the encyclopedia project discussed ways of supplementing nupedia with a more open complementary project multiple sources suggested that a wiki might allow members of the public to contribute material and nupedias first wiki went online on january 10 2001 there was considerable resistance on the part of nupedias editors and reviewers to the idea of associating nupedia with a website in the wiki format so the new project was given the name wikipedia and launched on its own domain wikipediacom on january 15 now called wikipedia day by some users the bandwidth and server in san diego were donated by wales other current and past bomis employees who have worked on the project include tim shell one of the cofounders of bomis and its current ceo and programmer jason richey in may 2001 a large number of nonenglish wikipedias were launched—in catalan chinese dutch esperanto french german hebrew italian japanese portuguese russian spanish and swedish these were soon joined by arabic and hungarian in september2 polish was added and further commitment to the multilingual provision of wikipedia was made at the end of the year afrikaans norwegian and serbocroatian versions were announced the domain was eventually changed to the present wikipediaorg when the notforprofit wikimedia foundation was launched in 2003 as its new parent organization with the org toplevel domain denoting its noncommercial nature today there are wikipedias in over 250 languages wikipedia contributors main pages wikipediawho writes wikipedia and wikipediawikipedians further information wikipediaadministration § editors play media wikipedia contributors anyone with web access can edit wikipedia and this openness encourages inclusion of a tremendous amount of content about 70000 editors—from expert scholars to casual readers—regularly edit wikipedia and these experienced editors often help to create a consistent style throughout the encyclopedia following our manual of style several mechanisms are in place to help wikipedia members carry out the important work of crafting a highquality resource while maintaining civility editors are able to watch pages and technically skilled persons can write editing programs to keep track of or rectify bad edits where there are disagreements on how to display facts editors often work together to compile an article

been designated by the wikipedia community as featured articles exemplifying the best articles in the encyclopedia another 26000 articles are designated as good articles some information on wikipedia is organized into lists the best of these are designated as featured lists wikipedia also has portals which organize content around topic areas our best portals are selected as featured portals articles can be found using the search box on the topright side of the screen wikipedia is available in languages other than english wikipedia has more than two hundred and eighty languages including a simple english version and related projects include a dictionary quotations books manuals and scientific reference sources and a news service see sister projects all of these are maintained updated and managed by separate communities and often include information and articles that can be hard to find through other common sources basic navigation in wikipedia main page helpnavigation wikipedia articles are all linked or crossreferenced when highlighted text like this is seen it means there is a link to some relevant article or wikipedia page with further indepth information holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead there are other links towards the ends of most articles for other articles of interest relevant external websites and pages reference material and organized categories of knowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more information some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions audiobook readings quotations the same article in other languages and further information available on our sister projects additional links can be easily made if a relevant link is missing—this is one simple way to contribute using wikipedia as a research tool main pages wikipediaresearching with wikipedia and wikipediaciting wikipedia as wiki documents articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved over time this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start they may contain false or debatable information indeed many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint and after a long process of discussion debate and argument they gradually take on a neutral point of view reached through consensus others may for a while become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time—months or years perhaps—to achieve better balanced coverage of their subject in part this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article that they edit comprehensive however eventually additional editors expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage in addition wikipedia operates a number of internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach usually editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article the ideal wikipedia article is well written balanced neutral and encyclopedic containing comprehensive notable verifiable knowledge an increasing number of articles reach this standard over time and many already have our best articles are called featured articles and display a small star in the upper right corner of the article and our second best tier of articles are designated good articles however this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved through the concerted effort of editors some articles contain statements which have not yet been fully cited others will later be augmented with new sections some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and therefore may be removed while the overall trend is toward improvement it is important to use wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source since individual articles will by their nature vary in quality and maturity guidelines and information pages are available to help users and researchers do this effectively as is an article that summarizes thirdparty studies and assessments of the reliability of wikipedia wikipedia vs paper encyclopedias main page wikipedia is not paper on wikimedia metawiki wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias first is that it is not limited in space it can keep growing as fast as people add to it second there are no qualifications required to be able to author its articles therefore it has a very large pool of contributors the whole world this and the first advantage mentioned above have enabled wikipedia to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia on earth third a paper encyclopedia remains static stays the same and falls out of date until the next edition but wikipedia is dynamic you dont have to wait for the next edition to come out there are no editions as wikipedia is published online as it is written online articles are made available as is regardless of what stage of development they are in you can update wikipedia at any instant and people do so continually around the clock thereby helping each other to keep abreast of the most recent events everywhere and of the latest facts in every subject fourth wikipedia has a very low publishing cost for adding or expanding entries as it is online with no need to buy paper or ink for distribution this has allowed it to be made available for free making it more accessible to everyone this has enabled wikipedia to be independently developed and published in many different languages at the same time by people literate in each language of the 290 different language wikipedias 137 of them have 10000 or more articles fifth wikipedia has a low environmental impact in some respects since it never needs to be printed although computers have their own environmental cost sixth wikipedia is extralinear more than linear instead of inline explanations wikipedia incorporates hypertext in the form of wikilinks throughout its content is a robust network of links providing another dimension of knowledge accessibility the encyclopedia also has correlates to tables of contents and indexes with each entry in them hyperlinked to an article on the topic specified seventh each wikipedia article provides an introduction summarizing the more extensive detail of its contents eighth being open to anyone to edit articles on wikipedia are subject to additions that might be erroneous or written poorly which in turn are subject to being corrected or rewritten it is a community effort with most people who are involved helping to improve the work fixing problems they encounter along the way see more about wikipedias strengths and weaknesses below strengths weaknesses and article quality in wikipedia main pages wikipediawhy wikipedia is so great and wikipediawhy wikipedia is not so great see also reliability of wikipedia and wikipediaresearching with wikipedia wikipedias greatest strengths weaknesses and differences all arise because it is open to anyone it has a large contributor base and its articles are written by consensus according to editorial guidelines and policies wikipedia is open to a large contributor base drawing a large number of editors from diverse backgrounds this allows wikipedia to significantly reduce regional and cultural bias found in many other publications and makes it very difficult for any group to censor and impose bias a large diverse editor base also provides access and breadth on subject matter that is otherwise inaccessible or little documented a large number of editors contributing at any moment also means that wikipedia can produce encyclopedic articles and resources covering newsworthy events within hours or days of their occurrence it also means that like any publication wikipedia may reflect the cultural age socioeconomic and other biases of its contributors there is no systematic process to make sure that obviously important topics are written about so wikipedia may contain unexpected oversights and omissions while most articles may be altered by anyone in practice editing will be performed by a certain demographic younger rather than older male rather than female rich enough to afford a computer rather than poor et cetera and may therefore show some bias some topics may not be covered well while others may be covered in great depth allowing anyone to edit wikipedia means that it is more easily vandalized or susceptible to unchecked information which requires removal see wikipediaadministrator intervention against vandalism while blatant vandalism is usually easily spotted and rapidly corrected wikipedia is more subject to subtle viewpoint promotion than a typical reference work however bias that would be unchallenged in a traditional reference work is likely to be ultimately challenged or considered on wikipedia while wikipedia articles generally attain a good standard after editing it is important to note that fledgling articles and those monitored less well may be susceptible to vandalism and insertion of false information wikipedias radical openness also means that any given article may be at any given moment in a bad state such as in the middle of a large edit or a controversial rewrite many contributors do not yet comply fully with key policies or may add information without citable sources wikipedias open approach tremendously increases the chances that any particular factual error or misleading statement will be relatively promptly corrected numerous editors at any given time are monitoring recent changes and edits to articles on their watchlists wikipedia is written by open and transparent consensus—an approach that has its pros and cons censorship or imposing official points of view is extremely difficult to achieve and usually fails after a time eventually for most articles all notable views become fairly described and a neutral point of view reached in reality the process of reaching consensus may be long and drawnout with articles fluid or changeable for a long time while they find their neutral approach that all sides can agree on reaching neutrality is occasionally made harder by extremeviewpoint contributors wikipedia operates a full editorial dispute resolution process one that allows time for discussion and resolution in depth but one that also permits disagreements to last for months before poorquality or biased edits are removed a common conclusion is that wikipedia is a valuable resource and provides a good reference point on its subjects that said articles and subject areas sometimes suffer from significant omissions and while misinformation and vandalism are usually corrected quickly this does not always happen see for example this incident in which a person inserted a fake biography linking a prominent journalist to the kennedy assassinations and soviet russia as a joke on a coworker which went undetected for four months saying afterwards he didn’t know wikipedia was used as a serious reference tool wikipedia is written largely by amateurs those with expert credentials are given no additional weight wikipedia is also not subject to any peer review for scientific medical or engineering articles one advantage to having amateurs write in wikipedia is that they have more free time on their hands so that they can make rapid changes in response to current events the wider the general public interest in a topic the more likely it is to attract contributions from nonspecialists the mediawiki software that runs wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes thus information added to wikipedia never vanishes irreversibly discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics therefore serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article as with any source information should be checked a 2005 editorial by a bbc technology writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that are happening across all sources of information including search engines and the media and may lead to a better sense of how to evaluate information sources3 disclaimers disclaimers general content legal medical risk related academic use nonwikipedia v t e main page wikipediageneral disclaimer wikipedia disclaimers apply to all pages on wikipedia however the consensus in wikipedia is to put all disclaimers only as links and at the end of each article proposals to have a warning box at the beginning have been rejected some do not like the way it looks or that it calls attention to possible errors in wikipedia wikipedia in common with many websites has a disclaimer that at times has led to commentators citing these in order to support a view that wikipedia is unreliable a selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often regarded as reliable including sources such as

clicking on the edit tab in an article before beginning to contribute however read some handy helping tools such as the tutorial and the policies and guidelines as well as our welcome page creating an account offers many benefits it is important to realize that in contributing to wikipedia users are expected to be civil and neutral respecting all points of view and only add verifiable and factual information rather than personal views and opinions the five pillars of wikipedia cover this approach and are recommended reading before editing vandals are reported via the administrator notice board and may be temporarily blocked from editing wikipedia most articles start as stubs but after many contributions they can become featured articles once the contributor has decided a topic of interest they may want to request that the article be written or they could research the issue and write it themselves wikipedia has ongoing projects focused on specific topic areas or tasks which help coordinate editing the ease of editing wikipedia results in many people editing that makes the updating of the encyclopedia very quick almost as fast as news websites editing wikipedia pages main pages helpediting and helpwiki markup play media editing tutorial for wikipedia using classic wiki markup 307 min wikipedia uses a simple yet powerful page layout to allow editors to concentrate on adding material rather than page design page aspects facilitated include sections and subsections—which follow a pages lead sectionintroduction and if specific conditions are met a table of contents references images tables indentations lists links isbns maths formatting elements and most world alphabets and common symbols most of which have simple formats that are deliberately very easy and intuitive normally editing is chosen by clicking the edit tab at the top of a wikipedia page or on a sectionedit link this will take you to a new page with a text box containing the editable text of the page you were viewing in this box you can type in the text that you want to add using wiki markup to format the text and add other elements like images and tables you should then press the show preview button to review your contributions for any errors when you have finished editing you should write a short edit summary in the small field below the editbox describing your changes before you press the save page button this will help others to understand the intention of your edit to avoid accidentally leaving edit summaries blank you can select prompt me when entering a blank edit summary on the editing tab of your personal preferences page editing is accessed through tabs that are found along the top edge of the page these are article shows the main wikipedia article talk shows a user discussion about the articles topic and possible revisions controversies etc edit this tab allows users to edit the article depending on the page’s susceptibility to vandalism according to its visibility or the degree of controversy surrounding the topic this tab may not be shown for all users for example any user who is not an administrator will not be able to edit the main page view history this tab allows readers to view the editors of the article and the changes that have been made star watch if you are logged into your account clicking on the star icon will cause any changes made to the article to be displayed on the watchlist note when this icon is clicked it changes to a filledin star wikipedia has robust version and reversion controls this means that poorquality edits or vandalism can quickly and easily be reversed or brought up to an appropriate standard by any other editor so inexperienced editors cannot accidentally do permanent harm if they make a mistake in their editing as there are many more editors intent on improving articles than not errorridden articles are usually corrected promptly wikipedia content criteria main pages wikipediawikipedia in brief

main pages wikipediaadministration and wikipediaeditorial oversight and control play media video guided tour 2 why does wikipedia work even though anyone can edit it the wikipedia community is largely selforganising so that anyone may build a reputation as a competent editor and become involved in any role she may choose subject to peer approval individuals often will choose to become involved in specialised tasks such as reviewing articles at others request watching current edits for vandalism watching newly created articles for quality control purposes or similar roles editors who believe they can serve the community better by taking on additional administrative responsibility may ask their peers for agreement to undertake such responsibilities this structure enforces meritocracy and communal standards of editorship and conduct at present a minimum approval of 75–80 from the community is required to take on these additional tools and responsibilities this standard tends to ensure a high level of experience trust and familiarity across a broad front of aspects within wikipedia a variety of softwareassisted systems and automated programs help editors and administrators to watch for problematic edits and editors theoretically all editors and users are treated equally with no power structure there is however a hierarchy of permissions and positions some of which are listed hereafter anyone can edit most of the articles here some articles are protected because of vandalism or editwarring and can only be edited by certain editors anyone with an account that has been registered for four days or longer and has made at least ten edits becomes autoconfirmed and gains the technical ability to do three things that nonautoconfirmed editors cannot move articles edit semiprotected articles vote in certain elections minimum edit count to receive suffrage varies depending on the election many editors with accounts obtain access to certain tools that make editing easier and faster few editors learn about most of those tools but one common privilege granted to editors in good standing is rollback which is the ability to undo edits more easily administrators admins or sysops have been approved by the community and have access to some significant administrative tools they can delete articles block accounts or ip addresses and edit fully protected articles bureaucrats are chosen in a process similar to that for selecting administrators there are not very many bureaucrats they have the technical ability to add or remove admin rights and approve or revoke bot privileges the arbitration committee is analogous to wikipedias supreme court they deal with disputes that remain unresolved after other attempts at dispute resolution have failed members of this committee are elected by the community and tend to be selected from among the pool of experienced admins stewards hold the top echelon of community permissions stewards can do a few technical things and one almost never hears much about them since they normally only act when a local admin or bureaucrat is not available and hence almost never on the english wikipedia there are very few stewards jimmy wales the founder of wikipedia has several special roles and privileges in most instances however he does not expect to be treated differently than any other editor or administrator handling disputes and abuse main pages wikipediavandalism wikipediadispute resolution wikipediaconsensus wikipediasock puppetry and wikipediaconflict of interest wikipedia has a rich set of methods to handle most abuses that commonly arise these methods are welltested and should be relied upon intentional vandalism can be reported and corrected by anyone unresolved disputes between editors whether based upon behavior editorial approach or validity of content can be addressed through the talk page of an article through requesting comments from other editors or through wikipedias comprehensive dispute resolution process abuse of user accounts such as the creation of internet sock puppets or solicitation of friends and other parties to enforce a nonneutral viewpoint or inappropriate consensus within a discussion or to disrupt other wikipedia processes in an annoying manner are addressed through the sock puppet policy in addition new users may initially find that their votes are given less weight by editors in some informal polls in order to prevent abuse of singlepurpose accounts editorial quality review as well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits wikipedia also has a full style and content manual and a variety of positive systems for continual article review and improvement examples of the processes include peer review good article assessment and the featured article process a rigorous review of articles that are intended to meet the highest standards and showcase wikipedias capability to produce highquality work in addition specific types of article or fields often have their own specialized and comprehensive projects assessment processes such as biographical article assessment and expert reviewers within specific subjects nominated articles are also frequently the subject of specific focus on the neutral point of view noticeboard or in wikiproject cleanup technical attributes wikipedia uses mediawiki software the opensource
