cure from wikipedia the free encyclopedia   redirected from remission medicine jump to navigation search for other uses see cure disambiguation a cure is the end of a medical condition the substance or procedure that ends the medical condition such as a medication a surgical operation a change in lifestyle or even a philosophical mindset that helps end a persons sufferings or the state of being healed or cured a remission is a temporary end to the medical signs and symptoms of an incurable disease a disease is said to be incurable if there is always a chance of the patient relapsing no matter how long the patient has been in remission an incurable disease may or may not be a terminal illness conversely a curable illness can still result in the patients death the proportion of people with a disease that are cured by a given treatment called the cure fraction or cure rate is determined by comparing diseasefree survival of treated people against a matched control group that never had the disease1 another way of determining the cure fraction andor cure time is by measuring when the hazard rate in a diseased group of individuals returns to the hazard rate measured in the general population23 inherent in the idea of a cure is the permanent end to the specific instance of the disease45 when a person has the common cold and then recovers from it the person is said to be cured even though the person might someday catch another cold conversely a person that has successfully managed a disease such as diabetes mellitus so that it produces no undesirable symptoms for the moment but without actually permanently ending it is not cured related concepts whose meaning can differ include response remission and recovery contents 1 statistical model 2 similar concepts 21 remission 22 others 3 examples 4 see also 5 references statistical modeledit in complex diseases such as cancer researchers rely on statistical comparisons of diseasefree survival dfs of patients against matched healthy control groups this logically rigorous approach essentially equates indefinite remission with cure6 the comparison is usually made through the kaplanmeier estimator approach7 the simplest cure rate model was published by berkson and gage in 19527 in this model the survival at any given time is equal to those that are cured plus those that are not cured but who have not yet died or in the case of diseases that feature asymptomatic remissions have not yet redeveloped signs and symptoms of the disease when all of the noncured people have died or redeveloped the disease only the permanently cured members of the population will remain and the dfs curve will be perfectly flat the earliest point in time that the curve goes flat is the point at which all remaining diseasefree survivors are declared to be permanently cured if the curve never goes flat then the disease is formally considered incurable with the existing treatments the berkson and gage equation is s t p 1 − p × s ∗ t displaystyle stp1ptimes st where s t displaystyle st is the proportion of people surviving at any given point in time p displaystyle p is the proportion that are permanently cured and s ∗ t displaystyle st is an exponential curve that represents the survival of the noncured people cure rate curves can be determined through an analysis of the data7 the analysis allows the statistician to determine the proportion of people that are permanently cured by a given treatment and also how long after treatment it is necessary to wait before declaring an asymptomatic individual to be cured3 several cure rate models exist such as the expectationmaximization algorithm and markov chain monte carlo model7 it is possible to use cure rate models to compare the efficacy of different treatments7 generally the survival curves are adjusted for the effects of normal aging on mortality especially when diseases of older people are being studied8 from the perspective of the patient particularly one that has received a new treatment the statistical model may be frustrating6 it may take many years to accumulate sufficient information to determine the point at which the dfs curve flattens and therefore no more relapses are expected some diseases may be discovered to be technically incurable but also to require treatment so infrequently as to be not materially different from a cure other diseases may prove to have a multiple plateaus so that what was once hailed as a cure results unexpectedly in very late relapses consequently patients parents and psychologists developed the notion of psychological cure or the moment at which the patient decides that the treatment was sufficiently likely to be a cure as to be called a cure6 for example a patient may declare himself to be cured and to determine to live his life as if the cure were definitely confirmed immediately after treatment similar conceptsedit remissionedit remission is the state of absence of disease activity in patients known to have a chronic illness that cannot be cured it is commonly used to refer to absence of active cancer or inflammatory bowel disease when these diseases are expected to manifest again in the future a partial remission may be defined for cancer as 50 or greater reduction in the measurable parameters of tumor growth as may be found on physical examination radiologic study or by biomarker levels from a blood or urine test a complete remission is defined as complete disappearance of all such manifestations of disease each disease or even clinical trial can have its own definition of a partial remission othersedit a response is a partial reduction in symptoms after treatment a recovery is a restoration of health or functioning a person who has been cured may not be fully recovered and a person who has recovered may not be cured as in the case of a person in a temporary remission or who is an asymptomatic carrier for an infectious disease prevention is a way to avoid an injury sickness disability or disease in the first place and generally it will not help someone who is already ill though there are exceptions for instance many babies and young children are vaccinated against polio and other infectious diseases which prevents them from contracting polio but the vaccination does not work on patients who already have polio a treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started therapy treats a problem and may or may not lead to its cure in incurable conditions a treatment ameliorates the medical condition often only for as long as the treatment is continued or for a short while after treatment is ended for example there is no cure for aids but treatments are available to slow down the harm done by hiv and extend the treated persons life treatments dont always work for example chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer but it may not work for every patient in easily cured forms of cancer such as childhood leukemias testicular cancer and hodgkin lymphoma cure rates may approach 909 in other forms treatment may be essentially impossible a treatment need not be successful in 100 of patients to be considered curative a given treatment may permanently cure only a small number of patients so long as those patients are cured the treatment is considered curative examplesedit the most common example of a complete cure is a bacterial infection treated with antibiotics10 in 1999 the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization established a goal to cure 85 of tuberculosis patients in russia they reached an 80 success rate with 75 of the diseased cured and 5 that had otherwise successfully finished treatment see alsoedit eradication of infectious
