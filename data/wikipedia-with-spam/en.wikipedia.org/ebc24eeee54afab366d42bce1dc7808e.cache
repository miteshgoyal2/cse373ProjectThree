internas the majority of these historically hispanophone populations eventually adopted english as their first language as part of their overall americanization mexicanamerican history spans more than 400 years and varies from region to region within the united states in 1900 there were slightly more than 500000 hispanics of mexican descent living in new mexico arizona nevada colorado california and texas7 most were mexican americans of spanish descent and other hispanicized european settlers who settled in the southwest during spanish colonial times as well as local and mexican indians approximately ten percent of the current mexicanamerican population are descended from the early colonial settlers their families claim hundreds of years residency in the country8 as early as 1813 some of the tejanos who colonized texas in the spanish colonial period established a government in texas that desired independence from spanishruled mexico in those days there was no concept of identity as mexican many mexicans were more loyal to their statesprovinces than to their country as a whole which was a colony of spain this was particularly true in frontier regions such as zacatecas texas yucatán oaxaca new mexico etc9 as shown by the writings of colonial tejanos such as antonio menchaca the texas revolution was initially a colonial tejano cause mexico encouraged immigration from the united states to settle east texas and by 1831 englishspeaking settlers outnumbered tejanos ten to one in the region both groups were settled mostly in the eastern part of the territory10 the mexican government became concerned about the increasing volume of angloamerican immigration and restricted the number of settlers from the united states allowed to enter texas consistent with its abolition of slavery the mexican government banned slavery within the state which angered american slave owners11 the american settlers along with many of the tejano rebelled against the centralized authority of mexico city and the santa anna regime while other tejano remained loyal to mexico and still others were neutral1213 author john p schmal wrote of the effect texas independence had on the tejano community14 a native of san antonio juan seguín is probably the most famous tejano to be involved in the war of texas independence his story is complex because he joined the anglo rebels and helped defeat the mexican forces of santa anna but later on as mayor of san antonio he and other tejanos felt the hostile encroachments of the growing anglo power against them after receiving a series of death threats seguín relocated his family in mexico where he was coerced into military service and fought against the us in 1846–1848 mexican–american war although the events of 1836 led to independence for the people of texas the hispanic population of the state was very quickly disenfranchised to the extent that their political representation in the texas state legislature disappeared entirely for several decades mural in chicano park san diego stating all the way to the bay as a spanish colony the territory of california also had an established population of colonial settlers californios is the term for the spanishspeaking residents of modernday california they were the original mexicans regardless of race and local hispanicized indians in the region alta california before the united states acquired it as a territory in the mid19th century more settlers from the united states began to enter the territory in california spanish settlement began in 1769 with the establishment of the presidio and catholic mission of san diego 20 more missions were established along the california coast by 1823 along with military presidios and civilian communities settlers in california tended to stay close to the coast and outside of the california interior the california economy was based on agriculture and livestock in contrast to central new spain coastal colonists found little mineral wealth some became farmers or ranchers working for themselves on their own land or for other colonists government officials priests soldiers and artisans settled in towns missions and presidios15 one of the most important events in the history of mexican settlers in california occurred in 1833 when the mexican government secularized the missions in effect this meant that the government took control of large and vast areas of land these lands were eventually distributed among the population in the form of ranchos which soon became the basic socioeconomic units of the province15 relations between californios and englishspeaking settlers were relatively good until 1846 when military officer john c fremont arrived in alta california with a united states force of 60 men on an exploratory expedition fremont made an agreement with comandante castro that he would stay in the san joaquin valley only for the winter then move north to oregon however fremont remained in the santa clara valley then headed towards monterey when castro demanded that fremont leave alta california fremont rode to gavilan peak raised a us flag and vowed to fight to the last man to defend it after three days of tension fremont retreated to oregon without a shot being fired with relations between californios and americans quickly souring fremont returned to alta california where he encouraged europeanamerican settlers to seize a group of castros soldiers and their horses another group seized the presidio of sonoma and captured mariano vallejo the henry b gonzález convention center and lila cockrell theater along the san antonio river walk the tower of the americas is visible in the background the americans chose william b ide as chosen commander in chief and on july 5 he proclaimed the creation of the bear flag republic on july 9 us military forces reached sonoma they lowered the bear flag republics flag replacing it with a us flag californios organized an army to defend themselves from invading american forces after the mexican army retreated from alta california to defend other parts of mexico the californios defeated an american force in los angeles on september 30 1846 in turn they were defeated after the americans reinforced their forces in what is now southern california tens of thousands of miners and associated people arrived during the california gold rush and their activities in some areas meant the end of the californios ranching lifestyle many of the englishspeaking 49ers turned from mining to farming and moved often illegally onto land granted to californios by the former mexican government16 the united states had first come into conflict with mexico in the 1830s as the westward spread of united states settlements and of slavery brought significant numbers of new settlers into the region known as tejas modernday texas then part of mexico the mexican–american war followed by the treaty of guadalupehidalgo in 1848 and the gadsden purchase in 1853 extended us control over a wide range of territory once held by mexico including the presentday borders of texas and the states of new mexico colorado utah nevada arizona and california an example of a chicanothemed mural in the richard riordan central library although the treaty promised that the landowners in this newly acquired territory would have their property rights preserved and protected as if they were citizens of the united states many former citizens of mexico lost their land in lawsuits before state and federal courts over terms of land grants or as a result of legislation passed after the treaty17 even those statutes which congress passed to protect the owners of property at the time of the extension of the united states borders such as the 1851 california land act had the effect of dispossessing californio owners they were ruined by the cost over years of having to maintain litigation to support their land titles following the concession of california to the united states under the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo mexicans were repeatedly targeted by legislation that targeted their socioeconomic standing in the area one significant instance of this is exemplified by the passage of legislation that placed the heaviest tax burden on land the fact that there was such a heavy tax on land was important to the socioeconomic standing of mexican americans because it essentially limited their ability to keep possession of the ranchos that had been originally granted to them by the mexican government15 19thcentury mexican migrationedit the first mexican braceros arrived in california in 1917 in the late nineteenth century liberal mexican president porfirio díaz embarked on a program of economic modernization that triggered not only a wave of internal migration in mexico from rural areas to cities but also mexican emigration to the united states a railway network was constructed that connected central mexico to the us border and also opened up previously isolated regions the second factor was the shift in land tenure that left mexican peasants without title or access to land for farming on their own account18 for the first time mexicans in increasing numbers migrated north into the us for better economic opportunities 20th centuryedit mexican community in seattle while mexican americans were once concentrated in the southwest california arizona new mexico colorado and texas during world war i they moved to industrial communities such as st louis chicago detroit cleveland pittsburgh and other steelproducing regions where they gained industrial jobs like european immigrants they were attracted to work that did not require proficiency in english industrial restructuring in the second half of the century put many mexican americans out of work in addition to people of other ethnic groups their industrial skills were not as useful in the changing economies of these areas during the first half of the 20th century mexicanamerican workers formed unions of their own and joined integrated unions the most significant union struggle involving mexican americans was the effort to organize agricultural workers and the united farm workers long strike and boycott aimed at grape growers in the san joaquin and coachella valleys in the late 1960s leaders césar chávez and dolores huerta gained national prominence as they led a workers rights organization that helped workers get unemployment insurance to an effective union of farmworkers almost overnight the struggle to protect rights and sustainable wages for migrant workers has continued since the late 20th century mexican illegal immigrants have increasingly become a large part of the workforce in industries such as meat packing where processing centers have moved closer to ranches in relatively isolated rural areas of the midwest in agriculture in the southeastern united states and in the construction landscaping restaurant hotel and other service industries throughout the country mariachi bands who are available for hire wait at the mariachi plaza in los angeles mexicanamerican identity has changed throughout these years over the past hundred years activist mexican americans have campaigned for their constitutional rights as citizens to overturn discrimination in voting and to gain other civil rights they have opposed educational and employment discrimination and worked for economic and social advancement in numerous locations court cases have been filed under the voting rights act of 1965 to challenge practices such as poll taxes and literacy tests in english that made it more difficult for spanishlanguage minorities to register and vote at the same time many mexican americans have struggled with defining and maintaining their communitys cultural identity as distinct from mainstream united states that changes in response to the absorption of countless new immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s some latinohispanic student groups flirted with mexican nationalism and differences over the proper name for members of the community discussion over selfidentification as chicanochicana latinolatina mexican americans or hispanics became tied up with deeper disagreements over whether to integrate into or remain separate from mainstream american society there were divisions between those mexican americans whose families had lived in the united states for two or more generations and more recent immigrants in addition to distinctions from other hispanic or latino immigrants from nations in central and south america with their own distinct cultural traditions during this period civil rights groups such as the national mexicanamerican antidefamation committee were founded by the early 21st century the states with the largest percentages and populations of mexican americans are california arizona new mexico texas colorado nevada and utah there have also been markedly increasing populations in oklahoma pennsylvania and illinois19 in terms of religion mexican americans are primarily roman catholic a large minority are evangelical protestants notably according to a pew hispanic center report in 2006 and the pew religious landscape survey in 2008 mexican americans are significantly less likely than other hispanic groups to abandon catholicism for protestant churches2021 race and ethnicityedit main article mexicans ethnically mexican americans are a diverse population including those of european ancestry mostly spanish indigenous ancestry a mixture of both and mexicans of middle eastern descent mainly lebanese the mexican population is majority mestizo which in colonial times meant to be a person of half european and half native american ancestry nonetheless the meaning of the word has changed through time currently being used to refer to the segment of the mexican population who does not speak indigenous languages22 thus in mexico the term mestizo has become a cultural label rather than a racial one its vaguely defined and includes people who does not have indigenous ancestry people who does not have european ancestry as well as people of african ancestry23 such transformation of the word is not a casualty but the result of a concept known as mestizaje which was promoted by the postrevolutionary mexican government in an effort to create a united mexican ethnocultural identity with no racial distinctions24 its because of this that sometimes the mestizo population in mexico is estimated to be as high as 93 of the mexican population25 per the 2010 us census the majority 528 of mexican americans identified as being white26 the remainder identified themselves as being of some other race 395 two or more races 50 native american 14 black 09 and asian pacific islander 0426 2010 us census26 selfidentified race percent of population white alone   528 black   09 asian   04 american indians and alaska natives   14 native hawaiians and other pacific islanders   02 two or more races   50 some other race   395 total   100 this identification as some other race reflects activism among mexican americans as claiming a cultural status and working for their rights in the united states as well as the separation due to different language and culture hispanics are not a racial classification however but an ethnic group in the 21st century genetic studies done in the mexican population have concluded that a high proportion of the mexican population has predominately european ancestry in some studies the population is shown to be majority european comparable to south american countries in which a higher proportion of the population has traditionally been classified as european or white such as chile and costa rica who have an estimated average european ancestry of 5127 and 60 respectively28 while studies made in the mexican population have found european ancestry ranging from 5629 going to 6030 6431 and up to 7832 there is genetic asymmetry with the direct paternal line predominately european and the maternal line predominately amerindian laura harring in 1985 harring became the first latina woman crowned miss usa for instance a 2006 study conducted by mexicos national institute of genomic medicine inmegen which genotyped 104 samples reported that mestizo mexicans are 5896 european 3505 asian primarily amerindian and 503 other33 according to a 2009 report by the mexican genome project which sampled 300 mestizos from six mexican states and one indigenous group the gene pool of the mexican mestizo population was calculated to be 552 percent indigenous 418 european 10 african and 12 asian34 a 2012 study published by the journal of human genetics found the deep paternal ancestry of the mexican mestizo population to be predominately european 649 followed by amerindian 308 and asian 1235 a 2013 study published by the american journal of physical anthropology found the maternal ancestry of the mexican mestizo population to be predominately amerindian 929 followed by european 53 and african 1936 in 2011 a largescale mitochondrial sequencing in mexican americans revealed 85 to 90 of maternal mtdna lineages are of native american origin with the remainder having european 57 or other ancestry 3537 an autosomal ancestry study performed on mexico city reported that the european ancestry of mexicans was 52 with the rest being amerindian and a small african contribution additionally maternal ancestry was analyzed with 47 being of european origin unlike previous studies which only included mexicans who selfidentified as mestizos the only criteria for sample selection in this study was that the volunteers selfidentified as mexicans38 while mexico does not have comprehensive modern racial censuses some international publications believe that mexican people of predominately european descent spanish or other european make up approximately onesixth 165 this based on the figures of the last racial census in the country made in 192139 albeit such numbers might be too low to accurately reflect the racial composition of modern mexico considering that recent research has determined that 18540 to 2341 of the mexican population has blond hair and 285 has light eyes40 this further highlights the vagueness and subjetivity of the mestizo classification as it includes persons with a european admixture as high or higher than 90 as well as people who does not have native admixture at all42 producing an overlap between them the mexican government therefore decided to abandon racial classifications due to it being of little use to delineate between white and mestizo in these cases focusing its contemporary ethnoracial research in phenotypical traits such as skin and hair color said surveys performed by the government with the intent of having a precise outlook of social and economic unequalities between light skinned european looking mexicans and indigenousafrican looking mexicans43 suggest a modern white mexican population of 474445 us census bureau classificationsedit as the united states borders expanded the united states census bureau changed its racial classification methods for mexican americans under united states jurisdiction the bureaus classification system has evolved significantly from its inception from 1790 to 1850 there was no distinct racial classification of mexican americans in the us census the categories recognized by the census bureau were white free people of color and black the census bureau estimates that during this period the number of persons who could not be categorized as white or black did not exceed 025 of the total population based on 1860 census data46 from 1850 through 1920 the census bureau expanded its racial categories to include multiracial persons under mestizos mulattos as well as new categories of distinction of amerindians and asians it classified mexicans and mexican americans as white46 the 1930 us census revoked generic white status for mexican americans due to protests among certain parts of the population over a diluted definition of whiteness this decision followed a period in which virginia and some other racially segregated states passed laws imposing binary classification and the onedrop rule requiring classification of all persons with any known african ancestry as blackcitation needed the new form asked for color or race census workers were instructed to differentiate between european whites and known people of mexican descent and to write ‘w’ for white and ’mex’ for mexican47 in the 1940 census due to widespread protests by the mexican american community following the 1930 changes mexican americans were reclassified as white instructions for enumerators were mexicans – report white w for mexicans unless they are definitely of indigenous or other nonwhite race during the same census however the bureau began to track the white population of spanish mother tongue this practice continued through the 1960 census46 the 1960 census also used the title spanishsurnamed american in their reporting data of mexican americans this category also covered cuban americans puerto ricans and others under the same category from 1970 to 1980 there was a dramatic increase in the number of people who identified as of other race in the census reflecting the addition of a question on hispanic origin to the 100percent questionnaire an increased propensity for hispanics to identify as other than white as they agitated for civil rights and a change in editing procedures to accept reports of other race for respondents who wrote in ethnic hispanic entries such as mexican cuban or puerto rican in 1970 such responses in the other race category were reclassified and tabulated as white during this census the bureau attempted to identify all hispanics by use of the following criteria in sampled sets46 spanish speakers and persons belonging to a household where the head of household was a spanish speaker persons with spanish heritage by birth location or surname persons who selfidentified spanish origin or descent from 1980 on the census bureau has collected data on hispanic origin on a 100percent basis the bureau has noted an increasing number of respondents who identify as of hispanic origin but not of the white race46 for certain purposes respondents who wrote in chicano or mexican or indeed almost all hispanic origin groups in the some other race category were automatically reclassified into the white race group48 politics

mexicanamerican rights activists to prove minority discrimination in the case hernandez v texas 1954 civil rights lawyers for the appellant named pedro hernandez were confronted with a paradox because mexican americans were classified as white by the federal government and not as a separate race in the census lower courts held that they were not being denied equal protection by being tried by juries that excluded mexican americans by practice the lower court ruled there was no violation of the fourteenth amendment by excluding people with mexican ancestry among the juries attorneys for the state of texas and judges in the state courts contended that the amendment referred only to racial not nationality groups thus since mexican americans were tried by juries composed of their racial group—whites—their constitutional rights were not violated the us supreme court ruling in hernandez v texas case held that nationality groups could be protected under the fourteenth amendment and it became a landmark in the civil rights history of the united states49 while mexican americans were allowed to serve in allwhite units during world war ii many mexican–american veterans were discriminated against and even denied medical services by the united states department of veterans affairs when they arrived home they created the gi forum to work for equal treatment50 in times and places in the united states where mexicans were classified as white they were permitted by law to intermarry with what today are termed nonhispanic whites social customs typically approved of such marriages only if the mexican partner was not of visible indigenous ancestry51 legally mexican americans could vote and hold elected office however in many states electoral practices discriminated against them especially as a language minority after they created political organizations such as the league of united latin america citizens and the gi forum mexican americans began to exert more political influence and gain elective office edward roybals election to the los angeles city council in 1949 and to congress in 1962 also represented this rising mexicanamerican political power in the late 1960s the founding of the crusade for justice in denver and the land grant movement in new mexico in 1967 set the bases for what would become known as chicano mexican american nationalism the 1968 los angeles california school walkouts expressed mexicanamerican demands to end de facto ethnic segregation also based on residential patterns increase graduation rates and reinstate a teacher fired for supporting student political organizing a notable event in the chicano movement was the 1972 convention of la raza unida united people party which organized with the goal of creating a third party to give chicanos political power in the us50 in the past mexicans were legally considered white because either they were accepted as being of spanish ancestry or because of early treaty obligations to spaniards and mexicans that conferred citizenship status to mexican peoples before the american civil war numerous slave states bordered mexican territory at a time when whiteness was nearly a prerequisite for us citizenship in those states5253 although mexican americans were legally classified as white in terms of official federal policy many organizations businesses and homeowners associations and local legal systems had official policies in the early 20th century to exclude mexican americans in a racially discriminatory way54 throughout the southwest discrimination in wages was institutionalized in white wages versus lower mexican wages for the same job classifications54 for mexican americans opportunities for employment were largely limited to guest worker programs54 the bracero program begun in 1942 during world war ii when many united states men were drafted for war allowed mexicans temporary entry into the us as migrant workers at farms throughout california and the southwest this program continued until 1964335556 a number of western states passed antimiscegenation laws directed chiefly at chinese and japanese as mexican americans were then classified as white by the census they could not legally marry african or asian americans see perez v sharp according to historian neil foley in his book the white scourge mexicans blacks and poor whites in texas cotton culture mexicans and mexicanamericans in texas did marry nonwhites typically without reprisal57 while of racial segregation and discrimination against both mexican american and african american minorities were subject to segregation and racial discrimination they were treated differently there were legal racial demarcations between whites and blacks in a state like texas whereas the line between whites and mexican americans was not legally defined mexican americans could attend white schools and colleges which were racially segregated against blacks mix socially with whites and marry whites these choices were prohibited to african americans under state laws racial segregation operated separately from economic class and was rarely as rigid for mexican americans as it was for african americans for instance even when some african americans in texas enjoyed higher economic status than mexican americans or whites in an area they were still segregated by law58page needed economic and social issuesedit immigration issuesedit see also 2006 united states immigration reform protests and illegal immigration to the united states see also strangers no longer

makes them highly vulnerable to exploitation by employers many employers however have developed a dont ask dont tell attitude toward hiring undocumented mexican nationals in may 2006 hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants mexicans and other nationalities walked out of their jobs across the country in protest to support immigration reform many in hopes of a path to citizenship similar to the immigration reform and control act of 1986 signed into law by president ronald reagan which granted citizenship to mexican nationals living and working without documentation in the us a rally on may day 2006 in chicago the protests began in response to proposed legislation known as hr 4437 which would raise penalties for illegal immigration and classify undocumented immigrants and anyone who helped them enter or remain in the us as felons even legal immigrants to the united states both from mexico and elsewhere have spoken out against illegal immigration however according to a survey conducted by the pew research center in june 2007 63 of americans would support an immigration policy that would put illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship if they pass background checks pay fines and have jobs learn english while 30 would oppose such a plan the survey also found that if this program was instead labeled amnesty 54 would support it while 39 would oppose60 alan greenspan former chairman of the federal reserve has said that the growth of the workingage population is a large factor in keeping the economy growing and that immigration can be used to grow that population according to greenspan by 2030 the growth of the us workforce will slow from 1 percent to 12 percent while the percentage of the population over 65 years will rise from 13 percent to perhaps 20 percent61 greenspan has also stated that the current immigration problem could be solved with a stroke of the pen referring to the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2007 which would have strengthened border security created a guest worker program and put illegal immigrants currently residing in the us on a path to citizenship if they met certain conditions62 according to data

in media and popular culture6465 mexican americans have also faced discrimination based on ethnicity race culture poverty and use of the spanish language66 since the majority of illegal immigrants in the us have traditionally been from latin america the mexican american community has been the subject of widespread immigration raidscitation needed during the great depression the united states government sponsored a mexican repatriation program which was intended to encourage people to voluntarily move to mexico but thousands were deported against their will more than 500000 individuals were deported approximately 60 percent of which were actually united states citizens6768 in the postwar mccarthy era the justice department launched operation wetback68 zoot suit riots were a series

300000 mexican americans served in the us armed forces17 mexican americans were generally integrated into regular military units however many mexican–american war veterans were discriminated against and even denied medical services by the united states department of veterans affairs when they arrived home33 in 1948 war veteran hector p garcia founded the american gi forum to address the concerns of mexican american veterans who were being discriminated against the agifs first campaign was on the behalf of felix longoria a mexican american private who was killed in the philippines while in the

immigrants mexican food has become part of the mainstream american market just as italian food did decades before and assimilated to the american market like texmex most immigrants from mexico as elsewhere come from the lower classes and from families generationally employed in lower skilled jobs they also are most likely from rural areas thus many new mexican immigrants are not skilled in white collar professions recently some professionals from mexico have been migrating but to make the transition from one country to another involves retraining and readjusting to conform to us laws —ie professional licensing is requiredcitation needed cinco de mayo celebration at the white housein the us the date has become associated with the celebration of mexicanamerican culture in mexico the commemoration of the battle continues to be mostly ceremonial such as through military parades according to james p smith of the research and development corporation the children and grandchildren of latino immigrants tend to lessen educational and income gaps with white american immigrant latino men earn about half of what whites make while second generation usborn latinos make about 78 percent of the salaries of their white counterparts and by the third generation usborn latinos make on average identical wages to their usborn white counterparts74 however the number of mexican american professionals have been growing in size since 201075 huntington 2005 argues that the sheer number concentration linguistic homogeneity and other characteristics of latin american immigrants will erode the dominance of english as a nationally unifying language weaken the countrys dominant cultural values and promote ethnic allegiances over a primary identification as an american testing these hypotheses with data from the us census and national and los angeles opinion surveys citrin et al 2007 show that hispanics generally acquire english and lose spanish rapidly beginning with the second generation and appear to be no more or less religious or committed to the work ethic than nativeborn nonmexican american whites however the children and grandchildren of mexican immigrants were able to make close ties with their extended families in mexico since united states shares a 2000 mile border with mexico many had the opportunity to visit mexico on a relatively frequent basis as a result many mexicans were able to maintain a strong mexican culture language and relationship with others76 south et al 2005 examine hispanic spatial assimilation and interneighborhood geographic mobility their longitudinal analysis of seven hundred mexican puerto rican and cuban immigrants followed from 1990 to 1995 finds broad support for hypotheses derived from the classical account of assimilation into american society high income englishlanguage use and embeddedness in american social contexts increased latin american immigrants geographic mobility into multiethnic neighborhoods us citizenship and years spent in the united states were positively associated with geographic mobility into different neighborhoods while coethnic contact and prior experiences of ethnic discrimination decreased the likelihood that latino immigrants would move from their original neighborhoods and into nonhispanic white census tracts77 intermarriageedit according to 2000 census data usborn ethnic mexicans have a high degree of intermarriage with nonhispanic whites based on a sample size of 38911 usborn mexican husbands and 43527 usborn mexican wives78 506 of usborn mexican men and 453 of usborn mexican women married usborn mexicans78 267 of usborn mexican men and 281 of usborn mexican women married nonhispanic whites and78 136 of usborn mexican men and 174 of usborn mexican women married mexicoborn mexicans78 in addition based on 2000 data there is a significant amount of ethnic absorption of ethnic mexicans into the mainstream population with 16 of the children of mixed marriages not being identified in the census as mexican79 a study done by the national research council us panel on hispanics in the united states published in 2006 looked at not only marriages but also nonmarriage unions it found that since at least 1980 marriage for females across all hispanic ethnic groups including mexican americans has been in a steady decline80 in addition the percentage of births to unmarried mothers increased for females of mexican descent from 203 in 1980 to 408 in 2000 more than doubling in that time frame80 the study also found that for females of all hispanic ethnicities including mexican origin considerably fewer births to unmarried hispanic mothers involve partnerships with nonhispanic white males than is the case for married hispanic mothers second births outside marriage are more likely to involve a nonhispanic black father than births within marriage80 additionally unions among partners from different hispanic origins or between hispanics and nonhispanic blacks are considerably more evident in cohabitation and parenthood than they are in marriage in particular unions between hispanics and nonhispanic blacks are prominent in parenthood especially nonmarital births80 furthermore for 297 of unmarried births to nativeborn females of mexican origin and 40 of unmarried births to females of other hispanic origin which may include mexican american information on the fathers ethnicity was missing80 the study was supported by the us census bureau amongst other sources80 segregation issuesedit housing market practicesedit studies have shown that the segregation among mexican americans and mexican immigrants seems to be declining one study from 1984 found that mexican american applicants were offered the same housing terms and conditions as nonhispanic white americans they were asked to provide the same information regarding employment income credit checks etc and asked to meet the same general qualifications of their nonhispanic white peers81 in this same study it was found that mexican americans were more likely than nonhispanic white americans to be asked to pay a security deposit or application fee81 and mexican american applicants were also more likely to be placed onto a waiting list than nonhispanic white applicants81 battle of chavez ravineedit view of downtown and the palos verdes peninsula the battle of chavez ravine has several meanings but often refers to controversy surrounding government acquisition of land largely owned by mexican americans in los angeles chavez ravine over approximately ten years 1951–1961 the eventual result was the removal of the entire population of chavez ravine from land on which dodger stadium was later constructed the great majority of the chavez ravine land was acquired to make way for proposed public housing the public housing plan that had been advanced as politically progressive and had resulted in the removal of the mexican american landowners of chavez ravine was abandoned after passage of a public referendum prohibiting the original housing proposal and election of a conservative los angeles mayor opposed to public housing years later the land acquired by the government in chavez ravine was dedicated by the city of los angeles as the site of what is now dodger stadium latino segregation versus black segregationedit viramontes childhood neighborhood was divided by the east la interchange in the early 1960s their dogs came with them a book that focuses on the freeway construction and difficult conditions for the mexican americans living in this area at the time when comparing the contemporary segregation of mexican americans to that of black americans some scholars claim that latino segregation is less severe and fundamentally different from black residential segregation suggesting that the segregation faced by latinos is more likely to be due to factors such as lower socioeconomic status and immigration while the segregation of african americans is more likely to be due to larger issues of the history of racism in the us82 legally mexican americans could vote and hold elected office however it was not until the creation of organizations such as the league of united latin america citizens and the gi forum that mexican americans began to achieve political influence edward roybals election to the los angeles city council in 1949 and then to congress in 1962 also represented this rising mexican american political power in the late 1960s the founding of the crusade for justice in denver in and the land grant movement in new mexico in 1967 set the bases for what would become the chicano mexican american nationalism the 1968 los angeles school walkouts expressed mexican american demands to end segregation increase graduation rates and reinstate a teacher fired for supporting student organizing a notable event in the chicano movement was the 1972 convention of la raza unida united people party which organized with the goal of creating a third party that would give chicanos political power in the us50 map of los angeles county showing percentage of population selfidentified as mexican in ancestry or national origin by census tracts heaviest concentrations are in east lost angeles echo parksilver lake south los angeles and san pedrowilmington in the past mexicans were legally considered white because either they were considered to be of full spanish heritage or because of early treaty obligations to spaniards and mexicans that conferred citizenship status to mexican peoples at a time when whiteness was a prerequisite for us citizenship5253 although mexican americans were legally classified as white in terms of official federal policy many organizations businesses and homeowners associations and local legal systems had official policies to exclude mexican americans throughout the southwest discrimination in wages were institutionalized in white wages versus lower mexican wages for the same job classifications for mexican americans opportunities for employment were largely limited to guest worker programs the bracero program which began in 1942 and officially ended in 1964 allowed them temporary entry into the us as migrant workers in farms throughout california and the southwest33545556 mexican americans legally classified as white following antimiscegenation laws in most western states until the 1960s could not legally marry african or asian americans see perez v sharp however most were not socially considered white and therefore according to historian neil foley in the book the white scourge mexicans blacks and poor whites in texas cotton culture mexicans and mexicanamericans did marry nonwhites typically without reprisal despite the similarities between mexican american and african american patterns of segregation there were important differences the racial demarcations between whites and blacks in a state like texas were inviolable whereas those between whites and mexican americans were not it was possible for mexican americans to attend white schools and colleges mix socially with whites and on occasion marry whites all of these things were impossible for african americans largely due to the legalized nature of blackwhite segregation racial segregation was rarely as rigid for mexican americans as it was for african americans even in situations where african americans enjoyed higher economic status than mexican americans58 segregated schoolsedit mendez v westminster was a 1947 federal court case that challenged mexican remedial schools in orange county california in its ruling the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in an en banc decision held that the forced segregation of mexican american students into separate mexican schools was unconstitutional and unlawful because mexicans were white it was the first ruling in the united states in favor of desegregation during certain periodswhen mexican american children sometimes were forced to register at mexican schools where classroom conditions were poor the school year was shorter and the quality of education was substandard83 various reasons for the inferiority of the education given to mexican american students have been listed by james a fergcadima including inadequate resources poor equipment unfit building construction in 1923 the texas education survey commission found that the school year for some nonwhite groups was 16 months shorter than the average school year83 some have interpreted the shortened school year as a means of social control implementing policies to ensure that mexican americans would maintain the unskilled labor force required for a strong economy a lesser education would serve to confine mexican americans to the bottom rung of the social ladder by limiting the number of days that mexican americans could attend school and allotting time for these same students to work in mainly agricultural and seasonal jobs the prospects for higher education and upward mobility were slim83 immigration and segregationedit el paso morning times newspaper january 30 1917 headlinedː bill before congress to prevent mexicans voting depicts the 1917 bath riots begun by carmelita torres at the santa fe international bridge disinfecting plant at the el paso texas and juarez mexico border immigration hubs are popular destinations for latino immigrants these segregated areas have historically served the purpose of allowing immigrants to become comfortable in the united states accumulate wealth and eventually leave84 this model of immigration and residential segregation explained above is the model which has historically been accurate in describing the experiences of latino immigrants however the patterns of immigration seen today no longer follows this model this old model is termed the standard spatial assimilation model more contemporary models are the polarization model and the diffusion model the spatial assimilation model posits that as immigrants would live within this countrys borders they would simultaneously become more comfortable in their new surroundings their socioeconomic status would rise and their ability to speak english would increase the combination of these changes would allow for the immigrant to move out of the barrio and into the dominant society this type of assimilation reflects the experiences of immigrants of the early twentieth century82 polarization model suggests that the immigration of nonblack minorities into the united states further separates blacks and whites as though the new immigrants are a buffer between them this creates a hierarchy in which blacks are at the bottom whites are at the top and other groups fill the middle in other words the polarization model posits that asians and hispanics are less segregated than their african american peers because white american society would rather live closer to asians or hispanics than african americans84 geronimo far right and his apache warriors fought against both mexican and american settlers as well as native americans as apache were territorial the diffusion model has also been suggested as a way of describing the immigrants experience within the united states this model is rooted in the belief that as time passes more and more immigrants enter the country this model suggests that as the united states becomes more populated with a more diverse set of peoples stereotypes and discriminatory practices will decrease as awareness and acceptance increase the diffusion model predicts that new immigrants will break down old patterns of discrimination and prejudice as one becomes more and more comfortable with the more diverse neighborhoods that are created through the influx of immigrants84 applying this model to the experiences of mexican americans forces one to see mexican american immigrants as positive additions to the american melting pot in which as more additions are made to the pot the more equal and accepting society will become the chicano movement and the chicano moratoriumedit see also chicano movement chicano studies and chicano literature a plaque honoring ruben salazar mounted in the globe lobby of the los angeles times building in downtown los angeles in the heady days of the late 1960s when the student movement was active around the globe the chicano movement conducted actions such as the mass walkouts by high school students in denver and east los angeles in 1968 and the chicano moratorium in los angeles in 1970 the movement was particularly strong at the college level where activists formed mecha an organization that seeks to promote chicano unity and empowerment through education and political action but also espouses revanchist ideals centered around taking back the american southwest for mexicans the chicano moratorium formally known as the national chicano moratorium committee was a movement of chicano antiwar activists that built a broadbased but fragile coalition of mexicanamerican groups to organize opposition to the vietnam war the committee was led by activists from local colleges and members of the brown berets a group with roots in the high school student movement that staged walkouts in 1968 known as the east la walkouts also called blowouts the best known historical fact of the moratorium was the death of rubén salazar known for his reporting on civil rights and police brutality the official story is that salazar was killed by a tear gas canister fired by a member of the los angeles county sheriffs department into the silver dollar café at the conclusion of the august 29 rally educationedit parental involvementedit a mexican quinceañera after mass in church parents are commonly associated with being a child’s first teacher as the child grows older the parent’s role in their child’s learning may change however a parent will often continue to serve as a role model there are multiple research articles that have looked at parental involvement and education a key aspect of parental involvement in education is that it can be transmitted in many ways for a long time there has been a misconception that the parents of mexican american students are not involved in their children’s education however multiple studies have demonstrated that parents are involved in their children’s education valencia black 200285 it is important to know that the parents of mexican american students frequently display their involvement through untraditional methods such as consejos homebase practices and high academic expectations sal castro was a mexicanamerican educator and activist he was most well known for his role in the 1968 see walkout literature has demonstrated that parental involvement has had a positive influence in the academic achievement of mexican american students studies have shown that mexican families show their value towards education by using untraditional methods kiyama 201186 one educational practice that is commonly used among mexican families are consejos advice additional research has supported the idea that parents’ consejos have had a significant influence on the education of mexican american students espino 201687 studied the influence that parental involvement had on seven 1st generation mexican american phds the study found that one of the participant’s father would frequently use consejos to encourage his son to continue his education the father’s consejos served as an encouragement tool which motivated the participant to continue his education consejos are commonly associated with the parents’ occupation parents use their occupation as leverage to encourage their child to continue his or her education or else they may end up working an undesirable job espino 2016 while this might not be the most common form of parental involvement studies have shown that it has been an effective tool that encourages mexican american students although that might be an effective tool for mexican american students a mother can be just as a important figure for consejos a mothers role teaches their child the importance of everyday tasks ssuch as knowing how to cook clean and care for oneself in order to be independent and also to help out around the house the children of single mothers have a huge impact on their children in pushing them to be successful in school in order to have a better life than what they provided to their children most single mothers live in poverty and are dependent of the government so they want the best for their children so they are always encouraging their children to be focused and do their best protesters are seen in june 2011 in support of the tucson unified school districts mexicanamerican studies program a new state law effectively ended the program saying it was divisive another study emphasized the importance of homebased parental involvement altschul 201188 conducted a study that tested the effects of six different types of parental involvement and their effect on mexican american students the study used previous data from the national education longitudinal study nels of 1988 the data was used to evaluate the influence of parental practices in the 8th grade and their effect on students once they were in the 10th grade altschul 2011 noted that homebased parental involvement had a more positive effect on the academic achievement of mexican american students than involvement in school organizations the literature suggests that parental involvement in the school setting is not necessary parents can impact the academic achievement of their children from their home additional literature has demonstrated that parent involvement also comes in the form of parent expectations valencia and black 2002 argued that mexican parents place a significant amount of value on education and hold high expectations for their children the purpose of their study was to debunk the notion that mexicans do no value education by providing evidence that shows the opposite setting high expectations and expressing their desire for their children to be academically successful has served as powerful tools to increase of the academic achievement among mexican american students valencia black 2002 keith and lichtman 199589 also conducted a research study that measured the influence of parental involvement and academic achievement the data was collected from the nels and used a total of 1714 students that identified as mexican american chicanao the study found a higher level of academic achievement among 8th grade mexican american students and parents who had high educational aspirations for their children keith lichtman 1995 lauro cavazos secretary of education from august 1988 to december 1990 additional research done by carranza you chhuon and hudley 200990 added support to the idea that high parental expectations were associated with higher achievement levels among mexican american students carranza et al 2009 studied 298 mexican american high school students they studied whether perceived parental involvement acculturation and selfesteem had any effect on academic achievement and aspirations results from their study demonstrated that perceived parental involvement had an influence on the students’ academic achievement and aspirations additionally carranza et al noted that among females those who perceived that their parents expected them to get good grades tended to study more and have higher academic aspirations 2009 the findings suggest that parental expectations can affect the academic performance of mexican american students based on current literature one can conclude that parental involvement is an extremely important aspect of mexican american students’ education the studies demonstrated that parental involvement is not limited to participating in school activities at the school instead parental involvement can be displayed through various forms there are numerous studies that suggest that parental expectations are associated with the achievement level of mexican american students future research should continue to study the reasons why mexican american students perform better when their parents expect them to do well in school furthermore future research can also look into whether gender influences parental expectations in december 2011 stand and deliver was deemed culturally historically or aesthetically significant by the
