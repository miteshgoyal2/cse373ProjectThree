maitland terracestrang road intersection in union mills isle of man in 1955 the brothers barry robin and maurice gibb moved back to their father hugh gibbs hometown of chorltoncumhardy manchester england and formed a skifflerockandroll group the rattlesnakes which consisted of barry on guitar and vocals robin and maurice on vocals and friends paul frost on drums and kenny horrocks on teachest bass in december 1957 the boys began to sing in harmony the story is told that they were going to lip sync to a record in the local gaumont cinema as other children had done on previous weeks but as they were running to the theatre the fragile shellac 78rpm record broke the brothers had to sing live and received such a positive response from the audience that they decided to pursue a singing career9 in may 1958 the rattlesnakes were disbanded when frost and horrocks left so the gibb brothers then formed wee johnny hayes and the blue cats with barry as johnny hayes10 in august 1958 the gibb family including older sister lesley and infant brother andy emigrated to redcliffe just northeast of brisbane in queensland australia the young brothers began performing to raise pocket money they were introduced to leading brisbane radio dj bill gates by speedway promoter and driver bill goode who had hired the brothers to entertain the crowd at the redcliffe speedway in 1960 the crowd at the speedway would throw money onto the track for the boys who generally performed during the interval of meetings usually on the back of a truck that drove around the track and in a deal with goode any money they collected from the crowd they were allowed to keep gates renamed them the bgs later changed to bee gees after his goodes and barry gibbs initials—thus the name was not specifically a reference to brothers gibb despite popular belief11 the family moved to cribb island which was later demolished for brisbane airport while there the brothers attended northgate state school by 1960 the bee gees were featured on television shows including their performance of time is passing by12 in the next few years they began working regularly at resorts on the queensland coast for his songwriting barry sparked the interest of australian star col joye who helped them get a record deal in 1963 with festival records subsidiary leedon records under the name bee gees the three released two or three singles a year while barry supplied additional songs to other australian artists in 1962 the bee gees were chosen as the supporting act for chubby checkers concert at sydney stadium13 from 1963 to 1966 the gibb family lived at 171 bunnerong road maroubra in sydney14 robin gibb recorded the song sydney about the brothers experience living in sydney just prior to his death it was released on his posthumous album 50 st catherines drive15 the house was demolished in 201616 a minor hit in 1965 wine and women led to the groups first lp the bee gees sing and play 14 barry gibb songs by 1966 festival was however on the verge of dropping them from the leedon roster because of their perceived lack of commercial success it was at this time that they met the americanborn songwriter producer and entrepreneur nat kipner who had just been appointed ar manager of a new independent label spin records kipner briefly took over as the groups manager and successfully negotiated their transfer to spin in exchange for granting festival the australian distribution rights to the groups recordingscitation needed through kipner the bee gees met engineerproducer ossie byrne who produced or coproduced with kipner many of the earlier spin recordings most of which were cut at his own small selfbuilt st clair studio in the sydney suburb of hurstville byrne gave the gibb brothers virtually unlimited access to st clair studio over a period of several months in mid196617 the group later acknowledged that this enabled them to greatly improve their skills as recording artists during this productive time they recorded a large batch of original material—including the song that would become their first major hit spicks and specks on which byrne played the trumpet coda—as well as cover versions of current hits by overseas acts such as the beatles they regularly collaborated with other local musicians including members of beat band steve the board led by steve kipner nats teenage son18 frustrated by their lack of success the gibbs decided to return to england in late 1966 ossie byrne travelled with them and colin petersen who eventually became the groups drummer followed soon afterward while at sea in january 1967 they learned that spicks and specks had been awarded best single of the year by goset australias most popular and influential music

polydor records would release their records in the uk and atco records would do so in the us work quickly began on the groups first international album and stigwood launched a promotional campaign to coincide with its release20 stigwood proclaimed that the bee gees were the most significant new talent of 1967 thus initiating the comparison of the bee gees to the beatles before recording the first album the group expanded to include colin petersen and vince melouney21 new york mining disaster 1941 their second british single their firstissued uk 45 rpm was spicks and specks was issued to radio stations with a blank white label listing only the song title some djs immediately assumed this was a new single by the beatles and started playing the song in heavy rotation this helped the song climb into the top 20 in both the uk and us no such chicanery was needed to boost the bee gees second single to love somebody into the us top 20 originally written for otis redding to love somebody a soulful ballad sung by barry has since become a pop standard covered by many artists including the flying burrito brothers rod stewart bonnie tyler janis joplin the animals gary puckett and the union

in the beatles fan club book so we thought we were really there that show had lulu us the move and the stones doing lets spend the night together you have to remember this was really before the superstar was invented so you were all in it together24 ” in late 1967 they began recording for the second album on 21 december 1967 for a live broadcast from liverpool anglican cathedral they performed their own song thank you for christmas which was recorded in the horizontal sessions but was not released until 2008 as well as silent night and hark the herald angels sing the folk group

harum who had a wellknown hit a whiter shade of pale on their german tour26 as robins partner molly hullis recalls germans were wilder than the fans in england at the heights of beatlemania the tour schedule took them to 11 venues in as many days with 18 concerts played finishing with a brace of shows at the stadthalle braunschweig after that the group was off to switzerland as maurice described it “ there were over 5000 kids at the airport in zurich the entire ride to bern the kids were waving union jacks when we got to the hotel the police werent there to meet us and the kids crushed the car we were inside and the windows were all getting smashed in and we were on the floor24 ” on 17 march the band performed words on the ed sullivan show the other artists who performed on that nights

20 album in the us no 1725 following the tour and tv special to promote the album vince melouney left the group desiring to play more of a blues style music than the gibbs were writing melouney did achieve one feat while with the bee gees his composition such a shame from idea is the only song on any bee gees album not written by a gibb brother the group also filmed a bbc television special with frankie howerd called frankie howerd meets the bee gees written by ray galton and alan simpson this gave the group the opportunity to display their comedy skills in sketches with howerd the band were due to begin a sevenweek tour of the us on 2 august 1968 but on 27 july robin collapsed and fell unconscious he was admitted to a london nursing home suffering from nervous exhaustion and the american

sessions but the rest of the band put away instrumental tracks and demos28 odessa cucumber castle and breakupedit the bee gees performing at the tom jones show in early 1969 one of the last performances with robin as he left the group later in march by 1969 the cracks started to show within the group as robin began to feel that stigwood had been favouring barry as the frontman the bee gees performances in early 1969 on the top of the pops and the tom jones show performing i started a joke and first of may as a medley was one of the last live performances of the group with robin29 their next album which was to have been a concept album called masterpeace evolved into the doublealbum odessa most rock critics felt this was the best bee gees album of the 1960s with its progressive rock feel on the title track the countryflavoured marley purt drive and give your best and ballads such as melody fair and first of may the last of which became the only single from the album and was a minor hit feeling the flipside lamplight should have been the aside robin quit the group in mid1969 and launched a solo career the first of many bee gees compilations best of bee gees was released featuring the nonlp single words plus the australian hit spicks and specks the single tomorrow tomorrow was also released and was a moderate hit in the uk where it reached no 23 but it was only no 54 in the us the compilation reached the top 10 in both the uk and the us25 while robin pursued his solo career barry maurice and petersen continued on as the bee gees recording their next album cucumber

which aired on the bbc in 1971 petersen played drums on the tracks recorded for the album but was fired from the group after filming began he went on to form the humpy bong with jonathan kelly his parts were edited out of the final cut of the film and pentangle drummer terry cox was recruited to complete the recording of songs for the album after the album was released in early 1970 it seemed that the bee gees were finished the leadoff single dont forget to remember was a big hit in the uk reaching no 2 but a disappointment in the us only reaching no 73 the next two singles ioio and if i only had my mind on something else barely scraped the charts on 1 december 1969 barry and maurice parted ways professionally30 maurice started to record his first solo album the loner which was not released meanwhile he released the single railroad and starred in the west end musical sing a rude song31 in february 1970 barry recorded a solo album which never saw official release either although ill kiss your memory was released as a single backed by this time without much interest32 meanwhile robin saw success in europe with his no 2 hit saved by the bell and the album robins reign 1970–1974 reformationedit the bee gees performing at the midnight special in 1973 in the summer of 1970 according to barry robin rang me in spain where i was on holiday saying lets do it again by 21 august 1970

how can you mend a broken heart was the first to hit no 1 on the us charts while israel reached no 22 in the netherlands how can you mend a broken heart also brought the bee gees their first grammy award nomination for best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals later that year the groups songs were included in the soundtrack for the film melody in 1972 they hit no 16 in the us with the nonalbum single my world backed by maurices composition on time another 1972 single run to me from the lp to whom it may concern returned them to the uk top 10 for the first time in three years25 on 24 november 1972 the band headlined the woodstock of the west festival at the los angeles coliseum which was a west coast answer to woodstock in new york which also featured sly the family stone

money thats what i want with jerry lee lewis38 also in 1973 they were invited by chuck berry to performtwo songs with him onstage at the midnight special johnny b goode39 and reelin and rockin40 after a tour of united states in early 1974 and a canadian tour later in the year41 the group ended up playing small clubs42 as barry joked we ended up in have you ever heard of batleys the variety club in west yorkshire england43 on the advice of ahmet ertegün head of their us label atlantic records stigwood arranged for the group to record with soul music producer arif mardin the resulting lp mr natural included fewer ballads and foreshadowed the rb direction of the rest of their career when it too failed to attract much interest mardin encouraged them to work within the soul music style the brothers attempted to assemble a live stage band that could replicate their studio sound lead guitarist alan kendall had come on board in 1971 but did not have much to do until mr natural for that album they added drummer dennis bryon and they later added exstrawbs keyboard player blue weaver completing the bee gees band that lasted through the late 70s maurice who had previously performed on piano guitar harpsichord electric piano organ mellotron and bass guitar as well as mandolin and moog synthesiser now confined himself to bass onstage 1975–1979 turning to discoedit main course and children of the worldedit bee gees wordmark logo 1975–81 at eric claptons suggestion the brothers moved to miami florida early in 1975 to record after starting off with ballads they eventually heeded the urging of mardin and stigwood and crafted more danceoriented disco songs including their second us no 1 jive talkin along with us no 7 nights on broadway the band liked the resulting new sound this time the public agreed by sending the lp main course up the charts this album included the first bee gees songs wherein barry used falsetto44 something that would later become a trademark of the band this was also the first bee gees album to have two us top10 singles since 1968s idea main course also became their first charting rb album on the bee gees appearance on the midnight special in 1975 to promote main course they sang to love somebody with helen reddy45 around the same time the bee gees recorded three beatles covers—golden slumberscarry that weight she came in through the bathroom window with barry providing lead vocals and sun king with maurice providing lead vocals for the unsuccessful musicaldocumentary all this and world war ii46 the next album children of the world released in september 1976 was drenched in barrys newfound falsetto and weavers synthesizer disco licks mardin was unavailable to produce so the bee gees enlisted albhy galuten and karl richardson who had worked with mardin during the main course sessions this production team would carry the bee gees through the rest of the 1970s the first single from the album was you should be dancing which features percussion work by musician stephen stills47 the song pushed the bee gees to a level of stardom they had not previously achieved in the us though their new rbdisco sound was not as popular with some die hard fans the pop ballad love so right reached no 3 in the us and boogie child reached us no 12 in january 197748 the album peaked at no 8 in the us49 a compilation bee gees gold was released in november containing the groups hits from 19671972 saturday night fever and spirits having flownedit following a successful live album here at last bee gees live the bee gees agreed with stigwood to participate in the creation of the saturday night fever soundtrack it would be the turning point of their career the cultural impact of both the film and the soundtrack was seismic throughout the world prolonging the disco scenes mainstream appeal the bands involvement in the film did not begin until postproduction as john travolta asserted the bee gees werent even involved in the movie in the beginning  i was dancing to stevie wonder and boz scaggs50 producer robert stigwood commissioned the bee gees to create the songs for the film51 the brothers wrote the songs virtually in a single weekend at château dhérouville studio in france50 barry gibb remembered the reaction when stigwood and music supervisor bill oakes arrived and listened to the demos they flipped out and said these will be great we still had no concept of the movie except some kind of rough script that theyd brought with them  youve got to remember we were fairly dead in the water at that point 1975 somewhere in that zone — the bee gees sound was basically tired we needed something new we hadnt had a hit record in about three years so we felt oh jeez thats it thats our life span like most groups in the late 60s so we had to find something we didnt know what was going to happen50 bill oakes who supervised the soundtrack asserts that saturday night fever did not begin the disco craze rather it prolonged it disco had run its course these days fever is credited with kicking off the whole disco thing—it really didnt truth is it breathed new life into a genre that was actually dying50 three bee gees singles how deep is your love us no 1 uk no 3 stayin alive us no 1 uk no 4 and night fever us no 1 uk no 1 charted high in many countries around the world launching the most popular period of the disco era25 they also penned the song if i cant have you which became a us no 1 hit for yvonne elliman while the bee gees own version was the bside of stayin alive such was the popularity of saturday night fever that two different versions of the song more than a woman received airplay one by the bee gees which was relegated to album track and another by tavares which was the hit the gibb sound was inescapable during a ninemonth period beginning in the christmas season of 1977 seven songs written by the brothers held the no 1 position on the us charts for 27 of 37 consecutive weeks three of their own releases two for brother andy gibb the yvonne elliman single and grease performed by frankie valli fuelled by the films success the soundtrack broke multiple industry records becoming the highestselling album in recording history to that point with more than 40 million copies sold saturday night fever is among musics top five best selling soundtrack albums as of 2010 it is calculated as the 4th highestselling album worldwide52 in march 1978 the bee gees held the top 2 positions on the us charts with night fever and stayin alive the first time this had happened since the beatles on the us billboard hot 100 chart for 25 march 1978 five songs written by the gibbs were in the us top 10 at the same time night fever stayin alive if i cant have you emotion and love is thicker than water such chart dominance had not been seen since april 1964 when the beatles had all five of the top five american singles barry gibb became the only songwriter to have four consecutive number one hits in the us breaking the john lennon and paul mccartney 1964 record these songs were stayin alive love is thicker than water night fever and if i cant have you the bee gees won five grammy awards for saturday night fever over two years album of the year producer of the year with albhy galuten and karl richardson two awards for best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals one in 1978 for how deep is your love and one in 1979 for stayin alive and best vocal arrangement for two or more voices for stayin alive during this era barry and robin also wrote emotion for an old friend australian vocalist samantha sang who made it a top 10 hit with the bee gees singing backing vocals barry also wrote the title song to the film version of the broadway musical grease for frankie valli to perform which went to no 1 the bee gees younger brother andy now followed his older siblings into a music career and enjoyed considerable success produced by barry andy gibbs first three singles all topped the us charts the bee gees also costarred with peter frampton in robert stigwoods film sgt peppers lonely hearts club band 1978 loosely inspired by the classic 1967 album by the beatles the movie had been heavily promoted prior to release and was expected to enjoy great commercial success however it was savaged by the movie critics as a disjointed mess and ignored by the public though some of its tracks charted the soundtrack too was a highprofile flop the single oh darling credited to robin gibb reached no 15 in the us the bee gees followup to saturday night fever was the spirits having flown album it yielded three more hits too much heaven us no 1 uk no 3 tragedy us no 1 uk no 1 and love you inside out us no 125 this gave the act six consecutive no 1 singles in the us within a year and a half equalling the beatles and surpassed only by whitney houston53 in january 1979 the bee gees performed too much heaven as their contribution to the music for unicef concert at the united nations general assembly a benefit organised by the bee gees robert stigwood and david frost for unicef that was broadcast worldwide the brothers donated the royalties from the song to the charity up to 2007 this song has earned over 11 million for unicef during the summer of 1979 the bee gees embarked on their largest concert tour covering the us and canada the spirits having flown tour capitalised on bee gees fever that was sweeping the nation with sold out concerts in 38 cities the bee gees produced a video for the title track too much heaven directed by miamibased filmmaker martin pitts and produced by charles allen with this video pitts and allen began a long association with the brothers the bee gees even had a country hit in 1979 with rest your love on me the flip side of their pop hit too much heaven which made top 40 on the country charts it was also a 1981 hit for conway twitty topping the country music charts54 the bee gees overwhelming success rose and fell with the disco bubble by the end of 1979 disco was rapidly declining in popularity and the backlash against disco put the bee gees american career in a tailspin radio stations around the us began promoting bee geefree weekends following their remarkable run from 1975 to 1979 the act would have only one more top 10 single in the us and that would not come until 1989 barry gibb considered the success of the saturday night fever soundtrack both a blessing and a curse fever was no 1 every week  it wasnt just like a hit album it was no 1 every single week for 25 weeks it was just an amazing crazy extraordinary time i remember not being able to answer the phone and i remember people climbing over my walls i was quite grateful when it stopped it was too unreal in the long run your life is better if its not like that on a constant basis nice though it was50 1980–1986 outside projects band turmoil solo efforts and declineedit robin coproduced jimmy

out jimi hendrix said we were twoyear old beatles he was just giving an opinion at the time people just like to have go at other artists but we are very good friends with jimi now years later gibb recalled he was a great mate of mine he came to my twentyfirst birthday he was an extremely polite bloke i never knew about the drugs then i thought he was acting a bit weird and saying kind of remote things but i was too naive to even consider that it might be drugs i never caught on with jimi and the drugs i saw him drunk a few times because i remember thinking he was always really quiet until he had a few drinks 101 the english indie rock band the cribs was also influenced by the bee gees cribs member ryan jarman said it must have had quite a big influence on us – pop melodies is something we

after the bee gees success on the pop charts they were still writing songs for other people huge hit songs their talent went far beyond their moment of normal pop success it is a loss to the music
