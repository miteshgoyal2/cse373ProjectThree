liberating christianity from its cultural captivity by nancy pearcey as a wonderful book14 journalist ryan lizza has argued that bachmanns worldview is deeply influenced by the christian movement known as dominionism citing the influence of schaeffer and pearcey as evidence14 others have criticized lizzas article especially its connection of schaeffer with dominionism404142 however religion writer sarah posner broadly concurs with lizza pointing to the influence of christian reconstructionists herb titus and r j rushdoony on bachmann via the curriculum at o w coburn school of law4344

a controversial psychological treatment repudiated by the american psychological association which attempts to transform homosexuals into heterosexuals5152 a former client of bachmanns clinic and a hidden camera investigator with the activist group truth wins out have said that therapists at the clinic do engage in such practices5354 although columnist mariah blake of the nation has suggested the hidden camera investigator may have been intentionally baiting the therapist to say something controversial51 in a subsequent interview with the minnesota star tribune marcus bachmann did not deny that he or other counselors at his clinic used the technique but said they did so only at the request of a client38 in personal financial disclosure reports for 2006 through 2009 bachmann reported

bachmann said that in 2006–2009 her husband acted as a trustee of the farm for his dying father and so out of an abundance of caution she claimed the farm as income in financial disclosures though it

state she told the minneapolis star tribune that she was reading gore vidals 1973 novel burr he was kind of mocking the founding fathers and i just thought i just remember reading the book putting it

who file joint tax returns provide more favorable repayment terms to students who fail to use their education to prosper financially78 and favor public sector over private sector workers with much more favorable loan forgiveness benefits79 supporters of the bill said it would allow more students to attend college80 bachmann said her opposition was because it fails students and taxpayers with

american auto companies approached congress to ask for roughly 15 billion in loans to keep them operational into 2009 bachmann criticized that bill fearing that the initial sum of money would be followed by subsequent ones without the companies making changes to revive their business bachmann supported an alternative rescue for the american auto companies and the rest of the auto industry rather than the plan that passed bachmanns alternative would have set benchmarks for reducing their debt and renegotiating labor deals and would set up the financial assistance as interim insurance instead of a taxpayerfinanced bailout92 call for a media exposé of barack obama and members of congress on october 17 2008 bachmann gave an interview on msnbcs hardball with chris matthews in support of the presidential campaign of senator john mccain that brought the minnesota 6th congressional district race national attention during the interview she criticized barack obama for his association with jeremiah wright and bill ayers saying  usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us and it seems that it calls into question what barack obamas true beliefs and values and thoughts are  i am very concerned that he barack obama may have antiamerican views she noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by bill ayers before discussing his association with barack obama arguing that bill ayers is not someone the average american wants to see their president have an association with93 matthews followed up by asking but he obama is a senator from the state of illinois hes one of the members of congress you suspect of being antiamerican how many people in the congress of the united states do you think are antiamerican youve already suspected barack obama is he alone or are there others bachmann answered what i would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look  i wish they would  i wish the american media would take a great look at the views of the people in congress and find out are they proamerica or antiamerica i think people would love to see an exposé like that94 the five democratic members of minnesotas congressional delegation – tim walz betty mccollum keith ellison collin peterson and jim oberstar – issued a joint statement in which they questioned her ability to work in a bipartisan way to put the interests of our country first in this time of crisis95 former secretary of state colin powell9697 and former minnesota governor republican arne carlson98 said that her comments had influenced their decisions to endorse obama for president bachmann brought up the interview before business leaders and republicans during a campaign stop in st cloud minnesota on october 21 2008 she stated that she never intended to question obamas patriotism i made a misstatement i said a comment that i would take back i did not nor do i question barack obamas patriotism  i did not say that barack obama is antiamerican nor do i believe that barack obama is antiamerican  but im very concerned about barack obamas views i dont believe that socialism is a good thing for america99 however in march 2010 bachmann said i said i had very serious concerns that barack obama had antiamerican views—and now i look like nostradamus while speaking at a fundraiser for the susan b anthony list100101 a year later in march 2011 bachmann was asked on meet the press if she still believed that obama held unamerican views she responded i believe that the actions of this government have have been emblematic of ones that have not been based on true american values pressed for clarification she said ive already answered that question before i said i had very serious concerns about the presidents views102 111th congress further information 111th united states congress bachmann speaking in april 2010 global currency on march 26 2009 following comments by china proposing adoption of a global reserve currency bachmann introduced a resolution calling for a constitutional amendment to bar the dollar from being replaced by a foreign currency current law prohibits foreign currency from being recognized in the us but bachmann expressed concerns relating to the presidents power to make and interpret treaties103 earlier that month at a financial services committee hearing bachmann asked both treasury secretary timothy geithner and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke if they would reject calls for the us to move away from the us dollar and they replied that they would reject such a call104 2010 census in a june 17 2009 interview with the washington times bachmann expressed concern that the questions on the 2010 united states census had become very intricate very personal and that acorn a community organizing group that had come under fire the previous year might be part of the census bureaus doortodoor information collection efforts she stated i know for my family the only question we will be answering is how many people are in our home we wont be answering any information beyond that because the constitution doesnt require any information beyond that105 according to politifact her statement was incorrect as the watchdog group confirmed that the constitution does require citizens to complete the census106 fellow republican representatives patrick mchenry nc lynn westmoreland ga and john mica fla – members of the oversight and government reform subcommittee on information policy census and national archives which oversees the census – subsequently asked bachmann not to boycott the

reiterated her belief that the census asks too many personal questions109 come under fire cap and trade legislation in march 2009 bachmann was interviewed by the northern alliance radio network and promoted two forums she was hosting the next month in st cloud and woodbury regarding obamas proposed cap and trade tax policy to limit greenhouse gas emissions bachmann said she wanted minnesotans armed and dangerous on this issue of the energy tax because we need to fight back bachmanns office quickly clarified that she was speaking metaphorically meaning armed with knowledge however according to the star tribune her quote went viral across the internet110111 americorps in 2009 bachmann became a critic of what she characterized as proposals for mandatory public service30 speaking in reference to the edward m kennedy serve america act an expansion to americorps a federal community service organization she said in april its under the guise of—quote—volunteerism but its not volunteers at all its paying people to do work on behalf of government  i believe that there is a very strong chance that we will see that young people will be put into mandatory service and the real concerns is that there are provisions for what i would call reeducation camps for young people where young people have to go and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward and then they have to go to work in some of these politically correct forums112 the original bill called for an exploration of whether a mandatory public service program could be established but that entire section on creating a congressional commission on civic service was stripped from the bill113 in august 2009 political opponents of bachmann publicized in the local media and the blogosphere what they described as the ironic fact that her son harrison joined teach for america114115 which is a member of the americorps program116 health care bachmann contributed to the death panel controversy when she read from a july 24 article written by betsy mccaughey from the floor of the house sarah palin said that her death panel remark was inspired by what she called the orwellian opinions of ezekiel emanuel as described by bachmann117118119120121122 who accused him of advocating health care rationing by age and disability123 according to politifact124 and time125 bachmanns euthanasia remarks distorted emanuels position on health care for the elderly and disabled factcheckorg stated we agree that emanuels meaning is being twisted126 when many doctors wanted to legalize euthanasia or physicianassisted suicide emanuel opposed it127 on august 31 2009 bachmann spoke at an event in colorado saying of democratic health care overhaul proposals that this cannot pass what we have to do today is make a covenant to slit our wrists be blood brothers on this thing this will not pass we will do whatever it takes to make sure this doesnt pass128 she outlined ideas for changing the health care system including erase the boundaries around every single state when it comes to health care enabling consumers to purchase insurance across state lines increase the use of health savings accounts and allow everyone to take full deductibility of all medical expenses including insurance premiums and tort reform128 bachmann denounced the governmentrun health insurance public option calling it a government takeover of health care that would squeeze out private health insurance129 criticism of president obamas visit to asia in an interview with anderson cooper on november 3 2010 when discussing cuts in government spending for medicare and social security suggested by congressman paul ryan bachmann was asked what cuts in government spending she would make to reduce the deficit she cited president obamas thenupcoming visit to asia as an example saying it is expected to cost the taxpayers 200 million a day hes taking two thousand people with him hell be renting out over 870 rooms in india and these are 5star hotel rooms at the taj mahal palace hotel this is the kind of overthetop spending its a very small example anderson bachmann was apparently referring to information in a story from the press trust of india attributed to a top official of the maharashtra government privy to the arrangements for the highprofile visit information that was also published in usbased media such as the drudge report130 in response to the news reports claim that 34 warships were accompanying the president a pentagon spokesman geoff morrell dismissed the account as comical the white house said that the press report figures were wildly inflated and had no basis in reality131 while stating that they could not give the actual projected figures for security reasons staffers maintained costs were in line with the official travel costs of previous presidents bush and clinton130 112th congress leadership run see also list of tea party politicians bachmann in february 2011 after the 2010 elections and the announcement from rep mike pence that he was stepping away from his leadership position in the house bachmann announced on her facebook page her intention to seek the position of house republican conference chair as bachmann is the founder of the houses tea party caucus her announcement caused some to see the leadership election as an early test of how gop leaders will treat the antiestablishment movements winners132 many among the houses republican leadership including eric cantor and the retiring mike pence were quick to endorse rep jeb hensarling for the position speakertobe john boehner remained neutral on the issue133 supporters of bachmanns run include reps steve king john kline louie gohmert chip cravaack erik paulsen as well as media personality and political commentator glenn beck134 listing her qualifications for the position bachmann noted ive done an effective job speaking out at a national and local level motivating people with our message calling attention to deficits in obamas policy i was instrumental in bringing tens of thousands of people to the us capitol to rally against obama care and to attend our press conference134 she noted her work to keep the tea party within the gop rather than having it become a third party thereby helping the party capture the house stating i have been able to bring a voice and motivate people to in effect put that gavel in john boehners hands so that republicans can lead going forward …its important that leadership represents the choice of the people coming into our caucus…i think i have motivated a high number of people to get involved in this cycle who may have sat it out and that have made a difference on a number of these races i gave a large amount of money to nrcc and individual candidates and started michele pac which raised 650000 for members since july so i was able to financially help about 50 people out134 bachmanns bid suffered a setback when she was passed over for the gops transition team on which hensarling was placed135 despite bachmanns leading all other representatives in fund raising a republican aide stated some members are getting resentful of bachmann who they say is making the argument that youre not really a tea party supporter unless you support her thats gone through the formation of the tea party caucus and the formation of this candidacy of hers its just not so135 sarah palin with whom bachmann had campaigned earlier in the year declined to endorse her leadership bid while other tea party favorites reps adam kinzinger and tim scott were placed on the transition team135 according to some senior house staff members the party leadership was concerned about some of bachmanns high profile faux pas the high rate of turnover among her staff and how willing she would be to advance the partys messaging rather than her own136 on november 10 bachmann released a statement ending her campaign for conference chair and giving her enthusiastic support to hensarling137 committee assignment bachmann was selected by house speaker john boehner for a position on the house permanent select committee on intelligence giving her a new role as overseer of the central intelligence agency the national security agency and the rest of the us intelligence community138 bachmann who had not served on any committee that deals with foreign policy issues requested the position138 a move that has fueled speculation that she may be planning to carry the tea party banner into the gop presidential primaries138 repeal of doddfrank reform soon after being sworn into her third term bachmann introduced legislation to repeal the doddfrank financial reform law she stated im pleased to offer a full repeal of the jobkilling doddfrank financial regulatory bill doddfrank grossly expanded the federal government beyond its jurisdictional boundaries it gave washington bureaucrats the power to interpret and enforce the legislation with little oversight real financial regulatory reform must deal with these lenders who were a leading cause of our economic recession true reform must also end the bailout mindset that was perpetuated by the last congress she also took issue with the law for not addressing the liabilities of the taxpayer funded fannie mae and freddie mac139 bachmanns bill was endorsed by conservative groups such as the club for growth and americans for prosperity it gained four other republican cosponsors including rep darrell issa who became the new chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee at the start of the 112th congress140 bachmanns call for total repeal was seen as more drastic than the approach advocated by her fellow republican spencer bachus who became the house financial services committee chairman with the change of majority in the house bachus plans to provide vigorous oversight of regulators efforts to reform banking and housing  reform fannie and freddie and dismantle pieces of the doddfrank act that he believes unnecessarily punish small businesses and community banks140 in response to bachmanns legislation rep barney frank stated michele bachmann the club for growth and others in the rightwing coalition have now made their agenda for the financial sector very clear they yearn to return to the thrilling days of yesteryear so the loan arrangers can ride again—untrammeled by any rules restraining irresponsibility excess deception and most of all infinite leverage140 the chances of bachmanns legislation passing were viewed as unlikely the financial times wrote that like the republican move to repeal healthcare reform ms bachmanns bill could be passed by the house of representatives but be blocked by the senate or white house141 state of the union response bachmann responded to president obamas 2011 state of the union speech for the tea party express website this speech was broadcast live by cnn she insisted that her response was not intended to counter the official republican party response by rep paul ryan of wisconsin when asked if the speech was an indication of competition with ryan and speaker boehners leadership team bachmann dismissed such a view as a fiction of the media she had alerted ryan and the leadership team that her response might go national and no objections were raised142 health care bachmann has characterized the patient protection and affordable care act as obamacare and has continually called for its repeal143 she recalled to reporters that she called for debate to repeal the act the morning after obamacare passed143 joining with rep steve king she introduced the bachmannking repeal of health care bill stating that it is our intent in our heart to make sure that obamacare is completely repealed143 in light of a democratic held senate and presidency that oppose repeal bachmann called on the republican held house of representatives to not provide any funds for the implementation of the act but until we can see that repeal happen we want to fully defund this bill so that like it would be akin to a helium balloon that gets no helium inside so that it cant take off the ground and thats what were planning to do im very very grateful for nothing else having a majority in the house of representatives so that we have the ability of the power of the purse to not fund obamacare and this is exactly the right way to go143 on march 4 2011 bachmann who was one of the six house republicans to vote against the continuing resolution expressed her unhappiness with the move that gave a twoweek reprieve to the fear of government shutdown stating i am vowing to vote no on future continuing resolutions to fund the government unless there is specific language included to defund obamacare and rescind the funding that has already been appropriated defunding obamacare along with defunding planned parenthood must be nonnegotiable planks in our budget negotiations144145 in an appearance on meet the press on march 6 2011 and during a march 7 2011 interview with sean hannity bachmann declared that the obama administration and the congressional democrats had hidden 105 billion in spending in the overhaul of the american health care system she portrayed the democratic leadership as timing the release of the bills text to avoid detection of the spending we didnt get the bill until a literally couple of hours before we were supposed to vote on it146 she also stated the spending was split up within different portions of the bill to mask its total cost bachmann was alerted of the situation by the conservative heritage foundation which read the tallies of the congressional research service and congressional budget office reports listed a partial breakdown of the costs which include about 40 billion would go to the childrens health insurance program 15 billion would go to medicare and medicaid innovation programs and 95 billion would go to the community health centers fund146 as the funds are designated mandatory spending they are not controlled by the annual appropriations acts the funds would remain even if the move to defund the reform law succeeded bachmann stated that 16 billion of the money gives health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius a slush fund  to do whatever she wants with this money146 she called on the bills supporters to return the money i think this deception that the president and former house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid put forward with appropriating over 105 billion needs to be given back to the people147 when asked during the meet the press interview if she would take back her previous comments that obama may have antiamerican views and that his administration had embraced something called gangster government bachmann backed her statements saying i do believe that actions that have been taken by this white house—i dont take back my statements on gangster government i think that there have been actions taken by the government that are corrupt  i said i have very serious concerns about the presidents views and i think the presidents actions in the last two years speak for themselves147 in response to bachmanns charges chief deputy democratic whip rep jan schakowsky who serves on the house health subcommittee pointed out that the report bachmann refers to is an update of a report that came out in october 2010 and that the costs were spelled out in both the bill and the congressional budget offices estimate of its cost michele bachmann obviously didnt read the bill because there was absolutely nothing hidden in that legislation schakowsky held that the costs were not kept secret citing the 40 billion for the childrens health insurance program as an example there was a robust debate about whether or not that should be included etc so this idea of somehow now at the last minute there was a secret addition to some kind of funding  is absolute nonsense148 in a september 2011 republican presidential debate in tampa fl bachmann criticized rick perry for his support for the humanpapilloma virus hpv vaccine and his support for mandating the hpv vaccine for all sixthgrade texas girls149 the american academy of pediatrics centers for disease control and prevention american academy of family physicians american college of obstetricians and gynecologists advisory committee on immunization practices and other medical organizations worldwide are in favor of immunizing girls and boys against hpv150151 hpv can cause lesions and genital warts and has been linked to cervical cancer as well as genital and oral cancers in people of any gender152 because the vaccine is effective only if given before the onset of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to the virus medical groups recommend the three dose vaccine be given to 11 and 12yearolds150152153 bachmann during the debate and in interviews following the event accused perry of “crony capitalism” because perry’s former chief of staff was chief lobbyist for a drug company manufacturing the vaccine and claimed that the hpv vaccine was dangerous and caused mental retardation149152 she repeatedly referred to an anecdotal account from a mother of a girl who been immunized for hpv “she told me that her little daughter took that vaccine that injection and she suffered mental retardation thereafter” bachmann said “there is no second chance for these little girls if there is any dangerous consequences to their bodies149 shortly after bachmann’s statements at the debate the american academy of pediatrics released a statement “the american academy of pediatrics would like to correct false statements made in the republican presidential campaign that hpv vaccine is dangerous and can cause mental retardation there is absolutely no scientific validity to this statement since the vaccine has been introduced more than 35 million doses have been administered and it has an excellent safety record151152153 fewer than one percent of those receiving the vaccine reported neurological side effects or in rare cases severe allergic reactions none linked to changes in cognitive ability149150 bachmann later acknowledged that she was not a doctor or a scientist150 letter on muslim brotherhood influence in june–july 2012 bachmann and several other

speaker john boehner termed bachmanns allegations dangerous and other republicans have also criticized the remarks157 in a letter to bachmann rep keith ellison dminn a muslim asked for evidence backing her claims and stated your response simply rehashes claims that have existed for years on antimuslim websites and contains no reliable information that the muslim brotherhood has infiltrated the us government155 bachmann has replied that the intention of the letters was to outline the serious national security concerns i had and ask for answers to questions regarding the muslim brotherhood and other radical groups access to top obama administration officials158159 in a july 19 interview with radio and tv show host glenn beck bachmann repeated and expanded her allegations
