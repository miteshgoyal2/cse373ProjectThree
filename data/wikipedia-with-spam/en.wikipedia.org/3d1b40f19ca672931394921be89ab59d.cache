common law areas tort law property law wills trusts and estates criminal law evidence v t e restraint of trade is a common law doctrine relating to the enforceability of contractual restrictions on freedom to conduct business it is a precursor of modern competition law in an old leading case of mitchel v reynolds 1711 lord smith lc said1 it is the privilege of a trader in a free country in all matters not contrary to law to regulate his own mode of carrying it on according to his own discretion and choice if the law has regulated or restrained his mode of doing this the law must be obeyed but no power short of the general law ought to restrain his free discretion a contractual undertaking not to trade is void and unenforceable against the promisor as contrary to the public policy of promoting trade unless the restraint of trade is reasonable to protect the interest of the purchaser of a business2 restraints of trade can also appear in posttermination restrictive covenants in employment contracts contents 1 history 11 in england and the uk 12 in the us 2 restraining workers 3 contemporary application 4 see also 5 notes 6 references 7 external links historyedit chief justice coke 17th century english jurist in england and the ukedit restraint of trade in england and the uk was and is defined as a legal contract between a buyer and a seller of a business or between an employer and employee that prevents the seller or employee from engaging in a similar business within a specified geographical area and within a specified periodcitation needed it intends to protect trade secrets or proprietary information but is enforceable only if it is reasonable with reference to the party against whom it is made and if it is not contrary to public policy the restraint of trade doctrine is based on the two concepts of prohibiting agreements that run counter to public policy unless the reasonableness of an agreement could be shown a restraint of trade is simply some kind of agreed provision that is designed to restrain anothers trade for example in nordenfelt v maxim nordenfelt guns and ammunition co2 a swedish arms inventor promised on sale of his business to an american gun maker that he would not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world and would not compete with maxim in any way to be a valid restraint of trade in the first place both parties must have provided valuable consideration for their agreement to be enforceable in dyers case3 a dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return on hearing the plaintiffs attempt to enforce this restraint hull j exclaimed per dieu if the plaintiff were here he should go to prison till he had paid a fine to the king the common law evolved with changing business conditions so in the early 17th century case of rogers v parry4 it was held that a promise by a joiner not to trade from his house for 21 years was enforceable against him since the time and place was certain it was also held by chief justice coke that a man cannot bind himself to not use his trade generally this was followed in broad v jolyffe5 and mitchel v reynolds6 where lord macclesfield asked what does it signify to a tradesman in london what another does in newcastle in times of such slow communications and commerce around the country it seemed axiomatic that a general restraint served no legitimate purpose for ones business and ought to be void but already in 1880 in roussillon v roussillon7 lord justice fry stated that a restraint unlimited in space need not be void since the real question was whether it went further than necessary for the promisees protection so in the nordenfelt2 case lord macnaghten ruled that while one could validly promise to not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world it was an unreasonable restraint to not compete with maxim in any way this approach in england was confirmed by the house of lords in mason v the provident supply and clothing co8 in the usedit in the us the first significant discussion occurred in the sixth circuits opinion by chief judge later us president and still later supreme court chief justice william howard taft in united states v addyston pipe steel co9 judge taft explained the sherman antitrust act of 189010 as a statutory codification of the english commonlaw doctrine of restraint of trade as explicated in such cases as mitchel v reynolds11 the court distinguished between naked restraints of trade and those ancillary to the legitimate main purpose of a lawful contract and reasonably necessary to effectuation of that purpose12 an example of the latter would be a noncompetition clause associated with the lease or sale of a bakeshop as in the mitchel case such a contract should be tested by a rule of reason meaning that it should be deemed legitimate if necessary and ancillary an example of the naked type of restraint would be the pricefixing and bidallocation agreements involved in the addyston case taft said that we do not think there is any question of reasonableness open to the courts to such a contract the supreme court affirmed the judgment during the following century the addyston pipe opinion of judge taft has remained foundational in antitrust analysis13 the 1911 decision of the supreme court in standard oil company of new jersey v united states14 relied on tafts ruleofreason analysis in that case the court concluded that a contract offended the sherman act only if the contract restrained trade unduly—that is if the contract resulted in monopolistic consequences a broader meaning the court suggested would ban normal and usual contracts and would thus infringe liberty of contract the court therefore endorsed the rule of reason enunciated in addyston pipe which in turn derived from mitchel v reynolds and the common law of restraints of trade in more recent cases court continue to base their rulings on the mitchel framework but attention has turned to such issues as necessary to do what and how necessary compared to collateral damage for example even if a restraint is necessary and ancillary within the meaning of the mitchel and addyston pipe cases it may still be an unreasonable restraint of trade if its anticompetive effects and consequent harm to the public interest outweigh its benefits thus judge ginsburg opined in the polygram case if the only way a new product can be profitably introduced is to restrain the legitimate competition of older products then one must seriously wonder whether consumers are genuinely benefited by the new product15 a related issue is whether even if a restraint is necessary and ancillary available means exist to accomplish the desired result which are less harmful the ftcdoj 2000 guidelines for collaborations among competitors say that in determining whether a restraint is reasonably necessary the issue is whether practical significantly less restrictive means were reasonably available when the agreement was entered into16 in other cases questions have been raised as to whether the restraint was necessary and ancillary to accomplishing only something unworthy of recognition given the resulting harm involved in one recent case a court rejected a credit card issuers attempted justification of a restriction against competitive dealings said to be reasonably necessary to promote loyalty and cohesion17 how necessary and necessary to what thus remain controverted issues under the doctrine of mitchel v reynolds restraining workersedit see also noncompete clause under english law restraining clauses in employment contracts are enforceable ifcitation needed there is a legitimate interest which needs to be protected examples of such interests include business connections and business secrets the restraint is reasonable ie sufficiently protects the interest and goes no further generally if a restraining clause is found to be unreasonable then it will be void in certain circumstances though the court may uphold it either by construing ambiguities or by severance severance consists of the application of what is known as the blue pencil test if individual words which make the clause excessively wide are able to be crossed out and the clause still makes grammatical sense without altering the nature of the obligations then the courts may be willing to sever the illegal aspects of the clause and enforce the remainder contemporary applicationedit though the restraint of trade doctrine is still valid the current use has been limited by modern and economically oriented statutes of competition law in most countries it remains of considerable importance in the united states as does the mitchel case however as indicated in the wikipedia article mitchel v reynolds see alsoedit history of competition law unfair competition notesedit mitchel v reynolds 1711 1 p wms 181 a b c
