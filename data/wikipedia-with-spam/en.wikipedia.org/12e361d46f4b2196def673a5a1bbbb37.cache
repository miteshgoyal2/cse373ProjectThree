2010 census takers visited households that did not return a form an operation called nonresponse followup nrfu in december 2010 the census bureau delivered population information to the president for apportionment and in march 2011 complete redistricting data was delivered to states1 personally identifiable information will be available in 208210 major changesedit the census bureau did not use a long form for the 2010 census11 in several previous censuses one in six households received this long form which asked for detailed social and economic information the 2010 census used only a short form asking ten basic questions11 how many people were living or staying in this house apartment or mobile home on april 1 2010 were there any additional people staying here on april 1 2010 that you did not include in question 1 mark all that apply checkboxes for children relatives nonrelatives people staying temporarily none is this house apartment or mobile home – checkboxes for owned with a mortgage owned free and clear rented occupied without rent what is your telephone number what is person 1s name last first what is person 1s sex male female what is person 1s age and person 1s date of birth is person 1 of hispanic latino or spanish origin checkboxes for no and several for yes which specify groups of countries what is person 1s race checkboxes for 14 including other one possibility was black african am or negro does person 1 sometimes live or stay somewhere else checkboxes for no and several locations for yes the form included space to repeat some or all of these questions for up to twelve residents total in contrast to the 2000 census an internet response option was not offered nor was the form available for download1112 detailed socioeconomic information collected during past censuses will continue to be collected through the american community survey12 the survey provides data about communities in the united states on a 1year or 3year cycle depending on the size of the community rather than once every 10 years a small percentage of the population on a rotating basis will receive the survey each year and no household will receive it more than once every five years13 in june 2009 the us census bureau announced that it would count samesex married couples however the final form did not contain a separate samesex married couple option when noting the relationship between household members samesex couples who are married could mark their spouses as being husband or wife the same response given by oppositesex married couples an unmarried partner option was available for couples whether samesex or oppositesex who were not married14 costedit the 2010 census cost 13 billion approximately 42 per capita by comparison the 2010 census percapita cost for china was about us1 and for india was us04015 operational costs were 54 billion significantly under the 7 billion budget16 in december 2010 the government accountability office gao noted that the cost of conducting the census has approximately doubled each decade since 197015 in a detailed 2004 report to congress the gao called on the census bureau to address cost and design issues and at that time had estimated the 2010 census cost to be 11 billion17 in august 2010 commerce secretary gary locke announced that the census operational costs came in significantly under budget of an almost 7 billion operational budget16 650 million was saved in the budget for the doortodoor questioning nrfu phase because 72 of households returned mailed questionnaires 150 million was saved because of lowerthanplanned costs in areas including alaska and tribal lands and the 800 million emergency fund was not needed locke credited the management practices of census bureau director robert groves citing in particular the decision to buy additional advertising in locations where responses lagged which improved the overall response rate the agency also has begun to rely more on questioning neighbors or other reliable third parties when a person could not be immediately reached at home which reduced the cost of followup visits census data for about 22 of us households that did not reply by mail were based on such outside interviews groves said16 technologyedit in 2005 lockheed martin won a sixyear 500 million contract to capture and standardize data for the census the contract included systems facilities and staffing18 the final value of that contract was in excess of one billion dollars 19 information technology was about a quarter of the projected 113 billion cost of the decennial census20 the use of highspeed document scanning technology such as imagetrac scanners developed by ibml helped lockheed martin complete the project on schedule and under budget21 this was the first census to use handheld computing devices with gps capability although they were only used for the address canvassing operation enumerators information gatherers that had operational problems with the device understandably made negative reports during the 2009 senate confirmation hearings for robert groves president obamas census director appointee there was much mention of contracting problems but very little criticism of the units themselves22 in rural areas there was a problem with transmission of data to and from the hhc since the units were updated nightly with important changes and reprogramming operator implementation of proper procedure was imperative dramatic dysfunction and delays were caused if the units were not put into sleep mode overnight the census bureau chose to conduct the primary operation nonresponse follow up nrfu without using the handheld computing devices2324 marketing and undercountsedit due to allegations surrounding previous censuses that poor people and nonwhites are routinely undercounted for the 2010 census the census bureau tried to avoid that bias by enlisting tens of thousands of intermediaries such as churches charities and firms to explain to people the importance of being counted8 in april 2009 the census bureau announced that it intended to work with community organizations in an effort to count all illegal immigrants in the united states for the census25 the association of community organizations for reform now acorn was given a contract to help publicize the importance of the census count and to encourage individuals to fill out their forms in september 2009 after controversial undercover videos showing four acorn staffers giving tax advice to a man and a woman posing as a prostitute the bureau canceled acorns contract26 various american celebrities including demi lovato and eva longoria27 were used in public service announcements targeting younger people to fill out census forms wilmer valderrama and rosario dawson have helped spread census awareness among young hispanics a historically low participating ethnicity in the us census28 rapper ludacris also participated in efforts to spread awareness of the 2010 census29 the census bureau hired about 635000 people to find those us residents who had not returned their forms by mail as of may 28 2010 113 census workers had been victims of crime while conducting the census3needs update as of june 29 there were 436 incidents involving assaults or threats against enumerators more than double the 181 incidents in 2000 one enumerator attempting to handdeliver the census forms to a hawaii county police officer was arrested for trespassing – the officers fellow policemen made the arrest2 some political conservatives and libertarians questioned the validity of the questions and even encouraged people to refuse to answer questions for privacy and constitutional reasons30 michele bachmann a conservative republican representative from minnesota stated that she would not fill out her census form other than to indicate the number of people living in her household because the constitution doesnt require any information beyond that31 former republican representative and libertarian presidential candidate bob barr stated that the census has become too intrusive going beyond the mere enumeration ie count intended by the framers of the us constitution32 according to political commentator juan williams census participation rates have been declining since 1970 and if conservatives dont participate doubts about its accuracy and credibility may become fatal30 as a result the census bureau undertook an unprecedented advertising campaign targeted at encouraging white political conservatives to fill out their forms in the hope of avoiding an undercount of this group the 2010 us census was the primary sponsor at nascar races in atlanta bristol and martinsville and sponsored the no 16 ford fusion driven by greg biffle for part of the season because of a marketing survey that indicated most nascar fans lean politically conservative30 it also ran an advertisement during the 2010 super bowl and hired singer marie osmond who is thought to have many conservative fans to publicize the census30 reapportionmentedit the 435 seats of the house grouped by state as apportioned after the 2010 census the results of the 2010 census determined the number of seats that each state receives in the united states house of representatives starting with the 2012 elections consequently this affected the number of votes each state has in the electoral college for the 2012 presidential election because of population changes eighteen states had changes in their number of seats eight states gained at least one seat and ten states lost at least one seat the final result involved 12 seats being switched33 gained four seats gained two seats gained one seat lost one seat lost two seats texas florida arizona georgia nevada south carolina utah washington illinois iowa louisiana massachusetts michigan missouri new jersey pennsylvania new york ohio map of 2010 reapportionment controversiesedit some objected to the counting of persons who are in the united states illegally3435 republican senators david vitter and bob bennett tried unsuccessfully to add questions on immigration status to the census form8 organizations such as the prison policy initiative argued that the census counts of incarcerated men and women as residents of prisons rather than of their preincarceration addresses skewed political clout and resulted in misleading demographic and population data36 the term negro was used in the questionnaire as one of the options for african americans question 9 what is person numbers race black african am or negro as a choice to describe ones race census bureau spokesman jack martin explained that many older africanamericans identified themselves that way and many still do those who identify themselves as negroes need to be included3738 the word was also used in the 2000 census with over 56000 people identifying themselves as negro39 the 2010 census contained ten questions about age gender ethnicity home ownership and household relationships six of the ten questions were to be answered for each individual in the household federal law has provisions for fining those who refuse to complete the census form40 detroit mayor dave bing held a press conference on march 22 2011 to announce that the city would challenge its census results41 the challenge being led by the citys planning department cited an inconsistency as an example showing a downtown census tract which lost only 60 housing units but 1400 people implying that a downtown jail or dormitory was missed in canvassing42 new york city mayor michael bloomberg held a conference on march 27 2011 to announce that the city would also challenge his citys census results specifically the apparent undercounting in the boroughs of queens and brooklyn43 bloomberg said that the numbers for queens and brooklyn the two most populous boroughs are implausible44 according to the census they grew by only 01 and 16 respectively while the other boroughs grew by between 3 and 5 he also stated that the census showed improbably high numbers of vacant housing in vital neighborhoods such as jackson heights queens the district of columbia announced in august 2011 that it would also challenge its census results the mayors office claimed that the detailed information provided for 549 census blocks is nonsensical listing examples of census data that show housing units located in the middle of a street that does not actually exist however officials do not believe the citys total population will drastically change as a result of the challenge45 clemons v department of commerceedit main article clemons v department of commerce a 2009 lawsuit clemons v department of commerce see also controversy and history of united states congressional apportionment sought a court order for congress to reapportion the house of representatives with a greater number of members following the census to rectify under and overrepresentation of some states under the socalled 435 rule established by the apportionment act of 1911 which limits the number of us representatives to that number meaning that some states are slightly underrepresented proportionate to their true population and that others are slightly overrepresented by the same standardclarification needed had this occurred it would have also affected electoral college apportionment for the 2012–2020 presidential elections46 after the court order was not granted the plaintiffs appealed the case to the united states supreme court and on december 13 2010 the supreme court vacated and remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction47 state rankingsedit see also list of us states and territories by
