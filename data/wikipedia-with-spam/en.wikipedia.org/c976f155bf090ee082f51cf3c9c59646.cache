pharmacy of caleb bradham with a pepsi dispenser the drink pepsi was first introduced as brads drink2 in new bern north carolina united states in 1893 by caleb bradham who made it at his drugstore where the drink was sold it was renamed pepsi cola in 1898 after the root of the word dyspepsia and the kola nuts used in the recipe the original recipe also included sugar and vanilla3 bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid in digestion and boost energy2 1919 newspaper ad for pepsicola a plaque at 256 middle street new bern nc in 1903 bradham moved the bottling of pepsicola from his drugstore to a rented warehouse that year bradham sold 7968 gallons of syrup the next year pepsi was sold in sixounce bottles and sales increased to 19848 gallons in 1909 automobile race pioneer barney oldfield was the first celebrity to endorse pepsicola describing it as a bully drinkrefreshing invigorating a fine bracer before a race the advertising theme delicious and healthful was then used over the next two decades4 in 1926 pepsi received its first logo redesign since the original design of 1905 in 1929 the logo was changed again in 1931 at the depth of the great depression the pepsicola company entered bankruptcy—in large part due to financial losses incurred by speculating on the wildly fluctuating sugar prices as a result of world war i assets were sold and roy c megargel bought the pepsi trademark3 megargel was unsuccessful and soon pepsis assets were purchased by charles guth the president of loft inc loft was a candy manufacturer with retail stores that contained soda fountains he sought to replace cocacola at his stores fountains after coke refused to give him a discount on syrup guth then had lofts chemists reformulate the pepsicola syrup formula on three separate occasions between 1922 and 1933 the cocacola company was offered the opportunity to purchase the pepsicola company and it declined on each occasion5 pepsicola trademark

was used again and replacing the current wordmark on many cans rise during the great depression pepsi gained popularity following the introduction in 1936 of a 12ounce bottle with a radio advertising campaign featuring the jingle pepsicola hits the spot twelve full ounces thats a lot twice as much for a nickel too pepsicola is the drink for you arranged in such a way that the jingle never ends pepsi encouraged pricewatching consumers to switch obliquely referring to the cocacola standard of 65 ounces per bottle for the price of five cents a nickel instead of the 12 ounces pepsi sold at the same price6 coming at a time of economic crisis the campaign succeeded in boosting pepsis status from 1936 to 1938 pepsicolas profits doubled7 pepsi pepsis success under guth came while the loft candy business was faltering since he had initially used lofts finances and facilities to establish the new pepsi success the nearbankrupt loft company sued guth for possession of the pepsicola company a long legal battle guth v loft then ensued with the case reaching the delaware supreme court and ultimately ending in a loss for guth niche marketing 1940s advertisement specifically targeting african americans a young ron brown is the boy reaching for a bottle walter mack was named the new president of pepsicola and guided the company through the 1940s mack who supported progressive causes noticed that the companys strategy of using advertising for a general audience either ignored african americans or used ethnic stereotypes in portraying blacks up until the 1940s the full revenue potential of what was called the negro market was largely ignored by whiteowned manufacturers in the us8 mack realized african americans were an untapped niche market and that pepsi stood to gain market share by targeting its advertising directly towards them9 to this end he hired hennan smith an advertising executive from the negro newspaper field10 to lead an allblack sales team which had to be cut due to the onset of world war ii in 1947 walter mack resumed his efforts hiring edward f boyd to lead a twelveman team they came up with advertising portraying black americans in a positive light such as one with a smiling mother holding a six pack of pepsi while her son a young ron brown who grew up to be secretary of commerce11 reaches up for one another ad campaign titled leaders in their fields profiled twenty prominent african americans such as nobel peace prize winner ralph bunche and photographer gordon parks boyd also led a sales team composed entirely of blacks around the country to promote pepsi racial segregation and jim crow laws were still in place throughout much of the us boyds team faced a great deal of discrimination as a result10 from insults by pepsi coworkers to threats by the ku klux klan11 on the other hand it was able to use racism as a selling point attacking cokes reluctance to hire blacks and support by the chairman of coke for segregationist governor of georgia herman talmadge9 as a result pepsis market share as compared to cokes shot up dramatically in the 1950s with african american softdrink consumers three times more likely to purchase pepsi over coke12 after the sales team visited chicago pepsis share in the city overtook that of coke for the first time9 journalist stephanie capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s the team members had a grueling schedule working seven days a week morning and night for weeks on end they visited bottlers churches ladies groups schools college campuses ymcas community centers insurance conventions teacher and doctor conferences and various civic organizations they got famous jazzmen such as duke ellington and lionel hampton to give shoutouts for pepsi from the stage no group was too small or too large to target for a promotion13 pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted onedimensional aunt jemimas and uncle bens whose role was to draw a smile from white customers instead it portrayed black customers as selfconfident middleclass citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks they were economical too as pepsi bottles were twice the size14 this focus on the market for black people caused some consternation within the company and among its affiliates it did not want to seem focused on black customers for fear white customers would be pushed away9 in a national meeting mack tried to assuage the 500 bottlers in attendance by pandering to them saying we dont want it to become known as a nigger drink15 after mack left the company in 1950 support for the black sales team faded and it was cut8 pepsi perfect pepsi perfect is a vitaminenriched soft drink used in back to the future part ii when marty orders it in the cafe 80s to commemorate the trilogys 30th anniversary pepsico decided to release a limitededition run of 6500 with each costing 2015 which spells 2015 releasing it on

pepsi max the font used in this logo is almost identical to the font used for diet pepsi from 1975 to 1986 it is also worth noting that the e in pepsi is shaped liked previous forms of the pepsi globe from the 1930s through the late 1950s pepsicola hits the spot was the most commonly used slogan in the days of old radio classic motion pictures and later television its jingle conceived in the days when pepsi cost only five cents was used in many different forms with different lyrics with the rise of radio pepsi utilized the services of a young upandcoming actress named polly bergen to promote products oftentimes lending her singing talents to the classic hits the spot jingle film actress joan crawford after marrying pepsicola president alfred n steele became a spokesperson for pepsi appearing in commercials television specials and televised beauty pageants on behalf of the company crawford also had images of the soft drink placed prominently in several of her later films when steele died in 1959 crawford was appointed to the board of directors of pepsicola a position she held until 1973 although she was not a board member of the larger pepsico created in 196519 the buffalo bisons an american hockey league team were sponsored by pepsicola in its later years the team adopted the beverages red white and blue color scheme along with a modification of the pepsi logo with the word buffalo in place of the pepsicola wordmark the bisons ceased operations in 1970 making way for the buffalo sabres through the intervening decades there have been many different pepsi theme songs sung on television by a variety of artists from joanie summers to the jacksons to britney spears see slogans in 1975 pepsi introduced the pepsi challenge marketing campaign where pepsico set up a blind tasting between pepsicola and rival cocacola during these blind taste tests the majority of participants picked pepsi as the better tasting of the two soft drinks pepsico took great advantage of the campaign with television commercials reporting the results to the public20 pepsi has been featured in several films including back to the future part ii 1989 home alone 1990 waynes world 1992 fight club 1999 and world war z 20132122 in 1996 pepsico launched the highly successful pepsi stuff marketing strategy by 2002 the strategy was cited by promo magazine as one of 16 ageless wonders that helped redefine promotion marketing23 in 2007 pepsico redesigned its cans for the fourteenth time and for the first time included more than thirty different backgrounds on each can introducing a new background every three weeks24 one of its background designs includes a string of repetitive numbers 73774 this is a numerical expression from a telephone keypad of the word pepsi in late 2008 pepsi overhauled its entire brand simultaneously introducing a new logo and a minimalist label design the redesign was comparable to cocacolas earlier simplification of its can and bottle designs

a skinny can that is taller and has been described as a sassier version of the traditional can that pepsi says was made in celebration of beautiful confident women the companys equating of skinny and

her wig removing her necklace and leaving her photoshoot to join the protest going on the protest ends when kendall jenner hands a police officer a pepsi soda can reuniting everyone this commercial created a huge public controversy due to the concern that viewers were receiving the message that marching in a protest such as the demonstrations around that time against the presidency of donald trump is less effective than someone handing a police officer a pepsi rivalry with cocacola main article cola wars according to consumer reports in the 1970s the rivalry continued to heat up the market pepsi conducted blind taste tests in stores in what was called the pepsi challenge these tests suggested that more consumers preferred the taste of pepsi which is believed to have more lemon oil and less orange oil and uses vanillin rather than vanilla to coke the sales of pepsi started to climb and pepsi kicked off the challenge across the nation this became known as the cola wars in 1985 the cocacola company amid much publicity changed its formula the theory has been advanced that new coke as the reformulated drink came to be known was invented specifically in response to the pepsi challenge however a consumer backlash led to cocacola quickly reintroducing the original formula as not coke previous to 1985 but to cocacola classic according to beverage digests 2008 report on carbonated soft drinks pepsicos us market share is 308 percent while the cocacola companys is 427 percent37 cocacola outsells pepsi in most parts of the us notable exceptions being central appalachia north dakota and utah in the city of buffalo new york pepsi outsells cocacola by a twotoone margin38 overall cocacola continues to outsell pepsi in almost all areas of the world however exceptions include oman india saudi arabia pakistan pepsi has been a dominant sponsor of the pakistan cricket team since the 1990s the dominican republic guatemala the canadian provinces of quebec newfoundland and labrador nova scotia and prince edward island and northern ontario39 pepsi had long been the drink of frenchcanadians and it continues to hold its dominance by relying on local québécois celebrities especially claude meunier of la petite vie fame to sell its product40 pepsico introduced the quebec slogan here its pepsi ici cest pepsi in response to cocacola ads proclaiming around the world its coke partout dans le monde cest coke as of 2012 pepsi is the third most popular carbonated drink in india with a 15 market share behind sprite and thums up in comparison cocacola is the fourth most popular carbonated drink occupying a mere 88 of the indian market share41 by most accounts cocacola was indias leading soft drink until 1977 when it left india because of the new foreign exchange laws which mandated majority shareholding in companies to be held by indian shareholders the cocacola company was unwilling to dilute its stake in its indian unit as required by the foreign exchange regulation act fera thus sharing its formula with an entity in which it did not have majority shareholding in 1988 pepsico gained entry to india by creating a joint venture with the punjab governmentowned punjab agro industrial corporation paic and voltas india limited this joint venture marketed and sold lehar pepsi until 1991 when the use of foreign brands was allowed pepsico bought out its partners and ended the joint venture in 1994 in 1993 the cocacola company returned in pursuance of indias liberalization policy42 pepsi bottles in ussr period style in supermarket in kyiv in russia pepsi initially had a larger market share than coke but it was undercut once the cold war ended in 1972 pepsico struck a barter agreement with the then government of the soviet union in which pepsico was granted exportation and western marketing rights to stolichnaya vodka in exchange for importation and soviet marketing of pepsicola4344 this exchange led to pepsicola being the first foreign product sanctioned for sale in the ussr45 reminiscent of the way that cocacola became a cultural icon and its global spread spawned words like coca colonization pepsicola and its relation to the soviet system turned it into an icon in the early 1990s the term pepsistroika began appearing as a pun on perestroika the reform policy of the soviet union under mikhail gorbachev critics viewed the policy as an attempt to usher in western products in deals there with the old elites pepsi as one of the first american products in the soviet union became a symbol of that relationship and the soviet policy46 this was reflected in russian author victor pelevins book generation p in 1989 billy joel mentioned the rivalry between the two companies in the song we didnt start the fire the line rock roller cola wars refers to pepsi and cokes usage of various musicians in advertising campaigns coke used paula abdul while pepsi used michael jackson both companies then competed to get other musicians to advertise its beverages in 1992 following the dissolution of the soviet union cocacola was introduced to the russian market as it came to be associated with the new system and pepsi to the old cocacola rapidly captured a significant market share that might otherwise have required years to achieve by july 2005 cocacola enjoyed a market share of 194 percent followed by pepsi with 13 percent47 pepsi did not sell soft drinks in israel until 1991 many israelis and some american jewish organizations attributed pepsis previous reluctance to do battle to the arab boycott pepsi which has a large and lucrative business in the arab world denied that saying that economic rather than political reasons kept it out of israel48 pepsiman pepsiman is an official pepsi mascot from pepsis japanese corporate branch the design of the pepsiman character is attributed to canadian comic book artist travis charest created sometime around the mid1990s pepsiman took on three different outfits each one representing the current style of the pepsi can in distribution twelve commercials were created featuring the character his role in the advertisements is to appear with pepsi to thirsty people or people craving soda pepsiman happens to appear at just the right time with the product after delivering the beverage sometimes pepsiman would encounter a difficult and actionoriented
