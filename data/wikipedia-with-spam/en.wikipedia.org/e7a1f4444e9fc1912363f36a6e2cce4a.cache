until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at erlitou henan in 195957 it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period58 the succeeding shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records59 the shang ruled the plain of the yellow river in eastern china from the 17th to the 11th century bce60

ie cart axles length and currency his dynasty also conquered the yue tribes in guangxi guangdong and vietnam65 the qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after the first emperors death as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion6667 following a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at xianyang was burnedo the han dynasty emerged to rule china between 206 bce and ce 220 creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the han chinese6667 the han expanded the empires territory considerably with military campaigns reaching central asia mongolia south korea and yunnan and the recovery of guangdong and northern vietnam from nanyue han involvement in central asia and sogdia helped establish the land

official abandonment of the qin philosophy of legalism in favor of confucianism qins legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the han government and its successors70 after the end of the han dynasty a period of strife known as three kingdoms followed71 whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the four classics of chinese literature at its end wei was swiftly overthrown by the jin dynasty the jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentallydisabled emperor the five barbarians then invaded and ruled northern china as the sixteen states the

khitan liao the song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade77 between the 10th and 11th centuries the population of china doubled in size to around 100 million people mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern china and the production of abundant food surpluses the song dynasty also saw a revival of confucianism in response to the growth of buddhism during the tang78 and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity7980 however the military weakness of the song army was observed by the
