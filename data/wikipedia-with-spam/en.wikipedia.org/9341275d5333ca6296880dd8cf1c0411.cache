balloting 4 bomb discoveries 5 see also 6 references 7 further reading 8 external links the raceedit in the months leading up to the opening of the 1940 republican national convention the three leading candidates for the gop nomination were considered to be senators robert a taft of ohio and arthur vandenberg of michigan and district attorney thomas e dewey of new york taft was the leader of the gops conservative noninterventionist wing and his main strength was in his native midwest and parts of the south vandenberg the senior republican in the senate was the favorite son candidate of the michigan delegation and was considered a possible compromise candidate dewey the district attorney for manhattan had risen to national fame as the gangbuster prosecutor who had sent numerous infamous mafia figures to prison most notably lucky luciano the organizedcrime boss of new york city all three men had campaigned vigorously during the primary season but only 300 of the 1000 convention delegates had been pledged to a candidate by the time the convention opened moreover each of these candidates had weaknesses that could be exploited tafts outspoken noninterventionism and opposition to any american involvement in the european war convinced many republican leaders that he could not win a general election particularly as the french third republic fell to nazi germany in may 1940 and germany threatened the united kingdom deweys relative youth he was only 38 in 1940 and lack of any foreignpolicy experience caused his candidacy to weaken as the nazi military emerged as a fearsome threat in 1940 vandenberg was also a noninterventionist he changed his foreignpolicy stance during world war ii and his lackadaisical lethargic campaign never caught the voters attention this left an opening for a dark horse candidate to emerge willkie emerges as a dark horseedit wilkie received news of his nomination at a notification ceremony held in his hometown of elwood indiana a wall streetbased industrialist named wendell willkie who had never before run for public office emerged as the unlikely nominee willkie a former democrat who had been a proroosevelt delegate at the 1932 democratic national convention was considered an improbable choice willkie had first come to public attention as an articulate critic of roosevelts attempt to break up electrical power monopolies willkie was the ceo of the commonwealth and southern power company and he opposed the federal governments attempts to compete with private enterprise claiming that the government had unfair advantages over private companies willkie did not dismiss all roosevelts social welfare programs and in fact supported those he believed free enterprise could not do better furthermore unlike the leading republican candidates willkie was a forceful and outspoken advocate of aid to the allies especially the united kingdom his support of giving all aid to the british short of declaring war won him the support of many republicans on the east coast of the united states who disagreed with their partys isolationist leaders in congress willkies persuasive arguments impressed these republicans who believed that he would be an attractive presidential candidate many of the leading press barons of the era such as ogden reid of the new york herald tribune roy howard of the scrippshoward newspaper chain and john and gardner cowles publishers of the minneapolis star and the minneapolis tribune as well as the des moines register and look magazine supported willkie in their newspapers and magazines even so willkie remained a longshot candidate the may 8 gallup poll showed dewey at 67 support among republicans followed by vandenberg and taft with willkie at only 3 the nazi armys rapid blitzkrieg into france in may 1940 shook american public opinion even as taft was telling a kansas audience that america must concentrate on domestic issues to prevent roosevelt from using the international crisis to extend socialism at home both dewey and vandenberg also continued to oppose any aid to the united kingdom that might lead to war with germany nevertheless sympathy for the embattled british was mounting daily and this aided willkies candidacy by midjune little over one week before the republican convention opened the gallup poll reported that willkie had moved into second place with 17 and that dewey was slipping fueled by his favorable media attention willkies probritish statements won over many of the delegates as the delegates were arriving in philadelphia gallup reported that willkie had surged to 29 dewey had slipped 5 more points to 47 and taft vandenberg and former president herbert hoover trailed at 8 8 and 6 respectively hundreds of thousands perhaps as many as one million telegrams urging support for willkie poured in many from willkie clubs that had sprung up across the country millions more signed petitions circulating everywhere ballotingedit at the 1940 republican national convention itself keynote speaker harold stassen the governor of minnesota announced his support for willkie and became his official floor manager hundreds of vocal willkie supporters packed the upper galleries of the convention hall willkies amateur status his fresh face appealed to delegates as well as voters the delegations were selected not by primaries but by party leaders in each state and they had a keen sense of the fastchanging pulse of public opinion gallup found the same thing in polling data not reported until after the convention willkie had moved ahead among republican voters by 44 to only 29 for the collapsing dewey as the prowillkie galleries repeatedly yelled we want willkie the delegates on the convention floor began their vote dewey led on the first ballot but steadily lost strength thereafter both taft and willkie gained in strength on each ballot and by the fourth ballot it was obvious that either willkie or taft would be the nominee the key moments came when the delegations of large states such as michigan pennsylvania and new york left dewey and vandenberg and switched to willkie giving him the victory on the sixth ballot the voting went like this presidential balloting rnc 19401 ballot 1 2 3 4 5 6 before shifts 6 after shifts wendell l willkie 105 105 171 171 259 259 306 306 429 429 655 655

and willkie picked up votes on the fourth ballot willkie was ahead but short of the 501 votes needed for nomination on the sixth roll call — 1 am friday — willkie finally went over the top2 willkies nomination is still considered by most historians to have been one of the most dramatic moments in any political convention willkie also made history too by his personal appearance at the 1940 convention willkie breaks party tradition by personal appearance like roosevelts in 32 the new york times headline told its readers crowd goes wild greeting nominee and cheers mark his every word in the new york times headlines convey something of the conventions mood in 1940 with willkies appearance as your nominee willkie told the convention in his brief appearance i expect to conduct a crusading vigorous fighting campaign having given little thought to whom he would select as his vicepresidential nominee willkie left the decision to convention chairman and massachusetts congressman joe martin the house minority leader who suggested senate minority leader charles l mcnary of oregon despite the fact that mcnary had spearheaded a stop willkie campaign late in the balloting the candidate picked him for his running mate vice presidential vote charles l mcnary 848 dewey short 108 styles bridges 2 the 1940 republican convention was the first convention carried on live
