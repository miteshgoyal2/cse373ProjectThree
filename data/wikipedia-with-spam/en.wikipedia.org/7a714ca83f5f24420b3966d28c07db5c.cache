quality of cbs programming during the tenure of william s paley2 it can also refer to some of cbss first demonstrations of color television which were held in a former tiffany co building in new york city in 19503 the network has its origins in united independent broadcasters inc a collection of 16 radio stations that was purchased by paley in 1928 and renamed the columbia broadcasting system4 under paleys guidance cbs would first become one of the largest radio networks in the united states and eventually one of the big three american broadcast television networks in 1974 cbs dropped its former full name and became known simply as cbs inc the westinghouse electric corporation acquired the network in 1995 renamed its corporate entity to the current cbs broadcasting inc in 1997 and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become cbs corporation in 2000 cbs came under the control of viacom which was formed as a spinoff of cbs in 1971 in late 2005 viacom split itself into two separate companies and reestablished cbs corporation – through the spinoff of its broadcast television radio and select cable television and nonbroadcasting assets – with the cbs

by new york city talentagent arthur judson the fledgling network soon needed additional investors though and the columbia phonograph company manufacturers of columbia records rescued it in april 1927 as a result the network was renamed the columbia phonographic broadcasting system on september 18 of that year columbia phonographic went on the air on september 18 1927 with a presentation by the howard barlow orchestra5 from flagship station wor in newark new jersey and fifteen affiliates6 operational costs were steep particularly the payments to att for use of its land lines and by the end of 1927 columbia phonograph wanted out7 in early 1928 judson sold the network to brothers isaac and leon levy owners of the networks philadelphia affiliate wcau and their partner jerome louchenheim none of the three were interested in assuming daytoday management of the network so they installed wealthy 26yearold william s paley son of a philadelphia cigar family and inlaw of the levys as president with the record company out of the picture paley quickly streamlined the corporate name to columbia broadcasting system7 he believed in the power of radio advertising since his familys la palina cigars had doubled their sales after young william convinced his elders to advertise on radio8 by september 1928 paley bought out the louchenheim share of cbs and became its majority owner with 51 of the business9 turnaround paleys first yearedit during louchenheims brief regime columbia paid 410000 to ah grebes atlantic broadcasting company for a small brooklyn station wabc no relation to the current wabc which would become the networks flagship station wabc was quickly upgraded and the signal relocated to 860 khz10 the physical plant was relocated also – to steinway hall on west 57th street in manhattan where much of cbss programming would originate by the turn of 1929 the network could boast to sponsors of having 47 affiliates11 paley moved right away to put his network on a firmer financial footing in the fall of 1928 he entered into talks with adolph zukor of paramount pictures who planned to move into radio in response to rcas forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies12 the deal came to fruition in september 1929 paramount acquired 49 of cbs in return for a block of its stock worth 38 million at the time8 the agreement specified that paramount would buy that same stock back by march 1 1932 for a flat 5 million provided cbs had earned 2 million during 1931 and 193212 for a brief time there was talk that the network might be renamed paramount radio but it only lasted a month – the 1929 stock market crash sent all stock value tumbling it galvanized paley and his troops who had no alternative but to turn the network around and earn the 2000000 in two years this is the atmosphere in which the cbs of today was born12 the nearbankrupt movie studio sold its cbs shares back to cbs in 193213 in the first year of paleys watch cbss gross earnings more than tripled going from 14 million to 47 million14 paleys management saw a twentyfold increase in gross income in his first decade much of the increase was a result of paleys second upgrade to the cbs business plan – improved affiliate relations there were two types of program at the time sponsored and sustaining ie unsponsored rival nbc paid affiliates for every sponsored show they carried and charged them for every sustaining show they ran15 it was onerous for small and medium stations and resulted in both unhappy affiliates and limited carriage of sustaining programs paley had a different idea designed to get cbs programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible16 he would give the sustaining programs away for free provided the station would run every sponsored show and accept cbss check for doing so17 cbs soon had more affiliates than either nbc red or nbc blue18 paley was a man who valued style and taste19 and in 1929 once he had his affiliates happy and his companys creditworthiness on the mend he relocated his concern to sleek new 485 madison avenue the heart of the advertising community right where paley wanted his company to be20 and where it would stay until its move to its own eero saarinendesigned headquarters the cbs building in 1965 when his new landlords expressed skepticism about the network and its flybynight reputation paley overcame their qualms by inking a lease for 15 million20 cbs takes on the red and the blue 1930sedit wholesome kate smith paleys choice for la palina hour was unthreatening to home and hearth since nbc was the broadcast arm of radio set manufacturer rca its chief david sarnoff approached his decisions as both a broadcaster and as a hardware executive nbcs affiliates had the latest rca equipment and were often the bestestablished stations or were on clear channel frequencies yet sarnoffs affiliates were mistrustful of him paley had no such split loyalties his – and his affiliates – success rose and fell with the quality of cbs programming16 paley had an innate pitchperfect sense of entertainment a gift of the gods an ear totally pure21 wrote david halberstam he knew what was good and would sell what was bad and would sell and what was good and would not sell and he never confused one with another22 as the 1930s loomed paley set about building the cbs talent stable the network became the home of many popular musical and comedy stars among them jack benny your canada dry humorist al jolson george burns gracie allen and kate smith whom paley personally selected for his familys la palina hour because she was not the type of woman to provoke jealousy in american wives23 when on a midocean voyage paley heard a phonograph record of a young unknown crooner he rushed to the ships radio room and cabled new york to sign bing crosby immediately to a contract for a daily radio show24 while the cbs primetime lineup featured music comedy and variety shows the daytime schedule was a direct conduit into american homes – and into the hearts and minds of american women for many it was the bulk of their adult human contact during the course of the day cbs time salesmen recognized early on that this intimate connection could be a bonanza for advertisers of femaleinterest products25 starting in 1930 astrologer evangeline adams would consult the heavens on behalf of listeners who sent in their birthdays a description of their problems – and a boxtop from sponsor forhans toothpaste26 the lowkey murmuring of smoothvoiced tony wons backed by a tender violin made him a soul mate to millions of women27 on behalf of the r j reynolds tobacco company whose cellophanewrapped camel cigarettes were as fresh as the dew that dawn spills on a field of clover28 the most popular radiofriend of all was m sayle taylor the voice of experience though his name was never uttered on air28 women mailed descriptions of the most intimate of relationship problems to the voice in the tens of thousands per week sponsors musterole ointment and haleys m–o laxative enjoyed sales increases of several hundred percent in just the first month of the voice of experiences run29 when charlie chaplin finally allowed the world to hear his voice after 20 years of mime he chose cbss airwaves to do it on as the decade progressed a new genre joined the daytime lineup serial dramas – soap operas so named for the products that sponsored them by way of the ad agencies that actually produced them although the form usually in quarterhour episodes proliferated widely in the mid and late 1930s they all had the same basic premise that characters fell into two categories 1 those in trouble and 2 those who helped people in trouble the helpinghand figures were usually older30 at cbs just plain bill brought human insight and anacin pain reliever into households your family and mine came courtesy of sealtest dairy products bachelors children first hawked old dutch cleanser then wonder bread aunt jennys real life stories was sponsored by spry vegetable shortening our gal sunday anacin again the romance of helen trent angélus cosmetics big sister rinso laundry soap and many others filled the daytime ether31 cbs west coast headquarters reflected its industry stature while hosting its top hollywood talent thanks to its daytime and primetime schedules cbs prospered in the 1930s in 1935 gross sales were 193 million yielding a profit of 227 million32 by 1937 the network took in 287 million and had 114 affiliates16 almost all of which cleared 100 of networkfed programming thus keeping ratings and revenue high in 1938 cbs even acquired the american record corporation parent of its onetime investor columbia records33 in 1938 nbc and cbs each opened studios in hollywood to attract the entertainment industrys top talent to their networks – nbc at radio city on sunset boulevard and vine street cbs two blocks away at columbia square34 cbs launches an independent news divisionedit the extraordinary potential of radio news showed itself in 1930 when cbs suddenly found itself with a live telephone connection to a prisoner called the deacon who described from the inside and in real time a riot and conflagration at the ohio penitentiary for cbs it was a shocking journalistic coup35 yet as late as 1934 there was still no regularly scheduled newscast on network radio most sponsors did not want network news programming those that did were inclined to expect veto rights over it36 there had been a longstanding wariness between radio and the newspapers as well the papers had rightly concluded that the upstart radio business would compete with them on two counts – advertising dollars and news coverage by 1933 they fought back many no longer publishing radio schedules for readers convenience or allowing their news to be read on the air for radios profit37 radio in turn pushed back when urban department stores newspapers largest advertisers and themselves owners of many radio stations threatened to withhold their ads from print38 a shortlived attempted truce in 1933 even saw the papers proposing that radio be forbidden from running news before 930 am and then only after 900 pm – and that no news story could air until it was 12 hours old39 cbs news engineers prepare a remote justice hugo blacks 1937 denial of klan ties it was in this climate that paley set out to enhance the prestige of cbs to make it seem in the public mind the more advanced dignified and socially aware network40 he did it through sustaining programming like the new york philharmonic the thoughtful drama of norman corwin – and an inhouse news division to gather and present news free of fickle suppliers like newspapers and wire services40 in the fall of 1934 cbs launched an independent news division shaped in its first years by paleys vicepresident former new york times columnist ed klauber and news director paul white since there was no blueprint or precedent for realtime news coverage early efforts of the new division used the shortwave linkup cbs had been using for five years41 to bring live feeds of european events to its american air a key early hire was edward r murrow in 1935 his first corporate title was director of talks he was mentored in microphone technique by robert trout the lone fulltime member of the news division and quickly found himself in a growing rivalry with boss white42 murrow was glad to leave the hothouse atmosphere of the new york office behind43 when he was dispatched to london as cbss european director in 1937 a time when the growing hitler menace underscored the need for a robust european bureau halberstam described murrow in london as the right man in the right place in the right era44 murrow began assembling the staff of broadcast journalists – including william l shirer charles collingwood bill downs and eric sevareid – who would become known as the murrow boys they were in murrows own image sartorially impeccable literate often liberal and prima donnas all45 they covered history in the making and sometimes made it themselves on march 12 1938 hitler boldly annexed nearby austria and murrow and boys quickly assembled coverage with shirer in london edgar ansel mowrer in paris pierre huss in berlin frank gervasi in rome and trout in new york46 this bore the news roundup format which is still ubiquitous today in broadcast news murrows nightly reports from the rooftops during the dark days of the london blitz galvanized american listeners even before pearl harbor the conflict became the story of the survival of western civilization the most heroic of all possible wars and stories he was indeed reporting on the survival of the englishspeaking peoples47 with his manly tormented voice48 murrow contained and mastered the panic and danger he felt thereby communicating it all the more effectively to his audience48 using his trademark selfreference this reporter49 he did not so much report news as interpret it combining simplicity of expression with subtlety of nuance48 murrow himself said he tried to describe things in terms that make sense to the truck driver without insulting the intelligence of the professor48 when he returned home for a visit late in 1941 paley threw an extraordinarily elaborate reception50 for murrow at the waldorfastoria of course its goal was more than just honoring cbss latest star – it was an announcement to the world that mr paleys network was finally more than just a pipeline carrying other peoples programming it had now become a cultural force in its own right51 once the war was over and murrow returned for good it was as a superstar with prestige and freedom and respect within his profession and within his company52 he possessed enormous capital within that company and as the unknown form of television news loomed large he would spend it freely first in radio news then in television taking on senator joseph mccarthy first then eventually william s paley himself53 and with a foe that formidable even the vast murrow account would soon run dry panic the war of the worlds radio broadcastedit enfant terrible orson welless halloween joke frightened the country and snared a sponsor on october 30 1938 cbs gained a taste of infamy when the mercury theatre on the air broadcast a radio adaptation of h g wellss the war of the worlds performed by orson welles its unique format a contemporary version of the story in the form of faux news broadcasts had panicked many listeners into believing invaders from mars were actually invading and devastating grovers mill new jersey despite three disclaimers during the broadcast that it was a work of fiction the flood of publicity after the broadcast had two effects an fcc ban on faux news bulletins within dramatic programming and sponsorship for the mercury theatre on the air – the former sustaining program became the campbell playhouse to sell soup54 welles for his part summarized the episode as the mercury theaters own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying boo55 cbs recruits edmund a chesteredit before the the united states joined world war ii in 1940 cbs recruited edmund a chester from his position as bureau chief for latin america at the associated press to serve as director of latin american relations and director of short wave broadcasts for the cbs radio network in this capacity chester coordinated the development of the network of the americas la cadena de las americas with the department of state the office for interamerican affairs as chaired by nelson rockefeller and voice of america this network provided vital news and cultural programming throughout south america and central america during the crucial world war ii era and fostered diplomatic relations between the united states and the less developed nations of the continent it featured such popular radio broadcasts as viva américa56 which showcased leading musical talent from both north and south america including john serry sr as accompanied by the cbs pan american orchestra under the musical direction of alfredo antonini57 the postwar era also marked the beginning of cbss dominance in the field of radio as well58 zenith of network radio 1940sedit as 1939 wound down bill paley announced that 1940 would be the greatest year in the history of radio in the united states59 he turned out to be right by more than anyone could imagine the decade of the 1940s would indeed be the apogee of network radio by every gauge nearly 100 of the advertisers who made sponsorship deals in 1939 renewed their contracts for 1940 manufacturers of farm tractors made radios standard equipment on their machines60 wartime rationing of paper limited the size of newspapers – and effectively advertisements – and when papers turned them away they migrated to radio sponsorship61 a 1942 act by congress made advertising expenses a tax benefit61 and that sent even automobile and tire manufacturers – who had no products to sell since they had been converted to war production – scurrying to sponsor symphony orchestras and serious drama on radio62 in 1940 only onethird of radio programs were sponsored while twothirds were sustaining by the middle of the decade the statistics had swapped – two out of three shows now had cashpaying sponsors and only onethird were sustaining63 the cbs of the 1940s was vastly different from that of the early days many of the old guard veterans had died retired or simply left the network64 no change was greater than that in paley himself he had become difficult to work for and had gradually shifted from leader to despot64 he spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits his hope was that cbs could somehow learn to run itself64 his brief to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement for closets that would accommodate 300 suits 100 shirts and had special racks for a hundred neckties65 dr frank stanton second only to paley in his impact on cbs president 1946–1971 as paley grew more remote he installed a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power at cbs first ed klauber then paul kesten and finally frank stanton second only to paley as the author of cbss style and ambitions in its first halfcentury stanton was a magnificent mandarin who functioned as company superintendent spokesman and imagemaker66 he had come to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his phd thesis a critique of present methods and a new plan for studying radio listening behavior to cbs top brass and they responded with a job offer67 he scored an early hit with his study memory for advertising copy presented visually vs orally which cbs salesmen used to great effect bringing in new sponsors67 in 1946 paley appointed stanton as president of cbs and promoted himself to chairman stantons colorful but impeccable wardrobe – slateblue pinstripe suit ecru shirt robins egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron – made him in the mind of one sardonic cbs vicepresident the greatest argument we have for color television68 despite the influx of advertisers and their cash or perhaps because of them the 1940s were not without bumps for the radio networks the biggest challenge came in the form of the fccs chain broadcasting investigation – the monopoly probe as it was often called69 though it started in 1938 the investigation only gathered steam in 1940 under newbroom chairman james l fly70 by the time the smoke had cleared in 1943 nbc had already spun off its blue network which became the american broadcasting company abc cbs was also hit though not as severely paleys brilliant 1928 affiliate contract which had given cbs first claim on local stations air during sponsored time – the network option – came under attack as being restrictive to local programming71 the final compromise permitted the network option for three out of four hours during certain dayparts but the new regulations had virtually no practical effect since most all stations accepted the network feed especially the sponsored hours that earned them money71 flys panel also forbade networks from owning artists representation bureaus so cbs sold its bureau to music corporation of america and it became management corporation of america72 arthur godfrey spoke directly to listeners individually making him the foremost pitchman in his era on the air the war affected almost every show variety shows wove patriotism through their comedy and music segments dramas and soaps had characters join the service and go off to fight even before hostilities commenced in europe one of the most played songs on radio was irving berlins god bless america popularized by cbs personality kate smith73 although an office of censorship sprang up within days of pearl harbor censorship would be totally voluntary a few shows submitted scripts for review most did not74 the guidelines that the office did issue banned weather reports including announcement of sports rainouts news about troop ship or plane movements war production and live manonthestreet interviews the ban on adlibbing caused quizzes game shows and amateur hours to wither for the duration74 surprising was the granite permanence of the shows at the top of the ratings75 the vaudevillians and musicians who were hugely popular after the war were the same stars who had been huge in the 1930s jack benny bing crosby burns and allen and edgar bergen all had been on the radio almost as long as there had been network radio76 a notable exception to this was relative newcomer arthur godfrey who as late as 1942 was still doing a local morning show in washington dc77 godfrey who had been a cemeterylot salesman and a cab driver pioneered the style of talking directly to the listener as an individual with a singular you rather than phrases like now folks or yes friends78 his combined shows contributed as much as 12 of all cbs revenues by 1948 he was pulling down 500000 a year77 in 1947 paley still the undisputed head talent scout of cbs66 led a muchpublicized talent raid on nbc one day while freeman gosden and charles correll were hard at work at nbc writing their venerable amos and andy show a knock came on the door it was paley himself with an astonishing offer whatever you are getting now i will give you twice as much79 capturing nbcs cornerstone show was enough of a coup but paley repeated in 1948 with longtime nbc stars edgar bergen charlie mccarthy and red skelton as well as former cbs defectors jack benny radios toprated comedian and burns and allen paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent of his 1928 contract that caused some nbc radio affiliates to jump ship and join cbs79 cbs would buy the stars names as a property in exchange for a large lump sum and a salary80 the plan relied on the vastly different tax rates between income and capital gains so not only would the stars enjoy more than twice their income after taxes but cbs would preclude any nbc counterattack because cbs owned the performers names79 as a result of this paley got in 1949 something he had sought for 20 years cbs finally beat nbc in the ratings81 but it was not just to oneup rival sarnoff that paley led his talent raid he and all of radio had their eye on the coming force that threw a shadow over radio throughout the 1940s – television prime time radio gives way to television 1950sedit a 1951 advertisement for the cbs television network introduced the eye logo in the spring of 1940 cbs staff engineer peter goldmark devised a system for color television that cbs management hoped would leapfrog the network over nbc and its existing blackandwhite rca system8283 the cbs system gave brilliant and stable colors while nbcs was crude and unstable but compatible84 ultimately the fcc rejected the cbs system because it was incompatible with rcas that and the fact that cbs had moved to secure many uhf not vhf television licenses left cbs flatfooted in the early television age85 in 1946 only 6000 television sets were in operation most in greater new york city where there were already three stations by 1949 the number had increased to 3 million sets and by 1951 had risen to 12 million86 64 american cities had television stations though most of them only had one87 radio continued to be the backbone of the company at least in the early 1950s but it was a strange twilight period76 nbcs venerable fred allen saw his ratings plummet when he was pitted against upstart abcs game show stop the music within weeks he was dropped by longtime sponsor ford motor company and was shortly gone from the scene88 radio powerhouse bob hopes ratings plunged from a 238 share in 1949 to 54 in 195389 by 1952 death seemed imminent for network radio in its familiar form90 most telling of all the big sponsors were eager for the switch gradually as the television network took shape radio stars began to migrate to the new medium many programs ran on both media while making the transition the radio soap opera the guiding light moved to television in 1952 and ran another 57 years burns allen back home from nbc made the move in 1950 lucille ball a year later our miss brooks in 1952 though it continued simultaneously on radio for its full television life the highrated jack benny program ended its radio run in 1955 and edgar bergens sunday night show went off the air in 1957 when cbs announced in 1956 that its radio operations had lost money while the television network had made money91 it was clear where the future lay when the soap opera ma perkins went off the air on november 25 1960 only eight relatively minor series remained prime time radio ended on september 30 1962 when yours truly johnny dollar and suspense aired for the final time92 cbss radio programming after 1972edit the retirement of arthur godfrey in april 1972 marked the end of longform programming on cbs radio programming thereafter consisted of hourly news summaries and news features known in the 1970s as dimension and commentaries including the spectrum series that evolved into the pointcounterpoint feature on the television networks 60 minutes and first line report a news and analysis feature delivered by cbs correspondents the network also continued to offer traditional radio programming through its weeknightly cbs radio mystery theater the lone sustained holdout of dramatic programming from 1974 to 1982 though shorter runs were given to the general mills radio adventure theater and the sears radio theater in the 1970s otherwise most new dramatic radio was carried on public and to some extent religious stations93 the cbs radio network continues to this day offering hourly newscasts including its centerpiece cbs world news roundup in the morning and evening weekend sister program cbs news weekend roundup the newsrelated feature segment the osgood file whats in the news a oneminute summary of one story and various other segments such as commentary from seattle radio personality dave ross tip segments from various other sources and technology coverage from cbs interactive property cnet cbs is the last of the original big four radio networks to continue to be owned by its founding company although the cbs parent itself ceased to exist when it was acquired by westinghouse electric in 1995 cbs radio continues to be operated by cbs in contrast abc radio was sold to citadel broadcasting in 2007 and is now a part of cumulus media while mutual now defunct and nbc radio were acquired by westwood one in the 1980s westwood one and cbs were under common ownership from 1993 to 2007 the former would be acquired outright by dial global in october 2011 television years expansion and growthedit cbs headquarters in new york city cbss involvement in television dates back to the opening of experimental station w2xab in new york city on july 21 1931 using the mechanical television system that had been moreorless perfected in the late 1920s its initial broadcast featured new york mayor jimmy walker kate smith and george gershwin the station boasted the first regular sevenday broadcasting schedule in american television broadcasting 28 hours a week announcerdirector bill schudt was the stations only paid employee all other talent was volunteer w2xab pioneered program development including smallscale dramatic acts monologues pantomime and the use of projection slides to simulate sets engineer bill lodge devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television station in 1932 enabling w2xab to broadcast picture and sound on a single shortwave channel instead of the two previously needed on november 8 1932 w2xab broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns the station suspended operations on february 20 1933 as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an allelectronic system w2xab returned to the air with an allelectronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in grand central station and a transmitter atop the chrysler building broadcasting on channel 294 w2xab transmitted the first color broadcast in the united states on august 28 194095 on june 24 1941 w2xab received a commercial construction permit and program authorization as wcbw the station went on the air at 230 pm on july 1 one hour after rival wnbt channel 1 formerly w2xbs and now wnbc making it the second authorized fully commercial television station in the united states the fcc issued permits to cbs and nbc at the same time and intended wnbt and wcbw to sign on simultaneously on july 1 so no one station could claim to be the first during the world war ii years commercial television broadcasting was reduced dramatically toward the end of the war commercial television began to ramp up again with an increased level of programming evident from 1944 to 1947 on the three new york television stations which operated in those years the local stations of nbc cbs and dumont but as rca and dumont raced to establish networks and offer upgraded programming cbs lagged advocating an industrywide shift and restart to uhf for their incompatible with black and white color system the fcc putting an indefinite freeze on television licenses that lasted until 1952 also did not help matters only in 1950 when nbc was dominant in television and black and white transmission was widespread did cbs begin to buy or build their own stations outside of new york city in los angeles chicago and other major cities up to that point cbs programming was seen on such stations as kttv in los angeles which cbs – as a bit of insurance and to guarantee program clearance in that market – quickly purchased a 50 interest in that station partnering with the los angeles times newspaper cbs then sold its interest in kttv now the west coast flagship of the fox network and purchased outright los angeles pioneer station ktsl in 1950 renaming it knxt after cbss existing los angeles radio property knx later to become kcbstv in 1953 cbs bought pioneer television station wbkb in chicago which had been signed on by former investor paramount pictures and would become a sister company to cbs again decades later as a commercial station in 1946 and changed that stations call sign to wbbmtv moving the cbs affiliation away from wgntv wcbstv would ultimately be the only station as of 2013 built and signed on by cbs the rest of the stations would be acquired by cbs either in an ownership stake or outright purchase in televisions early years the network bought washington dc affiliate woic now wusa in a joint venture with the washington post in 1950 only to sell its stake to the post in 1954 due to thentighter fcc ownership regulations cbs would also temporarily return to relying on its own uhf technology by owning wxix in milwaukee now cw affiliate wvtv and whct in hartford connecticut now univision affiliate wuvn but as uhf was not viable for broadcasting at the time due to the fact that most television sets of the time were not equipped with uhf tuners cbs decided to sell those stations off and affiliate with vhf stations witi and wtictv now wfsb respectively ironically cbs would later be forced back onto uhf in milwaukee due to the affiliation agreement with new world communications that resulted in witi disaffiliating from the network in 1994 to join fox it is now affiliated with wdjttv in that market more longterm cbs bought stations in philadelphia wcau now owned by nbc and st louis kmoxtv now kmov but cbs would eventually sell these stations off as well before buying kmoxtv cbs had attempted to purchase and sign on the channel 11 license in st louis now kplrtv96 cbs did attempt to sign on a station in pittsburgh after the freeze was lifted as that city was then the sixthlargest market but only had one commercial vhf station in dumontowned wdtv while the rest were either on uhf the modernday wpghtv and winptv or public television wqed although the fcc turned down cbss request to buy the channel 9 license in nearby steubenville ohio and move it to pittsburgh that station initially cbs affiliate wstvtv is now nbc affiliate wtovtv cbs did score a major coup when pittsburghbased westinghouse electric a cofounder of nbc with rca bought wdtv from struggling dumont and opted to affiliate the nowrecalled kdkatv with cbs instead of nbc like kdka radio due to nbc extorting and coercing westinghouse to trade kyw radio and wptz now kywtv for cleveland stations wtam wtamfm now wmji and wnbk now wkyc the trade ended up being reversed in 1965 by order of the fcc and the united states department of justice after an eightyear investigation97 had cbs not been able to affiliate with kdkatv it would have affiliated with eventual nbc affiliate wiictv now wpxi once it signed on in 1957 instead98 this coup would eventually lead to a much stronger relationship between westinghouse and cbs decades later programming 1945–1970edit the talent raid on nbc of the mid1940s had brought over established radio stars who became stars of cbs television programs as well one reluctant cbs star refused to bring her radio show my favorite husband to television unless the network would recast the show with her reallife husband in the lead i love lucy debuted in october 1951 and was an immediate sensation with 11 million out of a population of 15 million television sets watching 73 share99 paley and network president frank stanton had so little faith in the future of lucille balls series that they granted her wish and allowed her husband desi arnaz to take financial control of the comedys production this was the making of the ballarnaz desilu empire and became the template for series production to this day it also served as the template for some television conventions that continue to exist including the use of a multiple cameras to film scenes the use of a studio audience and the airing of past episodes for syndication to other television outlets100 the phenomenal success of a primetime bigmoney quiz show the 64000 question propelled its creator louis g cowan first to an executive position as cbss vicepresident of creative services then to the presidency of the cbs tv network itself when the quiz show scandals involving rigged questions surfaced in 1959 cowan was fired by cbs as television came to the forefront of american entertainment and information cbs dominated television as it once had radiocitation needed in 1953 the cbs television network would make its first profit101 and would maintain dominance on television between 1955 and 1976 as well101 by the late 1950s the network often controlled seven or eight of the slots on the top ten ratings list with wellrespected shows like route 66 during the presidency of james t aubrey 1958–1965 cbs was able to balance prestigious television projects befitting the tiffany network image with more low culture broad appeal programs so the network had challenging fare like the twilight zone the defenders and east sidewest side as well as the andy griffith show the beverly hillbillies gomer pyle usmc and gilligans island102 this success would continue for many years with cbs being bumped from first place only due to the rise of abc in the mid1970s perhaps because of its status as the toprated network during the late 1960s and early 1970s cbs felt freer to gamble with controversial properties like the smothers brothers comedy hour and all in the family and its many spinoffs during this period programming rural purge and success in the 1970s and earlymid 1980s 1971–86edit main article rural purge by the end of the 1960s cbs was very successful in television ratings but many of its shows including the beverly hillbillies gunsmoke mayberry rfd petticoat junction hee haw and green acres were appealing more to older and more rural audiences and less to the young urban and more affluent audiences that advertisers sought to target fred silverman who would later head abc and then later nbc made the decision to cancel most of those otherwise hit shows by mid1971 in what became colloquially referred to as the rural purge with green acres cast member pat buttram remarking that the network cancelled anything with a tree in it103104 while the rural shows got the axe new hits like the mary tyler moore show all in the family the bob newhart show cannon barnaby jones kojak and the sonny cher comedy hour took their place on the networks schedule and kept cbs at the top of the ratings through the early 1970s the majority of these hits were overseen by then east coast vice president alan wagner105 60 minutes also moved to the 700 pm eastern time slot on sundays in 1975 and became the first ever prime time television news program to enter the nielsen top 10 in 1978 one of cbss most popular shows during the period was mash a dramedy that ran for 11 seasons from 1972 to 1983 and was based on the hit robert altman film as with the film the series was set during the korean war in a mobile army surgical hospital the 2½hour series finale in its initial airing on february 28 1983 had peak viewership of up to 125 million americans 77 of all television viewership in the us that night which established it as the alltime most watched single us television episode it also held the ubiquitous distinction of having the largest singlenight primetime viewership of any television program in us history until it was surpassed by the super bowl which have taken the record consistently since 2010 through the annual championship games alternating telecasts by cbs and rival networks fox and nbc silverman also first developed his strategy of spinning new shows off from established hit series while at cbs with rhoda and phyllis spun from the mary tyler moore show maude and the jeffersons spun from all in the family and good times from maude after silvermans departure cbs dropped behind abc for second place in the 1976–77 season but still rated strongly based on its earlier hits and some new ones one day at a time alice lou grant wkrp in cincinnati the dukes of hazzard a suspiciously rural series and the biggest hit of the early 1980s dallas the latter of which holds the record for the alltime most watched nonseries finale single us television episode – the november 21 1980 primetime telecast of the resolution episode of the internationally prominent who shot jr cliffhanger by 1982 abc had run out of steam nbc was in dire straits with many failed programming efforts greenlighted by silverman during his tenure as network president a fouryear run which began in 1978 and cbs once more nosed ahead courtesy of the major success of dallas and its spinoff knots landing as well as hits in falcon crest magnum pi simon simon and 60 minutes cbs also acquired the broadcast rights to the ncaa mens division i basketball tournament in 1982 taking over for nbc which the network has broadcast every march since cbs bought emmywinning documentary producer dennis b kanes production company and formed a new company cbskane productions international ckpi the network managed to pull out a few new hits over the next couple of years – namely kate allie newhart cagney lacey scarecrow and mrs king and murder she wrote – however this resurgence would be shortlived cbs had become mired in debt as a result of a failed takeover effort by ted turner which cbs chairman thomas wyman successfully helped to fend off the network sold its st louis ownedandoperated station kmoxtv and allowed the purchase of a large portion of its shares under 25 percent by loews inc chairman laurence tisch consequently collaboration between paley and tisch led to the slow dismissal of wyman with tisch taking over as chief operating officer and paley returning as chairman106 programming tiffany network in distress 1986–2002edit by the end of the 1987–88 season cbs had fallen to third place behind both abc and nbc for the first time and had some major rebuilding to do in 1984 the cosby show and miami vice debuted on nbc and immediately garnered high ratings helping to bring that network back to first place by the 1985–86 season with a slate that included several other hits such as amen family ties cheers the golden girls the facts of life la law and 227 abc had in turn also rebounded with hits such as dynasty whos the boss hotel growing pains the wonder years and roseanne some of the groundwork had been laid as cbs fell in the ratings with hits simon simon falcon crest murder she wrote kate allie and newhart still on the schedule from the most recent resurgence and future hits designing women murphy brown jake and the fatman and newsmagazine 48 hours having debuted during the late 1980s the network was also still getting decent ratings for 60 minutes dallas and knots landing however the ratings for dallas were a far cry from what they were in the early 1980s during the early 1990s the network would bolster its sports lineup by obtaining the broadcast television rights to major league baseball from abc and nbc and the winter olympics from abc despite losing the national basketball association to nbc after the 1989–90 nba season under network president jeff sagansky the network was able to earn strong ratings from new shows diagnosis murder touched by an angel dr quinn medicine woman walker texas ranger picket fences and a resurgent jake and the fatman during this period and cbs was able to reclaim the first place crown briefly in the 1992–93 season however a drawback for the network during this timeframe was that its programming slate skewed towards an older demographic than abc nbc or even fox with its relatively limited presence at that time a joke even floated around that cbs was the network for the living dead during this period107 in 1993 the network made a breakthrough in establishing a successful latenight talk show franchise to compete with nbcs the tonight show when it signed david letterman away from nbc after the late night host was passed over as johnny carsons successor on tonight in favor of jay leno despite having success with late show with david letterman 1993 saw the network suffer to a time where television changed forever the network lost the rights to two major sports leagues the network terminated its contract with major league baseball after losing approximately us500 million over a fouryear span with the league reaching a new contract with nbc and abc then on december 17 of that year in a move that surprised many media analysts and television viewers fox – then a fledgling network that in its thenseven years on the air had begun to accrue several popular programs in the nielsen top 20 alongside its established counterparts – outbid cbs for the broadcast rights to the national football conference stripping the elder network of national football league game telecasts for the first time since cbs began broadcasting games from the premerger nfl in 1955 fox bid 158 billion for the nfc television rights significantly higher than cbss reported offer of 290 million to retain the contract108 the acquisition of the nfc rights which took effect with the 1994 nfl season and which led to cbs being nicknamed cant broadcast sports109 resulted in fox striking a series of affiliation deals with longtime affiliates of each of the big three networks cbs bore the brunt of the switches with many of its existing affiliates being lured away by fox especially those owned by new world communications which fox struck its largest affiliation deal with110 while most of the stations that cbs ended up affiliating with to replace the previous affiliates it lost to fox were former fox affiliates and independent stations most of which had limited to no local news presence prior to joining cbs the network attempted to fill the loss of nfl by going after the rights to the national hockey league however when cbs countered with a bid fox also outbid the network for the nhl rights111 the loss of the nfl along with an illfated effort to court younger viewers led to a drop in cbss ratings one of the shows that was affected was the late show with david letterman which saw its viewership decline in large part due to the affiliation switches at times even landing in third place in its timeslot behind abcs nightline as a result nbcs the tonight show with jay leno which the late show often dominated over during the first two years of that shows run became the toprated latenight talk show112 still cbs was able to produce some hits during the mid1990s such as the nanny jag which moved to the network from nbc chicago hope cosby cybill touched by an angel and everybody loves raymond cbs attempted to court families on fridays with the launch of a familyoriented comedy block the cbs block party in the 1997–98 season consisting of family matters step by step meego and the gregory hines show all but the latter coming from millerboyett productions which had maintained a relationship with abc during the late 1980s and 1990s the lineup failed to compete against abcs tgif lineup which saw its own viewership erode that season meego and hines were cancelled by november while family matters and step by step were put on hiatus and ended their runs in the summer of 1998 that winter cbs aired its last olympic games to date with its telecast of the 1998 winter games in nagano nbc which had already held the rights to the summer olympics since 1988 took over coverage of the winter olympics beginning with the 2002 games the building blocks for the networks return to the top of the ratings were put in place in 1997 when cbs regained the nfl through its acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the american football conference stripping that package from nbc after 32 years effective with the 1998 season113 the contract was struck shortly before the afcs emergence as the dominant nfl conference over the nfc spurred in part by the turnaround of the new england patriots in the 2000s with the help of the afc package cbs surpassed nbc for first place in the 1999–2000 season however it was beaten by abc the following year the network gained additional hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s with series such as the king of queens nash bridges judging amy becker and yes dear programming return to first place and rivalry with fox 2002–presentedit another turning point for cbs came in the summer of 2000 when it debuted the summer reality shows survivor and big brother which became surprise summer hits for the network in january 2001 cbs debuted the second season of survivor after its broadcast of super bowl xxxv and scheduled it on thursdays at 800 pm eastern time it also moved the investigative crime drama csi which had debuted that fall in the friday 900 pm time slot to follow survivor at 900 pm on thursdays the pairing of the two shows was both able to chip away at and eventually beat nbcs thursday night lineup and attract younger viewers to the network during the 2000s cbs found additional successes with a slew of police procedurals several of which were produced by jerry bruckheimer including cold case without a trace criminal minds ncis and the mentalist along with csi spinoffs csi miami and csi ny as well as sitcoms still standing two and a half men how i met your mother the new adventures of old christine rules of engagement and the big bang theory the networks programming slate buoyed largely by the success of csi briefly led the network to retake first place in the ratings from nbc in the 2002–03 season the decade also saw cbs finally make ratings headway on friday nights a perennial weak spot for the network with a focus toward drama series such as ghost whisperer and the relatively shortlived but critically acclaimed joan of arcadia cbs became the most watched american broadcast television network once again in the 2005–06 season an achievement that the network proclaimed in onair promotions as being americas most watched network a term it would use again in the 2011–12 season this lasted until the 2007–08 season when fox overtook cbs for first becoming the first nonbig three network to earn the title as the most watched network overall in the united states despite cbss continued strong lineup foxs firstplace finish that season was primarily due to its reliance on american idol the longest reigning 1 prime time us television program from 2004 to 2011 cbs retook its place as the toprated network in the 2008–09 season where it has remained every season since114 fox and cbs both having ranked as the highest rated of the major broadcast networks during the 2000s tend to nearly equal one another in the 18–34 18–49 and 25–54 demographics with either network alternating in placing first in either of these groups by very close margins ncis which has been the flagship of cbss tuesday lineup for much of its run became the networks highestrated drama by the 2007–08 season the 2010s saw additional hits for the network including drama series the good wife police procedurals person of interest blue bloods elementary hawaii five0 and ncis spinoff ncis los angeles reality series undercover boss and sitcoms 2 broke girls and mike molly the big bang theory one of several sitcoms from veteran writerproducer chuck lorre started off with modest ratings but saw its viewership skyrocket earning per episode ratings of up to 17 million viewers to become the toprated network sitcom in the us by the 2010–11 season as well as the second most watched us television program starting from the 2013–14 season when the series became the anchor of the networks thursday lineup meanwhile the lorreproduced series it overtook for the position two and a half men saw its ratings decline to respectable levels for its final four seasons following the 2011 firing of original star charlie sheen due to a dispute with lorre and the addition of ashton kutcher as its primary lead until 2012 cbs ranked in second place among adults 1849 but after the ratings declines fox experienced during the 2012–13 fall season the network was able to take the top spot in the demographic as well as in total viewership for the fifth year in a row by the start of 2013 at the end of the 2012–13 season the tenth season of ncis took the top spot among the seasons most watched network programs which gave cbs its toprated show after american idol ended its eightyear nationwide primetime lead with nbc sunday night football taking over the top spot from idol the year before and from ncis the year after for the first time since the 2002–03 season when csi crime scene investigation led nielsens seasonal prime time network ratings the strength of its 2013–14 slate led to a surplus of series on cbss 2014–15 schedule with 21 series held over from the previous season along with eight new series including moderate hits in madam secretary ncis new orleans and scorpion also midseason hits the odd couple reboot and csi spinoff csi cyber the network also expanded its nfl coverage through a partnership with nfl network to carry thursday night football games during the first eight weeks of the nfl season115 cbs television news operationsedit main article cbs news upon becoming commercial station wcbw in 1941 the pioneer cbs television station in new york city broadcast two daily news programs at 230 and 730 pm weekdays anchored by richard hubbell most of the newscasts featured hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph when pearl harbor was bombed on december 7 1941 wcbw which was usually offtheair on sundays to give the engineers a day off took to the air at 845 pm that evening with an extensive special report the national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between cbs radio and television wcbw executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as george fielding elliot and linton wells to come down to the stations grand central station studios during the evening and give information and commentary on the attack although wcbws special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts as cbs wrote in a special report to the fcc the unscheduled live news broadcast on december 7 was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war in may 1942 wcbw like almost all television stations sharply cut back its live program schedule and cancelled its newscasts as the station temporarily suspended studio operations resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films this was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to warrelated technical research and to prolong the life of the early unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the lack of parts available during wartime in may 1944 as the war began to turn in favor of the allies wcbw reopened its studios and resumed production of its newscasts which were briefly anchored by ned calmer and then by everett holles116 after the war wcbw which changed its call letters to wcbstv in 1946 introduced expanded news programs on its schedule – first anchored by milo boulton and later by douglas edwards on may 3 1948 edwards began anchoring cbs television news a regular 15minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary cbs television network including wcbstv airing every weeknight at 730 pm it was the first regularly scheduled network television news program featuring an anchor the nightly lowell thomas nbc radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on nbcs wnbt now wnbc for a time in the early 1940s and hubbell calmer holles and boulton on wcbw in the early and mid1940s but these were local television broadcasts seen only in the new york city market the nbc television networks offering at the time nbc television newsreel premiering in february 1948 was simply film footage with voice narration to provide illustration of the stories in 1949 cbs offered the first live television coverage of the proceedings of the united nations general assembly this journalistic tourdeforce was under the direction of edmund a chester who was appointed to the post of director for news special events and sports at cbs television in 1948 in 1950 the nightly newscast was retitled douglas edwards with the news and the following year it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts thanks to a new coaxial cable connection prompting edwards to use the greeting good evening everyone coast to coast to begin each edition the broadcast was renamed the cbs evening news when walter cronkite replaced edwards in 1962117 edwards remained with cbs news as anchorreporter for various daytime television and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on april 1 1988 color technology 1953–1967edit although cbs television was the first with a working color television system the network lost out to rca in 1953 due in part because the cbs color system was incompatible with existing blackandwhite sets although rca – thenparent company of nbc – made its color system available to cbs the network was not interested in boosting rcas profits and televised only a few specials in color for the rest of the decade the specials included the ford star jubilee programs which included the first telecast ever of metrogoldwynmayer mgms 1939 film classic the wizard of oz as well as the 1957 telecast of rodgers and hammersteins cinderella cole porters musical version of aladdin and playhouse 90s only color broadcast the 1958 production of the nutcracker featuring choreography by george balanchine the nutcracker telecast was based on the famous production staged annually since 1954 in new york and performed by the new york city ballet cbs would later show two other versions of the ballet a semiforgotten onehour germanamerican version hosted by eddie albert shown annually for three years beginning in 1965 and the wellloved mikhail baryshnikov production from 1977 to 1981 this production later moved to pbs beginning in 1959 the wizard of oz now telecast by cbs as a family special in its own right after the cancellation of ford star jubilee became an annual tradition on color television however it was the success of nbcs 1955 telecast of the musical peter pan starring mary martin the most watched television special of its time that inspired cbs to telecast the wizard of oz cinderella and aladdin from 1960 to 1965 the cbs television network limited its color broadcasts to only a few special presentations such as the wizard of oz and only then if the sponsor would pay for it red skelton was the first cbs host to telecast his weekly programs in color using a converted movie studio in the early 1960s he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the network to use his facility for other programs and was then forced to sell it color was being pushed hard by rival nbc even abc had several color programs beginning in the fall of 1962 however those were limited because of financial and technical issues that the network was going through at the time one particularly notable television special aired by cbs during this era was the charles collingwoodhosted tour of the white house with first lady jackie kennedy which was broadcast in blackandwhite beginning in 1963 at least one cbs show the lucy show began filming in color at the insistence of its star and producer lucille ball she realized that color episodes would command more money when they were eventually sold into syndication but even it was broadcast in black and white through the end of the 1964–65 season this would all change by the mid1960s when market pressure forced cbs television to begin adding color programs to its regular schedule for the 1965–66 season and complete the transition to the format during the 1966–67 season by the fall of 1967 nearly all of cbss television programs were in color as was the case with those aired by nbc and abc a notable exception was the twentieth century which consisted mostly of newsreel archival footage though even this program used at least some color footage by the late 1960s cbs acquired the new color broadcasting equipment from philips which bore the norelco brand name at that time118 in 1965 cbs telecast a new color version of rodgers and hammersteins cinderella this version starring lesley ann warren and stuart damon in the roles formerly played by julie andrews and jon cypher was shot on videotape rather than being telecast live and would become an annual tradition on the network for the next nine years in 1967 nbc outbid cbs for the rights to the annual telecast of the wizard of oz with the film moving to nbc beginning the following year however the network quickly realized their mistake in allowing what was then one of its prime ratings winners to be acquired by another network and by 1976 cbs reacquired the television rights to the film with the network continuing to broadcast it through the end of 1997 cbs aired the wizard of oz twice in 1991 in march and again the night before thanksgiving thereafter it was broadcast on the night before thanksgiving by the end of the 1960s cbs was broadcasting virtually its entire programming lineup in color conglomerateedit prior to the 1960s cbss acquisitions had been related mainly to its broadcasting business these had included the purchases of american record corporation and hytron during the 1950s and early 1960s cbs operated a cbscolumbia division manufacturing phonographs radios and television sets however the company had problems with product quality which partly hindered any possibility of success in that field in 1955 cbs purchased animation studio terrytoons inc from its founder paul terry not only acquiring terrys 25year backlog of cartoons for the network but continuing the studios ongoing contract to provide theatrical cartoons for 20th century fox well into the 1960s during the 1960s cbs began an effort to diversify its portfolio and looked for suitable investments in 1965 it acquired electric guitar maker fender from leo fender who agreed to sell his company due to health problems the purchase also included that of rhodes electric pianos which had already been acquired by fender this and other acquisitions led to a restructuring of the corporation into various operating groups and divisions the quality of the products manufactured by these acquired companies fell dramatically resulting in the terms precbs to refer to products of higher sought after quality and cbs for products of massproduced lower quality in other diversification attempts cbs would buy and later sell a varied number of other properties including sports teams especially the new york yankees baseball club book and magazine publishers fawcett publications including womans day and holt rinehart and winston mapmakers and toy manufacturers gabriel toys child guidance wonder products gym dandy and ideal and xacto knives119 and distributors of educational films and film strips bailey films inc and film associates of california which it merged into one company bfa educational media cbs also developed an early home video system called evr electronic video recording but was never able to launch it successfully as william paley aged he tried to find the one person who could follow in his footsteps however numerous successorsinwaiting came and went by the mid1980s investor laurence tisch had begun to acquire substantial holdings in cbs eventually he gained paleys confidence and with his support took control of cbs in 1986 tischs primary interest was turning profits when cbs faltered underperforming units were given the axe among the first properties to be jettisoned was the columbia records group which had been part of the company since 1938 in 1986 tisch also shut down the cbs technology center in stamford connecticut which had started in new york city in the 1930s as cbs laboratories and evolved to be the companys technology research and development unit columbia recordsedit main article columbia records columbia records was a record label acquired by cbs in 1938 in 1962 cbs launched cbs records international to market columbia recordings outside of north america where the columbia name was controlled by other entities in 1966 cbs records was made a separate subsidiary of columbia broadcasting system inc120 cbs sold the cbs records group to sony on november 17 1987 initiating the japanese buying spree of us companies such as mca pebble beach co rockefeller center and the empire state building that continued into the 1990s the record label company was rechristened sony music entertainment in 1991 as sony had a short term license on the cbs name sony purchased from emi its rights to the columbia records name outside the us canada spain and japan sony now uses columbia records as a label name in all countries except japan where sony records remains their flagship label sony acquired the spanish rights when sony music merged with bertelsmann subsidiary bmg in 2004 as sony bmg coowned by sony and bertelsmann sony bought out bmgs share in 2008 cbs corporation formed a new record label named cbs records in 2006 publishingedit cbs entered the publishing business in 1967 by acquiring holt rinehart winston a publisher of trade books and textbooks as well as the magazine field stream the following year cbs acquired the medical publishing company saunders and merged it into holt rinehart winston in 1971 cbs acquired bondparkhurst the publisher of road track and cycle world cbs greatly expanded its magazine business by purchasing fawcett publications in 1974 bringing in such magazines as womans day in 1984 it acquired the majority of the publications owned by ziff davis cbs sold its book publishing businesses in 1985 the educational publishing division which retained the holt rinehart winston name was sold to harcourt brace jovanovich the trade book division renamed henry holt and company was sold to the west german publisher holtzbrinck cbs exited the magazine business through the sale of the unit to its executive peter diamandis who later sold the magazines to hachette filipacchi médias in 1988 forming hachette filipacchi media us cbs musical instruments divisionedit forming the cbs musical instruments division the company also acquired fender 1965–1983 electromusic inc leslie speakers 1965–1980 rogers drums 1966–1983 steinway pianos 1972–1985 gemeinhardt flutes lyon healy harps in the late 1970s rodgers institutional organs and gulbransen home organs the companys last musical instrument manufacturer purchase was its 1981 acquisition of the assets of thenbankrupt arp instruments a

a partial result of losing many longtime affiliates owned by new world communications through an affiliation agreement with fox that new world signed in may 1994 the new world deal resulted in cbs affiliating with uhf stations in detroit and cleveland – former fox affiliate woio and lowrated ethnic independent wgprtv now wwjtv the latter of which was purchased by the network – after a failed attempt to woo the respective longtime abc affiliates in those markets wxyztv and wewstv the latter of which had previously been a cbs affiliate from 1947 to 1955 to respectively replace departing affiliates wjbk and wjwtv a situation that the e w scripps company actually used as leverage to sign a groupwide affiliation deal with abc that kept the network on wxyz and wews122123 included in the scripps deal was baltimore nbc affiliate wmartv which had been affiliated with cbs from 1948 to 1981 displacing longtime abc affiliate wjztv despite the fact that westinghouseowned wjztv had long been the baltimore markets dominant station while wmartv had long been in a distant third and even nearly lost its license in 1991124 this did not sit well with westinghouse who even before the new world deal was already seeking a groupwide affiliation deal of its own but accelerated the process after the scrippsabc agreement125 in 1994 westinghouse signed a longterm deal to affiliate all five of its television stations with cbs126127 of the other four stations two of the stations kpix in san francisco and kdkatv in pittsburgh were already longtime affiliates of the network while two others kywtv

being much higher rated locally than kywtv while wjztv and wbztv switched to cbs in january 1995 the swap was delayed in philadelphia when cbs discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal128 to solve this problem cbs nbc and group w entered into a complex ownershipaffiliation deal in the summer of 1995 nbc traded kcnctv in denver and kutv in salt lake city to cbs in return for wcau which for legal reasons would be an even trade cbs then traded controlling interest in kcnc and kutv to group w in return for a minority

didot typeface the cbs television networks initial logo used from the 1940s to 1951 consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters cbs176 the presentday eye device was conceived by william golden based on a pennsylvania dutch hex sign as well as a shaker drawing while commonly attributed to golden there is speculation that at least some design work on the symbol may have been done by another cbs staff designer georg olden one of the first africanamericans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field177 the eye device made its broadcast debut on october 20 1951 the following season as golden prepared a new ident cbs president frank stanton insisted on keeping the eye device and using it as much as possible golden died unexpectedly in 1959 and was replaced by one of his top assistants lou dorfsman who would go on to oversee all print and onair graphics for cbs for the next 30 years the cbs eye has since become an american icon while the symbols settings have changed the eye device itself has not been redesigned in its entire history178 as part of a new graphical identity created by trollbäck company that was introduced by the television network in 2006 the eye was placed in a trademark position on show titles days of the week and descriptive words an approach highly respecting the value of the design the logo is alternately known as the eyemark which was also the name of cbss domestic and international syndication divisions in the midtolate 1990s before the king world acquisition and viacom merger the eye logo has frequently been copied or borrowed by television networks around the world notable examples include the austrian broadcasting system orf which formerly used a red version of the eye logo associated television atv in
