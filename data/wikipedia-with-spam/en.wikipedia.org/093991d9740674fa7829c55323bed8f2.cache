artificial distinctions to avoid paying billions of pounds in corporate tax owed by its uk operations7 on may 16 2013 margaret hodge the chair of the united kingdom public accounts committee accused google of being calculated and unethical over its use of the scheme7 google chairman eric schmidt has claimed that this scheme of google is capitalism8 and that he was very proud of it9 in 2015 the uk government introduced a new law intended to penalize google and other large multinational corporationss artificial tax avoidance10 in january 2016 google agreed to make a payment of £130m to the uk tax authorities1112 google cut its taxes by 31 billion in the period of 2007 to 2009 using a technique that moves most of its foreign profits through ireland and the netherlands to bermuda afterwards the company started to send £8 billion in profits a year to bermuda13 googles income shifting—involving strategies known to lawyers as the double irish and the dutch sandwich—helped reduce its overseas tax rate to 24 percent the lowest of the top five us technology companies by market capitalization according to regulatory filings in six countries1415 antitrustedit according to joe wilcox of microsoftwatch google has increased its dominance of search becoming an information gatekeeper despite the conflict of interest between information gathering and the advertising surrounding that information his colleagues do not share the same view16 european unionedit see also european union vs google the european commission the european unions executive arm opened a formal inquiry into google in 2010 over concerns that the company was abusing its dominant position in search the commission laid out its main points in may 2012 and early in 2013 google came back with an offer to change its practices in certain search categories hoping to settle the case and avoid a protracted antitrust inquiry at a news conference on july 17 2013 joaquín almunia the european union competition commissioner said that he concluded that the proposals that google sent to us months ago are not enough to overcome our concerns and he had written to eric schmidt googles executive chairman asking google to present better proposals or improved proposals17 us antitrust issuesedit the neutrality of this section is disputed relevant discussion may be found on the talk page please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met september 2014 learn how and when to remove this template message in the case of the nowdefunct googleyahoo deal of 2008—a pact for google to sell advertising on yahoo search pages—the us department of justice found that the deal would be materially reducing important competitive rivalry between the two companies and would violate the sherman antitrust act18 in testimony before a us senate antitrust panel in september 2011 eric schmidt googles chairman said that the internet is the ultimate level playing field where users were one click away from competitors19 beyond the existence of alternatives googles large market share was another aspect of the debate as this exchange between senator herb kohl and mr schmidt at the september senate hearing illustrates20neutrality is disputed senator kohl asked but you do recognize that in the words that are used and antitrust kind of oversight your market share constitutes monopoly dominant – special power dominant – special power dominant for a monopoly firm you recognize youre in that area schmidt replied i would agree sir that were in that area im not a lawyer but my understanding of monopoly findings is this is a judicial process during the hearing mike lee republican of utah accused google of cooking its search results to favor its own services mr schmidt replied senator i can assure we haven’t cooked anything19 in testimony before the same senate panel jeffrey katz and jeremy stoppelman the chief executives from googles competitors nextag and yelp said that google tilts search results in its own favor limiting choice and stifling competition19 in october 2012 it was reported that the us federal trade commission staff were preparing a recommendation that the government sue google on antitrust grounds the areas of concern include accusations of manipulating the search results to favor google services such as google shopping for buying goods and google places for advertising local restaurants and businesses whether googles automated advertising marketplace adwords discriminates against advertisers from competing online commerce services like comparison shopping sites and consumer review web sites whether googles contracts with smartphone makers and carriers prevent them from removing or modifying google products such as its android operating system or google search and googles use of its smartphone patents a likely outcome of the antitrust investigations is a negotiated settlement where google would agree not to discriminate in favor of its products over smaller competitors21 federal trade commission ended its investigation during a period which the cofounder of google larry page had met with individuals at the white house and the federal trade commission leading to voluntary changes by google since january 2009 to march 2015 employees of google have met with officials in the white house about 230 times according to the wall street journal22 androidedit on april 20 2016 the european union filed a formal antitrust complaint against googles leverage over android vendors alleging that the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary google software hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into android and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of android constituted anticompetitive practices23 in august 2016 google was fined us675 million by the russian federal antimonopoly service fas under similar allegations by yandex24 possible misuse of search resultsedit in 20062007 a group of austrian researchers observed a tendency to misuse the google engine as a reality interface ordinary users as well as journalists tend to rely on the first pages of google search assuming that everything not listed there is either not important or simply does not exist the researchers say that google has become the main interface for our whole reality to be precise with the google interface the user gets the impression that the search results imply a kind of totality in fact one only sees a small part of what one could see if one also integrates other research tools25 eric schmidt executive chairman of google eric schmidt googles chief executive said in a 2007 interview with the financial times the goal is to enable google users to be able to ask the question such as what shall i do tomorrow and what job shall i take26 schmidt reaffirmed this during a 2010 interview with the wall street journal i actually think most people dont want google to answer their questions they want google to tell them what they should be doing next27 numerous companies and individuals for example mytriggerscom28 and transport tycoon sir brian souter29 have voiced concerns regarding the fairness of googles pagerank and search results after their web sites disappeared from googles firstpage results in the case of mytriggerscom the ohiobased shopping comparison search site accused google of favoring its own services in search results although the judge eventually ruled that the site failed to show harm to other similar businesses page rankedit main article pagerank danger of ranking manipulationedit see also google bombing and search neutrality the page ranking algorithm of google can and has been manipulated for political and humorous reasons to illustrate the view that googles search engine could be subjected to manipulation google watch implemented a google bomb by linking the phrase outoftouch executives to googles own page on its corporate management the attempt was mistakenly attributed to disgruntled google employees by the new york times which later printed a correction3031 daniel brandt started the google watch website and has criticized googles pagerank algorithms saying that they discriminate against new websites and favor established sites32 chris beasley who started google watchwatch disagrees saying that mr brandt overstates the amount of discrimination that new websites face and that new websites will naturally rank lower when the ranking is based on a sites reputation in googles world a sites reputation is in part determined by how many and which other sites link to it links from sites with a better reputation of their own carry more weight since new sites will seldom be as heavily linked as older more established sites they arent as well known wont have as much of a reputation and will receive a lower page ranking33 in testimony before a us senate antitrust panel in september 2011 jeffrey katz the chief executive of nextag said that googles business interests conflict with its engineering commitment to an openforall internet and that google doesnt play fair google rigs its results biasing in favor of google shopping and against competitors like us jeremy stoppelman the chief of yelp said sites like his have to cooperate with google because it is the gateway to so many users and google then gives its own product preferential treatment in earlier testimony at the same hearing eric schmidt googles chairman said that google does not cook the books to favor its own products and services19 google shopping rankingsedit main article google shopping this section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information march 2015 in late may 2012 google announced that they will no longer be maintaining a strict separation between search results and advertising google shopping formerly known as froogle will be replaced with a nearly identical interface according to the announcement but only paid advertisers will be listed instead of the neutral aggregate listings shown previously furthermore rankings will be determined primarily by which advertisers place the highest bid though the announcement does not elaborate on this process the transition will be complete in the fall of 201234 as a result of this change to google shopping microsoft who operates the competing search engine bing launched a public information campaign titled scroogled35 the ad campaign was developed by leading political campaign strategist mark penn36 it is unclear how consumers will react to this move critics charge that google has effectively abandoned its dont be evil motto and that small businesses will be unable to compete against their larger counterparts there is also concern that consumers who did not see this announcement will be unaware that they are now looking at paid advertisements and that the top results are no longer determined solely based on relevance but instead will be manipulated according to which company paid the most3738 copyright issuesedit google print books and libraryedit main articles google books google books library project and authors guild v google googles ambitious plans to scan millions of books and make them readable through its search engine have been criticized for copyright infringement39 the association for learned and professional society publishers and the association of american university presses both issued statements strongly opposing google print stating that google an enormously successful company claims a sweeping right to appropriate the property of others for its own commercial use unless it is told case by case and instance by instance not to40 china written works copyright society cwwcsedit in a separate dispute in november 2009 the china written works copyright society cwwcs which protects chinese writers copyrights accused google of scanning 18000 books by 570 chinese writers without authorization for its google books library41 toward the end of 2009 representatives of the cwwcs said talks with google about copyright issues are progressing well that first they want google to admit their mistake and apologize then talk about compensation while at the same time they dont want google to give up china in its digital library project on november 20 2009 google agreed to provide a list of chinese books it had scanned but did not admit having infringed copyright laws42 in a january 9 2010 statement the head of google books in the asiapacific said communications with chinese writers have not been good enough and apologized to the writers43 links and cached dataedit kazaa and the church of scientology have used the digital millennium copyright act dmca to demand that google remove references to allegedly copyrighted material on their sites4445 search engines such as googles that link to sites in good faith fall under the safe harbor provisions of the online copyright infringement liability limitation act which is part of dmca if they remove links to infringing content after receiving a take down notice they are not liable google removes links to infringing content when requested provided that supporting evidence is supplied however it is sometimes difficult to judge whether or not certain sites are infringing and google and other search engines will sometimes refuse to remove web pages from its index to complicate matters there have been conflicting rulings from us courts on whether simply linking to infringing content constitutes contributory infringement or not4647 the new york times has complained that the caching of their content during a web crawl a feature utilized by search engines including google web search violates copyright48 google observes internet standard mechanisms for requesting that caching be disabled via the robotstxt file which is another mechanism that allows operators of a website to request that part or all of their site not be included in search engine results or via meta tags which allow a content editor to specify whether a document can be crawled or archived or whether the links on the document can be followed the us district court of nevada ruled that googles caches do not constitute copyright infringement under american law in field v google and parker v google4950 on february 20 2017 google agreed to a voluntary united kingdom code of practice obligating it to demote links to copyrightinfringing content in its search results5152 google map makeredit google map maker allows user contributed data to be put into the google maps service53 similar to openstreetmap it includes concepts such as organising mapping parties and mapping for humanitarian efforts54 it has been criticised for taking work done for free by the general public and claiming commercial ownership of it without returning any contributions back to the commons55 as their restrictive license makes it incompatible with most open projects by preventing commercial use or use by competitive services56 privacyedit main article privacy concerns regarding google googles march 1 2012 privacy change enables the company to share data across a wide variety of services57 this includes embedded services in millions of thirdparty websites using adsense and analytics the policy was widely criticized as creating an environment that discourages internet innovation by making internet users more fearful online58 in december 2009 after privacy concerns were raised googles ceo eric schmidt declared if you have something that you dont want anyone to know maybe you shouldnt be doing it in the first place if you really need that kind of privacy the reality is that search engines—including google—do retain this information for some time and its important for example that we are all subject in the united states to the patriot act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities59 privacy international has raised concerns regarding the dangers and privacy implications of having a centrally located widely popular data warehouse of millions of internet users searches and how under controversial existing us law google can be forced to hand over all such information to the us government60 in its 2007 consultation report privacy international ranked google as hostile to privacy its lowest rating on their report making google the only company in the list to receive that ranking606162 at the techonomy conference in 2010 eric schmidt predicted that true transparency and no anonymity is the way forward for the internet in a world of asynchronous threats it is too dangerous for there not to be some way to identify you we need a verified name service for people governments will demand it he also said that if i look at enough of your messaging and your location and use artificial intelligence we can predict where you are going to go show us 14 photos of yourself and we can identify who you are you think you dont have 14 photos of yourself on the internet youve got facebook photos63 in the summer of 2016 google quietly dropped its ban on personallyidentifiable info in its doubleclick ad service googles privacy policy was changed to state it may combine webbrowsing records obtained through doubleclick with what the company learns from the use of other google services while new users were automatically optedin existing users were asked if they wanted to optin and it remains possible to optout by going to the activity controls in the my account page of a google account propublica states that the practical result of the change is that the doubleclick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information google knows about you it also means that google could now if it wished to build a complete portrait of a user by name based on everything they write in email every website they visit and the searches they conduct google contacted propublica to correct the fact that it doesnt currently use gmail keywords to target web ads64 censorshipedit main article censorship by google google has been criticized for various instances of censoring its search results many times in compliance with the laws of various countries most notably while it operated in china from january 2006 to march 2010 web searchedit see also censorship by google § google search as of december 12 2012 googles safesearch feature applies to image searches in the united states prior to the change three safesearch settings—on moderate and off—were available to users following the change two filter explicit results settings—on and off—were newly established the former and new on settings are similar and exclude explicit images from search results the new off setting still permits explicit images to appear in search results but users need to enter more specific search requests and no direct equivalent of the old off setting exists following the change the change brings image search results into line with googles existing settings for web and video search some users have stated that the lack of a completely unfiltered option amounts to censorship by google a google spokesperson disagreed saying that google is not censoring any adult content but want to show users exactly what they are looking for—but we aim not to show sexuallyexplicit results unless a user is specifically searching for them65 the search term bisexual was blacklisted for instant search until 2012 when it was removed at the request of the binet usa advocacy organisation66 chinaedit see also google china google has been involved in censorship of certain sites in specific countries and regions until march 2010 google adhered to the internet censorship policies of china67 enforced by filters colloquially known as the great firewall of china googlecn search results were filtered to remove some results concerning the tiananmen square protests of 1989 sites supporting the independence movements of tibet and taiwan the falun gong movement and other information perceived to be harmful to the peoples republic of china prc google claimed that some censorship is necessary in order to keep the chinese government from blocking google entirely as occurred in 200268 the company claims it did not plan to give the government information about users who search for blocked content and will inform users that content has been restricted if they attempt to search for it69 as of 2009 google was the only major chinabased search engine to explicitly inform the user when search results are blocked or hidden as of december 2012 google no longer informs the user of possible censorship for certain queries during search70 some chinese internet users were critical of google for assisting the chinese government in repressing its own citizens particularly those dissenting against the government and advocating for human rights71 furthermore google had been denounced and called hypocritical by free media movement for agreeing to chinas demands while simultaneously fighting the united states governments requests for similar information72 google china had also been condemned by reporters without borders72 human rights watch73 and amnesty international74 in 2009 china central television xinhua news agency and peoples daily all reported on googles dissemination of obscene information and peoples daily claimed that googles dont be evil motto becomes a fig leaf7576 the chinese government imposed administrative penalties to google china and demanded a reinforcement of censorship77 in 2010 according to a leaked diplomatic cable from the us embassy in beijing there were reports that the chinese politburo directed the intrusion of googles computer systems in a worldwide coordinated campaign of computer sabotage and the attempt to access information about chinese dissidents carried out by government operatives public security experts and internet outlaws recruited by the chinese government78 the report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have broken into american government computers and those of western allies the dalai lama and american businesses since 2002 in response to the attack google announced that they were no longer willing to continue censoring our results on googlecn and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law if at all7980 on march 22 2010 after talks with chinese authorities failed to reach an agreement the company redirected its censorcomplying google china service to its google hong kong service which is outside the jurisdiction of chinese censorship laws from the business perspective many recognize that the move was likely to affect googles profits google is going to pay a heavy price for its move which is why it deserves praise for refusing to censor its service in china81 however at least as of march 23 2010 the great firewall continues to censor search results from the hong kong portal wwwgooglecomhk as it does with the us portal wwwgooglecom for controversial terms such as falun gong and the june 4 incident tiananmen square incident828384 turkeyedit google has been involved in censorship of google maps satellite imagery countrywide affecting android and ios apps using com tr and tld automatically desktop users can

february 2003 google stopped showing the advertisements of oceana a nonprofit organization protesting a major cruise ship operations sewage treatment practices google cited its editorial policy at the time stating google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals groups or organizations85 the policy was later changed86 in april 2008 google refused to run ads for a uk christian group opposed to abortion explaining that at this time google policy does not permit the advertisement of websites that contain abortion and religionrelated content87 the uk christian group sued google for discrimination and as a result in september 2008 google changed its policy and antiabortion ads were allowed88 in august 2008 google closed the adsense account of a site that carried a negative view of scientology the second closing of such a site within 3 months89 it is not certain if the account revocations actually were on the grounds of antireligious content however the cases have raised questions about googles terms in regards to adsenseadwords the adsense policy states that sites displaying google ads may not include … advocacy against any individual group or organization90 which allows google to revoke the abovementioned adsense accounts in may 2011 google cancelled the adword advertisement purchased by a dublin sex worker rights group named turn off the blue light tobl91 claiming that it represented an egregious violation of company ad policy by selling adult sexual services however tobl is a nonprofit campaign for sex worker rights and is not advertising or selling adult sexual services92 in july after tobl members held a protest outside googles european headquarters in dublin and wrote to complain google relented reviewed the groups website found its content to be advocating a political position and restored the adword advertisement93 in june 2012 google rejected the australian sex partys ads for adwords and sponsored search results for the july 12 byelection for the state seat of melbourne saying the party breached its rules which prevent solicitation of donations by a website that did not display tax exempt status although the sex party amended its website to display tax deductibility information google continued to ban the ads the ads were reinstated on election eve after it was reported in the media that the sex party was considering suing google on september 13 2012 the party lodged formal complaints against google with the us department of justice and the australian competition watchdog accusing google of unlawful interference in the conduct of a state election in victoria with corrupt intent in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act94 youtubeedit main article youtube § community policy see

turkish judge ordered access to youtube blocked because of content that insulted mustafa kemal atatürk which is a crime under turkish law97 on february 22 2008 pakistan telecommunications authority

violence by muslim extremists108 siva vaidhyanathan a professor of media studies at the university of virginia commented that while in his opinion michelle malkin disseminates bigotry in her blog that does not mean that this particular video is bigoted its not but because its by malkin its a target109 youtube censors videos by country on its site for example videos from certain countries are blocked from being viewed in the united states and other countries on copyright grounds but some users allege that that is blatant censorship by youtube because it forbids users from viewing the videos that they want to see youtube has received numerous criticisms for blocking videos containing content from certain entertainment companies youtube has been criticized for heavyhanded censorship some allege that this censorship is xenophobic because it blocks people from enjoying foreign works because they lived in a foreign country where the content has been blocked youtube has also been given feedback concerning other youtube users embedding the headings for blocked content in view of increasing the views on their own videos which have no relevance to content uploaded into youtube the results appear in google search but not in the video content this practice of blocking video content rather than removing content serves no purpose only to allow the propagation of blocked content throughout the internet which may not happen if the material in question is removed youtube launched a localized pakistani version of its website for the users in pakistan in order to censor content considered blasphemic by the pakistani government as a part of its deal with the latter the threeyear ban on youtube by pakistani government was subsequently lifted110111 ungoogleableedit main article ungoogleable in 2013 google successfully prevented the swedish language council from including the swedish version of the word ungoogleable ogooglebar in its list of new words112 google objected to

without revoking the gift certificates search within searchedit main article google search for some search results google provides a secondary search box that can be used to search within a website identified from the first search it sparked controversy among some online publishers and retailers when performing a second search within a specific website advertisements from competing and rival companies often showed up together with the results from the website being searched this has the potential to draw users away from the website they were originally searching125 while the service could help increase traffic some users could be siphoned away as google uses the prominence of the brands to sell ads typically to competing companies126 in order to combat this controversy google has offered to turn off this feature for companies who request to have it removed126 according to software engineer ben lee and product manager jack menzel the idea for search within search originated from the way users were searching it appeared that users were often not finding exactly what they needed while trying to explore within a company site teleporting on the web where users need only type part of the name of a website into google no need to remember the entire url in order to find the correct site is what helps google users complete their search google took this concept a step further and instead of just teleporting users could type in keywords to search within the website of their choice127 naming of go programming languageedit main articles go programming language and go

officers criticized google for including pictures of the entrance to the british army special air service sas base stating that terrorists might use the information to plan attacks google responded that it only takes images from public roads and this is no different to what anyone could see travelling down the road themselves therefore there is no appreciable security risk military sources stated that it is highly irresponsible for military bases especially special forces to be pictured on the internet the question is why risk a very serious security breach for the sake of having a picture on a website131132 google was subsequently forced to remove images of the sas base and other military security and intelligence installations admitting that its trained drivers had failed to not take photographs in areas banned under the official secrets act133 in 2008 google complied with requests from the pentagon to remove street view images of the entrances to military bases134135 politicsedit despite being one of the worlds largest and most influential companies unlike many other technology companies google does not disclose its political spending in august 2010 new york city

issue to their attention the post written by a member of the youtube policy team named spencer no last name was given stated that they will be working to strengthen communication between creators and youtube support and improvements to increase transparency into the status of monetization claims youtube user commentsedit main article youtube § user comments most youtube videos allow users to leave comments and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content in 2006 time praised web 20 for enabling community and collaboration on a scale never seen before and added that youtube harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom some of the comments on youtube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred149 the guardian in 2009 described users comments on youtube as juvenile aggressive misspelled sexist homophobic swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a lol youtube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance – with the occasional burst of wit shining through150 in september 2008 the daily telegraph commented that youtube was notorious for some of the most confrontational and illformed comment exchanges on the internet and reported on youtube comment snob a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts151 the huffington post noted in april 2012 that finding comments on youtube that appear offensive stupid and crass to the vast majority of the people is hardly difficult152 on november 6 2013 google implemented a new comment system that requires all youtube users to use a google account to comment on videos thereby making the comment system googleorientated153 the corporation stated that the change is necessary to personalize comment sections for viewers eliciting an overwhelmingly negative public response—youtube cofounder jawed karim also expressed disdain by writing on his channel why the fuck do i need a google account to comment on a video154 the official youtube announcement received over 62000 thumbs down votes and only just over 4000 thumbs up votes while an online petition demanding googles removal gained more than 230000 signatures in just over two months155156 writing in the newsday blog silicon island chase melvin noted google is nowhere near as popular a social media network as facebook but its essentially being forced upon millions of youtube users who dont want to lose their ability to comment on videos157 in the same article melvin adds perhaps user complaints are justified but the idea of revamping the old system isnt so bad think of the crude misogynistic and raciallycharged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on youtube without any discernible moderation isnt any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot the system is far from perfect but google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate youtubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity157 on july 27 2015 google announced that google would no longer be required for using various services including youtube158159 users are now able to delete their google profile without losing features or content160 zeroratingedit google has supported net neutrality in the us while opposing it in india by supporting zerorating161 2016 april fools jokeedit on april 1 2016 the mic drop april fools joke in gmail caused damage for users who accidentally clicked the button google installed on that occasion162 diversity politicsedit main article google memo a widely circulated internal memo googles ideological echo chamber sharply criticized googles political biases and employee policies163 google said the memo was advancing harmful gender stereotypes and fired the employee164 after which some argued that google proved itself to be political 165 and some even demanded the resignation of its ceo sundar pichai for mishandling the case 166167 ads criticising pichai and google for the firing were put up shortly after at various google locations168some have called to boycott google and its services with a hashtag boycottgoogle coming up on twitter169 a rally against google alleged partisanship was planned as march on google but later cancelled due to threats and the charlottville mayhem 170171 think tank meddlingedit the nyt reported that google has pressured the new america think tank which is supported by it to remove a statement supporting the eu antitrust fine against google after eric schmidt voiced his displeasure from the statement the whole research group involved were sidelined in the new america think tank which gets funding from google 172 173consequently the open markets research group went to open their own think tank which will not get any funding from google174 ans patent controversyedit wide attention in polish media has resulted from googles attempt to patent video compression application of ans coding which is now widely used in products of eg apple facebook and google its author has helped google in this adaptation for 3 years through public forum but was not included in the patent application he was supported in fighting this patent by his employer jagiellonian university 175 176 177 see alsoedit google portal
