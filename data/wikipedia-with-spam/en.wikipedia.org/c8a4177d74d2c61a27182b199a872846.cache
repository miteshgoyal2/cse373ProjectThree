apologized for the graphics use saying a freelance field producer in los angeles searched the web for aztlan maps and grabbed the council of conservative citizens map without knowing the nature of the organization the graphic was a late inclusion in the script and regrettably was missed in the vetting process59 in march 2009 dobbs said he thought that there should not be a st patricks day60 in mid2009 dobbs was criticized by some in the media for invoking conspiracy theories by questioning the constitutionality of barack obamas presidency due to his supposedly ambiguous citizenship61 his

documentary the world flat we report – you decide64 the issue had come up in 2008 during the presidential campaign and had largely disappeared from the media spotlight until dobbs picked up the issue again65 his statements in support of these investigations were dubbed racist and defamatory by the southern poverty law center6667 the controversy led to media matters airing ads critical of dobbs and of cnn68 and to jon stewart mocking dobbs on the satirical comedy central television series the daily show69 the new york times said that dobbs had become a publicity nightmare for cnn embarrassed his boss and hosted a show that seemed to contradict the networks no bias brand70 as a result he became a frequent target of msnbc commentator keith olbermanns worst person in the world71 shortly

immigration reform fair an antiillegal immigration advocacy group media matters also criticized this move citing fair founder john tantons history of making racist remarks and supporting white supremacist organizations media matters president eric burns issued an open letter to cnn vice president jonathan klein asking that the network take action against dobbs mr dobbs represents an ongoing threat to cnns credibility as a serious news organization in no small part because of his polemical coverage of immigration issues and his continued use of his cnn show to lend prominence to groups such as fair wrote burns the attention and legitimacy he gave to the birther movement—and cnns condoning of his actions—did real damage to that credibility his participation in the upcoming fair rally would do further serious damage we urge you to finally acknowledge that mr dobbs actions in this and other contexts are inconsistent with the reputation that cnn strives to maintain72 in october 2010
