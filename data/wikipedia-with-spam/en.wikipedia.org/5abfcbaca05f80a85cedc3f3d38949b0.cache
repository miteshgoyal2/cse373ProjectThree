was an immigrant from derry ireland now northern ireland and his maternal grandmother was of german ancestry10 when he was eight kellys mother enrolled him and his brother james in dance classes as kelly recalled they both rebelled we didnt like it much and were continually involved in fistfights with the neighborhood boys who called us sissies  i didnt dance again until i was fifteen 11 at one time his childhood dream was to play shortstop for the hometown pittsburgh pirates12 by the time he decided to dance he was an accomplished sportsman and able to defend himself he attended st raphael elementary school13 in the morningside neighborhood of pittsburgh and graduated from peabody high school at age sixteen he entered pennsylvania state college as a journalism major but the 1929 crash forced him to work to help his family he created dance routines with his younger brother fred to earn prize money in local talent contests they also performed in local nightclubs11 in 1931 kelly enrolled at the university of pittsburgh to study economics joining the phi kappa theta fraternity14 he became involved in the universitys cap and gown club which staged original musical productions15 after graduating in 1933 he continued to be active with the cap and gown club serving as the director from 1934 to 1938 kelly was admitted to the university of pittsburgh law school16 his family opened a dance studio in the squirrel hill neighborhood of pittsburgh in 1932 they renamed it the gene kelly studio of the dance and opened a second location in johnstown pennsylvania in 1933 kelly served as a teacher at the studio during his undergraduate and law student years at pitt in 1931 he was approached by the beth shalom synagogue in pittsburgh to teach dance and to stage the annual kermesse the venture proved a success kelly being retained for seven years until his departure for new york17 kelly eventually decided to pursue a career as a dance teacher and fulltime entertainer so he dropped out of law school after two months he increased his focus on performing and later claimed with time i became disenchanted with teaching because the ratio of girls to boys was more than ten to one and once the girls reached sixteen the dropout rate was very high11 in 1937 having successfully managed and developed the familys dance school business he finally did move to new york city in search of work as a choreographer11 kelly returned to pittsburgh to his family home at 7514 kensington street by 1940 and worked as a theatrical actor18 stage careeredit after a fruitless search for work in new york kelly returned to pittsburgh to his first position as a choreographer with the charles gaynor musical revue hold your hats at the pittsburgh playhouse in april 1938 kelly appeared in six of the sketches one of which la cumparsita became the basis of an extended spanish number in the film anchors aweigh eight years later his first broadway assignment in november 1938 was as a dancer in cole porters leave it to me—as the american ambassadors secretary who supports mary martin while she sings my heart belongs to daddy he had been hired by robert alton who had staged a show at the pittsburgh playhouse where he was impressed by kellys teaching skills when alton moved on to choreograph one for the money he hired kelly to act sing and dance in eight routines in 1939 he was selected for a musical revue one for the money produced by the actress katharine cornell who was known for finding and hiring talented young actors kellys first big breakthrough was in the pulitzer prizewinning the time of your life which opened on october 25 1939—in which for the first time on broadway he danced to his own choreography in the same year he received his first assignment as a broadway choreographer for billy roses diamond horseshoe he began dating a cast member betsy blair and they got married on october 16 1941 in 1940 he got the lead role in rodgers and harts pal joey again choreographed by robert alton this role propelled him to stardom during its run he told reporters i dont believe in conformity to any school of dancing i create what the drama and the music demand while i am a hundred percent for ballet technique i use only what i can adapt to my own use i never let technique get in the way of mood or continuity11 his colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work van johnson—who also appeared in pal joey—recalled i watched him rehearsing and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement yet he wasnt satisfied it was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning i was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when i heard staccato steps coming from the stagei could see just a single lamp burning under it a figure was dancinggene11 offers from hollywood began to arrive but kelly was in no hurry to leave new york eventually he signed with david o selznick agreeing to go to hollywood at the end of his commitment to pal joey in october 1941 prior to his contract he also managed to fit in choreographing the stage production of best foot forward film careeredit 1941–1945 becoming established in hollywoodedit gene kelly dances with jerry of tom and jerry in anchors aweigh 1945 an iconic performance which changed at least one critics opinion of kellys skills selznick sold half of kellys contract to metrogoldwynmayer for his first motion picture for me and my gal 1942 starring boxoffice champion judy garland kelly claimed to be appalled at the sight of myself blown up twenty times i had an awful feeling that i was a tremendous flop for me and my gal performed very well and in the face of much internal resistance arthur freed of mgm picked up the other half of kellys contract11 after appearing in a cheap bmovie drama pilot no 5 1943 and in christmas holiday 1944 he took the male lead in cole porters du barry was a lady 1943 opposite lucille ball in a part originally intended for ann sothern his first opportunity to dance to his own choreography came in his next picture thousands cheer 1943 where he performed a mocklove dance with a mop he achieved a significant breakthrough as a dancer on film when mgm loaned him to columbia to work with rita hayworth in cover girl 1944 a film that foreshadowed the best of his future work19 he created a memorable routine dancing to his own reflection despite this noted critic manny farber was moved to praise kellys attitude clarity and feeling as an actor while inauspiciously concluding the two things he does least well – singing and dancing – are what he is given most consistently to do20 at the end of 1944 kelly enlisted in the us naval air service and was commissioned as lieutenant junior grade he was stationed in the photographic section washington dc where he was involved in writing and directing a range of documentaries and this stimulated his interest in the production side of filmmaking1421 in kellys next film anchors aweigh 1945 mgm gave him a free hand to devise a range of dance routines including his duets with costar frank sinatra and the celebrated animated dance with jerry mouse – the animation for which was supervised by william hanna and joseph barbera that iconic performance was enough for farber to completely reverse his previous assessment of kellys skills reviewing the film farber enthused kelly is the most exciting dancer to appear in hollywood movies22 anchors aweigh became one of the most successful films of 1945 and it garnered kelly his first and only academy award nomination for best actor in ziegfeld follies 1946 – which was produced in 1944 but not released until 1946 – kelly collaborated with fred astaire for whom he had the greatest admiration in the famous the babbitt and the bromide challenge dance routine 1946–1952 mgmedit after kelly returned to hollywood in 1946 mgm had nothing planned and used him in a routine blackandwhite movie living in a big way the film was considered so weak that the studio asked kelly to design and insert a series of dance routines and they noticed his ability to carry out such assignments this led to a lead part in his next picture with judy garland and director vincente minnelli— a musical film version of sn behrmans play the pirate with songs by cole porter in which kelly plays the lead the pirate gave full rein to kellys athleticism it is also notable for kellys work with the nicholas brothers – the leading black dancers of their day – in a virtuoso dance routine now regarded as a classic the film was ahead of its time but flopped at the boxoffice leslie caron and kelly in the trailer for an american in paris 1951 mgm wanted kelly to return to safer and more commercial vehicles but he ceaselessly fought for an opportunity to direct his own musical film in the interim he capitalized on his swashbuckling image as dartagnan in the three musketeers—and also appeared with veraellen in the slaughter on tenth avenue ballet in words and music 1948 he was due to play the male lead opposite garland in easter parade 1948 but broke his ankle playing volleyball he withdrew from the film and convinced fred astaire to come out of retirement to replace him23 there followed take me out to the ball game 1949 his second film with sinatra where kelly paid tribute to his irish heritage in the hat my father wore on st patricks day routine this musical film persuaded arthur freed to have kelly make on the town in which he partnered with frank sinatra for the third and final time a breakthrough in the musical film genre it has been described as the most inventive and effervescent musical thus far produced in hollywood11 stanley donen brought to hollywood by kelly to be his assistant choreographer received codirector credit for on the town according to kelly when you are involved in doing choreography for film you must have expert assistants i needed one to watch my performance and one to work with the cameraman on the timingwithout such people as stanley carol haney and jeanne coyne i could never have done these things when we came to do on the town i knew it was time for stanley to get screen credit because we werent bossassistant anymore but cocreators1124 together they opened up the musical form taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations with donen taking responsibility for the staging and kelly handling the choreography kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences going so far in the day in new york routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for sinatra munshin garrett and miller14 kelly asked the studio for a straight acting role and he took the lead role in the early mafia melodrama black hand 1950 this exposé of organized crime is set in new yorks little italy during late 19th century and focuses on the black hand a group which extorts money upon threat of death in reallife incidents upon which this film is based it was the mafia not the black hand who functioned as the villain even in 1950 however hollywood had to tread gingerly whenever dealing with bigtime crime it being safer to go after a dead criminal organization than a live one there followed summer stock 1950 – garlands last musical film for mgm – in which kelly performed the celebrated you you wonderful you solo routine with a newspaper and a squeaky floorboard in his book easy the hard way joe pasternak head of one of the other musical units within mgm singled out kelly for his patience and willingness to spend as much time as necessary to enable the ailing garland to complete her part11 singin in the rain trailer donald oconnor debbie reynolds and kelly 1952 there followed in quick succession two musicals which have secured kellys reputation as a major figure in the american musical film an american in paris 1951 and – probably the most popular and admired of all film musicals – singin in the rain 1952 as codirector lead star and choreographer kelly was the central driving force johnny green head of music at mgm at the time said of him gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when youre working with him hes a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work if you want to play on his team youd better like hard work too he isnt cruel but he is tough and if gene believed in something he didnt care who he was talking to whether it was louis b mayer or the gatekeeper he wasnt awed by anybody and he had a good record of getting what he wanted11 an american in paris won six academy awards including best picture and in the same year kelly received an honorary academy award for his contribution to film musicals and the art of choreography the film also marked the debut of leslie caron who kelly had spotted in paris and brought to hollywood its dream ballet sequence lasting an unprecedented seventeen minutes was the most expensive production number ever filmed at that time bosley crowther described it as whoopdedoo one of the finest ever put on the screen14 singin in the rain featured kellys celebrated and much imitated solo dance routine to the title song along with the moses supposes routine with donald oconnor and the broadway melody finale with cyd charisse though the film did not initially generate the same enthusiasm as an american in paris it subsequently overtook the earlier film to occupy its current preeminent place among critics and filmgoers alike25 1953–57 the decline of the hollywood musicaledit at the peak of his creative powers kelly made what in retrospect some see as a mistake14 in december 1951 he signed a contract with mgm that sent him to europe for nineteen months to use mgm funds frozen in europe to make three pictures while personally benefiting from tax exemptions only one of these pictures was a musical invitation to the dance a pet project of kellys to bring modern ballet to mainstream film audiences it was beset with delays and technical problems and flopped when finally released in 1956 michael kidd kelly and dan dailey in its always fair weather 1955 directed by kelly and stanley donen their last collaboration when kelly returned to hollywood in 1953 the film musical was already beginning to feel the pressures from television and mgm cut the budget for his next picture brigadoon 1954 with cyd charisse forcing him to make the film on studio back lots instead of on location in scotland this year also saw him appear as guest star with his brother fred in the celebrated i love to go swimmin with wimmen routine in deep in my heart mgms refusal to loan him out for guys and dolls and pal joey put further strains on his relationship with the studio he negotiated an exit to his contract which involved making three further pictures for mgm the first of these its always fair weather 1956 codirected with donen was a musical satire on television and advertising and includes his famous roller skate dance routine to i like myself and a dance trio with michael kidd and dan dailey that kelly used to experiment with the widescreen possibilities of cinemascope mgm had lost faith in kellys boxoffice appeal and as a result its always fair weather premiered at seventeen drivein theatres around the los angeles metroplex next followed kellys last musical film for mgm les girls 1957 in which he partnered a trio of leading ladies mitzi gaynor kay kendall and taina elg it too sold few movie tickets the third picture he completed was a coproduction between mgm and himself a cheapie bfilm the happy road set in his beloved france his first foray in a new role as producerdirectoractor after leaving mgm kelly returned to stage work 1958–1996 after mgmedit in 1958 kelly directed rodgers and hammersteins musical play flower drum song26 early in 1960 kelly an ardent francophile and fluent french speaker was invited by a m julien the general administrator of the paris opéra and opéracomique11 to select his own material and create a modern ballet for the company the first time an american had received such an assignment the result was pas de dieux based on greek mythology combined with the music of george gershwins concerto in f it was a major success and led to his being honored with the chevalier of the legion dhonneur by the french government kelly as hornbeck in inherit the wind kelly continued to make some film appearances such as hornbeck in the 1960 hollywood production of inherit the wind however most of his efforts were now concentrated on film production and directing in 1962 he directed jackie gleason in gigot in paris but the film was drastically recut by seven arts productions and flopped14 another french effort jacques demys homage to the mgm musical les demoiselles de rochefort 1967 in which kelly appeared was popular in france and nominated for academy awards for best music and score of a musical picture original or adaptation but performed poorly elsewhere he appeared as himself in george cukors lets make love 1960 he was asked to direct the film version of the sound of music which had been previously turned down by stanley donen he escorted ernest lehman out of his house saying go find someone else to direct this piece of shit27 his first foray into television was a documentary for nbcs omnibus dancing is a mans game 1958 where he assembled a group of americas greatest sportsmen – including mickey mantle sugar ray robinson and bob cousy – and reinterpreted their moves choreographically as part of his lifelong quest to remove the effeminate stereotype of the art of dance while articulating the philosophy behind his dance style14 it gained an emmy nomination for choreography and now stands as the key document explaining kellys approach to modern dance kelly appeared frequently on television shows during the 1960s including going my way which was based on the 1944 film of the same name it enjoyed great popularity in roman catholic countries outside the us14 he also appeared in three major tv specials the julie andrews show 1965 new york new york 1966 and jack and the beanstalk 1967—a show he produced and directed that again combined cartoon animation and live dance winning him an emmy award for outstanding childrens program in 1963 kelly joined universal pictures for a twoyear stint he joined 20th century fox in 1965 but had little to do—partly due to his decision to decline assignments away from los angeles for family reasons his perseverance finally paid off with the major boxoffice hit a guide for the married man 1967 where he directed walter matthau then a major opportunity arose when fox – buoyed by the returns from the sound of music 1965 – commissioned kelly to direct hello dolly 1969 again directing matthau along with barbra streisand the film was nominated for seven academy awards including best picture and won three in 1970 he made another tv special gene kelly and 50 girls and was invited to bring the show to las vegas nevada—which he did for an eightweek stint on the condition he be paid more than any artist had ever been paid there14 he directed veteran actors james stewart and henry fonda in the comedy western the cheyenne social club 1970 which performed poorly at the boxoffice in 1973 he worked again with frank sinatra as part of sinatras emmy nominated tv special magnavox presents frank sinatra then in 1974 he appeared as one of many special narrators in the surprise hit of the year thats entertainment he subsequently directed and costarred with his friend fred astaire in the sequel thats entertainment part ii 1976 it was a measure of his powers of persuasion that he managed to coax the 77yearold astaire – who had insisted that his contract rule out any dancing having long since retired—into performing a series of song and dance duets evoking a powerful nostalgia for the glory days of the american musical film in 1977 kelly starred in the poorly received action film viva knievel with the popular stuntman evel knievel kelly continued to make frequent tv appearances and in 1980 appeared in an acting and dancing role with olivia newtonjohn in xanadu 1980—an expensive theatrical flop that has since attained a cult following14 in kellys opinion the concept was marvelous but it just didnt come off11 in the same year he was invited by francis ford coppola to recruit a production staff for american zoetropes one from the heart 1982 although coppolas ambition was for him to establish a production unit to rival the freed unit at mgm the films failure put an end to this idea14 in 1985 kelly served as executive producer and cohost of thats dancing – a celebration of the history of dance in the american musical kellys final onscreen appearance was to introduce thats entertainment iii his final film project was in 1994 for the animated film cats dont dance released in 1997 and dedicated to him on which kelly acted as an uncredited choreographic consultant working methods and influence on filmed danceedit when he began his collaborative film work he was influenced by robert alton and john murray anderson striving to create moods and character insight with his dances he choreographed his own movement along with that of the ensemble with the assistance of jeanne coyne stanley donen carol haney and alex romero8 he experimented with lighting camera techniques and special effects in order to achieve true integration of dance with film and was one of the first to use split screens double images live action with animation and is credited as the person who made the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences8 there was a clear progression in his development from an early concentration on tap and musical comedy style to greater complexity using ballet and modern dance forms28 kelly himself refused to categorize his style i dont have a name for my style of dancingits certainly hybridive borrowed from the modern dance from the classical and certainly from the american folk dance – tapdancing jitterbuggingbut i have tried to develop a style which is indigenous to the environment in which i was reared28 he especially acknowledged the influence of george m cohan i have a lot of cohan in me its an irish quality a jawjutting uponthetoes cockiness – which is a good quality for a male dancer to have11 he was also heavily influenced by an africanamerican dancer robert dotson whom he saw perform at loews penn theatre around 1929 he was briefly taught by frank harrington an africanamerican tap specialist from new york29 however his main interest was in ballet which he studied under kotchetovsky in the early thirties as biographer clive hirschhorn explains as a child he used to run for miles through parks and streets and woods – anywhere just as long as he could feel the wind against his body and through his hair ballet gave him the same feeling of exhilaration and in 1933 he was convinced it was the most satisfying form of selfexpression14 he also studied spanish dancing under angel cansino rita hayworths uncle14 generally speaking he tended to use tap and other popular dance idioms to express joy and exuberance – as in the title song from singin in the rain or i got rhythm from an american in paris whereas pensive or romantic feelings were more often expressed via ballet or modern dance as in heather on the hill from brigadoon or our love is here to stay from an american in paris28 kelly in rehearsal with sugar ray robinson and assistant jeanne coyne in the nbc omnibus television special dancing is a mans game 1958 according to delamater kellys work seems to represent the fulfillment of dancefilm integration in the 1940s and 1950s while fred astaire had revolutionized the filming of dance in the 1930s by insisting on fullfigure photography of dancers while allowing only a modest degree of camera movement kelly freed up the camera making greater use of space camera movement camera angles and editing creating a partnership between dance movement and camera movement without sacrificing fullfigure framing kellys reasoning behind this was that he felt the kinetic force of live dance often evaporated when brought to film and he sought to partially overcome this by involving the camera in movement and giving the dancer a greater number of directions in which to move examples of this abound in kellys work and are well illustrated in the prehistoric man sequence from on the town and the hat my father wore on st patricks day from take me out to the ball game28 in 1951 he summed up his vision as follows if the camera is to make a contribution at all to dance this must be the focal point of its contribution the fluid background giving each spectator an undistorted and altogether similar view of dancer and background to accomplish this the camera is made fluid moving with the dancer so that the lens becomes the eye of the spectator your eye8 kellys athleticism gave his moves a distinctive broad muscular quality28 and this was a very deliberate choice on his part as he explained theres a strong link between sports and dancing and my own dancing springs from my early days as an athletei think dancing is a mans game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman11 he railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing which in his opinion tragically stigmatized the genre alienating boys from entering the field dancing does attract effeminate young men i dont object to that as long as they dont dance effeminately i just say that if a man dances effeminately he dances badly — just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass unfortunately people confuse gracefulness with softness john wayne is a graceful man and so are some of the great ball playersbut of course they dont run the risk of being called sissies11 in his view one of our problems is that so much dancing is taught by women you can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements — they are soft limp and feminine11 he acknowledged that in spite of his efforts — in tv programs such as dancing a mans game 1958 for example — the situation changed little over the years11 he also sought to break from the classconscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinemagoing public as his first wife actress and dancer betsy blair explained a sailor suit or his white socks and loafers or the tshirts on his muscular torso gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddleshe democratized the dance in movies30 in particular he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with fred astaire not least because he believed his physique didnt suit such refined elegance i used to envy his cool aristocratic style so intimate and contained fred wears top hat and tails to the manor born — i put them on and look like a truck driver11 personal lifeedit marriagesedit kelly photographed by allan warren in 1986 kelly married three times his first marriage was to the actress betsy blair in 1941 they had one child kerry b 1942 and divorced in april 195731 in 1960 kelly married his choreographic assistant jeanne coyne who had previously been married to stanley donen between 1948 and 1951 kelly and coyne had two children timothy b 1962 and bridget b 1964 and were married until coynes death in 1973 kellys third marriage was to patricia ward in 1990

us in 1947 he was part of the committee for the first amendment the hollywood delegation that flew to washington to protest at the first official hearings by the house committee on unamerican activities his first wife betsy blair was suspected of being a communist sympathizer and when united artists who had offered blair a part in marty 1955 were considering withdrawing her under pressure from the american legion kelly successfully threatened mgms influence on united artists with a pullout from its always fair weather unless his wife was restored to the part1433 he used his position on the board of directors of the writers guild of america west on a number of occasions to mediate disputes between unions and the hollywood studios he was raised as a roman catholic and he was a member of the good shepherd parish and the catholic motion picture guild in beverly hills california34 however after becoming disenchanted by the roman catholic churchs support for francisco franco against the second spanish republic during the spanish civil war35 he officially severed his ties with the church in september 1939 this separation was prompted in part by a trip kelly made to mexico in which he became convinced of the church’s failure in helping the poor35 after his departure from the catholic church kelly became an agnostic and had previously described himself as such36 he retained a lifelong passion for sports and relished competition he was known as a big fan of the pittsburgh steelers and new york yankees from the mid1940s through the early 1950s he and blair organized weekly parties at their beverly hills home and they often played an intensely competitive and physical version of charades known as the game33 his papers are currently housed at the howard gotlieb archival
