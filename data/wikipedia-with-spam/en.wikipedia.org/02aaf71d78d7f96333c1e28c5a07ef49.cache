who bought the primate from a texas research facility in the early 1980s the animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and among other factors a public perception of jackson as eccentric during the bad world tour for example jackson brought bubbles with him to japan where they both drank tea with the mayor of osaka bubbles was initially kept at the jackson familys home in encino los angeles but was moved to neverland ranch in 1988 there he slept in a crib in jacksons bedroom used the singers toilet and ate candy in the neverland movie theater by 2003 like many captive chimpanzees bubbles had matured into a large and aggressive adult chimp unsuitable as a companion animal he was sent to a california animal trainer when the trainer closed his operation in 2004 bubbles was moved to the center for great apes a sanctuary in wauchula florida where he has lived since 2005 contents 1 acquisition 2 life at neverland ranch 3 media mockery 4 late 1980s 5 relocations 6 death of michael jackson 7 legacy 8 see also 9 notes 10 references 11 bibliography 12 external links acquisitionedit bubbles was born in early 1983 in an austin texas research facility that bred primates for animal testing13 there are conflicting reports as to how he came into jacksons possession multiple reports state that jackson had bubbles bought for him when the chimpanzee was eight months old the acquisition was said to have been supervised by bob dunn then one of hollywoods most famous suppliers and trainers of animals for films photoshoots and advertisements145 life at neverland ranchedit bubbles was kept at the jackson familys encino home until 1988 when he was moved to jacksons newly acquired neverland ranch6 there bubbles slept in a crib in the singers bedroom7 ate candy in the neverland movie theater8 was fed at the dining table7 wore a diaper and relieved himself in jacksons personal toilet89 at jacksons 2005 people v jackson trial jurors learned from a videotaped interview with jackson that his several chimpanzees would help him with housekeeping chores they run around help me clean the room they help me dust clean the window jackson stated at the same trial jacksons maids testified that they were not impressed with the behavior of the chimpanzees that the singer had kept over the years one housekeeper told of how she had to clean up feces hurled at the bedroom wall another maid described a chimpanzee called max tearing off his diaper before crawling into jacksons bed9 media mockeryedit the public perception of what michael is as a human being has been highly exaggerated those articles are hard for me to relate to for instance bubbles is more fun than a lot of people i know i saw bubbles at a wedding in a tux he has great table manners quincy jones10 jacksons attachment to bubbles drew media mockery for instance the media reported that the chimpanzee would be the ringbearer at elizabeth taylors october 6 1991 neverland ranch wedding the report was not true but was according to the new york times an idea that some newspapers found too delightful not to report11 bubbles companionship was a source of comfort to jackson and formed writes journalist steve huey a public perception of jackson as a bizarre eccentric obsessed with recapturing his childhood121314 this is when the weirdness began to reach mythic proportions wrote robert thompson a professor of popular culture at syracuse university15 jackson and bubbles bond as well as jacksons other alleged eccentricities contributed to the media epithet wacko jacko a nickname jackson came to despise13 the media often focused on bubbles rather than on jacksons music and published many false stories regarding the animal such as the allegation that bubbles was not a single ape but one of several1617 a later claim suggested that bubbles had died jacksons press agent lee solters quipped to the media that when bubbles heard about his demise he went bananas like mark twain his death is grossly exaggerated and hes alive and doing well1819 another story reported in the national enquirer claimed that prince jacksons longtime rival had used extrasensory perception to turn bubbles crazy what kind of sicko would mess with a monkey jackson was reported to have asked this is the final straw poor poor bubbles jackson found the story hilarious and his staff reported that they had never seen the singer laugh so much20 late 1980sedit michael jackson had bubbles accompany him throughout the late 1980s the late 1980s were a busy period for bubbles jackson took him on outings and would often talk to him according to reports he later showed him how to moonwalk21 bubbles had an agent and was rumoured to have his own bodyguard722 he sat in for the recording of the bad album— jackson insisted that bubbles and jacksons pet snake attend as spectators—and accompanied jackson for the filming of the bad music video72324 in the short film for liberian girl bubbles made a cameo appearance25 when the bad world tour began in september 1987 he and jackson shared a twobedroom hotel suite in tokyo7 during the tour bubbles and jackson made a social visit to the mayor of osaka yasushi oshima there bubbles drank japanese green tea while seated quietly next to jackson oshima commented that he and his fellow officials were surprised to see the chimpanzee but we understand he is michaels good friend this is the first time an animal ever entered city hall2627 though allowed to travel to japan bubbles was unable to enter britain and sweden due to strict quarantine laws2829 jackson also brought bubbles for tea at elizabeth taylors house taylor did not mind the fact that jackson had brought a chimpanzee30 later at a party to celebrate and promote bad bubbles reportedly worked the room and was the life of the party7 around this time bubbles and jackson were photographed by kenny rogers for his book your friends and mine the photo shows bubbles held on jacksons hip and has been cited as one of the best taken of jacksonby whom in the black and white photograph bubbles is dressed casually in a long sleeved shirt and overalls jackson is also dressed casually he wears jeans and a simple shirt31 rogers said bubbles was so human it was almost frightening he would take christopher rogers son by the hand walk over to the refrigerator open it take out a banana and hand it to him christopher was amazed we all were31 relocationsedit neverland ranch served as the home of bubbles until he became too aggressive to live with the jackson family in a 2003 documentary living with michael jackson the singer revealed to journalist martin bashir that bubbles had become overly pugnacious32 he was removed to an animal sanctuary over fears he might attack jacksons newborn son prince michael iinb 134 jackson subsequently bought two more baby chimpanzees max and action jackson the public believed these two chimpanzees were also bubbles1 bubbles removal was a source of regret for the musician who stated that the animals could live for up to 60 years during the interview bashir was also told of how jackson had planned to hold a celebrity animal party for bubbles cheeta the chimpanzee from tarzan benji and lassie were to be invited35 bubbles was relocated to bob dunns ranch in sylmar california436 bubbles is an adult chimp and a wild animal dunn stated at the time we dont let him out to play36 according to cnn the chimpanzee would be visited by jackson and his children who also played with the other animals while at the californian ranch36 he still acts like a kid around them dunn added referring to the musician36 the washington times however claimed bubbles was not visited by jackson despite the singers representative stating beforehand that the entertainer would like to meet with the animal again37 shortly afterward in december 2003 it was claimed that bubbles had attempted suicidenb 24243 the chimpanzee was supposedly taken to a hospital in time to be saved43 since the closure of dunns facility in 2004 bubbles has been kept at the center for great apes in wauchula florida where he is said to enjoy painting and listening to flute music4 the center for apes where the annual care for each animal costs around 17000 as of 2009 also houses 41 other chimpanzees and orangutans24 patti ragan director for the center for great apes commented on the animals daily routine at the sanctuary they relax they take naps together they might go up in the top of the cupola they go out in the chutes and lie under a tree in the tunnel system they groom each other and they fight and they have arguments too4 according to animal keepers at the center the 160 pound 73 kg bubbles—whose facial features have changed since his time with jackson—is now huge and ugly but has a sweet character23 the ape now spends most of his time sitting quietly in trees with his best friend sam a 40yearold chimpanzee2 death of michael jacksonedit on june 25 2009 jackson died at the age of 50 after suffering a cardiac arrest44 news organizations reported that bubbles was not brought to the singers memorial service but instead stayed at the center for great apes2 it has not been revealed whether jackson left money to support bubbles whose care to date has been paid for from public donations3 animal trainer dunn speaking to the news of the world stated that the chimpanzee would miss jackson42 bubbles definitely missed him when they parted and will miss him now chimpanzees are intelligent they remember people and stuff bubbles and michael were close friends and playmates the last time michael visited bubbles definitely recognized and remembered himnb 342 he revealed that bubbles was thought of by the singer as his first child and added that he hoped jacksons children would keep in touch with their stepbrother following their fathers death42 in 2010 la toya visited bubbles at the center for great apes in florida46 legacyedit jackson launched michaels pets a range of soft toys based upon the animals the singer owned in november 1986 the toys consisted of a frog dog rabbit snake ostrich giraffe llama and bubbles the chimp jackson also appeared as a bear wearing sunglasses and a fedora47 he jackson was very instrumental in designing the toys said bob michaelson who was responsible for developing them47 he was very instrumental in how it should be programmed hes got tremendous intuition47 jackson in approving the toys stipulated that the manufacturers donate 1 per sale to a childrens charity48 porcelain sculpture by jeff koons in 1988 jeff koons made the three identical porcelain sculptures michael jackson and bubbles as part of his banality exhibit49 at the time each sculpture was said to be worth 25000050 koons once said of the pop star if i could be one other living person it would probably be michael jackson49 the art piece became one of koons best known works51 the figure shows jackson and the chimpanzee wearing gold militarystyle suits49 in 2001 one of the figures was put up for auction and was expected to fetch between 3 million and 4 million52 the figure sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for 56 million4953 the sale was a record for a work by koons54 two of the sculptures are housed at the broad contemporary art museum in downtown los angeles and the san francisco museum of modern art the daily telegraph reported in august 2009 that bubbles was to publish a tellall memoir about his time with michael jackson the book—entitled bubbles my secret diary from swaziland to neverland—is a spoof diary by journalist john blake55 the book fictionally documents the darker aspects of bubbles life including a 2000aday banana addiction depression romantic conquests and his vicious rivalry with tarzan star cheeta55 the collection of very personal and honest entries from bubbles diary fictitiously revealed how the chimpanzee coped with the death of jackson the publication was released in october 200955 speaking of bubbles blake stated behind his seeminglyperfect life of glamorous friends goldplated tyre swings and personal chefs there is a dark history of medical experiments addiction and loss but bubbles has fought against his personal and professional problems and with his help of manpet michael jackson he has grown to become bigger than king kong—figuratively speaking55 in 2017 an animated version of bubbles appears in michael jacksons halloween television special where he is voiced brad garrett see alsoedit primates portal michael jackson portal list of famous apes pet monkey primatology notesedit primatologist jane goodall writes that while some chimpanzees may seen cute funny and even lovable to think that they would make good pets is inaccurate she notes that at about 6 to 8 years of age the animals become strong and indocile33 reports on animal suicide can be traced back decades38 while there is no consensus on the topic and modern naturalistic studies have found little evidence of selfharming behaviour among nonhuman species it has been noted that there are strong crossspecies parallels and that traits linked with suicide in humans have been found in rodents3940 author yousheng li wrote in a 2005 book that it was doubtful that chimpanzees have the mental capacity to attempt suicide she added that some animals however may give up their lives in certain circumstances41 jane goodall notes that chimpanzees become more relaxed around individuals they recognize45 referencesedit a b c d e f g h bubbles the chimpanzee center for great apes resident center for great apes archived from the original on may 25 2013 retrieved february 19 2013  a b c
