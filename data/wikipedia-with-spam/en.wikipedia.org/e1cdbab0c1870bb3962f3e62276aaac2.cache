travels through the states of california oregon and washington serving several large cities on the us west coast including seattle portland sacramento los angeles and san diego the highways southern terminus is the mexican border and its northern terminus is the canada–us border it is currently the only continuous interstate highway to touch the us borders with both canada and mexico upon crossing the mexican border at its southern terminus interstate 5 continues to tijuana baja california as mexico federal highway 1 upon crossing the canada–us border at its northern terminus it continues to vancouver as british columbia highway 99 interstate 5 was originally created in 1956 as part of the interstate highway system but was predated by several auto trails and highways built in the early 20th century the pacific highway auto trail was built in the 1910s and 1920s by the states of california oregon and washington and was later incorporated into us route 99 us 99 in 1926 interstate 5 largely follows the route of us 99 with the exception of a portion in the central valley of california the freeway was built in segments between 1956 and 1979 including expressway

i5 intersects with interstate 210 and state route 14 near santa clarita main article interstate 5 in california the southernmost point of i5 is at the mexican border at the san ysidro border crossing one of the busiest in the world2 beginning at the border in san ysidro which is part of the city of san diego as the john j montgomery freeway i5 goes through the suburbs of chula vista and national city before reaching downtown san diego it then parallels the pacific coastline going through the northern suburbs of san diego bisecting the university of california san diego campus and passing the i805 merge where it becomes the widest interstate in the united states for a short stretch before passing through the 28 miles 45 km of marine corps base camp pendleton in northern san diego county here i5 is also known as the san diego freeway at dana point i5 turns inland and heads due north through mission viejo to the el toro y interchange in southeastern irvine i5 becomes the santa ana freeway as it runs southeast to northwest passing through major cities and suburbs in orange and southern los angeles counties southern californians refer to it as the 5 or as the santa ana freeway in the los angeles area from this point the san diego freeway continues northward as i405 when the freeway reaches the east los angeles interchange one mile 16 km east of downtown los angeles i5 becomes the golden state freeway the route continues through the san fernando valley and then crosses the newhall pass through the santa susana mountains into the santa clarita valley the interchange with state route 14 sr 14 is unusual in that truck traffic is separated into its own lanes for both the mainline of the freeway and the transition ramps to and from sr 14 for about a fourmile 64 km stretch between santa clarita valley and the pyramid lake the northbound and southbound lanes separate and cross sides with the southbound lanes running to the east of the northbound ones at that point the golden state freeway rises sharply to the north through the grapevine to eventually reach the secondhighest point of its entire length the tejon pass elevation 4183 ft or 1275 m through the tehachapi mountains path 26 power lines generally follow the freeway along this stretch the freeway then descends sharply for 12 miles 19 km at tejon pass to around 1600 feet 490 m at grapevine near the southernmost point of the san joaquin valley approximately 30 miles 48 km south of bakersfield and 4 mi 64 km south from where sr 99 splits away from it in wheeler ridge i5 south approaching weed and mt shasta from sr 99 to south of tracy i5 skirts along the far more remote western edge of the great central valley and thus here is removed from population centers such as bakersfield and fresno other state highways provide these connections i580 splits from i5 at a point south of tracy providing a looproute connection to the san francisco bay area after passing tracy i5 heads north through stockton and sacramento before turning west to woodland at woodland the interstate heads northwest again towards dunnigan where it converges with i505 from dunnigan i5 skirts north along the western edge of the sacramento valley to red bluff i5 then enters the shasta cascade region passing through redding and shasta lake before climbing up to near the foot of mount shasta the interstate then travels to weed and yreka before reaching the oregon border oregonedit main article interstate 5 in oregon in downtown portland interstate 5 runs adjacent to the willamette river and passes by the moda center and oregon convention center about three miles 48 km north of the california border the highway crosses 4310 feet 1310 m siskiyou summit the highest point on i5 and then drops down into the rogue valley through oregons southern mountains and towns such as ashland medford and grants pass turning north across three passes to the umpqua valley and through roseburg the mountains tend to turn into hills and as it reaches cottage grove the road enters the willamette river valley at eugene the highway intersects i105 a short spur route into downtown eugene some city highways intersect on i5 in the eugene metro the interstate then heads almost due north skirting albany and corvallis passing through salem and crossing through woodburn there were plans to build a spur called i305 into salem i5 covers 308 miles 496 km in oregon just north of salem between mile markers 259 and 260 just short of mile marker 260 signs in the median and on both shoulders mark the place where the 45th parallel crosses i5 it reads 45th parallel half way between the equator and the north pole the highway then tracks a little to the northeast and i205 splits off south of the portland metro area from here i5 passes through tualatin and tigard along former us route 99w us 99w before hitting the southern terminus of i405 and the marquam bridge also planned was a spur in portland off i405 called i505 but it was never built and has been removed from city plans a stub of i505 exists as a long exit ramp to us 30 after crossing the willamette river on the marquam bridge i5 has junctions at the western end of i84 and the northern end of i405 it then continues through the northern parts of the city of portland and crosses into washington via the interstate bridge interstate 5 passing through downtown seattle washingtonedit main article interstate 5 in washington the highway continues over the columbia river and drops down into the city of vancouver about seven miles 11 km into the state it reaches the northern terminus of i205 which is on the eastern edge of the portland–vancouver metropolitan area it then tracks north by northwest through woodland to kelso and longview at which point it ceases to parallel a large bend of the columbia river continuing north between the willapa hills and the cascade foothills the freeway eventually reaches olympia where it bends sharply east the highway passes though the northern end of joint base lewismcchord formerly fort lewis and mcchord air force base and tacoma where it bends sharply north again to reach seattle the ship canal bridge carries it over portage bay in seattle the freeway continues north out of the seattle–tacoma–everett metro area crosses the floodplains of three rivers through the skagit valley and the mount vernon–burlington metropolitan area to the northern city of bellingham to arrive at the peace arch canada–us border crossing between blaine washington and surrey british columbia highway 99 continues northwest from the border into vancouver bc i5 covers 277 miles 446 km in washington historyedit the shield for us route 99 a section of the 1915 ridge route in lebec california abandoned when us 99 later upgraded to i5 was constructed over the tejon pass in order to make the travel straighter and safer an extensive section of this highway over 600 miles 970 km from approximately stockton california to portland oregon follows very closely the track of the siskiyou trail3 this trail was based on an ancient network of native american footpaths connecting the pacific northwest with californias central valley by the 1820s trappers from the hudsons bay company were the first nonnative americans to use the route of todays i5 to move between todays washington state and california during the second half of the 19th century mule trains stagecoaches and the central pacific railroad also followed the route of the siskiyou trail3 by the early 20th century pioneering automobile roads were built along the path of the siskiyou trail notably the pacific highway the pacific highway ran from british columbia to san diego california and was the immediate predecessor of much of us 99 the route of us 99 was in turn used as a basis for much of the route of todays i5 a major deviation from the old us 99 route is the westside freeway portion of i5 in californias central valley to provide a faster and more direct northsouth route through the state the decision was made to build a new freeway to the west and bypass fresno bakersfield and the rest of population centers in the area instead of upgrading the existing highway which was redesignated as part of sr 994 this reroute through californias central valley was the last section of i5 to be constructed with the final segment dedicated and opened to traffic near stockton california on october 12 1979 representatives from both canada and mexico attended the dedication to commemorate the first contiguous freeway connecting the north american countries5 this direct route also bypasses san francisco and the rest of the san francisco bay area original plans called for a loop interstate with a directional suffix i5w4 this route now roughly corresponds to i580 from i5 south of tracy to oakland i80 from oakland to vacaville and i505 from vacaville to i5 near dunnigan i5w and most of the other interstates around the country with directional suffixes were eventually renumbered or eliminated nevertheless san francisco is still listed as a control city on northbound i5 between sr 99 and i580 on may 23 2013 a portion of a bridge on i5 collapsed in washington near mount vernon between seattle and the canada–us border at mile marker 2283 sending two cars into the water and requiring traffic in both directions to bypass the crossing6 the washington state department of transportation used a temporary structure to restore access across the river while a permanent bridge replacement was built that process was completed
