fair held april 21 1962 to october 21 1962 in seattle washington12 nearly 10 million people attended the fair3 unlike some other worlds fairs of its era century 21 made a profit3 as planned the exposition left behind a fairground and numerous public buildings and public works some credit it with revitalizing seattles economic and cultural life see history of seattle since 19404 the fair saw the construction of the space needle and alweg monorail as well as several sports venues washington state coliseum now keyarena and performing arts buildings the playhouse now the cornish playhouse most of which have since been replaced or heavily remodeled aerial photograph of the space needle in 2003 decorated for memorial day the site slightly expanded since the fair is now called seattle

links cold war and space race contextedit the fair was originally conceived in 1955 to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1909 alaska–yukon–pacific exposition but it soon became clear that that date was too ambitious with the space race underway and boeing having put seattle on the map5 as an aerospace city6 a major theme of the fair was to show that the united states was not really behind the soviet union in the realms of science and space as a result the themes of space science and the future completely trumped the earlier conception of a festival of the american west5 in june 1960 the bureau international des expositions bie certified century 21 as a worlds fair7 project manager ewen dingwall went to moscow to request soviet participation but was turned down neither the peoples republic of china vietnam nor north korea were invited7 as it happened the cold war had an additional effect on the fair president john f kennedy was supposed to attend the closing ceremony of the fair on october 21 1962 he bowed out pleading a heavy cold it later became public that he was dealing with the cuban missile crisis8 the fairs vision of the future displayed a technologically based optimism that did not anticipate any dramatic social change one rooted in the 1950s rather than in the cultural tides that would emerge in the 1960s affluence automation consumerism and american power would grow social equity would simply take care of itself on a rising tide of abundance the human race would master nature through technology rather than view it in terms of ecology5 in contrast 12 years later—even in far more conservative spokane washington—expo 74 took environmentalism as its central theme9 buildings and groundsedit map showing major features of the grounds once the fair idea was conceived several sites were considered among the sites considered within seattle were duwamish head in west seattle fort lawton now discovery park in the magnolia neighborhood and first hill—even closer to downtown than the site finally selected but far more densely developed two sites south of the city proper were considered—midway near des moines and the army depot in auburn—as was a site east of the city on the south shore of lake sammamish7 1960 map of what became the grounds of the century 21 exposition the site finally selected for the century 21 exposition had originally been contemplated for a civic center the idea of using it for the worlds fair came later and brought in federal money for the united states science pavilion now pacific science center and state money for the washington state coliseum later seattle center coliseum rebuilt 1993 as keyarena2101112 some of the land had been donated to the city by james osborne in 1881 and by david and louisa denny in 188913 two lots at third avenue n and john street were purchased from st demetrios greek orthodox church who had been planning to build a new church building there the church used the proceeds to purchase land in the montlake neighborhood14 the warren avenue school a public elementary school with several programs for physically handicapped students was torn down its programs dispersed and provided most of the site of the coliseum now keyarena15 near the school some of the citys oldest houses apartments and commercial buildings were torn down they had been run down to the point of being known as the warren avenue slum16 the old fire station no 4 was also sacrificed17 as early as the 1909 bogue plan this part of lower queen anne had been considered for a civic center the civic auditorium later the opera house now mccaw hall the ice arena later mercer arena and the civic field rebuilt in 1946 as the high school memorial stadium1819 all built in 1927 had been placed there based on that plan as was an armory the food circus during the fair later center house11 cover of the united states science exhibit guide for the seattle worlds fair united states department of commerce the fair planners also sought two other properties near the southwest corner of the grounds they failed completely to make any inroads with the seattle archdiocese of the roman catholic church who had recently built sacred heart church there they did a bit better with the freemasons nile temple which they were able to use for the duration of the fair and which then returned to its previous use20 it served as the site of the century 21 club this membership organization formed especially for the fair charged 250 for membership and offered lounge dining room and other club facilities as well as a gate pass for the duration of the fair the city ended up leasing the property after the fair and in 1977 bought it from the masons the building was eventually incorporated into a theater complex including the seattle childrens theatre21 paul thiry was the fairs chief architect he also designed the coliseum building among the other architects of the fair seattleborn minoru yamasaki received one of his first major commissions to build the united states science pavilion yamasaki would later design new yorks world trade center2223 victor steinbrueck and john graham jr designed the space needle hideki shimizu and kazuyuki matsushita designed the original international fountain17 despite the plan to build a permanent civic center more than half the structures built for the fair were torn down more or less immediately after it ended2 the grounds of the fair were divided into world of science world of century 21 also known as world of tomorrow10 world of commerce and industry world of art world of entertainment show street gayway boulevards of the world exhibit fair food and favors food circus source24 besides the monorail which survives as of 2017 the fair also featured a skyride that ran 1400 feet 430 m across the grounds from the gayway to the international mall the bucketlike threeperson cars were suspended from cables that rose as high as 60 feet 18 m off the ground25 the skyride was moved to the puyallup fairgrounds in 198026 world of scienceedit the federal science pavilion a virtual cathedral of science23 the world of science centered on the united states science exhibit it also included a nasa exhibit that included models and mockups of various satellites as well as the project mercury capsule that had carried alan shepard into space27 these exhibits were the federal governments major contribution to the fair611 the united states science exhibit began with charles eames 10minute short film the house of science followed by an exhibit on the development of science ranging from mathematics and astronomy to atomic science and genetics the spacearium held up to 750 people at a time for a simulated voyage first through the solar system and then through the milky way galaxy and beyond further exhibits presented the scientific method and the horizons of science this last looked at science and the individualcontrol of mans physical surroundings science and the problem of world population and mans concept of his place in an increasingly technological world27 world of century 21edit the washington state coliseum financed by the state of washington was one of thirys own architectural contributions to the fairgrounds his original conception had been staging the entire fair under a single giant airconditioned tentlike structure a city of its own but there were neither the budgets nor the tight agreements on concept to realize that vision in the end he got exactly enough of a budget to design and build a 160000 sq ft building suitable to hold a variety of exhibition spaces and equally suitable for later conversion to a sports arena and convention facility11 pavilion of electric power during the festival the building hosted several exhibits nearly half of its surface area was occupied by the states own circular exhibit century 21—the threshold and the threat also known as the world of tomorrow exhibit billed as a 21minute tour of the future the building also housed exhibits by france pan american world airways pan am general motors gm the american library association ala and rca as well as a washington state tourist center28 in the threshold and the threat visitors rode a bubbleator into the world of tomorrow music from another world and a shifting pattern of lights accompanied them on a 40second upward journey to a starry space bathed in golden light then they were faced briefly with an image of a desperate family in a fallout shelter which vanished and was replaced by a series of images reflecting the sweep of history starting with the acropolis and ending with an image of marilyn monroe28 next visitors were beckoned into a cluster of cubes containing a model of a city of the future which a few landmarks clearly indicated as seattle and its suburban and rural surroundings seen first by day and later by night the next cluster of cubes zoomed in on a vision of a hightech future home in a sylvan setting and a commuter gyrocopter a series of projections contrasted this best of the future to the worst of the present overuniform suburbs a dreary urban housing project28 gms firebird iii the exhibit continued with a vision of future transportation centered on a monorail and highspeed air cars on an electrically controlled highway there was also an office of the future a climatecontrolled farm factory an automated offshore kelp and plankton harvesting farm a vision of the schools of the future with electronic storehouses of knowledge and a vision of the many recreations that technology would free humans to pursue28 finally the tour ended with a symbolic sculptural tree and the reappearance of the family in the fallout shelter and the sound of a ticking clock a brief silence an extract from president kennedys inaugural address followed by a further symphony of music and color28 under the same roof the ala exhibited a library of the future centered on a univac computer gm exhibited its vision for highways and vehicles of the future the latter including the firebird iii pan am exhibited a giant globe that emphasized the notion that we had come to be able to think of distances between major world cities in hours and minutes rather than in terms of chancy voyages over great distances rca which produced the threshold and the threat exhibited television radio and stereo technology as well as its involvement in space the french government had an exhibit with its own take on technological progress finally a washington state tourist center provided information for fairgoers wishing to tour the state29 world of commerce and industryedit the world of commerce and industry was divided into domestic and foreign areas the former was sited mainly south of american way the continuation of thomas street through the grounds an area it shared with the world of science30 it included the space needle and what is now the broad street green and

street side of the grounds—with exhibits ranging from 32 separate furniture companies to the encyclopædia britannica33 vogue produced four fashion shows daily alongside a perfumed pool 7 the ford
