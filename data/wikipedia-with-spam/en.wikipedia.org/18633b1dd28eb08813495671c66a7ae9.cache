there they played at the fifty grand ballroom and casino ruffin continued to sing at talent shows worked with horses at a jockey club and eventually became a member of the dixie nightingales he also sang with the soul stirrers briefly after the departure of johnnie taylor4 it was in ruffins travels as a teenager that he met such later popular personalities as elvis presley little richard frankie lymon bobby womack the staple singers swan silvertones and the dixie hummingbirds4 after some of his singing idols such as sam cooke and jackie wilson had left gospel music and gone secular ruffin also turned in that direction the 16yearold ruffin met and came under the guardianship of eddie bush and his wife dorothy helen who took the teenager to detroit michigan where his brother jimmy was pursuing a career in music while simultaneously working at the ford motor company careeredit early yearsedit after moving to detroit with the bushes ruffin recorded his first released record with the songs you and i 1958 bw believe me 1958 these songs were recorded at vega records and released under the name little david bush using the last name of his guardian ruffin would later recall how he initially recorded a different kind of music strongly influenced by the smoother pop and rb of the time when he first recorded in detroit for vega7 in 1957 ruffin met berry gordy jr then a songwriter with ambitions of running his own label4 ruffin lived with gordys father a contractor and helped pops gordy do construction work on the building that would become hitsville usa the headquarters for

marvin gaye as an apprentice at anna records a chessdistributed label run by gordys sister gwen gordy fuqua and his songwriting partner billy davis47 asked about ruffin in the detroit free press in 1988 gordy fuqua said he was very much a gentleman yes maam and no maam but the thing that really impressed me about david was that he was one of the only artists ive seen who rehearsed like he was on stage5 according to ruffin both he and gaye would pack records for anna records8 ruffin created music as both the vocalist and drummer in the voice masters a doowop style combo9 and eventually started recording at anna records and recorded the song im in love bw one of these days 1961 with the voice masters a group which included future motown producer lamont dozier other group members included members of the originals ty hunter cp spencer hank dixon and voice masters and the originals founder walter gaines at one time the voice masters also included another future temptations member melvin franklin one of numerous people david would claim as a cousin4 ruffin did sign to anna records as a solo artist but his work in that time was unsuccessful9 ruffin eventually met an upandcoming local group by the name of the temptations his older brother jimmy went on a motortown revue tour with the temptations and he told david that they needed someone to sing tenor in their group david showed interest in joining the group to otis williams whom he lived very close to in detroit in january 1964 ruffin became a member of the temptations after founding member elbridge al bryant was fired from the group ruffins first recording session with the group was january 9 1964 though both david and jimmy were considered david was given the edge thanks to his performance skills these were displayed when he joined the temptations on stage during the labels new years eve party in 196310 with the temptations 19641968edit main article the temptations after joining the temptations the bespectacled ruffin initially sang backgrounds while the role of lead singer mostly alternated between eddie kendricks and paul williams he did sing a few lead parts both on stage and in the studio during his first year with the group but his leads on these studio tracks would not be released for over a year as they were not considered good enough to showcase his vocals however smokey robinson who produced and cowrote most of the temptations material at this point saw ruffin during this period as a sleeping giant in the group with a unique voice that was mellow yet gruff11 robinson thought that if he could write just the perfect song for ruffins voice then he could have a smash hit11 the song was to be something that ruffin could belt out yet something that was also melodic and sweet11 when robinson achieved his goal the song my girl was recorded in november 1964 and released a month later it became the groups first numberone single in 1965 my girl subsequently became the temptations signature song and elevated ruffin to the role of lead singer and frontman the followups to my girl were also extremely successful singles and included the ruffinled hits its growing 1965 since i lost my baby 1965 my baby 1965 aint too proud to beg 1966 beauty is only skin deep 1966 i know im losing you 1966 all i need 1967 loneliness made me realize its you that i need 1967 i wish it would rain 1967 and i could never love another after loving you 1968 ruffin also shared lead vocals on the 1967 hit single youre my everything with eddie kendricks the tall 63 ruffins passionate and dramatic performances endeared him to the temptations audiences and fans according to otis williams ruffin playfully nicknamed ruff by the group was a natural comedian and a hardworking singer when he first joined the group ruffins most notable nonvocal contribution to the temptations was the masterminding of their trademark fourheaded microphone stand12 this enabled the other members to sing and do their dances without having to crowd around one microphone while the lead singer would sing into a separate microphone david ruffin center with the temptations 1967 by 1967 however difficulties with ruffin became an issue for the group he became addicted to cocaine and began missing rehearsals and performances13 refusing to travel with the other temptations ruffin and his then girlfriend tammi terrell traveled in a custom limo with the image of his trademark black rimmed glasses painted on the door14 after the supremes had their name changed to diana ross the supremes in early 1967 ruffin felt that he should become the focal point of the temptations just as diana ross was for her group and began demanding that the group name be changed to david ruffin the temptations13 this led to a number of disagreements between ruffin and the groups de facto leader otis williams13 in addition to the groups problems with ruffins ego he began inquiring into the temptations financial records demanding an accounting of the groups money15 this caused friction between ruffin and gordy1516 in june 1968 the temptations agreed that ruffin had finally crossed the line when he missed a june 22 cleveland ohio date with the temptations in order to attend a performance by his new girlfriend barbara gail martin dean martins daughter17 ruffin was fired on june 27 and replaced with dennis edwards a former member of the contours who had been a friend of ruffin and the group as a whole beforehand17 though ruffin himself personally encouraged edwards to take his place ruffin began turning up unannounced at temptations concerts during edwards first few dates with the group17 when the group started to perform a ruffinera song such as my girl or aint too proud to beg ruffin would suddenly walk on to the stage take the microphone from edwards hands and steal the show embarrassing the group but entertaining the fans17 according to edwards the adulation and ruffins pleas convinced the other four temptations to give ruffin a second chance but when he arrived late to what was to be his return show with the group in gaithersburg maryland the temptations decided to keep edwards and drop considerations of rehiring ruffin1819 in october 1968 ruffin filed suit against motown records seeking a release from the label and an accounting of his money15 motown countersued to keep the singer from leaving the label and eventually the case was settled15 the settlement required ruffin to remain with motown to finish out his initial contract ruffin joined motown as a solo artist and always had a separate contract from the other temptations which some felt caused a lot of the infighting within the group15 solo years and personal issuesedit the album cover of ruffins solo debut lp released in 1969 ruffins first solo single was a song originally intended for the temptations my whole world ended the moment you left me the single from the album also entitled my whole world ended
