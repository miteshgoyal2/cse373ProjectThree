competition regulators v t e i like a little competition—j p morgan by art young cartoon relating to the answer j p morgan gave when asked whether he disliked competition at the pujo committee1 a monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity this contrasts with a monopsony which relates to a single entitys control of a market to purchase a good or service and with oligopoly which consists of a few sellers dominating a market2 monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service a lack of viable substitute goods and the possibility of a high monopoly price well above the sellers marginal cost that leads to a high monopoly profit3 the verb monopolise or monopolize refers to the process by which a company gains the ability to raise prices or exclude competitors in economics a monopoly is a single seller in law a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power that is the power to charge overly high prices4 although monopolies may be big businesses size is not a characteristic of a monopoly a small business may still have the power to raise prices in a small industry or market4 a monopoly is distinguished from a monopsony in which there is only one buyer of a product or service a monopoly may also have monopsony control of a sector of a market likewise a monopoly should be distinguished from a cartel a form of oligopoly in which several providers act together to coordinate services prices or sale of goods monopolies monopsonies and oligopolies are all situations in which one or a few entities have market power and therefore interact with their customers monopoly or oligopoly or suppliers monopsony in ways that distort the marketcitation needed monopolies can be established by a government form naturally or form by integration in many jurisdictions competition laws restrict monopolies holding a dominant position or a monopoly in a market is often not illegal in itself however certain categories of behavior can be considered abusive and therefore incur legal sanctions when business is dominant a governmentgranted monopoly or legal monopoly by contrast is sanctioned by the state often to provide an incentive to invest in a risky venture or enrich a domestic interest group patents copyrights and trademarks are sometimes used as examples of governmentgranted monopolies the government may also reserve the venture for itself thus forming a government monopolycitation needed contents 1 market structures 2 characteristics 3

normative aspects of economic competition and provides the basis for topics such as industrial organization and economics of regulation there are four basic types of market structures in traditional economic analysis perfect competition monopolistic competition oligopoly and monopoly a monopoly is a structure in which a single supplier produces and sells a given product if there is a single seller in a certain market and there are no close substitutes for the product then the market structure is that of a pure monopoly sometimes there are many sellers in an industry andor there exist many close substitutes for the goods being produced but nevertheless companies retain some market power this is termed monopolistic competition whereas in oligopoly the companies interact strategically in general the main results from this theory compare pricefixing methods across market structures analyze the effect of a certain structure on welfare and vary technologicaldemand assumptions in order to assess the consequences for an abstract model of society most economic textbooks follow the practice of carefully explaining the perfect competition model mainly because this helps to understand departures from it the socalled imperfect competition models the boundaries of what constitutes a market and what does not are relevant distinctions to make in economic analysis in a general equilibrium context a good is a specific concept including geographical and timerelated characteristics grapes sold during october 2009 in moscow is a different good from grapes sold during october 2009 in new york most studies of market structure relax a little their definition of a good allowing for more flexibility in the identification of substitute goods characteristicsedit profit maximizer maximizes profits price maker decides the price of the good or product to be sold but does so by determining the quantity in order to demand the price desired by the firm high barriers other sellers are unable to enter the market of the monopoly single seller in a monopoly there is one seller of the good who produces all the output5 therefore the whole market is being served by a single company and for practical purposes the company is the same as the industry price discrimination a monopolist can change the price or quantity of the product he or she sells higher quantities at a lower price in a very elastic market and sells lower quantities at a higher price in a less elastic market sources of monopoly poweredit monopolies derive their market power from barriers to entry – circumstances that prevent or greatly impede a potential competitors ability to compete in a market there are three major types of barriers to entry economic legal and deliberate6 economic barriers economic barriers include economies of scale capital requirements cost advantages and technological superiority7 economies of scale decreasing unit costs for larger volumes of production8 decreasing costs coupled with large initial costs often due to large fixed costs give monopolies an advantage over wouldbe competitors monopolies are often in a position to reduce prices below a new entrants operating costs and thereby prevent them from competing8 thus the size of the industry relative to the minimum efficient scale may limit the number of companies that can effectively compete within the industry if for example the industry is large enough to support one company of minimum efficient scale then other companies entering the industry will operate at a size that is less than mes and so cannot produce at an average cost that is competitive with the dominant company finally if longterm average cost is constantly decreasingclarification needed the least cost method to provide a good or service is by a single company9 capital requirements production processes that require large investments of capital perhaps in the form of large research and development costs or substantial sunk costs limit the number of companies in an industry10 this is an example of economies of scale technological superiority a monopoly may be better able to acquire integrate and use the best possible technology in producing its goods while entrants either do not have the expertise or are unable to meet the large fixed costs see above needed for the most efficient technology8 thus one large company can often produce goods cheaper than several small companies11 no substitute goods a monopoly sells a good for which there is no close substitute the absence of substitutes makes the demand for that good relatively inelastic enabling monopolies to extract positive profits control of natural resources a prime source of monopoly power is the control of resources such as raw materials that are critical to the production of a final good network externalities the use of a product by a person can affect the value of that product to other people this is the network effect there is a direct relationship between the proportion of people using a product and the demand for that product in other words the more people who are using a product the greater the probability that another individual will start to use the product this reflects fads fashion trends12 social networks etc it also can play a crucial role in the development or acquisition of market power the most famous current example is the market dominance of the microsoft office suite and operating system in personal computerscitation needed legal barriers legal rights can provide opportunity to monopolise the market in a good intellectual property rights including patents and copyrights give a monopolist exclusive control of the production and selling of certain goods property rights may give a company exclusive control of the materials necessary to produce a good manipulation a company wanting to monopolise a market may engage in various types of deliberate action to exclude competitors or eliminate competition such actions include collusion lobbying governmental authorities and force see anticompetitive practices in addition to barriers to entry and competition barriers to exit may be a source of market power barriers to exit are market conditions that make it difficult or expensive for a company to end its involvement with a market high liquidation costs are a primary barrier to exiting13 market exit and shutdown are sometimes separate events the decision whether to shut down or operate is not affected by exit barrierscitation needed a company will shut down if price falls below minimum average variable costs monopoly versus competitive marketsedit while monopoly and perfect competition mark the extremes of market structures14 there is some similarity the cost functions are the same15 both monopolies and perfectly competitive pc companies minimize cost and maximize profit the shutdown decisions are the same both are assumed to have perfectly competitive factors markets there are distinctions some of the more important of which are as follows marginal revenue and price in a perfectly competitive market price equals marginal cost in a monopolistic market however price is set above marginal cost16 product differentiation there is zero product differentiation in a perfectly competitive market every product is perfectly homogeneous and a perfect substitute for any other with a monopoly there is great to absolute product differentiation in the sense that there is no available substitute for a monopolized good the monopolist is the sole supplier of the good in question17 a customer either buys from the monopolizing entity on its terms or does without number of competitors pc markets are populated by an infinite number of buyers and sellers monopoly involves a single seller17 barriers to entry barriers to entry are factors and circumstances that prevent entry into market by wouldbe competitors and limit new companies from operating and expanding within the market pc markets have free entry and exit there are no barriers to entry or exit competition monopolies have relatively high barriers to entry the barriers must be strong enough to prevent or discourage any potential competitor from entering the market elasticity of demand the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change of demand caused by a one percent change of relative price a successful monopoly would have a relatively inelastic demand curve a low coefficient of elasticity is indicative of effective barriers to entry a pc company has a perfectly elastic demand curve the coefficient of elasticity for a perfectly competitive demand curve is infinitecitation needed excess profits excess or positive profits are profit more than the normal expected return on investment a pc company can make excess profits in the short term but excess profits attract competitors which can enter the market freely and decrease prices eventually reducing excess profits to zero18 a monopoly can preserve excess profits because barriers to entry prevent competitors from entering the market19 profit maximization a pc company maximizes profits by producing such that price equals marginal costs a monopoly maximises profits by producing where marginal revenue equals marginal costs20 the rules are not equivalent the demand curve for a pc company is perfectly elastic – flat the demand curve is identical to the average revenue curve and the price line since the average revenue curve is constant the marginal revenue curve is also constant and equals the demand curve average revenue is the same as price ar trq p x qq p thus the price line is also identical to the demand curve in sum d ar mr p pmax quantity price and profit if a monopolist obtains control of a formerly perfectly competitive industry the monopolist would increase prices reduce production and realise positive economic profits21 supply curve in a perfectly competitive market there is a well defined supply function with a onetoone relationship between price and quantity supplied22 in a monopolistic market no such supply relationship exists a monopolist cannot trace a short term supply curve because for a given price there is not a unique quantity supplied as pindyck and rubenfeld note a change in demand can lead to changes in prices with no change in output changes in output with no change in price or both23 monopolies produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs for a specific demand curve the supply curve would be the pricequantity combination at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost if the demand curve shifted the marginal revenue curve would shift as well and a new equilibrium and supply point would be established the locus of these points would not be a supply curve in any conventional sense2425 the most significant distinction between a pc company and a monopoly is that the monopoly has a downwardsloping demand curve rather than the perceived perfectly elastic curve of the pc company26 practically all the variations mentioned above relate to this fact if there is a downwardsloping demand curve then by necessity there is a distinct marginal revenue curve the implications of this fact are best made manifest with a linear demand curve assume that the inverse demand curve is of the form x a − by then the total revenue curve is tr ay − by2 and the marginal revenue curve is thus mr a − 2by from this several things are evident first the marginal revenue curve has the same y intercept as the inverse demand curve second the slope of the marginal revenue curve is twice that of the inverse demand curve third the x intercept of the marginal revenue curve is half that of the inverse demand curve what is not quite so evident is that the marginal revenue curve is below the inverse demand curve at all points26 since all companies maximise profits by equating mr and mc it must be the case that at the profitmaximizing quantity mr and mc are less than price which further implies that a monopoly produces less quantity at a higher price than if the market were perfectly competitive the fact that a monopoly has a downwardsloping demand curve means that the relationship between total revenue and output for a monopoly is much different than that of competitive companies27 total revenue equals price times quantity a competitive company has a perfectly elastic demand curve meaning that total revenue is proportional to output27 thus the total revenue curve for a competitive company is a ray with a slope equal to the market price27 a competitive company can sell all the output it desires at the market price for a monopoly to increase sales it must reduce price thus the total revenue curve for a monopoly is a parabola that begins at the origin and reaches a maximum value then continuously decreases until total revenue is again zero28 total revenue has its maximum value when the slope of the total revenue function is zero the slope of the total revenue function is marginal revenue so the revenue maximizing quantity and price occur when mr 0 for example assume that the monopoly’s demand function is p 50 − 2q the total revenue function would be tr 50q − 2q2 and marginal revenue would be 50 − 4q setting marginal revenue equal to zero we have 50 − 4 q 0 displaystyle 504q0 − 4 q − 50 displaystyle 4q50 q 125 displaystyle q125 so the revenue maximizing quantity for the monopoly is 125 units and the revenue maximizing price is 25 a company with a monopoly does not experience price pressure from competitors although it may experience pricing pressure from potential competition if a company increases prices too much then others may enter the market if they are able to provide the same good or a substitute at a lesser price29 the idea that monopolies in markets with easy entry need not be regulated against is known as the revolution in monopoly theory30 a monopolist can extract only one premiumclarification needed and getting into complementary markets does not pay that is the total profits a monopolist could earn if it sought to leverage its monopoly in one market by monopolizing a complementary market are equal to the extra profits it could earn anyway by charging more for the monopoly product itself however the one monopoly profit theorem is not true if customers in the monopoly good are stranded or poorly informed or if the tied good has high fixed costs a pure monopoly has the same economic rationality of perfectly competitive companies ie to optimise a profit function given some constraints by the assumptions of increasing marginal costs exogenous inputs prices and control concentrated on a single agent or entrepreneur the optimal decision is to equate the marginal cost and marginal revenue of production nonetheless a pure monopoly can – unlike a competitive company – alter the market price for its own convenience a decrease of production results in a higher price in the economics jargon it is said that pure monopolies have a downwardsloping demand an important consequence of such behaviour is worth noticing typically a monopoly selects a higher price and lesser quantity of output than a pricetaking company again less is available at a higher price31 the inverse elasticity ruleedit a monopoly chooses that price that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost the basic markup rule as measured by the lerner index can be expressed as p − m c p − 1 e d displaystyle frac pmcpfrac 1ed where e d displaystyle ed is the price elasticity of demand the firm faces32 the markup rules indicate that the ratio between profit margin and the price is inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand32 the implication of the rule is that the more elastic the demand for the product the less pricing power the monopoly has market poweredit market power is the ability to increase the products price above marginal cost without losing all customers33 perfectly competitive pc companies have zero market power when it comes to setting prices all companies of a pc market are price takers the price is set by the interaction of demand and supply at the market or aggregate level individual companies simply take the price determined by the market and produce that quantity of output that maximizes the companys profits if a pc company attempted to increase prices above the market level all its customers would abandon the company and purchase at the market price from other companies a monopoly has considerable although not unlimited market power a monopoly has the power to set prices or quantities although not both34 a monopoly is a price maker35 the monopoly is the market36 and prices are set by the monopolist based on their circumstances and not the interaction of demand and supply the two primary factors determining monopoly market power are the companys demand curve and its cost structure37 market power is the ability to affect the terms and conditions of exchange so that the price of a product is set by a single company price is not imposed by the market as in perfect competition3839 although a monopolys market power is great it is still limited by the demand side of the market a monopoly has a negatively sloped demand curve not a perfectly inelastic curve consequently any price increase will result in the loss of some customers price discriminationedit price discrimination allows a monopolist to increase its profit by charging higher prices for identical goods to those who are willing or able to pay more for example most economic textbooks cost more in the united states than in developing countries like ethiopia in this case the publisher is using its governmentgranted copyright monopoly to price discriminate between the generally wealthier american economics students and the generally poorer ethiopian economics students similarly most patented medications cost more in the us than in other countries with a presumed poorer customer base typically a high general price is listed and various market segments get varying discounts this is an example of framing to make the process of charging some people higher prices more socially acceptablecitation needed perfect price discrimination would allow the monopolist to charge each customer the exact maximum amount he would be willing to pay this would allow the monopolist to extract all the consumer surplus of the market while such perfect price discrimination is a theoretical construct advances in information technology and micromarketing may bring it closer to the realm of possibility it is very important to realize that partial price discrimination can cause some customers who are inappropriately pooled with high price customers to be excluded from the market for example a poor student in the us might be excluded from purchasing an economics textbook at the us price which the student may have been able to purchase at the ethiopian price similarly a wealthy student in ethiopia may be able to or willing to buy at the us price though naturally would hide such a fact from the monopolist so as to pay the reduced third world price these are deadweight losses and decrease a monopolists profits as such monopolists have substantial economic interest in improving their market information and market segmentingcitation needed there is important information for one to remember when considering the monopoly model diagram and its associated conclusions displayed here the result that monopoly prices are higher and production output lesser than a competitive company follow from a requirement that the monopoly not charge different prices for different customers that is the monopoly is restricted from engaging in price discrimination this is termed first degree price discrimination such that all customers are charged the same amount if the monopoly were permitted to charge individualised prices this is termed third degree price discrimination the quantity produced and the price charged to the marginal customer would be identical to that of a competitive company thus eliminating the deadweight loss however all gains from trade social welfare would accrue to the monopolist and none to the consumer in essence every consumer would be indifferent between 1 going completely without the product or service and 2 being able to purchase it from the monopolistcitation needed as long as the price elasticity of demand for most customers is less than one in absolute value it is advantageous for a company to increase its prices it receives more money for fewer goods with a price increase price elasticity tends to increase and in the optimum case above it will be greater than one for most customerscitation needed a company maximizes profit by selling where marginal revenue equals marginal cost a company that does not engage in price discrimination will charge the profit maximizing price p to all its customers in such circumstances there are customers who would be willing to pay a higher price than p and those who will not pay p but would buy at a lower price a price discrimination strategy is to charge less price sensitive buyers a higher price and the more price sensitive buyers a lower price40 thus additional revenue is generated from two sources the basic problem is to identify customers by their willingness to pay the purpose of price discrimination is to transfer consumer surplus to the producer41 consumer surplus is the difference between the value of a good to a consumer and the price the consumer must pay in the market to purchase it42 price discrimination is not limited to monopolies market power is a company’s ability to increase prices without losing all its customers any company that has market power can engage in price discrimination perfect competition is the only market form in which price discrimination would be impossible a perfectly competitive company has a perfectly elastic demand curve and has zero market power41434445 there are three forms of price discrimination first degree price discrimination charges each consumer the maximum price the consumer is willing to pay second degree price discrimination involves quantity discounts third degree price discrimination involves grouping consumers according to willingness to pay as measured by their price elasticities of demand and charging each group a different price third degree price discrimination is the most prevalent typecitation needed there are three conditions that must be present for a company to engage in successful price discrimination first the company must have market power46 second the company must be able to sort customers according to their willingness to pay for the good47 third the firm must be able to prevent resell a company must have some degree of market power to practice price discrimination without market power a company cannot charge more than the market price48 any market structure characterized by a downward sloping demand curve has market power – monopoly monopolistic competition and oligopoly46 the only market structure that has no market power is perfect competition48 a company wishing to practice price discrimination must be able to prevent middlemen or brokers from acquiring the consumer surplus for themselves the company accomplishes this by preventing or limiting resale many methods are used to prevent resale for example persons are required to show photographic identification and a boarding pass before boarding an airplane most travelers assume that this practice is strictly a matter of security however a primary purpose in requesting photographic identification is to confirm that the ticket purchaser is the person about to board the airplane and not someone who has repurchased the ticket from a discount buyercitation needed the inability to prevent resale is the largest obstacle to successful price discrimination43 companies have however developed numerous methods to prevent resale for example universities require that students show identification before entering sporting events governments may make it illegal to resale tickets or products in boston red sox baseball tickets can only be resold legally to the team the three basic forms of price discrimination are first second and third degree price discrimination in first degree price discrimination the company charges the maximum price each customer is willing to pay the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a unit of the good is the reservation price thus for each unit the seller tries to set the price equal to the consumer’s reservation price49 direct information about a consumer’s willingness to pay is rarely available sellers tend to rely on secondary information such as where a person lives postal codes for example catalog retailers can use mail highpriced catalogs to highincome postal codes5051 first degree price discrimination most frequently occurs in regard to professional services or in transactions involving direct buyerseller negotiations for example an accountant who has prepared a consumers tax return has information that can be used to charge customers based on an estimate of their ability to pay52 in second degree price discrimination or quantity discrimination customers are charged different prices based on how much they buy there is a single price schedule for all consumers but the prices vary depending on the quantity of the good bought53 the theory of second degree price discrimination is a consumer is willing to buy only a certain quantity of a good at a given price companies know that consumer’s willingness to buy decreases as more units are purchasedcitation needed the task for the seller is to identify these price points and to reduce the price once one is reached in the hope that a reduced price will trigger additional purchases from the consumer for example sell in unit blocks rather than individual units in third degree price discrimination or multimarket price discrimination54 the seller divides the consumers into different groups according to their willingness to pay as measured by their price elasticity of demand each group of consumers effectively becomes a separate market with its own demand curve and marginal revenue curve44 the firm then attempts to maximize profits in each segment by equating mr and mc465556 generally the company charges a higher price to the group with a more price inelastic demand and a relatively lesser price to the group with a more elastic demand57 examples of third degree price discrimination abound airlines charge higher prices to business travelers than to vacation travelers the reasoning is that the demand curve for a vacation traveler is relatively elastic while the demand curve for a business traveler is relatively inelastic any determinant of price elasticity of demand can be used to segment markets for example seniors have a more elastic demand for movies than do young adults because they generally have more free time thus theaters will offer discount tickets to seniors58 exampleedit assume that by a uniform pricing system the monopolist would sell five units at a price of 10 per unit assume that his marginal cost is 5 per unit total revenue would be 50 total costs would be 25 and profits would be 25 if the monopolist practiced price discrimination he would sell the first unit for 50 the second unit for 40 and so on total revenue would be 150 his total cost would be 25 and his profit would be 1250059 several things are worth noting the monopolist acquires all the consumer surplus and eliminates practically all the deadweight loss because he is willing to sell to anyone who is willing to pay at least the marginal cost59 thus the price discrimination promotes efficiency secondly by the pricing scheme price average revenue and equals marginal revenue that is the monopolist behaving like a perfectly competitive company60 thirdly the discriminating monopolist produces a larger quantity than the monopolist operating by a uniform pricing scheme61 qd price 1 50 2 40 3 30 4 20 5 10 classifying customersedit successful price discrimination requires that companies separate consumers according to their willingness to buy determining a customers willingness to buy a good is difficult asking consumers directly is fruitless consumers dont know and to the extent they do they are reluctant to share that information with marketers the two main methods for determining willingness to buy are observation of personal characteristics and consumer actions as noted information about where a person lives postal codes how the person dresses what kind of car he or she drives occupation and income and spending patterns can be helpful in classifyingcitation needed monopoly and efficiencyedit this section does not cite any

surpluses and deadweight loss created by monopoly price setting the price of monopoly is upon every occasion the highest which can be got the natural price or the price of free competition on the contrary is the lowest which can be taken not upon every occasion indeed but for any considerable time together the one is upon every occasion the highest which can be squeezed out of the buyers or which it is supposed they will consent to give the other is the lowest which the sellers can commonly afford to take and at the same time continue their business6256 monopoly besides is a great enemy to good management62127 – adam smith 1776 the wealth of nations according to the standard model in which a monopolist sets a single price for all consumers the monopolist will sell a lesser quantity of goods at a higher price than would companies by perfect competition because the monopolist ultimately forgoes transactions with consumers who value the product or service more than its price monopoly pricing creates a deadweight loss referring to potential gains that went neither to the monopolist nor to consumers given the presence of this deadweight loss the combined surplus or wealth for the monopolist and consumers is necessarily less than the total surplus obtained by consumers by perfect competition where efficiency is defined by the total gains from trade the monopoly setting is less efficient than perfect competition63 it is often argued that monopolies tend to become less efficient and less innovative over time becoming complacent because they do not have to be efficient or innovative to compete in the marketplace sometimes this very loss of psychological efficiency can increase a potential competitors value enough to overcome market entry barriers or provide incentive for research and investment into new alternatives the theory of contestable markets argues that in some circumstances private monopolies are forced to behave as if there were competition because of the risk of losing their monopoly to new entrants this is likely to happen when a markets barriers to entry are low it might also be because of the availability in the longer term of substitutes in other markets for example a canal monopoly while worth a great deal during the late 18th century united kingdom was worth much less during the late 19th century because of the introduction of railways as a substitutecitation needed natural monopolyedit main article natural monopoly a natural monopoly is an organization that experiences increasing returns to scale over the relevant range of output and relatively high fixed costs64 a natural monopoly occurs where the average cost of production declines throughout the relevant range of product demand the relevant range of product demand is where the average cost curve is below the demand curve65 when this situation occurs it is always cheaper for one large company to supply the market than multiple smaller companies in fact absent government intervention in such markets will naturally evolve into a monopoly an early market entrant that takes advantage of the cost structure and can expand rapidly can exclude smaller companies from entering and can drive or buy out other companies a natural monopoly suffers from the same inefficiencies as any other monopoly left to its own devices a profitseeking natural monopoly will produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs regulation of natural monopolies is problematiccitation needed fragmenting such monopolies is by definition inefficient the most frequently used methods dealing with natural monopolies are government regulations and public ownership government regulation generally consists of regulatory commissions charged with the principal duty of setting prices66 to reduce prices and increase output regulators often use average cost pricing by average cost pricing the price and quantity are determined by the intersection of the average cost curve and the demand curve67 this pricing scheme eliminates any positive economic profits since price equals average cost averagecost pricing is not perfect regulators must estimate average costs companies have a reduced incentive to lower costs regulation of this type has not been limited to natural monopolies67 averagecost pricing does also have some disadvantages by setting price equal to the intersection of the demand curve and the average total cost curve the firms output is allocatively inefficient as the price is less than the marginal cost which is the output quantity for a perfectly competitive and allocatively efficient market governmentgranted monopolyedit main article governmentgranted monopoly a governmentgranted monopoly also called a de jure monopoly is a form of coercive monopoly by which a government grants exclusive privilege to a private individual or company to be the sole provider of a commodity potential competitors are excluded from the market by law regulation or other mechanisms of government enforcementcitation needed samuel insull a britishborn american electrical industry business magnate invented regulated monopoly this came from a combination of his business persona and his political one on the one hand he abhorred the waste of competing power producers whose inefficiency would often double the cost of production on the other hand he believed in the citizens right to fair treatment so while he bought up rival companies and created a monopoly he kept his prices low and campaigned vigorously for regulation68 monopolist shutdown ruleedit a monopolist should shut down when price is less than average variable cost for every output level69 – in other words where the demand curve is entirely below the average variable cost curve69 under these circumstances at the profit maximum level of output mr mc average revenue would be less than average variable costs and the monopolists would be better off shutting down in the short term69 breaking up monopoliesedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and

see antitrust law and trust busting public utilities often being naturally efficient with only one operator and therefore less susceptible to efficient breakup are often strongly regulated or publicly owned american telephone telegraph att and standard oil are debatable examples of the breakup of a private monopoly by government when att a monopoly previously protected by force of law was broken up

very high market share does not always mean consumers are paying excessive prices since the threat of new entrants to the market can restrain a highmarketshare companys price increases competition law does not make merely having a monopoly illegal but rather abusing the power a monopoly may confer for instance through exclusionary practices ie pricing high just because you are the only one around it may also be noted that it is illegal to try to obtain a monopoly by practices of buying out the competition or equal practices if one occurs naturally such as a competitor going out of business or lack of competition it is not illegal until such time as the monopoly holder abuses the power first it is necessary to determine whether a company is dominant or whether it behaves to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors customers and ultimately of its consumer70 as with collusive conduct market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the company and product in question is sold the herfindahlhirschman index hhi is sometimes used to assess how competitive an industry is71 in the us the merger guidelines state that a postmerger hhi below 1000 is viewed as unconcentrated while hhis above that will provoke further review72 by european union law very large market shares raise a presumption that a company is dominant73 which may be rebuttable74 if a company has a dominant position then there is a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market75 the lowest yet market share of a company considered dominant in the eu was 39776 certain categories of abusive conduct are usually prohibited by a countrys legislation77 the main recognised categories are limiting supply predatory pricing or undercutting price discrimination refusal to deal and exclusive dealing tying commerce and product bundling despite wide agreement that the above constitute abusive practices there is some debate about whether there needs to be a causal connection between the dominant position of a company and its actual abusive conduct furthermore there has been some consideration of what happens when a company merely attempts to abuse its dominant position historical monopoliesedit originedit the term monopoly first appears in aristotles politics aristotle describes thales of miletuss cornering of

permanently abolished until 194581 coaledit robin gollan argues in the coalminers of new south wales that anticompetitive practices developed in the coal industry of australias newcastle as a result of the business cycle the monopoly was generated by formal meetings of the local management of coal companies agreeing to fix a minimum price for sale at dock this collusion was known as the vend the vend ended and was reformed repeatedly during the late 19th century ending by recession in the business cycle the vend was able to maintain its monopoly due to trade union assistance and material advantages primarily coal geography during the early 20th century as a result of comparable monopolistic practices in the australian coastal shipping business the vend developed as an informal and illegal collusion between the steamship owners and the coal industry eventually resulting in the high court case adelaide steamship co ltd v r ag82 petroleumedit standard oil was an american oil

failed diamondsedit de beers settled charges of price fixing in the diamond trade in the 2000s de beers is well known for its monopoloid practices throughout the 20th century whereby it used its dominant position to manipulate the international diamond market the company used several methods to exercise this control over the market firstly it convinced independent producers to join its single channel monopoly it flooded the market with diamonds similar to those of producers who refused to join the cartel and lastly it purchased and stockpiled diamonds produced by other manufacturers in order to control prices through limiting supply in 2000 the de beers business model changed due to factors such as the decision by producers in russia canada and australia to distribute diamonds outside the de beers channel as well as rising awareness of blood diamonds that forced de beers to avoid the risk of bad publicity by limiting sales to its own mined products de beers market share by value fell from as high as 90 in the 1980s to less than 40 in 2012 having resulted in a more fragmented diamond market with more transparency and greater liquidity in november 2011 the oppenheimer family announced its intention to sell the entirety of its 40 stake in de beers to anglo american plc thereby increasing anglo americans ownership of the company to 8530 the transaction was worth £32 billion 51 billion in cash and ended the oppenheimer dynastys 80year ownership of de beers utilitiesedit a public utility or simply utility is an organization or company that maintains the

because of its systemic bias in particular there may be a strong bias in favor of capitalism please see the discussion on the talk page please do not remove this message until the issue is resolved june 2017 according to professor milton friedman laws against monopolies cause more harm than good but unnecessary monopolies should be countered by removing tariffs and other regulation that upholds monopolies a monopoly can seldom be established within a country without overt and covert government assistance in the form of a tariff or some other device it is close to impossible to do so on a world scale the de beers diamond monopoly is the only one we know of that appears to have succeeded and even de beers are protected by various laws against so called illicit diamond trade – in a world of free trade international cartels would disappear even more quickly — milton friedman free to choose p 53–54 however professor steve h hanke believes that although private monopolies are more efficient than public ones often by a factor of two sometimes private natural monopolies such as local water distribution should be regulated not prohibited by eg price auctions98 thomas dilorenzo

that the company must charge a different price for each successive unit sold varian 1992 p 242 perloff 2009 p 396 because mc is the same in each market segment the profit maximizing condition becomes
