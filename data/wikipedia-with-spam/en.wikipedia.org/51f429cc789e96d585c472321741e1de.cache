once feulner became president he changed the direction of the heritage foundation he wanted to run a business not a research center made up of academics that would publish studies and hope that they would one day be read he wanted heritage to be aggressive and expected progress from its analysts and their results by creating easily accessed concise studies feulner brought a new focus to the marketing of the heritage foundation and would transform the foundation from a small policy think tank into a booming enterprise of conservative ideals eventually creating the think tank the new york times calls the parthenon of the conservative metropolis8 this new marketing strategy was called the briefcase test a concept which revolutionized the abilities of think tanks and their influence on public policy it was essentially the ability to create easily accessed timely concise research that was able to fit in a briefcase not only was the briefcase test essential to heritages popularity but heritage also promoted publishing policy reports and papers before legislation concerning those policies had been passed through congress the practice was unusual for washington think tanks in the 1970s who usually published such research after legislation had been passed and brought national attention to the heritage foundation as feulner related to the washington examiner it doesnt do us any good to have great ideas if we are not out there peddling our products6 since the 1970s the heritage foundation has been a beacon of liberal hope heritages political success has inspired many liberals

foundation had fierce allies in the newspapers and cable programs the heritage foundations influence is politically broad and well viewed much more so than liberal programs within a year and a half of

conservative ideas mainstream and equally credible9 when asked to identify heritages most important achievement the best way to put more money in peoples wallets is to leave it there in the first place the basic questions which i as a college student of draftable age will ask the women marchers for peace the ban the bombers and the other assorted groups of pacifists are can we as citizens of the leading country of the free world be satisfied with peace with the communists professing the intention of world conquest shouldnt our goal also be one of world conquest but world conquest for the free enterprise republican form of government which enables an individual to express his talents freely and advance on his own merits isnt it about time that we admit we are in a war and that given the nature and avowed purpose of the enemy peaceful coexistence is impossible and that we must either conquer or be conquered21 student at regis university bibliographyedit looking back heritage
