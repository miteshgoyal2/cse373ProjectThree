seattle storm are champions again i guess now i can be honest bird said losing in the first round has been terrible its something i took personally and something a lot of us took personally i judge myself by winning so to not win in five years really really hurt the storm made up for the long gap between titles by dominating the 2010 season seattle was 286 during the regular season tying the league record for wins before sweeping each of its three postseason series bird and jackson are the only players remaining from the storms 2004 title team i think the roads have been completely different said jackson of the two championships after the last six years it definitely has taken a long time to get here jackson who had 26 points in each of the storms first two wins in the series had 15 points and nine rebounds and was selected mvp of the finals swin cash scored 18 points to lead a balanced offense as seattle overcame 35 points by atlantas angel mccoughtry the dream star who

little who made two free throws to give seattle an 8784 lead mccoughtry missed a 3pointer but the rebound went to atlanta before coco miller also missed a lastsecond 3 i think we have grown up quite a bit this season said atlanta coach marynell meadors maybe another minute on the clock might have made a difference in the outcome of this game and the same thing with the two games in seattle
