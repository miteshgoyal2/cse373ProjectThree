struggled to come up with material for the group as a result the jackson 5 fell into a period from 1973 to 1974 where they scored no top 10 singles by this point most of the jackson 5s members and their managerfather joseph jackson were vocally complaining about the groups direction with michael jackson becoming the most outspoken the only member not to complain about motowns handling of the act was jermaine jackson who would marry motown head berry gordys daughter hazel three months after the release of the album git get it together would go on to sell over two million copies worldwide4

the original version of mama i got a brand new thing dont say no which appears here in a 7minute long version with all of the jacksons singing5 the sequence of songs was also carefully arranged for

year prior the title track get it together was a modest pop hit for the group reaching no 28 while the albumclosing dancing machine became a smash pop hit reaching no 2 on the pop chart and briefly restoring the jackson 5 back to their former success get it together was also the first jackson 5 album to feature all five jackson brothers sharing lead vocals giving the album a more group unified aura marlon in particular is prominently featured on mama i got a brand new thing and jackie and tito lead the brothers through hum along and dance in addition the album did not feature production or
