record labels such as motown atlantic and stax were influential during the civil rights movement soul also became popular around the world directly influencing rock music and the music of africa1 according to the rock and roll hall of fame soul is music that arose out of the black experience in america through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm blues into a form of funky secular testifying2 catchy rhythms stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves are an important feature of soul music other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound the style also occasionally uses improvisational additions twirls and auxiliary sounds3 soul music reflected the africanamerican identity and it stressed the importance of an africanamerican culture the newfound africanamerican consciousness led to new styles of music which boasted pride in being black4 soul music dominated the us rb chart in the 1960s and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the us britain and elsewhere by 1968 the soul music genre had begun to splinter some soul artists developed funk music while other singers and groups developed slicker more sophisticated and in some cases more politically conscious varieties5 by the early 1970s soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres leading to psychedelic soul the united states saw the development of neo soul around 1994 there are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music the key subgenres of soul include the detroit motown

nujazz and soulinfluenced electronica 6 see also 7 references 8 bibliography 9 further reading originsedit james brown was known as the godfather of soul6 soul music has its roots in traditional africanamerican gospel music and rhythm and blues and the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles in both lyrical content and instrumentation that began to occur in the 1950s the term soul had been used among africanamerican musicians to emphasize the feeling of being an africanamerican in the united states7 according to musicologist barry hansen8 though this hybrid produced a clutch of hits in the rb market in the early 1950s only the most adventurous white fans felt its impact at the time the rest had to wait for the coming of soul music in the 1960s to feel the rush of rock and roll sung gospelstyle according to another source soul music was the result of the urbanization and commercialization of rhythm and blues in the 60s9 the phrase soul music itself referring to gospelstyle music with secular lyrics is first attested in 196110 the term soul in africanamerican parlance has connotations of africanamerican pride and culture gospel groups in the 1940s and 1950s occasionally used the term as part of their name the jazz style that derived from gospel came to be called soul jazz as singers and arrangers began using techniques from gospel and soul jazz in africanamerican popular music during the 1960s soul music gradually functioned as an umbrella term for the africanamerican popular music at the time1112 important innovators whose recordings in the 1950s contributed to the emergence of soul music included clyde mcphatter hank ballard and etta james8 ray charles is often cited as popularizing the soul genre with his string of hits starting with 1954s i got a woman13 singer bobby womack said ray was the genius he turned the world onto soul music5 charles was open in acknowledging the influence of pilgrim travelers vocalist jesse whitaker on his singing style little richard who inspired otis redding14 and james brown were equally influential brown was known as the godfather of soul6 and richard proclaimed himself the king of rockin and rollin rhythm and blues soulin because his music embodied elements of all three and because he inspired artists in all three genres15 sam cooke and jackie wilson are also often acknowledged as soul forefathers516 cooke became popular as the lead singer of gospel group the soul stirrers before controversially moving into secular music his recording of you send me in 1957 launched a successful pop career and his 1962 recording of bring it on home to me has been described as perhaps the first record to define the soul experience17 jackie wilson a contemporary of both cooke and james brown also achieved crossover success in 1957 with reet petite and was particularly influential for his dramatic delivery and performances18 1960sedit writer peter guralnick is among those to identify solomon burke as a key figure in the emergence of soul music and atlantic records as the key record label burkes early 1960s songs including cry to me just out of reach and down in the valley are considered classics of the genre guralnick wrote soul started in a sense with the 1961 success of solomon burkes just out of reach ray charles of course had already enjoyed enormous success also on atlantic as had james brown and sam cooke — primarily in a pop vein each of these singers though could be looked upon as an isolated phenomenon it was only with the coming together of burke and atlantic records that you could begin to see anything even resembling a movement19 ben e king also achieved success in 1961 with stand by me a song directly based on a gospel hymn5 by the mid1960s the initial successes of burke king and others had been surpassed by new soul singers including stax artists such as otis redding and wilson pickett who mainly recorded in memphis tennessee and muscle shoals alabama according to jon landau20 between 1962 and 1964 redding recorded a series of soul ballads characterized by unabashedly sentimental lyrics usually begging forgiveness or asking a girlfriend to come home he soon became known as mr pitiful and earned a reputation as the leading performer of soul ballads aretha franklin is widely known as the queen of soul the most important female soul singer to emerge was aretha franklin originally a gospel singer who began to make secular recordings in 1960 but whose career was later revitalised by her recordings for atlantic her 1967 recordings such as i never loved a man the way i love you respect originally sung by otis redding and do right woman do right man written by chips moman and dan penn were significant and commercially successful productions21222324 soul music dominated the us africanamerican music charts in the 1960s and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the us otis redding was a huge success at the monterey pop festival in 19675 the genre also became highly popular in the uk where many leading acts toured in the late 1960s soul became an umbrella term used to describe an increasingly wide variety of rbbased music styles — from the dance and poporiented acts at motown records in detroit such as the temptations marvin gaye and stevie wonder to deep soul performers such as percy sledge and james carr252627 different regions and cities within the us including new york city detroit chicago memphis new orleans philadelphia and muscle shoals alabama the home of fame studios and muscle shoals sound studios became noted for different subgenres of the music and recording styles928 by 1968 while at its peak of popularity soul began to fragment into disparate subgenres artists such as james brown and sly the family stone evolved into funk music while other singers such as marvin gaye stevie wonder curtis mayfield and al green developed slicker more
