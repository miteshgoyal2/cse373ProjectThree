comments saying football fans love it if some stupid fans dont understand and appreciate such a gift they can go to hell3 some fulham footballers including brede hangeland supported the clubs decision to commission the statue5 after the unveiling fulham won their game against blackpool 3–05 louisa buck contemporary art correspondent for the art newspaper described it as a spectacularly bad piece of kitsch that doesnt even look all that much like michael jackson fisun guner art critic for the arts desk website said it certainly looks as if his plasticky limbs were too stiff to coordinate properly
