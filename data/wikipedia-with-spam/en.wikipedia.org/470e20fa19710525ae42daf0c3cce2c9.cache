company back to richard simon and max schuster while leon shimkin and james jacobson acquired pocket books8 in the 1950s and 1960s many publishers including simon schuster turned toward educational publishing due to the baby boom market9 pocket books focused on paperbacks for the educational market instead of textbooks and started the washington square press imprint in 19599 by 1964 it had published over 200 titles and was expected to put out another 400 by the end of that year9 books published under the imprint included classic reprints such as lorna doone ivanhoe tom sawyer

tony schulte126 among his many bestsellers was joseph hellers catch226 corporate ownershipedit simon schuster headquarters at 1230 avenue of the americas rockefeller center new york city in 1976 gulfwestern headed by charles bluhdorn acquired ss which was grossing about us50 million a year for 11 million most of it in gulfwestern stock6 1980sedit after the death of bluhdorn in 1983 simon schuster made the decision to diversify bluhdorns successor martin davis told the new york times society was undergoing dramatic changes so that there was a greater need for textbooks maps and educational information we saw the opportunity to diversify into those areas which are more stable and more profitable than trade publishing13 in 1984 ceo richard e snyder acquired esquire corporation buying everything but the magazine for 180 million13 prentice hall was brought into the company fold in 1985 for over 700 million and martin davis said that prentice hall became the road map for remodeling the company and a catalyst for change613 this acquisition was followed by silver burdett in 198614 mapmaker gousha in 1987 and charles e simon in 198814 part of the acquisition included educational publisher allyn bacon which according to michael korda became the nucleus of sss educational and informational business6 three california educational companies were also purchased between 1988 and 1990—quercus fearon education and janus book publishers13 in 1990 simon schuster purchased computer curriculum corporation ccc which specialized in computerbased learning systems for schools in all simon schuster spent more than 1 billion in acquisitions between 1983 and 199114 gw would change its name to paramount communications in 1989 in the 1980s richard e snyder also made an unsuccessful bid toward video publishing which consequently led to their success in the audio book business snyder was dismayed to realize that simon schuster did not own the video rights to jane fondas workout book a huge bestseller at the time and that the video company producing the vhs was making more money on the video this prompted snyder to ask editors to obtain video rights for every new book agents were often reluctant to give these up—which meant the ss video division never took off according to michael korda the audio rights expanded into the audio division which by the 1990s would be a major business for simon schuster6 1990sedit in 1990 the new york times described simon schuster the largest book publishing in the united states with sales of 13 billion the previous year13 in 1994 paramount was sold to the original viacom allowing ss to launch several new imprints in conjunction with channels owned by viacoms mtv networks simon schusters first move under viacom

publisher and then owner of penguin and the financial times the professional and reference operations were sold to hicks muse tate furst15 2000sedit viacom would split into two companies at the end of
