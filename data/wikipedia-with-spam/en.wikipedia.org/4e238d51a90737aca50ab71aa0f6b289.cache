magazine commented that the song was a complicated tapestry of colliding hooks and pop references the songs lyrics too high to get over too low to get under has strong similarities to funkadelics opening salvo for one nation under a groove5 the lyrics pertain to the media and press as well as gossip and people trying to start arguments or problems for no reason which he states in the lyrics

lyrics wont keep elvis costello awake nights sic they do show that jackson has progressed past the heyletshustle sentiments that dominated off the wall6 he added that jacksons raw ability and conviction make material like citing wanna be startin somethin as well as other of thrillers songs into firstclass cuts6 stephen thomas erlewine a writer for allmusic listed wanna be startin somethin

concerts video footage of performances of the song were used in the film michael jacksons this is it in 2009 wanna be startin somethin was one of the songs released as a single without an accompanying video it nonetheless has attained a popularity rivaling its sister compositions on the album and became jackson’s song of choice for opening live concerts although not being as strictly associated with a specific dance routine as those others has arguably allowed for more flexibility in performances and staging three notable occurrences during live performances are the physically complicated stopstart dance technique that brings jackson and his dancers to a frozen stop several times the singalong between performer and audience during the bridge and him singing hard to get over hard to get under instead of too high to get over too low to get under in the studio version wanna be startin somethin along with thriller beat it and billie jean was also used on every set list of jackson’s
