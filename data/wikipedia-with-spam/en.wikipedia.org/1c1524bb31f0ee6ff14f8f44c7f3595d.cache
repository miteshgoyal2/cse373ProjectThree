manchester guardian was founded in manchester in 1821 by cotton merchant john edward taylor with backing from the little circle a group of nonconformist businessmen17 they launched their paper after the police closure of the more radical manchester observer a paper that had championed the cause of the peterloo massacre protesters18 taylor had been hostile to the radical reformers writing they have appealed not to the reason but the passions and the suffering of their abused and credulous fellowcountrymen from whose illrequited industry they extort for themselves the means of a plentiful and comfortable existence they do not toil neither do they spin but they live better than those that do19 when the government closed down the manchester observer the millowners champions had the upper hand20 the influential journalist jeremiah garnett joined taylor during the establishment of the paper and all of the little circle wrote articles for the new paper21 the prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that it would zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious liberty … warmly advocate the cause of reform … endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of political economy and … support without reference to the party from which they emanate all serviceable measures22 in 1825 the paper merged with the british volunteer and was known as the manchester guardian and british volunteer until 182823 the workingclass manchester and salford advertiser called the manchester guardian the foul prostitute and dirty parasite of the worst portion of the millowners24 the manchester guardian was generally hostile to labours claims of the 1832 ten hours bill the paper doubted whether in view of the foreign competition the passing of a law positively enacting a gradual destruction of the cotton manufacture in this kingdom would be a much less rational procedure25 the manchester guardian dismissed strikes as the work of outside agitators … if an accommodation can be effected the occupation of the agents of the union is gone they live on strife …26 the manchester guardian was highly critical of abraham lincolns conduct during the american civil war writing on the news that abraham lincoln had been assassinated of his rule we can never speak except as a series of acts abhorrent to every true notion of constitutional right and human liberty …27 c p scottedit c p scott made the newspaper nationally recognised he was editor for 57 years from 1872 and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of taylors son in 1907 under scott the papers moderate editorial line became more radical supporting william gladstone when the liberals split in 1886 and opposing the second boer war against popular opinion28 scott supported the movement for womens suffrage but was critical of any tactics by the suffragettes that involved direct action29 the really ludicrous position is that mr lloyd george is fighting to enfranchise seven million women and the militants are smashing unoffending peoples windows and breaking up benevolent societies meetings in a desperate effort to prevent him scott thought the suffragettes courage and devotion was worthy of a better cause and saner leadership30 it has been argued that scotts criticism reflected a widespread disdain at the time for those women who transgressed the gender expectations of edwardian society29 scott commissioned j m synge and his friend jack yeats to produce articles and drawings documenting the social conditions of the west of ireland prefirst world war and these pieces were published in 1911 in the collection travels in wicklow west kerry and connemara31 scotts friendship with chaim weizmann played a role in the balfour declaration of 1917 and in 1948 the manchester guardian was a supporter of the new state of israel in june 1936 ownership of the paper passed to the scott trust named after the last owner john russell scott who was the first chairman of the trust this move ensured the papers independencecitation needed spanish civil waredit traditionally affiliated with the centrist to centreleft liberal party and with a northern nonconformist circulation base the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the spanish civil war 1936–1939 george orwell writes in homage to catalonia of our larger papers the manchester guardian is the only one that leaves me with an increased respect for its honesty with the proliberal news chronicle the laboursupporting daily herald the communist partys daily worker and several sunday and weekly papers it supported the republican government against general francisco francos insurgent nationalists postwaredit the paper so loathed labours leftwing champion aneurin bevan and the hategospellers of his entourage that it called for attlees postwar labour government to be voted out of office32 the newspaper opposed the creation of the national health service as it feared the state provision of healthcare would eliminate selective elimination and lead to an increase of congenitally deformed and feckless people33 the manchester guardian strongly opposed military intervention during the 1956 suez crisis the anglofrench ultimatum to egypt is an act of folly without justification in any terms but brief expediency it pours petrol on a growing fire there is no knowing what kind of explosion will follow34 1972 to 2000edit northern ireland conflictedit when 13 civil rights demonstrators in northern ireland were killed by british soldiers on 30 january 1972 known as bloody sunday the guardian said that neither side can escape condemnation35 of the protesters they wrote the organizers of the demonstration miss bernadette devlin among them deliberately challenged the ban on marches they knew that stone throwing and sniping could not be prevented and that the ira might use the crowd as a shield35 of the army they wrote there seems little doubt that random shots were fired into the crowd that aim was taken at individuals who were neither bombers nor weapons carriers and that excessive force was used35 many irish people believed that the widgery tribunals ruling on the killings was a whitewash36 a view that was later supported with the publication of the saville inquiry in 201037 but in 1972 the guardian declared that widgerys report is not onesided 20 april 197238 at the time the paper also supported internment without trial in northern ireland internment without trial is hateful repressive and undemocratic in the existing irish situation most regrettably it is also inevitable to remove the ringleaders in the hope that the atmosphere might calm down is a step to which there is no obvious alternative39 before then the guardian had called for british troops to be sent to the region british soldiers could present a more disinterested face of law and order40 but only on condition that britain takes charge41 sarah tisdalledit in 1983 the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of cruise missiles in britain that were leaked to the guardian by civil servant sarah tisdall the paper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities which resulted in a sixmonth prison sentence for tisdall42 though she served only four i still blame myself said peter preston who was the editor of the guardian at the time but he went on to argue that the paper had no choice because it believed in the rule of law43 first gulf waredit in the leadup to the first gulf war between 1990 and 1991 the guardian expressed doubts about military action against iraq frustration in the gulf leads temptingly to the invocation of task forces and tactical bombing but the military option is no option at all the emergence yesterday of a potential hostage problem of vast dimensions only emphasised that this is far too complex a crisis for gunboat diplomacy loose talk of carpet bombing baghdad should be put back in the bottle of theoretical but unacceptable scenarios44 first gulf war plaque stafford war memorial but on the eve of the war the paper rallied to the war cause the simple cause at the end is just an evil regime in iraq instituted an evil and brutal invasion our soldiers and airmen are there at un behest to set that evil to rights their duties are clear  let the momentum and the resolution be swift45 after the event journalist maggie okane conceded that she and her colleagues had been a mouthpiece for war propaganda  we the media were harnessed like 2000 beach donkeys and led through the sand to see what the british and us military wanted us to see in this nice clean war46 alleged penetration by russian intelligenceedit in 1994 kgb defector oleg gordievsky identified guardian literary editor richard gott as an agent of influence while gott denied that he received cash he admitted he had had lunch at the soviet embassy and had taken benefits from the kgb on overseas visits gott resigned from his post47 gordievsky commented on the newspaper the kgb loved the guardian it was deemed highly susceptible to penetration48 jonathan aitkenedit in 1995 both the granada television programme world in action and the guardian were sued for libel by the then cabinet minister jonathan aitken for their allegation that harrods owner mohamed al fayed had paid for aitken and his wife to stay at the hôtel ritz in paris which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on aitkens part aitken publicly stated that he would fight with the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of british fair play49 the court case proceeded and in 1997 the guardian produced evidence that aitkens claim of his wife paying for the hotel stay was untrue50 in 1999 aitken was jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice51 kosovo waredit the paper supported natos military intervention in the kosovo war in 1998–1999 though the united nations security council did not support the action the guardian stated that the only honourable course for europe and america is to use military force52 mary kaldors piece was headlined bombs away but to save civilians we must get in some soldiers too53 since 2000edit the guardian senior news writer esther addley interviewing ecuadorian foreign minister ricardo patiño for an article relating to julian assange in 2014 in the early 2000s the guardian challenged the act of settlement 1701 and the treason felony act 18485455 in october 2004 the guardian published a humorous column by charlie brooker in its entertainment guide which appeared to call for the assassination of george w bush56 this caused some controversy and the paper was forced to issue an apology and remove the article from its website5758 following the 7 july 2005 london bombings the guardian published an article on its comment pages by dilpazier aslam a 27yearold british muslim and journalism trainee from yorkshire59 aslam was a member of hizb uttahrir an islamist group and had published a number of articles on their website according to the paper it did not know that aslam was a member of hizb uttahrir when he applied to become a trainee though several staff members were informed of this once he started at the paper60 the home office has claimed the groups ultimate aim is the establishment of an islamic state caliphate according to hizb uttahrir via nonviolent means the guardian asked aslam to resign his membership of the group and when he did not do so terminated his employment61 in early 2009 the paper started a tax investigation into a number of major uk companies62 including publishing a database of the tax paid by the ftse 100 companies63 internal documents relating to barclays banks tax avoidance were removed from the guardian website after barclays obtained a gagging order64 the paper played a pivotal role in exposing the depth of the news of the world phone hacking affair the economists intelligent life magazine opined that “ as watergate is to the washington post and thalidomide to the sunday times so phonehacking will surely be to the guardian a defining moment in its history65 ” accusations of antisemitism and bias in coverage of israeledit in recent decades the guardian has been accused of biased criticism of israeli government policy66 and of bias against the palestinians67 in december 2003 columnist julie burchill cited striking bias against the state of israel as one of the reasons she left the paper for the times68 a leaked report from the european monitoring centre on racism cited the economists claim that for many british jews the british medias reporting on israel is spiced with a tone of animosity as to smell of antisemitism  this is above all the case with the guardian and the independent the eu said the report dated february 2003 was not published because it was insubstantial in its current state and lacking sufficient evidence6970 responding to these accusations a guardian editorial in 2002 condemned antisemitism and defended the papers right to criticise the policies and actions of the israeli government arguing that those who view such criticism as inherently antijewish are mistaken71 harriet sherwood then the guardians foreign editor later its jerusalem correspondent has also denied that the guardian has an antiisrael bias saying that the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the israeli–palestinian conflict72 on 6 november 2011 chris elliott the guardians readers editor wrote that guardian reporters writers and editors must be more vigilant about the language they use when writing about jews or israel citing recent cases where the guardian received complaints regarding language chosen to describe jews or israel elliott noted that over nine months he upheld complaints regarding language in certain articles that were seen as antisemitic revising the language and footnoting this change73 the guardians style guide section referred to tel aviv as the capital of israel in 20127475 the guardian later clarified in 1980 the israeli knesset enacted a law designating the city of jerusalem including east jerusalem as the countrys capital in response the un security council issued resolution 478 censuring the change in character and status of the holy city of jerusalem and calling on all member states with diplomatic missions in the city to withdraw the un has reaffirmed this position on several occasions and almost every country now has its embassy in tel aviv while it was therefore right to issue a correction to make clear israels designation of jerusalem as its capital is not recognised by the international community we accept that it is wrong to state that tel aviv – the countrys financial and diplomatic centre – is the capital the style guide has been amended accordingly 76 on 11 august 2014 the print edition of the guardian published a proisraeli advocacy advert during the 2014 israel–gaza conflict featuring elie wiesel headed by the words jews rejected child sacrifice 3500 years ago now its hamas turn the times had decided against running the ad although it had already appeared in major american newspapers77 one week later chris elliott expressed the opinion that the newspaper should have rejected the language used in the advert and should have negotiated with the advertiser on this matter78 clark countyedit in august 2004 for the us presidential election the daily g2 supplement launched an experimental letterwriting campaign in clark county ohio an averagesized county in a swing state the editor of the g2 supplement ian katz bought a voter list from the county for 25 and asked readers to write to people listed as undecided in the election giving them an impression of the international view and the importance of voting against president george w bush the paper scrapped operation clark county on 21 october 2004 after first publishing a column of responses—nearly all of them outraged—to the campaign under the headline dear limey assholes79 some commentators suggested that the publics dislike of the campaign contributed to bushs victory in clark county80 guardian americaedit in 2007 the paper launched guardian america an attempt to capitalise on its large online readership in the united states which at the time stood at more than 59 million the company hired former american prospect editor new york magazine columnist and new york review of books writer michael tomasky to head the project and hire a staff of american reporters and web editors the site featured news from the guardian that was relevant to an american audience coverage of us news and the middle east for example81 tomasky stepped down from his position as editor of guardian america in february 2009 ceding editing and planning duties to other us and london staff he retained his position as a columnist and blogger taking the title editoratlarge82 in october 2009 the company abandoned the guardian america homepage instead directing users to a us news index page on the main guardian website83 the following month the company laid off six american employees including a reporter a multimedia producer and four web editors the move came as guardian news and media opted to reconsider its us strategy amid a huge effort to cut costs across the company84 in subsequent years however the guardian has hired various commentators on us affairs including ana marie cox michael wolff naomi wolf glenn greenwald and george w bushs former speechwriter josh treviño85 treviños first blog post was an apology for a controversial tweet posted in june 2011 over the second gaza flotilla the controversy which had been revived by the appointment86 guardian us launched in september 2011 led by editorinchief janine gibson which replaced the previous guardian america service87 after a period during which katharine viner served as the us editorinchief before taking charge of guardian news and media as a whole viners former deputy lee glendinning was appointed to succeed her as head of the american operation at the beginning of june 201588 gagged from reporting parliamentedit in october 2009 the guardian reported that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter – a question recorded in a commons order paper to be answered by a minister later that week89 the paper noted that it was being forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented—for the first time in memory—from reporting parliament legal obstacles which cannot be identified involve proceedings which cannot be mentioned on behalf of a client who must remain secret the only fact the guardian can report is that the case involves the london solicitors carterruck the paper further claimed that this case appears to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1688 bill of rights90 the only parliamentary question mentioning carterruck in the relevant period was by paul farrelly mp in reference to legal action by barclays and trafigura9192 the part of the question referencing carterruck relates to the latter companys september 2009 gagging order on the publication of a 2006 internal report93 into the 2006 côte divoire toxic waste dump scandal which involved a class action case that the company only settled in september 2009 after the guardian published some of the commodity traders internal emails94 the reporting injunction was lifted the next day as carterruck withdrew it before the guardian could challenge it in the high court95 alan rusbridger credited the rapid backdown of carterruck to twitter96 as did a bbc article97 edward snowden leaks and intervention by the uk governmentedit in june 2013 the newspaper broke news of the secret collection of verizon telephone records held by barack obamas administration13 and subsequently revealed the existence of the prism surveillance program after it was leaked to the paper by former nsa contractor edward snowden14 the newspaper was subsequently contacted by the british governments cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood under instruction from prime minister david cameron and deputy prime minister nick clegg who ordered that the hard drives containing the information be destroyed98 the guardians offices were then visited in july by agents from the uks gchq who supervised the destruction of the hard drives containing information acquired from snowden99 in june 2014 the register reported that the information the government sought to suppress by destroying the hard drives related to the location of a beyond top secret internet monitoring base in seeb oman and the close involvement of bt and cable wireless in intercepting internet communications100 julian assange criticized the newspaper for not publishing the entirety of the content when it had the chance101 ownership and financesedit the guardian is part of the guardian media group gmg of newspapers radio stations and print media including the observer sunday newspaper the guardian weekly international newspaper and new media—guardian abroad website and guardiancouk all the aforementioned were owned by the scott trust a charitable foundation existing between 1936 and 2008 which aimed to ensure the papers editorial independence in perpetuity maintaining its financial health to ensure it did not become vulnerable to take overs by forprofit media groups at the beginning of october 2008 the scott trusts assets were transferred to a new limited company the scott trust limited with the intention being that the original trust would be wound up102 dame liz forgan chair of the scott trust reassured staff that the purposes of the new company remained the same as under the previous arrangements the guardians headquarters in london the guardians ownership by the scott trust is probably a factor in its being the only british national daily to conduct since 2003 an annual social ethical and environmental audit in which it examines under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor its own behaviour as a company103 it is also the only british national daily newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman called the readers editor to handle complaints and corrections the guardian and its parent groups participate in project syndicate established by george soros and intervened in 1995 to save the mail guardian in south africa however guardian media group sold the majority of its shares of the mail guardian in 2002citation needed the guardian has been consistently lossmaking the national newspaper division of gmg which also includes the observer reported operating losses of £499m in 2006 up from £186m in 2005104 the paper was therefore heavily dependent on crosssubsidisation from profitable companies within the group the continual losses made by the national newspaper division of the guardian media group caused it to dispose of its regional media division by selling titles to competitor trinity mirror in march 2010 this included the flagship manchester evening news and severed the historic link between that paper and the guardian the sale was in order to safeguard the future of the guardian newspaper as is the intended purpose of the scott trust105 in june 2011 guardian news and media revealed increased annual losses of £33m and announced that it was looking to focus on its online edition for news coverage leaving the print edition to contain more comments and features it was also speculated that the guardian might become the first british national daily paper to be fully online106107 for the three years up to june 2012 the paper lost £100000 a day which prompted intelligent life to question whether the guardian could survive108 between 2007 and 2014 the guardian media group sold all their side businesses of regional papers and online portals for classifieds and consolidated into the guardian as sole product the sales let them acquire a capital stock of £8383m as of july 2014 supposed to guarantee the independence of the guardian in perpetuity in the first year the paper made more losses than predicted and in january 2016 the publishers announced that the guardian will cut 20 per cent of staff and costs within the next three years109 membership subscription schemeedit in 2014 the guardian launched a membership scheme110 the scheme aims to reduce the financial losses incurred by the guardian without introducing a paywall thus maintaining open access to the website website readers can pay a monthly subscription with three tiers available111 political stance and editorial opinionedit founded by textile traders and merchants the guardian had a reputation as an organ of the middle class112 or in the words of c p scotts son ted a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last113 associated at first with the little circle and hence with classical liberalism as expressed by the whigs and later by the liberal party its political orientation underwent a decisive change after world war ii leading to a gradual alignment with labour and the political left in general the scott trust describes one of its core purposes to be to secure the financial and editorial independence of the guardian in perpetuity as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation remaining faithful to its liberal tradition114115 the papers readership is generally on the mainstream left of british political opinion a mori poll taken between april and june 2000 showed that 80 per cent of guardian readers were labour party voters3 according to another mori poll taken in 2005 48 per cent of guardian readers were labour voters and 34 per cent liberal democrat voters4 the newspapers reputation as a platform for liberal and leftwing opinions has led to the use of the epithets guardian reader and guardianista for people holding such views or as a negative stereotype of such people as middle class earnest and politically correct1166 although the paper is often considered to be linked inextricably to the labour party115 three of the guardians four leader writers joined the more centrist social democratic party on its foundation in 1981 the paper was enthusiastic in its support for tony blair in his successful bid to lead the labour party117 and to be elected prime minister118 on 19 january 2003 two months before the 2003 invasion of iraq the guardian reported military intervention in the middle east holds many dangers but if we want a lasting peace it may be the only option … war with iraq may yet not come but conscious of the potentially terrifying responsibility resting with the british government we find ourselves supporting the current commitment to a possible use of force119 then guardian features editor ian katz asserted in 2004 that it is no secret we are a centreleft newspaper120 in 2008 guardian columnist jackie ashley said that editorial contributors were a mix of rightofcentre libertarians greens blairites brownites labourite but less enthusiastic brownites etc and that the newspaper was clearly left of centre and vaguely progressive she also said that you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election the guardians stance will not be dictated by the editor still less any foreign proprietor it helps that there isnt one but will be the result of vigorous debate within the paper121 the papers comment and opinion pages though often written by centreleft contributors such as polly toynbee have allowed some space for rightofcentre voices such as sir max hastings and michael gove since an editorial in 2000 the guardian has favoured abolition of the british monarchy122 i write for the guardian said max hastings in 2005123 because it is read by the new establishment reflecting the papers thengrowing influence in the runup to the 2010 general election following a meeting of the editorial staff124 the paper declared its support for the liberal democrats due in particular to the partys stance on electoral reform the paper suggested tactical voting to prevent a conservative victory given britains firstpastthepost electoral system125 at the 2015 election the paper switched its support to the labour party the paper argued that britain needed a new direction and labour speaks with more urgency than its rivals on social justice standing up to predatory capitalism on investment for growth on reforming and strengthening the public realm britains place in europe and international development126 assistant editor michael white in discussing media selfcensorship in march 2011 says i have always sensed liberal middle class illease in going after stories about immigration legal or otherwise about welfare fraud or the less attractive tribal habits of the working class which is more easily ignored altogether toffs including royal ones christians especially popes governments of israel and us republicans are more straightforward targets127 in a 2013 interview for npr the guardians latin america correspondent rory carroll stated that many editors at the guardian believed and continue to believe that they should support hugo chávez because he was a standardbearer for the left128 in the 2015 labour party leadership election the guardian supported yvette cooper and was critical of leftwinger jeremy corbyn the successful candidate129 although the majority of political columnists in the guardian were against corbyn winning owen jones seumas milne and george monbiot wrote supportive articles about him130 controversyedit journalist glenn greenwald of the intercept a former contributor to the guardian has accused the guardian of falsifying the words of wikileaks founder julian assange in a report about the interview he gave to italian newspaper la repubblica greenwald wrote this article is about how those guardians false claims — fabrications really — were spread all over the internet by journalists causing hundreds of thousands of people if not millions to consume false news131 the guardian later retracted its article about assange randeep ramesh social affairs editors of the guardian has expressed his support for controversial charity cage a support organisation for people investigated due to terrorist connections132 after publishing a story on 13 january 2017 claiming that whatsapp had a backdoor that allows snooping on messages more than 70 professional cryptographers signed on to an open letter calling for the guardian to retract the article security researchers also criticized the story including moxie marlinspike who called it false133134135 the article and the followup articles affirming the guardians position remain on the site largely unchanged136 circulation and formatedit the guardian had a certified average daily circulation of 204222 copies in december 2012 — a drop of 1125 per cent on january 2012 — as compared to sales of 547465 for the daily telegraph 396041 for the times and 78082 for the independent137 in march 2013 its average daily circulation had fallen to 193586 according

guardian was a weekly published on saturdays and costing 7d the stamp duty on newspapers 4d per sheet forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently when the stamp duty was cut in 1836 the guardian added a wednesday edition and with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d in 1952 the paper took the step of printing news on the front page replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space theneditor a p wadsworth wrote it is not a thing i like myself but it seems to be accepted by all the newspaper pundits that it is preferable to be in fashion in 1959 the paper dropped manchester from its title becoming simply the guardian and in 1964 it moved to london losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the more downmarket but more profitable manchester evening news the financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s at one time it was in merger talks with the times the paper consolidated its centreleft stance during the 1970s and 1980s it was both shocked and revitalised by the launch of the independent in 1986 which competed for a similar readership and provoked the entire broadsheet industry into a fight for circulation front page of the guardian from 2001 showing the old design of the paper when in broadsheet format this design was used from 19882005 on 12 february 1988 the guardian had a significant redesign as well as improving the quality of its printers ink it also changed its masthead to a juxtaposition of an italic garamond the with a bold helvetica guardian that remained in use until the 2005 redesign in 1992 the guardian relaunched its features section as g2 a tabloidformat supplement this innovation was widely copied by the other quality broadsheets and ultimately led to the rise of compact papers and the guardians move to the berliner format in 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet price war started by rupert murdochs the times in june 1993 the guardian bought the observer from lonrho thus gaining a serious sunday sister newspaper with similar political views its international weekly edition is now titled the guardian weekly though it retained the title manchester guardian weekly for some years after the home edition had moved to london it includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat leftofcentre inclination including le monde and the washington post the guardian weekly was also linked to a website for expatriates guardian abroad which was launched in 2007 but had been taken offline by 2012 moving to the berliner paper formatedit the guardian is printed in full colour140 and was the first newspaper in the uk to use the berliner format for its main section while producing sections and supplements in a range of page sizes including tabloid approximately a4 and pocketsize approximately a5 in 2004 the guardian announced plans to change to a berliner or midi format similar to that used by die tageszeitung in germany le monde in france and many other european papers at 470×315 mm this is slightly larger than a traditional tabloid planned for the autumn of 2005 this change followed moves by the independent and the times to start publishing in tabloid or compact format on thursday 1 september 2005 the guardian announced that it would launch the new format on monday 12 september 2005141 sister sunday newspaper the observer also changed to this new format on 8 january 2006 the advantage the guardian saw in the berliner format was that though it is only a little wider than a tabloid and is equally easy to read on public transport its greater height gives more flexibility in page design the new presses mean that printing can go across the strip down the middle of the centre page known as the gutter allowing the paper to print striking doublepage pictures the new presses also made it the first uk national paper to print in full colour on every page the format switch was accompanied by a comprehensive redesign of the papers look on friday 9 september 2005 the newspaper unveiled its newly designed front page which débuted on monday 12 september 2005 designed by mark porter the new look includes a new masthead for the newspaper its first since 1988 a typeface family designed by paul barnes and christian schwartz was created for the new design with just over 200 fonts it is one of the most ambitious custom type programs ever commissioned by a newspaper142143 especially notable is guardian egyptian a highly legible slab serif that is used in various weights for both text and headlines and is central to the redesign the switch cost guardian newspapers £80 million and involved setting up new printing presses in east london and manchester this was necessary because before the guardians move no printing presses in britain could produce newspapers in the berliner format there were additional complications as one of the papers presses was partowned by telegraph newspapers and express newspapers contracted to use the plant until 2009 another press was shared with the guardian media groups northwestern tabloid local papers which did not wish to switch to the berliner format receptionedit the new format was generally well received by guardian readers who were encouraged to provide feedback on the changes the only controversy was over the dropping of the doonesbury cartoon strip the paper reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss within 24 hours the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week g2 supplement editor ian katz who was responsible for dropping it apologised in the editors blog saying im sorry once again that i made you—and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments address—so cross144 however some readers were dissatisfied as the earlier deadline needed for the allcolour sports section meant coverage of latefinishing evening football matches became less satisfactory in the editions supplied to some parts of the country the investment was rewarded with a circulation rise in december 2005 the average daily sale stood at 380693 nearly 6 per cent higher than the figure for december 2004145 however as of december 2012 circulation had dropped to 204222146 in 2006 the usbased society for news design chose the guardian and polish daily rzeczpospolita as the worlds bestdesigned newspapers—from among 389 entries from 44 countries147 tabloid format from 2018edit in june 2017 guardian media group gmg announced that the guardian and the observer will relaunch in tabloid format from early 2018 gmg also signed a contract with trinity mirror – the publisher of the daily mirror sunday mirror and sunday people – to outsource printing of the guardian and the observer david pemsel the chief executive officer of gmg said “ this is an important step in our threeyear transformation plan more people are reading and supporting our journalism than ever before but the print industry continues to evolve and we must evolve with it we plan to continue the guardians record of producing bold brilliantly designed awardwinning journalism ” katharine viner the editorinchief of the guardian said “ the berliner is a beautiful format which has served our readers brilliantly for 12 years but we know that it is our awardwinning quality independent journalism that our readers value most rather than the shape or the size of the newspapers we are going to create a newlook tabloid guardian and observer that are bold striking and beautiful – and which still contain the agendasetting journalism for which we’re renowned ” the move to outsource is expected to generate millions of pounds in savings annually148149 regular content and featuresedit each weekday the guardian comes with the g2 supplement containing feature articles columns television and radio listings and a quick crossword since the change to the berliner format there is a separate daily sports section other regular supplements during the week are shown below before

guardian also had a number of talkboards that were noted for their mix of political discussion and whimsy until they were closed on friday 25 february 2011156 they were spoofed in the guardians own regular humorous chatroom column in g2 the spoof column purported to be excerpts from a chatroom on permachatcouk a real url that pointed to the guardians talkboards in august 2013 a webshow titled

okane much of the companys output is documentary made for television– and it has included salam paxs baghdad blogger for bbc twos daily flagship newsnight some of which have been shown in compilations by cnn international sex on the streets and spiked both made for the uks channel 4 television162 guardianfilms was born in a sleeping bag in the burmese rainforest wrote okane in 2003163 i was a foreign correspondent for the paper and it had taken me weeks of negotiations dealing with shady contacts and a lot of walking to reach the cigarsmoking karen twins– the boy soldiers who were leading attacks against the countrys ruling junta after i had reached them and written a cover story for the newspapers g2 section i got a call from the bbcs documentary department which was researching a film on child soldiers could i give them all my contacts the plight of the karen people who were forced into slave labour in the rainforest to build pipelines for oil companies some of them british was a tale of human suffering that needed to be told by any branch of the media that was interested i handed over all the names and numbers i had as well as details of the secret route through thailand to get into burma good girl afterwards– and not for the first time– it seemed to me that we at the guardian should be using our resources ourselves instead of providing contact numbers for any independent tv company prepared to get on the phone to a journalist we should make our own films according to guardianfilmss own webpage its international work has focused on training talented local journalists based on the premise that the era of a traditional london or washington based foreign correspondent or fireman is coming to an end and the world urgently needs a more searching challenging journalism brought to us by people who speak the language and can secure access far beyond the green zone journalist limits of the traditional correspondent it says it is especially focused on reporting the muslim world in a more challenging manner and has trained a number of journalists in iraq afghanistan and zimbabwe164 guardianfilms has received several broadcasting awards in

papers nickname the grauniad sometimes abbreviated as graun originated with the satirical magazine private eye169 this anagram played on the guardians early reputation for frequent typographical errors including misspelling its own name as the gaurdian170 the very first issue of the newspaper contained a number of errors perhaps the most notable being a notification that there would soon be some goods sold at atction instead of auction fewer typographical errors are seen in the paper since the end of hotmetal typesetting171 one guardian writer keith devlin suggested that the high number of observed misprints was due more to the quality of the readership than the misprints greater frequency172 the fact that the newspaper was printed in manchester until 1961 and the early more errorprone prints were sent to london by train may have contributed to this image as well173174 when john cole was appointed news editor by alastair hetherington in 1963 he sharpened the papers
