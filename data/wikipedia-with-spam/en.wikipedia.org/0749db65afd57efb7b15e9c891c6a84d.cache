chandler born evan robert charmatz january 25 1944 – november 5 2009 was an american screenwriter and dentist perhaps best known for accusing pop icon michael jackson of child sexual abuse against his son jordan contents 1 early life 2 career 3 accusations against michael jackson and settlement 4 death 5 references early lifeedit evan robert charmatz was born in 1944 in bronx new york3 in 1973 he moved to west palm beach florida where he changed his last name because charmatz sounded too jewish 3 careeredit in her autobiographical book shockaholic actress and screenwriter carrie fisher claims that chandler was known as the dentist to the stars accommodating questionable requests in exchange for being associated with celebrities in the late 1980s through the early 1990s fisher would get unnecessary dental surgery to obtain morphine from him fisher claimed chandler could be persuaded via financial incentives or favors to come to a patients house to administer drugs chandler was also a screenwriter cowriting the 1993 comedy film robin hood men in tights accusations against michael jackson and settlementedit in her autobiography fisher says chandler told her privately that my son is very unsettling smile raised eyebrows maybe even a lewd wink good lookingit was grotesque this man was letting me know that he had this valuable thing that michael jackson wanted according to fisher in 1993 he told her he was bringing charges against jackson and was shocked with moral indignation she wrote this was the time i knew i had to find another dentist no drug can hide the feeling of ones skin crawlingi never thought that michaels whole thing with kids was sexual never as in neverland granted it was miles from appropriate but just because it wasnt normal doesnt mean that it had to be perverse those arent the only two choices for what can happen between an adult and an unrelated child hanging out togetherand yes he had an amusement park a zoo a movie theatre popcorn candy and an elephant but to draw a line under all that and add it up to the assumption that he fiendishly rubbed his hands together as he assembled this giant super spiderweb to lure and trap kids into it is just bad math4 in 1993 chandler accused pop star michael jackson of molesting chandlers son jordan after his son told him of the allegations while under the influence of sodium amytal during a routine dental procedure5 at the time chandler was in the midst of a custody battle for the boy with his exwife june chandlerschwartz the 1993 molestation case ended after jackson reached a settlement with chandler for a reported us 22 million67 although this amount was never confirmed by jackson and no formal charges were brought after two independent grand juries decided not to indict him89 court documents released in 2002 revealed the settlement was 15 million10 and that jacksons insurance carrier paid it without his consent admitting only to global claims of negligence and stated the parties recognize that the settlement payment are in settlement of claims by jordan chandler evan chandler and june chandler for alleged compensatory damages for alleged personal injuries arising out of claims of negligence and not for claims of intentional or wrongful acts of sexual molestation the document also stated jordan was not prevented from testifying against jackson if the case was tried in criminal court but specified that the chandlers could not speak to the media contrary to reports insisting the settlement halted a criminal proceeding during the 1993 investigation jacksons hired private investigator anthony pellicano released a recorded telephone conversation between chandler and dave schwartz the new husband of his exwife june and stepfather to jordan jacksons defense cited this tape as proof that chandlers allegations were nothing but an attempt to extort money from the star and regain custody of jordan especially considering chandler was more than 60000 behind child support payments and had already approached jackson several times asking for money chandler was recorded saying if i go through with this i win big time there’s no way that i lose i’ve checked that out inside outi will get everything i want and they will be totally — they will be destroyed forever they will be destroyed june is gonna lose jordy she will have no right to ever see him again this phone call took place on july 8 evan would claim jordan had confessed the abuse to him on july 16 following the settlement chandler had multiple plastic surgeries to mask his identity as he claimed abuse and harassment from angry jackson fans11 according to a usa today article written by journalist dewayne wickham in 1996 chandler attempted to sue jackson a second time citing the stars history album as a breach of their confidentiality agreement it is also believedby whom he is the ghostwriter of all that glitters a book about the allegations written by his brother raymond that was released in 2004 following a new set of molestation accusations against jackson it was revealed by june chandlerschwartz during jacksons 2005 trial that her son who according to his uncle fled the country to avoid testifying against jackson had filed for legal emancipation from his parents and had no contact with his mother since 19941213 in 2006 court documents filed in the state of new jersey revealed
