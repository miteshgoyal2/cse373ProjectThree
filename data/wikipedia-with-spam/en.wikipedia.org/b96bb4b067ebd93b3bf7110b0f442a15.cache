eventual world series champion st louis cardinals in six games team uniformsedit uniformsedit 1970–77edit the first brewers uniforms were handmedowns from the seattle pilots because the move to milwaukee received final approval less than a week before the start of the season there was no time to order new uniforms selig had originally planned to change the brewers colors to navy blue and red in honor of the minor league american associations milwaukee brewers but was forced to simply remove the seattle markings from the pilots blueandgold uniforms and sew brewers on the front however the outline of the pilots logo remained visible the uniforms had unique striping on the sleeves left over from the pilots days the cap was an updated version of the milwaukee braves cap in blue and yellow ultimately it was decided to keep blue and gold as the team colors and they have remained so ever since the brewers finally got their own flannel design in 1971 this design was essentially the same as the one used in 1970 but with blue and yellow piping on the sleeves and collar in 1972 the brewers entered the doubleknit era with uniforms based upon their flannels all white with brewers on the front and blue and yellow trim on the sleeves neck waistband and down the side of the pants this is the uniform that hank aaron wore with the club in his final seasons and that robin yount wore in his first during this period the logo of the club was the beer barrel man which had been used by the previous minor league brewers since at least the 1940s the brewers mascot bernie brewer a man with a large yellow mustache wearing a brewers hat was introduced in 19732 1978–93edit the brewers unveiled new uniforms for the 1978 season the uniforms featured pinstripes with a solid blue collar and waistband the road uniforms continued to be powder blue but for the first time the city name milwaukee graced the chest in an upward slant in addition this season saw the introduction of the logo that was to define the club m and b in the shape of a baseball glove the logo was designed by tom meindel an art history student at the university of wisconsineau claire the home cap was solid blue and the road cap was blue with a yellow front panel additionally their batting helmets had a white front panel the club wore these uniforms in their pennantwinning season of 1982 only minor changes were made until 1990 the color of the road uniforms changed to gray in 1985 while the blueyellowblue road cap and whitepaneled batting helmets were abandoned at the same time in 1990 the brewers made significant modifications to their uniforms switching from pullover to buttondown jerseys the last american league team to do so their individual uniforms showed other changes as well at home the blue piping was removed and the block lettered brewers was changed to a script version similar to the script used on road uniforms while those outfits had their piping changed from blueyellowblue to blueyellow the road jerseys were the first uniforms in franchise history to feature player names on the back names were added to the home jerseys beginning in 1993 1994–99edit in 1994 in collaboration with the brewers celebrating their 25th year in milwaukee the team did a radical makeover of their uniforms the ballinglove logo was removed and replaced with a stylized interlocking m and b set on a pair of crossed bats and a diamond background the royal blue changed to navy blue while the yellow changed to a metallic gold forest green was added as a third color the jerseys swapped pinstripes for retrothemed piping around the collar buttons and sleeves following a trend that was popular in the 1990s the uniforms lettering had the same style of letters as the new cap logo with heavily stylized brewers lettering on the home jerseys and milwaukee on the road grays for the first time an alternative jersey was introduced it was navy blue with the home brewers lettering on the front and featured the brewers logo on the lower left side the caps featured the interlocking mb logo without the bats or diamond on both the home and away versions the home cap was completely navy blue while the away cap featured a navy blue crown and a forest green bill in 1997 the uniforms were slightly modified with the main logo being removed from the caps and replaced with an m all navy caps were worn with both the home and away uniforms the home hats featured a white m and the road caps had a gold m the green socks that had previously been worn on the road were changed to navy blue the blue alternate jersey placed the players number on the lower left side instead of the logo 2000–presentedit before the 2000 season to coincide with the anticipated opening of miller park the brewers changed their uniforms again the block letters on the front were replaced with brewers in a flowing script and green was removed as the third color the cap logo was a script m similar in style to the miller logo with a head of barley underlining it symbolizing milwaukees beermaking industry the home uniforms also featured a patch on the left sleeve consisting of the cap logo with a gold outline of the state of wisconsin behind it showing the brewers statewide appeal the road uniforms were grey and featured the same script brewers on the front with a simple patch on the left sleeve bearing a script milwaukee there was also an alternate navy blue jersey that had the same features as the home jersey although the uniforms were supposed to debut with the opening of miller park the big blue crane collapse in july 1999 which cost the lives of three workers and caused damage to the first base side of the stadium delayed the opening of miller park for one year so the uniforms actually debuted at milwaukee county stadium in the ballparks final year in 2006 the brewers introduced retro sundays when the brewers would wear uniforms featuring the ballinglove logo the uniforms are similar to the uniforms worn from 1978 to 1989 but with some modern modifications such as the uniforms being buttonup instead of pullover displaying players last names on the backs of the jerseys and a ballinglove logo patch on the left sleeve in 2007 the retro day was changed from sunday to friday though they may also be worn outside of those days if a starting pitcher chooses the retro uniforms to wear during his start in 2010 the brewers debuted a new alternate road jersey which like the other alternate jersey is navy blue but bears a script milwaukee on the front in 2013 a gold alternate jersey with brewers on the front was introduced as well during the offseason before the 2013 season the brewers allowed fans to design their own milwaukee brewers uniforms three finalists were chosen which fans were given the opportunity to vote for their favorite through the brewers website the winning uniform was designed by ben peters of richfield minnesota and was worn by the brewers for two spring training games3 in 2016 the brewers replaced their road navy and home gold alternates with a new navy alternate jersey the uniform is similar to the previous road navy alternate but with yellow replacing gold as the trim color and will be paired with a navy cap featuring the ballandglove logo the navy road alternate has been worn far more often in 2016 than the official gray road jersey
