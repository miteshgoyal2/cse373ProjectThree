website wwwgooglecomadsense google adsense is a program run by google that allows publishers in the google network of content sites to serve automatic text image video or interactive media advertisements that are targeted to site content and audience these advertisements are administered sorted and maintained by google they can generate revenue on either a perclick or perimpression basis google betatested a costperaction service but discontinued it in october 2008 in favor of a doubleclick offering also owned by google2 in q1 2014 google earned us 34 billion 136 billion annualized or 22 of total revenue through google adsense3 adsense is a participant in the adchoices program so adsense ads typically include the triangleshaped adchoices icon45 this program also

reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed september 2010 learn how and when to remove this template message google uses its technology to serve advertisements based on website content the users geographical location and other factors those wanting to advertise with googles targeted advertisement system may enroll through google adwords adsense has become one of the popular programs that specializes in creating and placing banner advertisements on a website or blog because the advertisements are less intrusive and the content of the advertisements is often relevant to the website many websites use adsense to make revenue from their web content website online videos online audio content etc and it is the most popular advertising network7 adsense has been particularly important for delivering advertising revenue to small websites that do not have the resources for developing advertising sales programs and salespeople to seek out advertisers to display contextually relevant advertisements on a website webmasters place a brief javascript code on the websites pages websites that are contentrich have been very successful with this advertising program as noted in a number of publisher case studies on the adsense website google has removed the policy of limiting adsense ads to three ads per page now adsense publishers can place unlimited amount of adsense ads on a page some webmasters put significant effort into maximizing their own adsense income they do this in three wayscitation needed they use a wide range of trafficgenerating techniques including but not limited to online advertising they build valuable content on their websites that attracts adsense advertisements which pay out the most when they are clicked they use text content on their websites that encourages visitors to click on advertisements note that google prohibits webmasters from using phrases like click on my adsense ads to increase click rates the phrases accepted are sponsored links and advertisements the source of all adsense income is the adwords program which in turn has a complex pricing model based on a vickrey second price auction adsense commands an advertiser to submit a sealed bid ie a bid not observable by competitors additionally for any given click received advertisers only pay one bid increment above the secondhighest bid google currently shares 68 of revenue generated by adsense with content network partners and 51 of revenue generated by adsense with adsense for search partners8 on june 18 2015 google announced rebranding of adsense with a new logo9 adsense rebranded logo historyedit google launched its adsense program originally named content targeting advertising in march 200310 the adsense name was originally used by applied semantics a competitive offering to adsense the name was adopted by google after google acquired applied semantics in april 200311 some advertisers complained that adsense yielded worse results than adwords since it served ads that related contextually to the content on a web page and that content was less likely to be related to a users commercial desires than search results for example someone browsing a blog dedicated to flowers was less likely to be interested in ordering flowers than someone searching for terms related to flowers as a result in 2004 google allowed its advertisers to opt out of the adsense network12 paul buchheit the founder of gmail had the idea to run ads within googles email service but he and others say it was susan wojcicki with the backing of sergey brin who organized the team that adapted that idea into an enormously successful product13 by early 2005 adsense accounted for an estimated 15 percent of googles total revenues12 in 2009 google adsense announced that it would now be offering new features including the ability to enable multiple networks to display ads in february 2010 google adsense started using search history in contextual matching to offer more relevant ads14 on january 21 2014 google adsense launched direct campaigns a tool where publishers may directly sell ads this feature was retired on february 10 2015 typesedit contentedit the contentbased advertisements can be targeted for users with certain interest or contexts the targeting can be cpc per click or cpm per impression based the only significant difference in cpc and cpm is that with cpc targeting earnings are based on clicks while cpm earnings recently are actually based not just per viewsimpression but on a larger scale per thousand impression therefore driving it from the market which makes cpc ads more common there are various ad sizes available for content ads the ads can be simple text image animated image flash video video or rich media ads at most ad sizes users can change whether to show both text and multimedia ads or just one of them as of november 2012update a grey arrow appears beneath adsense text ads for easier identification google made a policy update regarding the number of ads per page the three ads per page limit has been removed 15 searchedit adsense for search allows publisher to display ads relating to search terms on their site and receive 51 of the revenue generated from those ads8 adsense custom search ads can be displayed either alongside the results from an adsense custom search engine or alongside internal search results through the use of custom search ads custom search ads are only available to whitelisted publishers although the revenue share from adsense for search 51 is lower than from adsense for content 68 higher returns can be achieved due to the potential for higher click through rates videoedit adsense for video allows publishers with video content eg video hosting websites to generate revenue using ad placements from googles extensive advertising network the publisher is able to decide what type of ads are shown with their video inventory formats available include linear video ads preroll or postroll overlay ads that display adsense text and display ads over the video content and the trueview format16 publishers can also display companion ads display ads that run alongside video content outside the player adsense for video is for publishers running video content within a player and not for youtube publishers link unitsedit link units are closely targeted to the interests of your users because users directly interact with the ad unit they may be more interested in the ads they eventually see adsense publishers are paid for clicks on the ads that are linked from link unit topics not for clicks on the initial topics themselves the ads on the linked page are payperclick google ads similar to those shown in regular adsense ad units link units discontinued typesedit mobile contentedit adsense for mobile content allowed publishers to generate earnings from their mobile websites using targeted google advertisements just like adsense for content google matches advertisements to the content of a website — in this case a mobile website instead of traditional javascript code technologies such as java and objectivec are used as of february 2012 adsense for mobile content was rolled into the core adsense for content offering to better reflect the lessening separation between desktop and mobile content17 domainsedit adsense for domains allows advertisements to be placed on domain names that have not been developed this offers domain name owners a way to monetize make money from domain names that are otherwise dormant or not in use adsense for domains is currently being offered to all adsense publishers but it wasnt always available to all on december 12 2008 techcrunch reported that adsense for domains is available for all us publishers18 on february 22 2012 google announced that it was shutting down its hosted adsense for domains program19 feedsedit in may 2005 google announced a limitedparticipation beta version of adsense for feeds a version of adsense that runs on rss and atom feeds that have more than 100 active subscribers according to the official google blog advertisers have their ads placed in the most appropriate feed articles publishers are paid for their original content readers see relevant advertising—and in the long run more quality feeds to choose from20 adsense for feeds works by inserting images into a feed when the image is displayed by a rss reader or web browser google writes the advertising content into the image that it returns the advertisement content is chosen based on the content of the feed surrounding the image when the user clicks the image he or she is redirected to the advertisers website in the same way as regular adsense advertisements adsense for feeds remained in its beta state until august 15 2008 when it became available to all adsense users on december 3 2012 google discontinued adsense for feeds program21 how it worksedit the webmaster who wishes to participate in adsense inserts the adsense javascript code into a webpage each time this page is visited by an end user eg a person surfing the internet the javascript code uses inlined json to display content fetched from googles servers for contextual advertisements googles servers use a web cache of the page created by its mediabot crawler to determine a set of highvalue keywords if keywords have been cached already advertisements are served for those keywords based on the adwords bidding system more details are described in the adsense patent for websitetargeted advertisements the advertiser chooses the pages on which to display advertisements and pays based on cost per mille cpm or the price advertisers choose to pay for every thousand advertisements displayed2223 for referrals google adds money to the advertisers account when visitors either download the referred software or subscribe to the referred service24 the referral program was retired in august 200825 search advertisements are added to the list of results after the visitoruser performs a search because the javascript is sent to the web browser when the page is requested it is possible for other website owners to copy the javascript code into their own webpages to protect against this type of fraud adsense publishers can specify the pages on which advertisements should be shown adsense then ignores clicks from pages other than those specified see click fraud for more information receptionedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message some webmasters create websites tailored to lure searchers from google and other engines onto their adsense website to make money from clicks such websites often contain nothing but a large amount of interconnected automated content eg a directory with content from the open directory project or scraper websites relying on rss feeds for content possibly the most popular form of such adsense farms are splogs spam blogs which are poorly written content centered around known highpaying keywords many of these websites reuse content from other websites such as wikipedia to attract visitors these and related approaches are considered to be search engine spam and can be reported to google26 a made for adsense mfa website or webpage has little or no content but is filled with advertisements so that users have no choice but to click on advertisements such pages were tolerated in the past but due to complaints google now disables such accounts there have also been reports of trojan horses engineered to produce counterfeit google advertisements that are formatted looking like legitimate ones the trojan uploads itself onto an unsuspecting users computer through a webpage and then replaces the original advertisements with its own set of malicious advertisements27 many website owners complain that their adsense accounts have been disabled just before they were supposed to receive their first paycheck from google28 google claims accounts have been disabled due to click fraud or forbidden content but have offered no proof of thiscitation needed an automated email is sent to the publishers owner which contains a link to file an appealcitation needed in the email google states that because we have a responsibility to protect our adwords advertisers from inflated costs due to invalid activity weve found it necessary to disable your adsense account your outstanding balance and googles share of the revenue will both be fully refunded back to the affected advertiserscitation needed the revenue generated whether legitimate or not is taken and all complaints are deferred29not in citation given in may 2014 hagens berman law firm filed a national classaction lawsuit against google claiming the company unlawfully denies payments to thousands of website owners and operators who place ads on their sites sold through google adwords30 there were numerous complaints in online discussion forums about a difference in treatment for publishers from china and india namely that sites from those locations are required to be active for six months before being eligible for adsense313233 due to alleged concerns about click fraud google adsense has been criticized by some search engine optimization firms as a large source of what google calls invalid clicks in which one company clicks on a rivals search engine advertisements to drive up the other companys costs34 the payment terms for webmasters have also been criticized google withholds payment until an account reaches us10035 but many micro content providerscitation needed require a long time—years in some cases—to build up this much adsense revenue however google will pay all earned revenue greater than us10 when an adsense account is closed and not disabled on the other side google bills its customers api users for example monthly in increments as low as a few centscitation needed google came under fire when the official google adsense blog showcased the french video website imineocom this website violated googles adsense program policies36 by displaying adsense alongside sexually explicit materialcitation needed typically websites displaying adsense have been banned from showing such content37 using both adsense and adwords may cause a website to pay google a commission when the website advertises itself38 in some cases adsense displays inappropriate or offensive ads for example in a news story about a terrorist attack in india an advert was generated for a presumably nonexistent educational qualification in terrorism39 adsense uses tracking cookies that are viewed by some users as a threat to privacy40 adsense terms of service require that sites using adsense explain the use of these cookies in their privacy
