flight it is quite emotional it is the big big ballads and the big big epic sound6 he has also stated that it is similar to made in heaven4 may had earlier stated that the album may end up being a mixture of old existing material and new material containing at least three unreleased songs later stating possibly as many as five7 the material has been fleshed out with modern technology by may8 song informationedit let me in your heart againedit main article let me in your heart again originating from sessions for the bands 1984 album the works let me in your heart again was written by may and originally recorded in los angeles in 1983 speaking on the chris evans breakfast show in september 2014 may revealed that the band had initially found it impossible to complete the track and that several different versions of the lyrics were written to make it easier for mercury to sing they abandoned the song but it was eventually recorded by mays wife anita dobson with may on guitar and released on her 1988 studio album talking of love dobson reportedly used the queen versions as a guide vocal in preparing the track for queen forever may stitched together parts from each of the existing queen versions before he and taylor fleshed out the music track consequently the final studio version contains very different lyrics from the dobson version an alternative remix by william orbit was released in november 2014 as a single in the uk to raise money for product red an initiative founded in 2006 by u2 lead singer bono for the purpose of engaging the private sector in raising awareness and funds to help eliminate hivaids in africa love killsedit main article love kills freddie mercury song it was stated by adam lambert at the start of the 2014 queen adam lambert tour of north america that love kills mercurys debut solo single from 1984 had been reworked by the band for inclusion on queen forever the band then proceeded to play a stripped down ballad version of the track the original version was noted for its heavily synthesized discoesque style queen had previously reworked mercurys solo recordings into queen songs for their 1995 album made in heaven on that occasion they had used his songs made in heaven and i was born to love you as well as the unreleased solo recording its a beautiful day when it became apparent that there was not enough quality unreleased queen material to make a new full studio album may and taylor decided to utilise the same tactics written by mercury and giorgio moroder love kills was originally recorded for the bands 1984 studio album the works but was ultimately rejected it was then reworked as a mercury solo track for inclusion in moroders 1984 restoration and edit of the 1927 silent film metropolis in 1985 the film was nominated at the 5th golden raspberry awards for worst musical score and the song itself was nominated for worst original song nevertheless the single reached number ten on the uk singles chart interestingly despite being released as a freddie mercury solo single all four members of queen appeared on the original release speaking on the chris evans breakfast show may revealed that he had always wanted to turn the song into a ballad but had never done so before mercurys death the new version is led by mays lead guitar rather than mercurys original synthesizers may also plays bass guitar on the track supplemented by deacons additional electric guitar as taken from the original source tapes there must be more to life than thisedit main article there must be more to life than this in the early 1980s mercury recorded three songs as duets with michael jackson of which there must be more to life than this written by mercury was one the sessions eventually fell apart and ended and the material was never released although mercury stated several times he hoped they would find the time to finish the tracks queen eventually recorded a version of the song in 1981 during sessions for their 1982 studio album hot space but it was ultimately left off the record mercury later went on to rerecord there must be more to life than this for his solo album mr bad guy 1985 while jackson recorded one of the other songs state of shock with his family band the jacksons with mick jagger of the rolling stones singing mercurys parts the song was released as a single in 1984 and later featured on the jacksons seventeenth studio album victory also released in 1984 interestingly this albums title was also that of the third mercuryjackson duet but has itself never been released after jacksons death in 2009 may and taylor made steps to secure the release of the duets with a view to a 2012 release however according to taylor working with the jackson estate was like wading through glue ultimately the parties were only able to reach an agreement for this one of the three tracks to be released the version released on queen forever was produced and mixed by william orbit containing the original 1981 backing track recorded during the hot space sessions and features deacon on bass guitar an alternative mix made by may exists but was rejected by the jackson estate in favour of the orbit mix other materialedit the rest of the album consists of remastered versions of previouslyreleased queen songs rather than simply being the greatest hits however the tracks are mostly deeper cuts personally chosen by taylor and may the songs were selected to loosely follow the concept of an album centred around the theme of love critical receptionedit professional ratings

other queen compilation albums thomas erlewine gave a twoandahalf star review in allmusic saying the hardcore fans might notice the difference but apart from those three songs theres not much reason
