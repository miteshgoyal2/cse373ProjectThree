washington the pilots played home games at sicks stadium and were a member of the west division of major league baseballs american league on april 1 1970 they moved to milwaukee wisconsin1 the pilots name originated from the owners parttime job as a harbor pilot and the citys association with the aviation industry2 the team colors were royal blue and gold with accessory red in the logo helm and baseball seams seattle had long been a hotbed for minor league baseball and was home to the seattle rainiers a successful team in the pacific coast league pcl at the time seattle was the thirdbiggest metropolitan area on the west coast the cleveland indians briefly considered a move to seattle in 1964 but opted to stay in ohio in 1967 charles finley looked to move his kansas city athletics to seattle but ended up moving the athletics to oakland california there was no real competition from other professional teams at the time while seattle had landed the national basketball association nbas supersonics in 1967 the nba was not as popular as baseball was at the time3 the nfl would come to the city in 1976 with the addition of the expansion seahawks contents 1 formation 2 team issues 3 relocation 4 bankruptcy 5 ball four 6 lawsuit and enfranchisement of the seattle mariners 7 the only season in seattle 8 see also 9 references 10 further reading formationedit the lead man for the franchise ownership pacific northwest sports inc pnsi was dewey soriano a former rainiers pitcher and general manager and former president of the pacific coast league4 in an ominous sign of things to come soriano had to ask william r daley who owned the indians during the time they flirted with moving to seattle to underwrite much of the purchase price in return soriano sold daley 47 of the stock — the largest stake in the club he became chairman of the board while soriano served as president a couple of factors were beyond the pilots control they were originally not set to start play until 1971 along with the kansas city royals however the date was moved up to 1969 under pressure from senator stuart symington of missouri professional baseball had been played in kansas city in one form or another from 1883 until the as left for oakland after the 1967 season and symington would not accept the prospect of kansas city having to wait three years for baseball to return5 the american league would not allow only one new team to enter the league as the resulting odd number of teams would unbalance the schedule that meant that kansas city and seattle had to be admitted together also the pilots had to pay the pcl 1 million to compensate for the loss of one of its most successful franchises after king county voters approved a bond for a domed stadium what would become the kingdome in february 1968 with 62 in favor6789 the seattle pilots were officially born1011 california angels executive marvin milkes was hired as general manager11 and joe schultz a coach with the national league champion st louis cardinals became manager112 team issuesedit the wordmarks for the seattle pilots schultz and milkes both optimistically stated that they thought pilots could finish third in the newly formed sixteam al west13 however the pilots experienced the typical struggles of a firstyear expansion team they won their very first game and then their home opener three days later but only won five more times in the first month nevertheless the pilots managed to stay in reasonable striking distance of 500 the pilots were only 6 games back of the division lead as late as june 28 but a disastrous 9–20 july and an even worse 6–22 august ended even a faint hope of any kind of contention though they were still in third place as late as august the team finished the season in last place in the al west with a record of 6498 33 games out of first minnesota and 45 games behind leagueleading baltimore1415 however the teams poor play was the least of its troubles the most obvious problem was sicks stadium the longtime home of the rainiers it had once been considered one of the best ballparks in minor league baseball16 by the 1960s however it was considered far behind the times while a condition of mlb awarding the pilots to seattle was that sicks had to be expanded to 30000 seats only 19500 seats were ready by opening day because of numerous delays17 the scoreboard was not even ready until the night before the season opener by june there were finally 25000 seats in place water pressure was almost nonexistent after the seventh inning especially with crowds above 800018 attendance was poor 678000 and the pilots lost several hundred thousand dollars their first and only season19 the teams new stadium was slated to be built at the seattle center20 but a petition by stadium opponents ground the project to a halt21 the site was later moved to south of downtown and became the kingdome9 now occupied by centurylink field relocationedit by the end of the season the pilots were gasping however daley refused to put up more financing it was obvious that they would not survive long enough to move into their new park without new ownership22 it was also obvious that such a move would have to happen quickly as sicks stadium was inadequate even for temporary use during the offseason soriano made contact with car salesman and former milwaukee braves minority owner bud selig who was leading the effort to bring major league baseball back to milwaukee they met in secret for over a month towards the end of the season and during game 1 of the world series soriano agreed to sell the pilots to selig for 108 million23 selig would then move the team to milwaukee however the remaining owners of the pilots turned it down in the face of pressure from washington states two senators warren magnuson and henry m scoop jackson as well as state attorney general slade gorton local theater chain owner fred danz came forward in october 1969 with a 10 million deal but it fizzled when the bank of california called in a 4 million loan it had made to soriano and daley to finance the purchase of the franchise24 in january 1970 westin hotels head eddie carlson put together a nonprofit group to buy the team25 however the owners rejected the idea almost out of hand since it would have devalued the other clubs worth a slightly modified deal came one vote short of approval26 bankruptcyedit after a winter and spring full of court action the pilots reported for spring training under new manager dave bristol unsure of where they would play the owners had given tentative approval to the milwaukee group but the state of washington got an injunction on march 16 to stop the deal pnsi immediately filed for bankruptcy — a move intended to forestall postsale legal action27 at the bankruptcy hearing a week later milkes testified there was not enough money to pay the coaches players and office staff had milkes been more than 10 days late in paying the players they would have all become free agents and left seattle without a team for the 1970 season28 with this in mind federal bankruptcy referee sidney volinn declared the pilots bankrupt on april 1—six days before opening day—clearing the way for them to move to milwaukee the teams equipment had been sitting in provo utah with the drivers awaiting word on whether to drive toward seattle or milwaukee29 the move came so late that selig had to scrap his initial plans to change the teams colors to navy and red in honor of the minorleague brewers of his youth instead the brewers were stuck using old pilots uniforms with the team name replaced one legacy of the brewers roots in seattle is that their colors are still blue and gold although the shades have been darker since 2000 ball fouredit jim bouton was a pilots relief pitcher in 1969 sold to the seattle angels by the new york yankees in mid196830 his classic baseball book ball four is based on a journal that bouton kept during the season31 lawsuit and enfranchisement of the seattle marinersedit see also history of the seattle mariners in 1970 in the aftermath of the pilots purchase and relocation to milwaukee the city of seattle king county and the state of washington represented by thenstate attorney general slade gorton sued the american league for breach of contract32 confident that major league baseball would return to seattle within a few years king county built the multipurpose kingdome which would become home to the nfls expansion seattle seahawks in 1976 the pilots lawsuit continued until 1976 at trial the american league offered to give seattle an expansion baseball franchise in return for dropping the suit32 and details were ironed out over the next year to keep the league with an even number of teams a formal expansion proceeding was held with a second team the blue jays being awarded to the city of toronto also allowing both leagues to place a team in canada the national leagues montreal expos having been established in 1969 the new seattle team to begin play in 1977 would be owned by entertainer danny kaye along with stanley golub walter schoenfeld lester smith james stillwell jr and
