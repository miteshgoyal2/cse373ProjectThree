farewell to the simpsons and walks off down the road singing lisas birthday song to himself in his normal voice productionedit al jean cowrote the episode with mike reiss stark raving dad was written specifically for michael jackson a fan of the show who had called groening one night and offered to do a guest spot45 the offer was accepted and a script was written by al jean and mike reiss based on an idea pitched by james l brooks6 creator matt groening and coexecutive producer sam simon also contributed significantly to the writing of the episode6 in an early version of the script homer decided to take his alcoholic friend barney gumble in for rehab but while there homer began acting crazily so the doctors assumed he was the one to be committed4 it was later changed to homer being hospitalized for wearing a pink shirt an idea pitched by brooks7 michael jackson pitched several story ideas for the episode such as bart telling everyone in town that michael jackson was coming to his house he also requested that there be a scene in which he and bart wrote a song together6 and asked that a joke about prince be changed to one about elvis presley7 the three voices of leon kompowsky michael jackson guest starred as leons jackson voice kipp lennon guest starred as leons singing voice hank azaria provided leons normal speaking voice according to jean jackson would not commit to the episode until after a readthrough of the script was done8 the read was held at jacksons manager sandy gallins house and dan castellaneta who provides the voice for homer was 30 minutes late jean recalls that no one said a word we just sat there waiting9 following the read jackson stipulated his conditions he would record his speaking parts but not receive credit and his singing voice would be performed by a soundalike810 leon kompowskys singing parts were performed by kipp lennon6 because jackson wanted to play a joke on his brothers and fool them into thinking the impersonator was him10 lennon recorded his lines at the same time as jackson who found the impersonations humorous6 jackson showed up for the recording session alone and did not use the special trailer that was set up for him6 according to jean jackson did record versions of the singing parts and while there have been rumors that those parts were the ones used in the final episode the simpsons music editor chris ledesma has stated the lennon versions were used7 kompowskys normal speaking voice which is heard at the end of the episode was recorded by cast member hank azaria11 the episode originally was supposed to end with kompowsky singing a portion of man in the mirror in his michael jackson voice as he walked down the road but it was changed to him singing the beginning of happy birthday lisa11 stark raving dad was the final episode in the season two production run but aired as the premiere of season three over a year after it was completed6 michael jackson was credited with pseudonym john jay smith in the closing credits5 at the time the producers of the show were legally prevented from confirming that jackson guest starred although many media sources assumed it was really him12131415 similarly in season two actor dustin hoffman had guest starred in the episode lisas substitute under the name sam etic after stark raving dad the producers decided that if a celebrity wished to guest star on the show they had to be willing to be credited under their real name16 jackson was a fan of bart17 and in addition to doing a guest spot on the show he wanted to give bart a number one single he therefore cowrote the song do the bartman which was released as a single around the same time that the episode was produced jackson could not take credit for his work on the song due to contractual reasons10 jackson also wrote the song happy birthday lisa which was later included in the album songs in the key of springfield7 a version of the song was reportedly scheduled to be included on a bonus disk in the october 2001 special edition of jacksons 1991 album dangerous however the bonus disk was eventually dropped from the release18 jackson died on june 25 2009 and the fox network reaired the episode on july 5 as a tribute to him19 the producers had intended to air the episode on june 28 2009 three days after jacksons death but could not resolve issues with syndication rights in time the music video for do the bartman was aired on that date instead20 the producers screened the episode first and the only change made which was unrelated to jackson was the blurring of a phone number8 this was the first episode to broadcast in dolby surround21 alternate openingedit a rerun of stark raving dad featured a response to a comment made by george bush the january 30 1992 rerun of the episode featured a brief alternate opening which was written in response to a comment made by the then president of the united states george bush three days earlier the show had previously had a feud with the presidents wife barbara bush when in the october 1 1990 edition of people she called the simpsons the dumbest thing she had ever seen22 the writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter to bush in which they posed as marge simpson bush immediately sent a reply in which she apologized later on january 27 1992 george bush made a speech during his reelection campaign which included the statement we are going to keep on trying to strengthen the american family to make american families a lot more like the waltons and a lot less like the simpsons3 the writers decided that they wanted to respond quickly like barbara bush had to them however each episode of the simpsons takes more than six months to produce so it is difficult for the show to comment on current events23 the writers therefore decided to add a brief response to the next broadcast of the simpsons which was a rerun of stark raving dad on january 303 nancy cartwright the voice of bart was quickly called in so she could record a line24 the broadcast included a new tongueincheek opening the scene begins in the simpsons living room where the family is watching bushs speech when bush says to make american families a lot more like the waltons and a lot less like the simpsons bart replies hey were just like the waltons were praying for an end to the depression too2526 the opening is featured on the season four dvd boxset3 unproduced sequeledit prince was asked to guest star as leon kompowsky in a sequel to stark raving dad however the episode was never produced a year after the episode aired the writers decided to make a sequel where leon kompowsky returns this time acting like the musician prince6 the script was written by freelance writers and polished by conan obrien6 according to reiss the plot of the episode saw kompowskyprince manage to get everyone in the town to loosen up become more flamboyant and become more sexually open6 the script was sent to prince who agreed to voice the character and sent back a page of notes about what he would be wearing in various scenes the writers were confused when the notes did not correspond to the script and they discovered that prince was referring to a script that had been written by someone else6 prince disliked the simpsons writers script and demanded the other one be made into an episode but the writers refused27 the episode eventually fell through and never made it past written form it became one of the few completed scripts never to be produced6 cultural referencesedit like all episodes of the simpsons stark raving dad features a variety of references to popular culture7 as bart fills out the 20question psychiatry quiz homer watches americas funniest home videos where the three nominated clips are all violent6 many of the scenes in the mental institution are references to the film one flew over the cuckoos nest several of the characters at the institution are based on those in the film such as chief7 floyd from the film rain man also appears at the mental home2 when marge calls the institution a muzak version of crazy sung by patsy cline can be heard over the phone1 in the shot of the crowd that awaits michael jacksons arrival outside of the simpson familys home a man is holding a john 316 sign in reference to rollen stewart who was famous for holding a similar sign at sporting events1 many aspects of jacksons career are referenced in the episode kompowsky mentions several things which made jackson famous including motown 25 yesterday today forever beat it and thriller7 he also sings portions of the songs billie jean and ben and performs the moonwalk28 when homer starts mumbling in his sleep kompowsky tells his stuffed animal bubbles its going to be a long night bubbles is the name of jacksons chimpanzee kompowsky also says he was upset when his 1979 album off the wall only received one grammy award nomination the writers had read that the real jackson was genuinely upset7 receptionedit in its original airing on the fox network stark raving dad acquired a 139 nielsen rating and 23 percent share of the audience it was viewed in approximately 128 million homes finishing the week ranked 33rd29 the episode finished second in its time slot behind the season premiere of the cosby show which ranked eighth for the week with a 197 rating and 31 percent share29 the simpsons was the second highest rated show on fox the week it aired behind married with children30 stark raving dad the season three opener of the simpsons is a hilarious and heartwarming halfhour it reminds me of the shows best days when it delivered that perfect blend of bizarre humor social commentary and unexpected sweetness — mike moody of tv squad 200931 the episode has been generally well received being praised by many critics for its writing in a 2009 review for slate josh levin wrote that the greatness of stark raving dad has a lot more to do with the simpsons writing staff than with jacksons voiceover talents the shows scripters came up with a plot device far more ingenious than simply dropping the singer into springfield32 monica collins of the boston herald also enjoyed the episode on the day it first aired she wrote that this episode is vintage simpsons crammed with divinely vulgar visual oddities and michael jackson of course is just so weird anyway that he fits right in33 mark lorando of the timespicayune commented that throwaway lines on the simpsons are funnier than the big punchlines on most socalled comedy series this episode has layers of humor satirical touches that enrich the story lines singling out jokes like the americas funniest home video parody the laughs are literally nonstop and jacksons unmistakable vocal presence adds a thousand watts of star power34 in 2011 television blends eric eisenberg named stark raving dad the best episode of the entire series he praised it for being heartful and stated that what prevents the episode from seeming artificial or manipulative is that the writing in the episode earns the earnest moments and further elaborates that while strong emotions might be the hallmark of stark raving dad it would be a sincere mistake to ignore how funny it is he concluded that the episode is perfectly constructed is filled with both deep belly laughs and tears and is simply the greatest episode of the simpsons35 in a dvd audio commentary writer mike reiss said he felt that michael jackson is not a terrific actor but he did fine he was really nice he was a great sport6 in 2006 jackson was named the fifthbest simpsons guest star by ign36 tom ganjamie of best week ever called jacksons guest appearance the cleverest ever on the simpsons37 writing for ign robert canning said in a 2009 review that stark raving dad is a solid funny and touching episode and described jacksons performance as heartfelt yet selfparodying38 in a 2011 article andrew martin of prefix mag named michael jackson his second favorite musical guest on the simpsons out of a list of ten39 in 2003 dvd movie guides colin jacobson commented that the episode was a good start to season three but it gets sappy on more than a few occasions and it lacks the acerbic bite of the series best shows nonetheless it tosses out some good laughs and the guest appearance by jackson—under a pseudonym—works well michael shows an ability to mock himself that still surprises me40 in a 2004 review for digitally obsessed nate meyers wrote that there are many funny gags in this episode especially in the first act when homer gets a tour of the mental hospital some clever references are made to one flew over the cuckoos nest but the second half of the episode is not especially funny the jokes seem forced and there is too much of an effort to sentimentalize the relationship between bart and lisa causing the show to lose its narrative drive41 in 2007 ben rayner of the toronto star listed stark raving dad as one of the three worst episodes of the simpsons42 in a 2009 article for tv squad mike moody said the episodes sweetest moment is at the end when kompowsky and bart perform the birthday song for lisa31 likewise writer al jean listed that scene as one of his five favorite moments from the simpsons in 200343 the reaction to the song happy birthday lisa was mixed ben rayner called it a crap tune42 and chris selley of macleans magazine wrote that stark raving dad is an unbearably sappy episode and that birthday song for lisa is just bad44 dave walker of the timespicayune however listed the episode as one of jacksons many memorable tv moments and called the song unforgettable45 referencesedit footnotes a b c d richmond coffman 1997 p 62 a b martyn warren wood adrian
