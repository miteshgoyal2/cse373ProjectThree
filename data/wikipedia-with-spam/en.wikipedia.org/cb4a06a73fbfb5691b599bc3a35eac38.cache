different from mainstream banks with a mission to be communityoriented and serve people not profit567 credit unions offer many of the same financial services as banks but often using a different terminology common services include share accounts savings accounts share draft accounts checking accounts credit cards share term certificates certificates of deposit and online banking1 normally only a member of a credit union may deposit or borrow money1 surveys of customers at banks and credit unions have consistently shown a significantly higher customer satisfaction rate with the quality of service at credit unions89 credit unions have historically claimed to provide superior member service and to be committed to helping members improve their financial situation in the context of financial inclusion credit unions claim to provide a broader range of loan and savings products at a much cheaper cost to their members than do most microfinance institutions10 notforprofit statusedit in the credit union context notforprofit must be distinguished from a nonprofit charity or similar organization11 credit unions are notforprofit because their purpose is to serve their members rather than to maximize profits101011 so unlike charities and the like credit unions do not rely on donations and are financial institutions that must perforce make what is in economic terms a small profit ie in nonprofit accounting terms a surplus to remain in existence1012 according to the world council of credit unions woccu a credit unions revenues from loans and investments must exceed its operating expenses and dividends interest paid on deposits in order to maintain capital and solvency12 fw raiffeisen wrote in 1870 that credit unions are according to paragraph eleven of the german

unions modern credit union history dates from 1852 when franz hermann schulzedelitzsch consolidated the learning from two pilot projects one in eilenburg and the other in delitzsch in the kingdom of saxony into what are generally recognized as the first credit unions in the world he went on to develop a highly successful urban credit union system20 in 1864 friedrich wilhelm raiffeisen founded the first rural credit union in heddesdorf now part of neuwied in germany20 by the time of raiffeisens death in 1888 credit unions had spread to italy france the netherlands england austria and other nations21 the first credit union in north america the caisse populaire de lévis in quebec canada began operations on january 23 1901 with a 10cent deposit founder alphonse desjardins a reporter in the canadian parliament was moved to take up his mission in 1897 when he learned of a montrealer who had been ordered by the court to pay nearly c5000 in interest on a loan of 150 from a moneylender

represented 4 million members across 17 countries with a loan portfolio of circa half a billion us dollars however from the late 1970s onwards many latin american credit unions struggled with inflation stagnating membership and serious loan recovery problems in the 1980s donor agencies such as usaid attempted to rehabilitate latin american credit unions by providing technical assistance and focusing credit unions efforts on mobilising deposits from the local population in 1987 the regional financial crisis caused a run on credit unions significant withdrawals and high default rates caused liquidity problems for many credit unions in the region23 stability and risksedit credit unions must make enough surplus to cover expenses otherwise like any other business they cannot continue in which case they can become insolvent and cease to exist the effect on those with funds deposited varies between jurisdictions several factors combine to put credit unions at risk of failure they may not be allowed to lend enough money to enough people who are willing and able to repay because of their rules on responsible lending when debtors get into trouble they will often repay liabilities such as payday loans with high interest rates first leaving the credit unions until last in some cases courts may after ruling against debtors leniently allow them to pay off their debts with very small payments sometimes free of interest over a long period24 corporateedit main article corporate credit union credit unions as such provide service only to individual consumers corporate credit
