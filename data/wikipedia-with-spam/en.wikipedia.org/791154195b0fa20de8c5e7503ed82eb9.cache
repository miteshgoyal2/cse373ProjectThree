heat cold electricity chemicals friction or radiation2 most burns are due to heat from hot liquids solids or fire6 while rates are similar for males and females the underlying causes often differ3 among women in some areas risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves3 among men risk is related to the work environments3 alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors3 burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people3 burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or firstdegree burns17 they appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days17 when the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer it is a partialthickness or seconddegree burn1 blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful1 healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur1 in a fullthickness or thirddegree burn the injury extends to all layers of the skin1 often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff1 healing typically does not occur on its own1 a fourthdegree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues such as muscle tendons or bone1 the burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part18 burns are generally preventable3 treatment depends on the severity of the burn1 superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers1 cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage however prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature17 partialthickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water followed by dressings1 it is not clear how to manage blisters but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large1 fullthickness burns usually require surgical treatments such as skin grafting1 extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling7 the most common complications of burns involve infection9 tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date1 in 2015 fire and heat resulted in 67 million injuries4 this resulted in about 29 million hospitalizations and 176000 deaths105 most deaths due to burns occur in the developing world particularly in southeast asia3 while large burns can be fatal treatments developed since 1960 have improved outcomes especially in children and young adults11 in the united states approximately 96 of those admitted to a burn center survive their injuries12 the longterm outcome is related

followed by peeling of the skin over the next few days713 individuals suffering from more severe burns may indicate discomfort or complain of feeling pressure rather than pain fullthickness burns may be entirely insensitive to light touch or puncture13 while superficial burns are typically red in color severe burns may be pink white or black13 burns around the mouth or singed hair inside the nose may indicate that burns to the airways have occurred but these findings are not definitive14 more worrisome signs include shortness of breath hoarseness and stridor or wheezing14 itchiness is common during the healing process occurring in up to 90 of adults and nearly all children15 numbness or tingling may persist for a prolonged period of time after an electrical injury16 burns may also produce

caused by a variety of external sources classified as thermal heatrelated chemical electrical and radiation20 in the united states the most common causes of burns are fire or flame 44 scalds 33 hot objects 9 electricity 4 and chemicals 321 most 69 burn injuries occur at home or at work 912 and most are accidental with 2 due to assault by another and 1–2 resulting from a suicide attempt17 these sources can cause inhalation injury to the airway andor lungs occurring in about 69 burn injuries occur more commonly among the poor17 smoking and alcoholism are other risk factor6 firerelated burns are generally more common in colder climates17 specific risk factors in the developing world include cooking with open fires or on the floor2 as well as developmental disabilities in children and chronic diseases in adults22 thermal main article thermal burn in the united states fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns9 of house fires that result in death smoking causes 25 and heating devices cause 222 almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire2 scalding is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks high temperature tap water in baths or showers hot cooking oil or steam23 scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five1 and in the united states and australia this population makes up about twothirds of all burns9 contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20–30 of burns in children9 generally scalds are first or seconddegree burns but thirddegree burns may also result especially with prolonged contact24 fireworks are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries25 this is a particular risk for adolescent males26 chemical main article chemical burn chemicals cause from 2 to 11 of all burns and contribute to as many as 30 of burnrelated deaths27 chemical burns can be caused by over 25000 substances1 most of which are either a strong base 55 or a strong acid 2627 most chemical burn deaths are secondary to ingestion1 common agents include sulfuric acid as found in toilet cleaners sodium hypochlorite as found in bleach and halogenated hydrocarbons as found in paint remover among others1 hydrofluoric acid can cause particularly deep burns that may not become symptomatic until some time after exposure28 formic acid may cause the breakdown of significant numbers of red blood cells14 electrical main article electrical burn electrical burns or injuries are classified as high voltage greater than or equal to 1000 volts low voltage less than 1000 volts or as flash burns secondary to an electric arc1 the most common causes of electrical burns in children are electrical cords 60 followed by electrical outlets 149 lightning may also result in electrical burns29 risk factors for being struck include involvement in outdoor activities such as mountain climbing golf and field sports and working outside16 mortality from a lightning strike is about 1016 while electrical injuries primarily result in burns they may also cause fractures or dislocations secondary to blunt force trauma or muscle contractions16 in high voltage injuries most damage may occur internally and thus the extent of the injury cannot be judged by examination of the skin alone16 contact with either low voltage or high voltage may produce cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest16 radiation main article radiation burn radiation burns may be caused by protracted exposure to ultraviolet light such as from the sun tanning booths or arc welding or from ionizing radiation such as from radiation therapy xrays or radioactive fallout30 sun exposure is the most common cause of radiation burns and the most common cause of superficial burns overall31 there is significant variation in how easily people sunburn based on their skin type32 skin effects from ionizing radiation depend on the amount of exposure to the area with hair loss seen after 3 gy redness seen after 10 gy wet skin peeling after 20 gy and necrosis after 30 gy33 redness if it occurs may not appear until some time after exposure33 radiation burns are treated the same as other burns33 microwave burns occur via thermal heating caused by the microwaves34 while exposures as short as two seconds may cause injury overall this is an uncommon occurrence34 nonaccidental in those hospitalized from scalds or fire burns 3–10 are from assault35 reasons include child abuse personal disputes spousal abuse elder abuse and business disputes35 an immersion injury or immersion scald may indicate child abuse24 it is created when an extremity or the lower body buttock or perineum is held under the surface of hot water24 it typically produces a sharp upper border and is often symmetrical24 other highrisk signs of potential abuse include circumferential burns the absence of splash marks a burn of uniform depth and association with other signs of neglect or abuse36 bride burning a form of domestic violence occurs in some cultures such as india where women have been burned in revenge for what the husband or his family consider an inadequate dowry3738 in pakistan acid burns represent 13 of intentional burns and are frequently related to domestic violence36 selfimmolation setting oneself on fire is also used as a form of protest in various parts of the world17 pathophysiology three degrees of burns at temperatures greater than 44 °c 111 °f proteins begin losing their threedimensional shape and start breaking down39 this results in cell and tissue damage1 many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin1 they include disruption of the skins sensation ability to prevent water loss through evaporation and ability to control body temperature1 disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium1 in large burns over 30 of the total body surface area there is a significant inflammatory response40 this results in increased leakage of fluid from the capillaries14 and subsequent tissue edema1 this causes overall blood volume loss with the remaining blood suffering significant plasma loss making the blood more concentrated1 poor blood flow to organs such as the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract may result in renal failure and stomach ulcers41 increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol can cause a hypermetabolic state that can last for years40 this is associated with increased cardiac output metabolism a fast heart rate and poor immune function40 diagnosis burns can be classified by depth mechanism of injury extent and associated injuries the most commonly used classification is based on the depth of injury the depth of a burn is usually determined via examination although a biopsy may also be used1 it may be difficult to accurately determine the depth of a burn on a single examination and repeated examinations over a few days may be necessary14 in those who have a headache or are dizzy and have a firerelated burn carbon monoxide poisoning should be considered42 cyanide poisoning should also be considered14 size burn severity is determined through among other things the size of the skin affected the image shows the makeup of different body parts to help assess burn size the size of a burn is measured as a percentage of total body surface area tbsa affected by partial thickness or full thickness burns1 firstdegree burns that are only red in color and are not blistering are not included in this estimation1 most burns 70 involve less than 10 of the tbsa9 there are a number of methods to determine the tbsa including the wallace rule of nines lund and browder chart and estimations based on a persons palm size7 the rule of nines is easy to remember but only accurate in people over 16 years of age7 more accurate estimates can be made using lund and browder charts which take into account the different proportions of body parts in adults and children7 the size of a persons handprint including the palm and fingers is approximately 1 of their tbsa7 severity american burn association severity classification42 minor moderate major adult 10 tbsa adult 10–20 tbsa adult 20 tbsa young or old 5 tbsa young or old 5–10 tbsa young or old 10 tbsa 2 full thickness burn 2–5 full thickness burn 5 full thickness burn high voltage injury high voltage burn possible inhalation injury known inhalation injury circumferential burn significant burn to face joints hands or feet other health problems associated injuries to determine the need for referral to a specialized burn unit the american burn association devised a classification system under this system burns can be classified as major moderate and minor this is assessed based on a number of factors including total body surface area affected the involvement of specific anatomical zones the age of the person and associated injuries42 minor burns can typically be managed at home moderate burns are often managed in hospital and major burns are managed by a burn center42 prevention historically about half of all burns were deemed preventable2 burn prevention programs have significantly decreased rates of serious burns39 preventive measures include limiting hot water temperatures smoke alarms sprinkler systems proper construction of buildings and fireresistant clothing2 experts recommend setting water heaters below 488 °c 1198 °f9 other measures to prevent scalds include using a thermometer to measure bath water temperatures and splash guards on stoves39 while the effect of the regulation of fireworks is unclear there is tentative evidence of benefit43 with recommendations including the limitation of the sale of fireworks to children9 management resuscitation begins with the assessment and stabilization of the persons airway breathing and circulation7 if inhalation injury is suspected early intubation may be required14 this is followed by care of the burn wound itself people with extensive burns may be wrapped in clean sheets until they arrive at a hospital14 as burn wounds are prone to infection a tetanus booster shot should be given if an individual has not been immunized within the last five years44 in the united states 95 of burns that present to the emergency department are treated and discharged 5 require hospital admission17 with major burns early feeding is important40 hyperbaric oxygenation may be useful in addition to traditional treatments45 intravenous fluids in those with poor tissue perfusion boluses of isotonic crystalloid solution should be given7 in children with more than 10–20 tbsa burns and adults with more than 15 tbsa burns formal fluid resuscitation and monitoring should follow74647 this should be begun prehospital if possible in those with burns greater than 25 tbsa46 the parkland formula can help determine the volume of intravenous fluids required over the first 24 hours the formula is based on the affected individuals tbsa and weight half of the fluid is administered over the first 8 hours and the remainder over the following 16 hours the time is calculated from when the burn occurred and not from the time that fluid resuscitation began children require additional maintenance fluid that includes glucose14 additionally those with inhalation injuries require more fluid48 while inadequate fluid resuscitation may cause problems overresuscitation can also be detrimental49 the formulas are only a guide with infusions ideally tailored to a urinary output of 30 mlh in adults or 1mlkg in children and mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mmhg14 while lactated ringers solution is often used there is no evidence that it is superior to normal saline7 crystalloid fluids appear just as good as colloid fluids and as colloids are more expensive they are not recommended5051 blood transfusions are rarely required1 they are typically only recommended when the hemoglobin level falls below 6080 gl 68 gdl52 due to the associated risk of complications14 intravenous catheters may be placed through burned skin if needed or intraosseous infusions may be used14 wound care early cooling within 30 minutes of the burn reduces burn depth and pain but care must be taken as overcooling can result in hypothermia17 it should be performed with cool water 10–25 °c 500–770 °f and not ice water as the latter can cause further injury739 chemical burns may require extensive irrigation1 cleaning with soap and water removal of dead tissue and application of dressings are important aspects of wound care if intact blisters are present it is not clear what should be done with them some tentative evidence supports leaving them intact seconddegree burns should be reevaluated after two days39 in the management of first and seconddegree burns little quality evidence exists to determine which dressing type to use53 it is reasonable to manage firstdegree burns without dressings39 while topical antibiotics are often recommended there is little evidence to support their use54 silver sulfadiazine a type of antibiotic is not recommended as it potentially prolongs healing time55 there is insufficient evidence to support the use of dressings containing silver56 or negativepressure wound therapy57 medications burns can be very painful and a number of different options may be used for pain management these include simple analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen and opioids such as morphine benzodiazepines may be used in addition to analgesics to help with anxiety39 during the healing process antihistamines massage or transcutaneous nerve stimulation may be used to aid with itching15 antihistamines however are only effective for this purpose in 20 of people58 there is tentative evidence supporting the use of gabapentin15 and its use may be reasonable in those who do not improve with antihistamines59 intravenous lidocaine requires more study before it can be recommended for pain60 intravenous antibiotics are recommended before surgery for those with extensive burns 60 tbsa61 as of 2008update guidelines do not recommend their general use due to concerns regarding antibiotic resistance54 and the increased risk of fungal infections14 tentative evidence however shows that they may improve survival rates in those with large and severe burns54 erythropoietin has not been found effective to prevent or treat anemia in burn cases14 in burns caused by hydrofluoric acid calcium gluconate is a specific antidote and may be used intravenously andor topically28 recombinant human growth hormone rhgh in those with burns that involve more than 40 of their body appears to speed healing without affecting the risk of death62 surgery wounds requiring surgical closure with skin grafts or flaps typically anything more than a small full thickness burn should be dealt with as early as possible63 circumferential burns of the limbs or chest may need urgent surgical release of the skin known as an escharotomy64 this is done to treat or prevent problems with distal circulation or ventilation64 it is uncertain if it is useful for neck or digit burns64 fasciotomies may be required for electrical burns64 alternative medicine honey has been used since ancient times to aid wound healing and may be beneficial in first and seconddegree burns65 there is tentative evidence that honey helps heal partial thickness burns66 the evidence for aloe vera is of poor quality67 while it might be beneficial in reducing pain18 and a review from 2007 found tentative evidence of improved healing times68 a subsequent review from 2012 did not find improved healing over silver sulfadiazine67 there were only three randomized controlled trials for the use of plants for burns two for aloe vera and one for oatmeal69 there is little evidence that vitamin e helps with keloids or scarring70 butter is not recommended71 in low income countries burns are treated up to onethird of the time with traditional medicine which may include applications of eggs mud leaves or cow dung22 surgical management is limited in some cases due to insufficient financial resources and availability22 there are a number of other methods that may be used in addition to medications to reduce procedural pain and anxiety including virtual reality therapy hypnosis and behavioral approaches such as distraction techniques59 prognosis prognosis in the usa72 tbsa mortality 10 06 10–20 29 20–30 86 30–40 16 40–50 25 50–60 37 60–70 43 70–80 57 80–90 73 90 85 inhalation 23 the prognosis is worse in those with larger burns those who are older and those who are females1 the presence of a smoke inhalation injury other significant injuries such as long bone fractures and serious comorbidities eg heart disease diabetes psychiatric illness and suicidal intent also influence prognosis1 on average of those admitted to united states burn centers 4 die9 with the outcome for individuals dependent on the extent of the burn injury for example admittees with burn areas less than 10 tbsa had a mortality rate of less than 1 while admittees with over 90 tbsa had a mortality rate of 8572 in afghanistan people with more than 60 tbsa burns rarely survive9 the baux score has historically been used to determine prognosis of major burns however with improved care it is no longer very accurate14 the score is determined by adding the size of the burn  tbsa to the age of the person and taking that to be more or less equal to the risk of death14 burns in 2013 resulted in 12 million years lived with disability and 123 million disability adjusted life years10 complications a number of complications may occur with infections being the most common9 in order of frequency potential complications include pneumonia cellulitis urinary tract infections and respiratory failure9 risk factors for infection include burns of more than 30 tbsa fullthickness burns extremes of age young or old or burns involving the legs or perineum73 pneumonia occurs particularly commonly in those with inhalation injuries14 anemia secondary to full thickness burns of greater than 10 tbsa is common7 electrical burns may lead to compartment syndrome or rhabdomyolysis due to muscle breakdown14 blood clotting in the veins of the legs is estimated to occur in 6 to 25 of people14 the hypermetabolic state that may persist for years after a major burn can result in a decrease in bone density and a loss of muscle mass40 keloids may form subsequent to a burn particularly in those who are young and dark skinned70 following a burn children may have significant psychological trauma and experience posttraumatic stress disorder74 scarring may also result in a disturbance in body image74 in the developing world significant burns may result in social isolation extreme poverty and child abandonment17 epidemiology disabilityadjusted life years for fires per 100000 inhabitants in 200475   no data    50   50–100   100–150   150–200   200–250   250–300   300–350   350–400   400–450   450–500   500–600    600 in 2015 fire and heat resulted in 67 million injuries4 this resulted in about 29 million hospitalizations and 238000 dying10 this is down from 300000 deaths in 199076 this makes it the 4th leading cause of injuries after motor vehicle collisions falls and violence17 about 90 of burns occur in the developing world17 this has been attributed partly to overcrowding and an unsafe cooking situation17 overall nearly 60 of fatal burns occur in southeast asia with a rate of 116 per 1000009 the number of fatal burns has changed from 280000 in 1990 to 176000 in 2015775 in the developed world adult males have twice the mortality as females from burns this is most probably due to their higher risk occupations and greater risktaking activities in many countries in the developing world however females have twice the risk of males this is often related to accidents in the kitchen or domestic violence17 in children deaths from burns occur at more than ten times the rate in the developing than the developed world17 overall in children it is one of the top fifteen leading causes of death2 from the 1980s to 2004 many countries have seen both a decrease in the rates of fatal burns and in burns generally17 developed countries an estimated 500000 burn injuries receive medical treatment yearly in the united states39 they resulted in about 3300 deaths in 20082 most burns 70 and deaths from burns occur in males112 the highest incidence of fire burns occurs in those 18–35 years old while the highest incidence of scalds occurs in children less than five years old and adults over 651 electrical burns result in about 1000 deaths per year78 lightning results in the death of about 60 people a year16 in europe intentional burns occur most commonly in middle aged men35 developing countries in india about 700000 to 800000 people per year sustain significant burns though very few are looked after in specialist burn units79 the highest rates occur in women 16–35 years of age79 part of this high rate is related to unsafe kitchens and loosefitting clothing typical to india79 it is estimated that onethird of all burns in india are due to clothing catching fire from open flames80 intentional burns are also a common cause and occur at high rates in young women secondary to domestic violence and selfharm1735 history guillaume dupuytren 1777–1835 who developed the degree classification of burns cave paintings from more than 3500 years ago document burns and their management11 the earliest egyptian records on treating burns describes dressings prepared with milk from mothers of baby boys81 and the 1500 bce edwin smith papyrus describes treatments using honey and the salve of resin11 many other treatments have been used over the ages including the use of tea leaves by the chinese documented to 600 bce pig fat and vinegar by hippocrates documented to 400 bce and wine and myrrh by celsus documented to 100 ce11 french barbersurgeon ambroise paré was the first to describe different degrees of burns in the 1500s82 guillaume dupuytren expanded these degrees into six different severities in 18321183 the first hospital to treat burns opened in 1843 in london england and the development of modern burn care began in the late 1800s and early 1900s1182 during world war i henry d dakin and alexis carrel developed standards for the cleaning and disinfecting of burns and wounds using sodium hypochlorite solutions which significantly reduced mortality11 in the 1940s the importance of early excision and skin grafting was acknowledged and around the same time fluid resuscitation and formulas to guide it were developed11 in the 1970s researchers demonstrated the significance of the hypermetabolic state that follows large burns11 references a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai aj ak al am an ao ap aq ar as at au av aw ax ay az ba bb bc bd be bf bg bh bi bj bk bl bm bn bo
