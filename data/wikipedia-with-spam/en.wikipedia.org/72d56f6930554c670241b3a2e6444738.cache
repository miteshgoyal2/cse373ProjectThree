not get into the end zone with their next three plays and had to settle for ryan succops 19yard field goal to take a 10–7 lead then after a colts threeandout smith launched a 79yard touchdown bomb to donnie avery increasing the chiefs lead to 17–7 21 seconds into the second quarter the situation continued to deteriorate for indianapolis on the first play of their next possession trent richardson

the score 24–7 this time the colts managed to respond with a 61yard scoring drive in which luck completed a 16yard pass to griff whalen and rushed for a 21yard gain after faking a hand off up the middle on a fourth and 1 conversion adam vinatieri finished the drive with a 37yard field goal cutting the score to 24–10 however smith also got to pass and rush as he carried the ball four times for 24 yards and completed five passes for 33 on an 81yard drive that ended with knile davis 4yard touchdown run putting the chiefs up 31–10 the colts managed to reach midfield on their next possession

indianapolis suddenly stormed back with 14 unanswered points first lucks 46yard completion to reserve receiver darick rogers moved the ball to the chiefs 10yard line and donald brown ran the ball into the end zone on the next play then linebacker robert mathis forced a fumble while sacking smith and fellow linebacker kelvin sheppard recovered for the colts on the chiefs 41yard line just before it

intercepted another pass from luck kansas city took over on the indianapolis 28yard line and scored on a 42yard succop field goal to give them a 17point lead 41–24 with just over five minutes left in

finishing it off with a 12yard touchdown pass to tight end coby fleener then after a threeandout kansas city punter dustin colquitts 31yard boot pinned indianapolis back at their own 10yard line but it did not stop the colts as luck completed five out of six passes for 61 yards and rushed for 12 on a 90yard scoring drive on the last play brown fumbled the ball while trying to run it into the end zone but it bounced right back into the hands of luck who took it across the goal line himself for a touchdown with this score the lead was cut to 41–38 with 1038 left in the game aided by a j jenkins 27yard reception the chiefs managed to run the clock down to 536 with their ensuing drive succop finished it off with a 43yard field goal to put the team up by six points but three plays after the kickoff luck fired a deep pass to hilton over the middle who caught it without breaking stride and took off for a 64yard touchdown catch giving indy their first lead of the game at 45–44 with 421 left

colts 39yard line smith was flagged for a 10yard intentional grounding penalty the next play netted the team six yards bringing up fourth down and 11 on the next play smith threw a deep pass to bowe along the right sideline bowe made a leaping catch with enough yardage for a first down but landed with only one foot in bounds causing a turnover on downs and allowing indianapolis to run out the

the previous postseason 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick shredded the packers for 444 total yards of offense including 181 rushing yards this time they managed to contain him a little better but the final result was still the same a green bay loss kaepernick racked up 325 offensive yards and with five minutes left he led the team on a 65yard drive to set up phil dawsons gamewinning field goal due to the 2014 north american cold wave the game was initially expected to be one of the coldest playoff games in nfl history6 but with a temperature of 5 °f −15 °c at kickoff time it was warmer than the record −9 °f −23 °c set during the 1981 afc championship game7 after the packers punted on their opening drive san francisco started off the scoring with a 69yard drive featuring a 31yard completion from kaepernick to michael crabtree that ended with dawsons 22yard field goal green bay was subsequently forced to punt again and tim masthays kick went just 29 yards to the packers 49yard line frank gore rushed four times for 21 yards for the 49ers as they drove 42 yards to go up 6–0 on dawsons second field goal the packers were forced to a threeandout on their next drive but this time their defense managed to step up and make a big play early in the second quarter cornerback tramon williams intercepted the ball from kaepernick and returned it 17 yards to the green bay 30yard line after the turnover green bay quarterback aaron rodgers completed six of seven passes for 45 yards as the team went 70 yards and 14 plays on a drive in which they never gained more than nine yards on a single play rodgers capped it off with a 5yard touchdown pass to jordy nelson that gave the packers a 7–6 lead in a notable contrast the 49ers quickly struck back scoring with just five plays as kaepernick took off for a 42yard gallop to set up gores touchdown on a 10yard run green bay responded with rodgers completing a 19yard pass to nelson and a 13yarder to running back james starks on a 59yard drive that ended with mason crosbys 34yard field goal as time expired in the half making the score 13–10 at halftime san francisco drove to the green bay 25yard line on the first drive of the second half but on third down linebacker nick perry sacked kaepernick for an 8yard loss and the 49ers decided to punt rather than attempt a long field goal following one more punt from each team rodgers led the packers on an 80yard drive to take a 17–13 lead on fullback john kuhns 1yard touchdown run the highlight of the drive was a fourth down conversion in which rodgers managed to power out of a tackle attempt and throw a pass to randall cobb for a 26yard gain however like green bays earlier touchdown the 49ers quickly struck back starting with lamichael james 37yard kickoff return to the 37yard line kaepernick then broke off a 24yard run and soon finished the drive with a 28yard touchdown pass to tight end vernon davis retaking the lead for the 49ers at 20–17 taking the ball back with just over 10 minutes left in regulation rodgers led the packers back with four completions for 46 yards including a 25yard pass to cobb crosby finished the drive with a 24yard field goal retying the game with 516 to go but this was matched by the 49ers who drove 65 yards for the gamewinning score kaepernick completed three passes for 39 yards along the way two for 28 to crabtree and also rushed for 11 gore also played a key role rushing five times for 15 yards including four consecutive carries that forced green bay to use up all their timeouts with three seconds left dawson managed to narrowly get his 33yard field goal inside the right upright to give the 49ers a 23–20 win rodgers finished the day 17for26 for 177 yards and a touchdown along with 11 rushing yards kaepernick completed 16 of 30 passes for 227 yards and a touchdown with one interception he also rushed seven times for 98 yards crabtree was the leading receiver of the game with eight receptions for 125 yards

the win was the seahawks fifth consecutive home playoff win as they have not lost at home in the playoffs since being defeated by the st louis rams in 2004 the seahawks dominated the first half jumping to a 16–0 lead while holding saints quarterback drew brees – who passed for over 5000 yards during the season – to just 34 yards new orleans was forced to punt on their opening drive and punter thomas morstead bobbled the rainsoaked ball at the snap before shanking a 16yard kick that gave seattle a first down on the saints 40yard line the seahawks then drove 20 yards aided by a penalty for unnecessary roughness on safety rafael bush and took a 3–0 lead on steven hauschkas 38yard field goal new orleans responded with a drive to the seattle 27yard line but shayne graham missed a 47yard field goal attempt seattle then drove 34 yards and increased their lead to 6–0 with hauschkas second field goal this one from 49 yards out with 37 seconds left in the first quarter on the first play of the second quarter defensive end michael bennett forced and recovered a fumble from new orleans running back mark ingram on the saints 24yard line following a 9yard run by percy harvin lynch scored on a 15yard touchdown carry to increase seattles lead to 13–0 later on the saints got a scoring opportunity when jon ryans 24yard punt gave them a first down on the seahawks 48yard line but they could only progress to the 29yard line and on fourth down and 4 linebacker bobby wagner ended the drive by breaking up brees pass on the seahawks ensuing drive lynch broke off an 18yard run while wilson completed a 16yard pass to harvin and rushed for 25 yards himself as the team drove 68 yards to take a 16–0 first half lead on hauschkas third field goal on the saints first drive of the second half they managed to reach the seahawks 34yard line but once again they failed to score as bennett and cliff avril sacked brees for a 10yard loss on third down pushing new orleans out of field goal range the saints built some momentum towards the end of the quarter on brees 23yard completion to reserve tight end josh hill on the next play brees 25yard completion to marques colston gave the team a first down on the seattle 14yard line and they eventually scored with khiry robinsons 1yard touchdown run ingram ran for a successful 2point conversion cutting their deficit to 16–8 early in the fourth quarter new orleans then forced a punt and seemed primed to score again when brees completed a 30yard pass to kenny stills from the saints 42yard line the play was negated by a holding penalty on tackle zach strief forcing a punt by the time they got the ball back again only 531 remained they subsequently drove to the seattle 30yard line but graham missed a 48yard field goal giving the ball back to the seahawks with 351 to go faced with third down and 3 after their first two plays wilson managed to complete a 24yard pass to doug baldwin for a first down on the next play lynch took off for a 31yard touchdown run giving the seahawks a 23–8 lead brees completed six of eight passes as he led his team down the field 80 yards in nine plays the last coming on fourth down and six from the seahawks nineyard line when he found colston in the end zone for a touchdown graham kicked the extra point to put new orleans within eight with twentysix seconds remaining on the subsequent kickoff grahams onside kick was bobbled by seattle receiver golden tate at the saints 42yard line allowing colston to recover for new orleans at the 41yard line on the first play of the drive brees found tight end jimmy graham for eight yards then spiked the ball to stop the clock on the next play brees found colston along the sideline at the seattle 38yard line instead of running out of bounds to stop the clock and give the saints one more chance colston turned back toward the field of play and attempted to keep the play going by relaying the ball across the field to teammate travaris cadet however the throw by colston to cadet was forward – therefore not qualifying as a lateral – resulting in an illegalforwardpass penalty which included a gameending runoff thus the seahawks won 23–15 brees finished the game with 309 passing yards and a touchdown colston caught 11 passes for 144 yards and a score bennett had six tackles half a sack two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery afc new

since 2006 the patriots played on the road in the playoffs which was also the last time they faced peyton manning when he was with the colts but the story was all about denver as their offense racked up 507 yards without turning the ball over or giving up any sacks as they advanced to their seventh super bowl in franchise history avenging a week 12 defeat in which the patriots rallied from a 24–0 halftime deficit manning set a conference championship record with 32 completions for 400 yards and two touchdowns the team also got a big performance from receiver demaryius thomas who caught seven passes for 134 yards and a touchdown and kicker matt prater who made four field goals the win was especially satisfying for head coach john fox who lost to tom brady and bill belichick in super bowl xxxviii 10 years earlier when he was with the carolina panthers midway through the first quarter manning got the broncos into scoring range with an 18yard completion to knowshon moreno a 29yard pass to thomas and a 19yarder to eric decker prater finished the drive with a 27yard field goal to put the team up 3–0 the next time denver had the ball they advanced 93 yards in 15 plays on a drive that took up nearly half the second quarter at one point they faced third and 10 from the patriots 39yard line and made the conversion with a 28yard draw play by moreno manning eventually got the team into the end zone with a 1yard pass to tight end jacob tamme making the score 10–08 this time new england managed to respond with brady completing a 27yard pass to receiver aaron dobson on the first play of their next drive this ended up as bradys longest completion of the game the patriots eventually reached the broncos 18yard line but denver lineman robert ayers sacked brady for an 11yard loss on third down forcing them to settle for stephen gostkowskis 47yard field goal denver then took the ball back and drove for more points as manning hooked up with thomas for a pair of completions that netted 53 yards prater finished things off with a 35yard field goal giving the team a 13–3 lead with 25 seconds left in the half9 denver started out the second half with a long touchdown drive that took up almost the same amount of time 708 as their last one 701 moving the ball 80 yards in 13 plays manning completed seven of eight passes for 59 yards on the drive the last a 3yard touchdown toss to thomas that increased denvers lead to 20–3 new england responded with a drive to the broncos 29yard line but on a fourth and 2 conversion attempt brady was sacked for a 10yard loss by defensive tackle terrance knighton denver then took over and set up a drive for more points with manning completing two passes to tight end julius thomas for 28 yards and a completion to demaryius thomas for 30 new england managed to halt the drive at their own 1 but prater kicked his third field goal to put denver up 23–310 new england finally scored a touchdown with just over nine minutes left in the fourth quarter starting the drive with an 18yard pass to tight end michael hoomanawanui brady followed it up with completions to austin collie and julian edelman for gains of 20 and 16 yards he eventually completed the drive with a 7yard touchdown pass to edelman cutting the score to 23–10 however denver scored again with their next possession with mannings 37yard completion to julius thomas setting up praters fourth field goal this one from 54 yards11 new england now faced a 26–10 deficit with seven minutes left in regulation brady completed five of seven passes for 54 yards on their next drive and took the ball into the end zone himself on a 5yard run however their twopoint conversion attempt failed keeping the score 26–16 then after decker recovered new englands onside kick denver managed to run the final 307 off the clock with their last drive brady finished the day 24for38 for 277 yards and touchdown along with two carries for seven yards and a score on the ground edelman caught 10 passes for 89 yards and a touchdown thomas had eight receptions for 85 yards for denver while decker had five catches for 7312 nfc championship game seattle seahawks 23 san francisco

defensive back richard sherman deflected a pass in the end zone into the arms of linebacker malcolm smith for a game clinching interception as san francisco was trying to drive for a winning score things got off to a rough start for the seahawks as their quarterback russell wilson was sacked on the first play of the game by linebacker aldon smith resulting in a fumble that was recovered on the seattle 15yard line however their defense managed to keep san francisco out of the end zone forcing them to settle for phil dawsons 25yard field goal to take a 3–0 lead there would be no more scoring until the second quarter when 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick took off for a 58yard run that gave the team a first down on the seattle 10yard line three plays later on fourth and goal running back anthony dixon dove over the goal line pile to score a 1yard touchdown run increasing the lead to 10–0 this time seattle managed to respond with wilsons 51yard completion to doug baldwin leading to a 32yard field goal by steven hauschka with just under six minutes left in the quarter near the end of the quarter the 49ers appeared to have a chance to drive for points when wilson threw an incomplete pass on fourth down from the 38yard line with 20 seconds to go defensive back carlos rogers was flagged for shoving receiver golden tate out of bounds after the incompletion resulting in a penalty that pushed san francisco back 15 yards and the team decided to run out the clock commentators joe buck and troy aikman both said they felt the penalty call was improper as it appeared to be only a mild push1314 san francisco was forced to punt on their first drive of the second half and tate returned the ball 10 yards to his 40yard line three plays later marshawn lynch scored on a 40yard touchdown run tying the score 10–10 the 49ers struck back with kaepernick completing a 22yard pass to michael crabtree and then rushing for a 22yard gain himself kaepernick fumbled the ball on the

17–10 baldwin returned the ensuing kickoff 69 yards to the 49ers 33yard line setting up hauschkas 40yard field goal that made the score 17–13 with less than four minutes left in the third quarter1516

turnovers followed first seattle defensive end cliff avril forced a fumble from kaepernick which was then recovered by michael bennett on the 49ers 23yard line seattle then drove to the 10yard line and on third down wilson completed a pass to kearse but kearse fumbled on the 1yard line as he was going in for a score while being tackled by linebacker navorro bowman replays showed bowman making a recovery and being touched down by contact but the play did not end and the ball was pulled away from bowman seattle fullback michael robinson ended up with the ball allowing the seahawks to maintain possession the play was not reviewable and to make matters worse for san francisco bowman suffered a severe leg injury now with fourth and goal on the 1yard line seattle coach pete carroll decided to go for the touchdown but lynch fumbled a handoff from wilson and the 49ers ended up getting the ball back on the seahawks 15yard line however all they managed to do with this opportunity was give it back as kaepernick was intercepted by safety kam chancellor on the second play of their ensuing drive17 now with the ball on the san francisco 40yard line seattle drove to the 29yard line where hauschka kicked a field goal to give the team a 23–17 lead with 337 left in the game san francisco responded with a drive to the seahawks 18yard line featuring a 17yard reception by running back frank gore on fourth down and 2 with 30 seconds remaining kaepernick attempted a pass to crabtree in the corner of the end zone sherman made a leaping deflection of the pass to smith for an interception to
