dates from before the kingdome was replaced by two new stadiums pioneer square is a neighborhood in the southwest corner of downtown seattle washington usa it was once the heart of the city seattles founders settled there in 1852 following a brief sixmonth settlement at alki point on the far side of elliott bay the early structures in the neighborhood were mostly wooden and nearly all burned in the great seattle fire of 1889 by the end of 1890 dozens of brick and stone buildings had been erected in their stead to this day the architectural character of the neighborhood derives from these late 19th century buildings mostly examples of richardsonian romanesque23 the neighborhood takes its name from a small triangular plaza near the corner of first avenue and yesler way originally known as pioneer place4 the pioneer squareskid road historic district a historic district including that plaza and several surrounding blocks is listed on the national register of historic places like virtually all seattle neighborhoods the pioneer square neighborhood lacks definitive borders it is bounded roughly by alaskan way s on the west beyond which are the docks of elliott bay by s king street on the south beyond which is sodo by 5th avenue s on the east beyond which is the international district and it extends between one and two blocks north of yesler way beyond which is the rest of downtown because yesler way marks the boundary between two different plats the street grid north of yesler does not line up with the neighborhoods other streets nor with the compass so the northern border of the district zigzags along numerous streets in some places the pioneer squareskid road historic district extends beyond these borders it includes union station east of 4th avenue s and several city blocks south of s king street5 contents 1 history 11 early history 12 below the line 13 late 19th century 14 20th century 141 1960s 142 1980s 15 21st century 16 crisis 2 fallen

his lumber mill which was located on elliott bay at the foot of what is now yesler way right on the border between the land claimed and soon thereafter platted by david swinson doc maynard to the south and that platted by arthur denny and carson boren much of the neighborhood is on landfill in pioneer times the area roughly between first and second avenue bounded on the south by jackson street and extending north almost to yesler way about twoandahalf city blocks was a lowlying offshore island the mainland shore roughly followed what is now yesler way to about fourth avenue then ran southeast at an angle of about 45 degrees to the current shoreline slightly inland were steep bluffs which were largely smoothed away by regrading in the late 19th and early 20th century below the line yesler way originally mill street is the main eastwest street through the pioneer square neighborhood immediately south of the square itself it was the dividing line between maynards original claim to the south and borens to the north it became the deadline the northern border of the restricted district originally maynardtown later down in the sawdust south of the slot below the line the lava bedscitation needed the tenderloin6 white chapel or wappyville6 after charles wappenstein a particularly corrupt police chief7 where low entertainment and vice were long tolerated one of the earliest names and one that stuck well into second half of the 20th century was skid row89 pioneer square pergola 1914 henry broderick approaching his 80th birthday in 1959 wrote of the neighborhood south of yesler perhaps never in all history certainly not in america has there ever existed such a massive collection of the demimonde grouped in a restricted area9 there were parlor houses with marquees celebrity madames—among them lou graham lila young and raw mcroberts—and piano professors scrupulous in their dealings the parlor houses were completely tolerated by the city at the time but there were also the far more controversial crib houses such as the midway the paris and dreamland near the corner of sixth avenue south and king street each had a hundred or more cubicles—cribs—and they were not known for any particular honesty in their dealings the city health department conducted inspections and attempted to keep venereal disease under control but the state of medicine at the time was not such as to give them any great chance of success10 besides the brothels there were an ungodly mixture of dives dumps  pawnshops hash houses dope parlors and  the et cetera that kept the police guessing box houses prospered part theater part bar part brothel as did all sorts of gambling police only dared enter the neighborhood in teams perhaps the only safe haven in the neighborhood was the saloon our house which rented out safe deposit boxes11 in 1870 father francis xavier prefontaine founded seattles first catholic church the church of our lady of good help in the heart of this district at third avenue south and washington street two decades later lou graham opened the citys most famous parlor house diagonally across the street father prefontaine is commemorated by a street in the neighborhood prefontaine place1213 late 19th century by the end of 1889 seattle had become the largest city in washington with 40000 residents that same year the great seattle fire resulted in the complete destruction of pioneer square fortunately for the neighborhood the economy was strong at the time so pioneer square was quickly rebuilt many of the new buildings show the influence of the romanesque revival architectural mode although influence of earlier victorian modes is also widespread because of drainage problems new development was built at a higher level literally burying the remains of old pioneer square anticipating the planned regrade many buildings were built with two entrances one at the old low level and another higher up visitors can take the seattle underground tour to see what remains of the old storefronts just before the fire cable car service was instituted from pioneer square along yesler way to lake washington and the leschi neighborhood 20th century pioneer square march 17 1917 in the upperright is the smith tower below it is the seattle hotel on the left are the pioneer building and the pergola during the klondike gold rush in 1897 and 1898 seattle was a center for travel to alaska thousands of socalled stampeders passed through seattle making the citys merchants prosperous a year later in 1899 a group of businessmen stole a tlingit totem pole and placed it in pioneer place park when an arsonist destroyed the pole in 1938 the city sent the pieces back to the tlingit tribe who carved a new one and gave it to seattle after finally getting paid for the one that was originally stolen in addition to the totem pole a wroughtiron victorian pergola and a bust of chief seattle were added to the park in 1909 the year 1914 saw the completion of the smith tower which at the time was the tallest building west of the mississippi river however by that time the heart of downtown seattle had moved north the building of second avenue extension in 19282914 reconfigured the eastern portion of the neighborhood by extending a piece of the northofyesler street grid south past yesler and slicing into buildings in its path14 the cable car line serving the area was shut down on august 10 1940 1960s in the 1960s pioneer square became a target of urban renewal one proposal was to replace the buildings with parking garages to serve downtown seattle in 1962 the historic seattle hotel was replaced with one such parking garage commonly referred to as the sinking ship garage because of its appearance when viewed from 1st and yesler it stands to this day another proposal was to build a ring road which would have required destroying many of pioneer squares buildings many buildings were saved by the benign neglect of landowner sam israel15 although he rarely sold any of his buildings he sold the union trust building to architect ralph anderson whose rehabilitation of that building set the pattern for the neighborhoods rehabilitation16 in 1970 preservationists such as bill speidel victor steinbrueck and others succeeded in listing the neighborhood as historic district listed on the national register of historic places later that year pioneer square became a city preservation district 1980s streetcar service returned to pioneer square on may 29 1982 with the opening of the waterfront streetcar the streetcar discontinued service on november 19 2005 since its carbarn was razed to make room for the olympic sculpture park 21st century artist gathering at all city coffee pioneer square in 2007 today pioneer
