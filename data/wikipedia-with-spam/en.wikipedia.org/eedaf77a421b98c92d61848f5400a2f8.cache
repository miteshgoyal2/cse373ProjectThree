usage of the tax regime in a single territory to ones own advantage to reduce the amount of tax that is payable by means that are within the law tax sheltering is very similar although unlike tax avoidance tax sheltering is not necessarily legal tax havens are jurisdictions which facilitate reduced taxes1 while forms of tax avoidance which use tax laws in ways not intended by governments may be considered legal it is almost never considered moral in the court of public opinion and rarely in journalism many corporations and businesses which take part in the practice experience a backlash either from their active customers or online conversely benefiting from tax laws in ways which were intended by governments is sometimes referred to as tax planning2 tax mitigation tax aggressive aggressive tax avoidance or tax neutral schemes generally refer to multiterritory schemes that fall into the grey area between commonplace and wellaccepted tax avoidance such as purchasing municipal bonds in the united states and evasion but are widely viewed as unethical especially if they are involved in profitshifting from hightax to lowtax territories and territories recognised as tax havens3 since 1995 trillions of dollars have been transferred from oecd and developing countries into tax havens using these schemes4 laws known as a general antiavoidance rule gaar statutes which prohibit tax aggressive avoidance have been passed in several developed countries including canada australia new zealand south africa norway hong kong and the united kingdom56 in addition judicial doctrines have accomplished the similar purpose notably in the united states through the business purpose and economic substance doctrines established in gregory v helvering and in the uk through the ramsay case though the specifics may vary according to jurisdiction these rules invalidate tax avoidance which is technically legal but not for a business purpose or in violation of the spirit of the tax code7 related terms for tax avoidance include tax planning and tax sheltering the term avoidance has also been used in the tax regulationsexamples and source needed of some jurisdictions to distinguish tax avoidance foreseen by the legislators from tax avoidance which exploits loopholes in the law such as likekind exchanges89correct example needed the united states supreme court has stated that the legal right of an individual to decrease the amount of what would otherwise be his taxes or altogether avoid them by means which the law permits cannot be doubted tax evasion on the other hand is the general term for efforts by individuals corporations trusts and other entities to evade taxes by illegal means both tax evasion and some forms of tax avoidance can be viewed as forms of tax noncompliance as they describe a range of activities that are unfavorable to a states tax system10 contents 1 antiavoidance measures 2 methods 21 country of residence 22 double taxation 23

not otherwise be regarded as a reasonable course of action methodsedit country of residenceedit a company may choose to avoid taxes by establishing their company or subsidiaries in an offshore jurisdiction see offshore company and offshore trust individuals may also avoid tax by moving their tax residence to a tax haven such as monaco or by becoming a perpetual traveler they may also reduce their tax by moving to a country with lower tax rates however a small number of countries tax their citizens on their worldwide income regardless of where they reside as of 2012update only the united states and eritrea have such a practice whilst finland france hungary italycitation needed and spain apply it in limited circumstances in cases such as the us taxation cannot be avoided by simply transferring assets or moving abroad11 the united states is unlike almost all other countries in that its citizens and permanent residents are subject to us federal income tax on their worldwide income even if they reside temporarily or permanently outside the united states us citizens therefore cannot avoid us taxes simply by emigrating from the us according to forbes magazine some citizens choose to give up their united states citizenship rather than be subject to the us tax system12 however us citizens who reside or spend long periods of time outside the us may be able to exclude some salaried income earned overseas but not other types of income unless specified in a bilateral tax treaty from income in computing the us federal income tax the 2015 limit on the amount that can be excluded is us100800 in addition taxpayers can exclude or deduct certain foreign housing amounts they may also be entitled to exclude from income the value of meals and lodging provided by their employer13 some american parents don’t register their children’s birth abroad with american authorities because they do not want their children to be required to report all earnings to the irs and pay american taxes for their entire lives even if they never visit the united states14 double taxationedit most countries impose taxes on income earned or gains realized within that country regardless of the country of residence of the person or firm most countries have entered into bilateral double taxation treaties with many other countries to avoid taxing nonresidents twice—once where the income is earned and again in the country of residence and perhaps for us citizens taxed yet again in the country of citizenship—however there are relatively few doubletaxation treaties with countries regarded as tax havens15 to avoid tax it is usually not enough to simply move ones assets to a tax haven one must also personally move to a tax haven and for us citizens renounce ones citizenship to avoid tax

article as appropriate april 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message without changing country of residence or if a us citizen without giving up ones citizenship personal taxation may be legally avoided by the creation of a separate legal entity to which ones property is donated the separate legal entity is often a company trust or foundation these may also be located offshore such as in the case of many private foundations assets are transferred to the new company or trust so that gains may be realized or income earned within this legal entity rather than earned by the original owner if assets are later transferred back to an individual then capital gains taxes would apply on all profits also income tax would still be due on any salary or dividend drawn from the legal entity for a settlor creator of a trust to avoid tax there may be restrictions on the type purpose and beneficiaries of the trust for example the settlor of the trust may not be allowed to be a trustee or even a beneficiary and may thus lose control of the assets transferred andor may be unable to benefit from them legal vaguenessedit tax results depend on definitions of legal terms which are usually vague for example vagueness of the distinction between business expenses and personal expenses is of much concern for taxpayers and tax authorities more generally any term of tax law has a vague penumbra and is a potential source of tax avoidance16 tax sheltersedit the examples and perspective in this section may not represent a worldwide view of the subject you may improve this article discuss the issue on the talk page or create a new article as appropriate april 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message tax shelters are investments that allow and purport to allow a reduction in ones income tax liability although things such as home ownership pension plans and individual retirement accounts iras can be broadly considered tax shelters insofar as funds in them are not taxed provided that they are held within the individual retirement account for the required amount of time the term tax shelter was originally used to describe primarily certain investments made in the form of limited partnerships some of which were deemed by the us internal revenue service to be abusive the internal revenue service and the united states department of justice have recently teamed up to crack down on abusive tax shelters in 2003 the senates permanent subcommittee on investigations held hearings about tax shelters which are entitled us tax shelter industry the role of accountants lawyers and financial professionals many of these tax shelters were designed and provided by accountants at the large american accounting firms examples of us tax shelters include foreign leveraged investment program flip and offshore portfolio investment strategy opis both were devised by partners at the accounting firm kpmg these tax shelters were also known as basis shifts or defective redemptions prior to 1987 passive investors in certain limited partnerships such as oil exploration or real estate investment ventures were allowed to use the passive losses if any of the partnership ie losses generated by partnership operations in which the investor took no material active part to offset the investors income lowering the amount of income tax that otherwise would be owed by the investor these partnerships could be structured so that an investor in a high tax bracket could obtain a net economic benefit from partnershipgenerated passive losses in the tax reform act of 1986 the us congress introduced the limitation under 26 usc § 469 on the deduction of passive losses and the use of passive activity tax credits the 1986 act also changed the at risk loss rules of 26 usc § 465 coupled with the hobby loss rules 26 usc § 183 the changes greatly reduced tax avoidance by taxpayers engaged in activities only to generate deductible losses transfer mispricingedit main article transfer mispricing fraudulent transfer pricing sometimes called transfer mispricing also known as transfer pricing manipulation17 refers to trade between related parties at prices meant to manipulate markets or to deceive tax authorities for example if company a a food grower in africa processes its produce through three subsidiaries x in africa y in a tax haven usually offshore financial centers and z in the united states now company x sells its product to company y at an artificially low price resulting in a low profit and a low tax for company x based in africa company y then sells the product to company z at an artificially high price almost as high as the retail price at which company z would sell the final product in the us company z as a result would report a low profit and therefore a low tax about 60 of capital flight from africa is from improper transfer pricing18 such capital flight from the developing world is estimated at ten times the size of aid it receives and twice the debt service it pays1920 the african union reports estimates that about 30 of subsaharan africas gdp has been moved to tax havens21 solutions include corporate “countrybycountry reporting” where corporations disclose activities in each country and thereby prohibit the use of tax havens where real economic activity occurs18 tax avoidersedit united kingdomedit hmrc the uk tax collection agency estimated that the overall cost of tax avoidance in the uk in 201415 was £22 billion of which £13 billion was loss of income tax national insurance contributions and capital gains tax the rest came from loss of corporation tax vat and other direct taxes22 this compares to the wider tax gap the difference between the amount of tax that should in theory be collected by hmrc against what is actually collected in that year of £36 billion22 the uk government has done little to prevent tax avoidance23 figures published by the tax justice network show that the uk had one of the lowest rates of tax losses due to profit shifting by multinational companies with the fourth lowest rate out of 102 countries studied24 according to the figures the uk lost £1 billion from profit shifting around 004 of its gdp coming behind botswana 002 ecuador 002 and sweden 000425 large companies accused of tax avoidanceedit in 2008 it was reported by private eye that tesco utilized offshore holding companies in luxembourg and partnership agreements to reduce corporation tax liability by up to £50 million a year26 another scheme previously identified by private eye involved depositing £1 billion in a swiss partnership and then loaning out that money to overseas tesco stores so that profit can be transferred indirectly through interest payments this scheme is reported to remain in operation and is estimated to be costing the uk exchequer up to £20 million a year in corporation tax2627 in 2011 actionaid reported that 25 of the ftse 100 companies avoided taxation by locating their subsidiaries in tax havens this increased to 98 when using the stricter us congress definition of tax haven and bank secrecy jurisdictions28 in 2016 it was reported in the private eye current affairs magazine that four out of the ftse top 10 companies paid no corporation tax at all29 tax avoidance by corporations came to national attention in 2012 when mps singled out google amazoncom and starbucks for criticism30 following accusations that the three companies were diverting hundreds of millions of pounds in uk profits to secretive tax havens there was widespread outrage across the uk followed by boycotts of products by google amazoncom and starbucks3132 following the boycotts and damage to brand image starbucks promised to move its tax base from the netherlands to london and to pay hmrc £20million33 but executives from amazoncom and google defended their tax avoidance as being within the law google has remained the subject of criticism in the uk regarding their use of the double irish dutch sandwich and bermuda black hole tax avoidance schemes34 similarly amazon remains the subject of criticism across the uk and eu for its tax avoidance with a sweetheart deal between luxembourg and amazoncom enabling the american company to pay little to no corporate tax across europe declared illegal in 201535 paypal ebay microsoft twitter and facebook have also been found to be using the double irish and dutch sandwich schemes up to 1000 individuals in the same year were also discovered to be using k2 to avoid tax36 other uk active corporations mentioned in relation to tax avoidance in 2015 particularly the double irish dutch sandwich and bermuda black hole technology apple microsoft paypal ebay intel yahoo facebook uber netflix hewlettpackard ibm and twitter37 retail

corporations mentioned in relation to tax avoidance in later years have been vodafone astrazeneca sabmiller glaxosmithkline and british american tobacco29 tax avoidance has not always related to corporation tax a number of companies including tesco sainsburys wh smith boots and marks and spencer used a scheme to avoid vat by forcing customers paying by card to unknowingly pay a 25 card transaction fee though the total charged to the customer remained the same such schemes came to light after hmrc litigated against debenhams over the scheme during 200543 general antiavoidance ruleedit since the late 1990s new labour consulted on a general antiavoidance rule gaar for taxation before deciding against the idea by 2003 public interest in a gaar surged as evidence of the scale of tax avoidance used by individuals in the financial and other sectors became apparent though in its 2004 budget the labour government announced a new disclosure regime as an alternative whereby tax avoidance schemes would be required to be disclosed to the revenue departments44 in december 2010 the new coalition government commissioned a report which would consider whether there should be a general antiavoidance rule for the uk which recommended that the uk should introduce such a rule which was introduced in 2013 the rule prevents the reduction of tax by legal arrangements where those arrangements are put in place purely to reduce tax and would not otherwise be regarded as a reasonable course of action6 following the panama papers leak private eye the guardian and other british media outlets noted that edward troup who became executive chair of hm revenue and customs worked with simmons simmons in 2004 representing corporate tax havens and opposed the gaar in 1998454647 historical tax avoidanceedit window taxedit avoiding the window tax in england one historic example of tax avoidance still evident today was the payment of window tax it was introduced in england and wales in 1696 with the aim of imposing tax on the relative prosperity of individuals without the controversy of introducing an income tax48 the bigger the house the more windows it was likely to have and the more tax the occupants would pay nevertheless the tax was unpopular because it was seen by some as a tax on lightleading to the phrase daylight robbery and led property owners to block up windows to avoid it49 the tax was repealed in 185150 deliberate roof destructionedit other historic examples of tax avoidance were the deliberate destructions of roofs in scotland to avoid substantial property taxes the roof of slains castle was removed in 1925 and the building has deteriorated since51 the owners fetteresso castle now restored deliberately destroyed their roof after world war ii in protest at the new taxes united statesedit see also united states as a tax haven an irs report indicates that in 2009 1470 individuals earning more than 1000000 annually faced a net tax liability of zero or less52 also in 1998 alone a total of 94 corporations faced a net liability of less than half the full 35 corporate tax rate and the corporations lyondell chemical texaco chevron csx tosco pepsico owens minor pfizer jp morgan saks goodyear ryder enron colgatepalmolive worldcom eaton weyerhaeuser general motors el paso energy westpoint stevens medpartners phillips petroleum mckesson and northrup grumman all had net negative tax liabilities53 additionally this phenomenon was widely documented regarding general electric in early 201154 furthermore a government accountability office study found that from 1998 to 2005 55 percent of united states companies paid no federal income taxes during at least one year in a sevenyear period it studied5556 a review in 2011 by citizens for tax justice and the institute on taxation and economic policy of companies in the fortune 500 profitable every year from 2008 through 2010 stated these companies paid an average tax rate of 185 and that 30 of these companies actually had a negative income tax due57 in 2012 hewlettpackard lost a lawsuit with the irs over a foreign tax credit generator which was engineered by a division of aig58 al jazeera also wrote in 2012 that rich individuals and their families have as much as 32 trillion of hidden financial assets in offshore tax havens representing up to 280bn in lost income tax revenues john christensen of the tax justice network told al jazeera that he was shocked by the sheer scale of the figures were talking about very big wellknown brands – hsbc citigroup bank of america ubs credit suisse and they do it knowing fully well that their clients more often than not are evading and avoiding taxes much of this activity christensen added was illegal59 as a result of the tax sheltering the government responded with treasury in treasury department circular 230 in 2010 the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 codified the economic substance rule of gregory v helvering 193560 the us public interest research group said in 2014 that the united states loses roughly 184 billion per year due to corporations such as pfizer microsoft and citigroup using offshore tax havens to avoid paying us taxes according to pirg pfizer paid no us income taxes 2010–2012 despite earning 43 billion the corporation received more than 2 billion in federal tax refunds in 2013 pfizer operated 128 subsidiaries in tax havens and had 69 billion offshore which could not be collected by the internal revenue service irs microsoft maintains five tax haven subsidiaries and held 764 billion overseas in 2013 thus saving the corporation 244 billion in taxes citigroup maintained 21 subsidiaries in tax haven countries in 2013 and kept 438 billion in offshore jurisdictions thus saving the corporation an additional 117 billion in taxes61 public opinionedit tax avoidance may be considered to be the dodging of ones duties to society or alternatively the right of every citizen to structure ones affairs in a manner allowed by law to pay no more tax than what is required attitudes vary from approval through neutrality to outright hostility attitudes may vary depending on the steps taken in the avoidance scheme or the perceived unfairness of the tax being avoided62 in 2008 the charity christian aid published a report death and taxes the true toll of tax dodging which criticised tax exiles and tax avoidance by some of the worlds largest companies linking tax evasion to the deaths of millions of children in developing countries63 however the research behind these calculations has been questioned in a 2009 paper prepared for the uk department for international development64 according to the financial times there is a growing trend for charities to prioritise tax avoidance as a key campaigning issue with policy makers across the world considering changes to make tax avoidance more difficult65 in 2010 tax avoidance became a hotbutton issue in the uk an organisation uk uncut began to encourage people to protest at local highstreet shops that were thought to be avoiding tax such as vodafone topshop and the arcadia group66 in 2012 during the occupy movement in the united states tax avoidance for the 99 was proposed as a protest tool67 prem sikka professor of accounting at the essex business school university of essex and scientific advisor of the tax justice network pointed to a discrepancy between the corporate social responsibility claims of multinational companies and “their internal dynamics aimed at maximising their profits through things like tax avoidance” he wrote in an article commenting the lux leaks publications “big corporations and accountancy firms are engaged in organised hypocrisy”68 fair tax markedit as a response to public opinion regarding tax avoidance the fair tax mark was established in the uk during 2014 as an independent certification scheme to identify companies which pay taxes in accordance with the spirit of all tax laws and not to use options allowances or reliefs or undertake specific transactions that are contrary to the spirit of the law6970 the mark is operated by a notforprofit community benefit society awardees of this mark include the coop71 sse goahead group lush cosmetics marshalls several large regional cooperatives east of england midcounties scotmid and the phone coop government and judicial responseedit this section only describes one highly specialized aspect of its associated subject please help improve this article by adding more general information the talk page may contain suggestions september 2011 tax avoidance reduces government revenue so governments with a stricter antiavoidance stance seek to prevent tax avoidance or keep it within limits the obvious way to do this is to frame tax rules so that there is a smaller scope for avoidance in practice this has not always been achievable and has led to an ongoing battle between governments amending legislation and tax advisors finding new scopeloopholes for tax avoidance in the amended rulescitation needed to allow prompter response to tax avoidance schemes the us tax disclosure regulations 2003 require prompter and fuller disclosure than previously required a tactic which was applied in the uk in 2004 some countries such as canada australia united kingdom and new zealand have introduced a statutory general antiavoidance rule or general antiabuse rule gaar canada also uses foreign accrual property income rules to obviate certain types of tax avoidance in the united kingdom many provisions of the tax legislation known as antiavoidance provisions apply to prevent tax avoidance where the main object or purpose or one of the main objects or purposes of a transaction is to enable tax advantages to be obtained in the united states the internal revenue service distinguishes some schemes as abusive and therefore illegal the alternative minimum tax was developed to reduce the impact of certain tax avoidance schemes furthermore while tax avoidance is in principle legal if the irs in its sole judgment determines that tax avoidance is the principal purpose for an expatriation attempt covered expat status will be applied to the requester thereby forcing an expatriation tax on worldwide assets to be paid as a condition of expatriation72 the irs presumes a principal purpose of tax avoidance if a taxpayer requesting expatriation has a net worth of 622000 or more or has had more than 124000 in average annual net income tax over the 5 tax years ending before the date of expatriation united kingdomedit see also panama papers § united kingdom in the uk judicial doctrines to prevent tax avoidance began in irc v ramsay 1981 which decided that where a transaction has prearranged artificial steps that serve no commercial purpose other than to save tax the proper approach is to tax the effect of the transaction as a whole this is known as the ramsay principle and this case was followed by furniss v dawson 1984 which extended the ramsay principle this approach has been rejected in most commonwealth jurisdictions even in those where uk cases are generally regarded as persuasive after two decades there have been numerous decisions with inconsistent approaches and both the revenue authorities and professional advisors remain quite unable to predict outcomes for this reason this approach can be seen as a failure or at best only partly successful in the judiciary different judges have taken different attitudes as a generalisation for example judges in the united kingdom before the 1970s regarded tax avoidance with neutrality but nowadays they may regard aggressive tax avoidance with increasing hostility in the uk in 2004 the labour government announced that it would use retrospective legislation to counteract some tax avoidance schemes and it has subsequently done so on a few occasions notably bn66 initiatives announced in 2010 suggest an increasing willingness on the part of hmrc to use retrospective action to counter avoidance schemes even when no warning has been given73 the uk government has pushed the initiative led by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd on base erosion and profit shifting74 in the 2015 autumn statement chancellor george osborne announced that £800m would be spent on tackling tax avoidance in order to recover £5 billion a year by 2019–20 in addition large companies will now have to publish their uk tax strategies and any large businesses that persistently engage in aggressive tax planning will be subject to special measures75 with these policies osborne has claimed to be at the forefront of combating tax avoidance76 however he has been criticised over his perceived inaction on enacting policies set forth by the oecd to combat tax avoidance29 in april 2015 the chancellor george osborne announced a tax on diverted profits quickly nicknamed the google tax by the press designed to discourage large companies moving profits out of the uk to avoid tax77 in 2016 google agreed to pay back £130m of tax dating back to 2005 to hmrc which said it was the full tax due in law78 however this amount of tax has been criticised by labour with labour leader jeremy corbyn saying that the rate of tax paid by google only amounted to 378 former liberal democrat business secretary vince cable also said google had got off very very lightly and osborne made a fool of himself by hailing the deal as a victory78 although claiming that it was absurd to lay blame onto google for tax avoidance saying that eu member states should compete with each other to offer firms the lowest corporate tax rates conservative mp boris johnson said it was a good thing for corporations to pay more tax79 however johnson said he did not want tax rates to go up or for european union countries to do this in unison79 see alsoedit fair tax town movement gregory v helvering
