years ago prominent native american duwamish villages of the lushootseed skagitnisqually coast salish nations were on a thenlarger portage bay at what is now called brooklyn avenue and the other on a larger union bay near the present uw power plant which is across from the uw ima building around the north shores a mile farther than today and shores east of what is now the union bay natural area see also adjacent ravenna neighborhood the duwamish5 people of the inside tribe had the prominent village of swahtsoogweel portage on thenadjacent union bay and what is now ravenna was their backyard before the arrival of european settlers6 villages were diffuse in spring people dispersed from their winter villages of longhouses to camps gathering in summer for salmon gaps in the forest were maintained to encourage game and food supplies such prairies anthrogenic grasslands were cultivated in what is now the university district7 they were connected by a welltravelled path along what is now the lake washington ship canal 1883 1916 surveyors noted several large douglasfirs and western red cedars given that large trees were not unusual back then these must have been especially large the u district was first surveyed in 1855 and its first white settlers arrived 12 years later in 1890 that part of the neighborhood due west of the present uw campus was laid out as the brooklyn addition one year later much of the land north of the ship canal including brooklyn was annexed to seattle the uw moved from downtown in 1893 and the first university building was built in 1895 an

avenue later 14th avenue in 1892 and the neighborhood soon began to be called university station after the heated waiting house at the corner of what is now ne 42nd street 1895 the name brooklyn is not lost however for brooklyn avenue ne runs parallel to university way one block west1 north and west of the campus within the university district the university heights—a name now little used—was named for its elementary school 1903–c1988 since 1990 the university heights center for the community association hosts numerous activities small and large from the university district community clean
