chinese characters mainland china also known as the chinese mainland is the geopolitical as well as geographical area under the direct jurisdiction of the peoples republic of china prc it generally includes hainan island and excludes the special administrative regions of hong kong and macau even though both are partially on the geographic mainland continental landmass the term mainland china was coinedcitation needed by the kuomintang kmt party after receiving control of taiwan from japan after world war ii by 1949 the kmtled republic of china roc government was defeated in the chinese civil war and fled to the island of taiwan where the kmt pledged to retake the mainland the kmt considers both sides of the taiwan strait including taiwan as one nation whereas taiwans democratic progressive party dpp considers only mainland china as china and taiwan as a separate entity and countrycitation needed there are two terms in chinese for mainland dàlù 大陆 大陸 which means the continent and nèidì 内地 內地 literally inland or inner land in the prc the usage of the two terms are generally interchangeable and there is no prescribed method of reference in any jurisdiction to emphasize equal footing in crossstrait relations the term is used in official contexts with reference to taiwan with the prc referring to itself as the mainland side as opposed to the taiwan side but in its relations with hong kong and macau the prc government refers to itself as the central peoples government mainland area is the opposing term to free area of the republic of china used in the roc constitution as amended in april 2000 it treats the mainland as part of rocs territory despite the lack of effective control1 contents 1 background 2 political use 21 in mainland china 22 in taiwan 23 in hong kong and macau 24 others 3 other terms 4 see also 5 references 51 citations 52 sources 6 external links backgroundedit by 1949 the communist party of chinas cpc peoples liberation army had largely defeated the kuomintang kmts national revolutionary army in the chinese civil war on the mainland this forced the kuomintang to relocate the government and institutions of the republic of china to the relative safety of taiwan an island which was placed under the control of the republic of china after the surrender of japan at the end of world war ii in 1945 with the establishment of the peoples republic of china on october 1 1949 the cpccontrolled government saw itself as the sole legitimate government of china2 competing with the claims of the republic of china whose authority is now limited to taiwan and other islands this has resulted in a situation in which two coexisting governments compete for international legitimacy and recognition as the government of china the phrase mainland china emerged as a politically neutral term to refer to the area under control of the communist party of china and later to the administration of the prc itself until the late 1970s both the prc and roc envisioned a military takeover of the other during this time the roc referred to the prc government as communist bandits 共匪 while the prc referred to the roc as chiang bandits 蔣匪 later as a military solution became less feasible the roc referred to the prc as communist china 中共 with the democratization of taiwan in the 1990s the phrase mainland china soon grew to mean not only the area under the control of the communist party of china but also a more neutral means to refer to the peoples republic of china government this usage remains prevalent by the kmt today due to their status as colonies of foreign states during the establishment of the peoples republic of china in 1949 the phrase mainland china excludes hong kong and macau3 since the return of hong kong and macau to chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999 respectively the two territories have retained their legal political and economic systems the territories also have their distinct identities therefore mainland china generally continues to exclude these territories because of the one country two systems policy adopted by the prc central government towards the regions4 the term is also used in economic indicators such as the imd competitiveness report international news media often use china to refer only to mainland china or the peoples republic of china political useedit in mainland chinaedit in the peoples republic of china the term 内地 inland is often contrasted with the term 境外 outside of the border for things outside of the mainland region examples include administration of foreignfunded banks 中華人民共和國外資銀行管理條例 or the measures on administration of representative offices of foreign insurance institutions 外國保險機構駐華代表機構管理辦法4 hainan is an offshore island therefore geographically not part of the continental mainland nevertheless politically it is common practice to consider it part of the mainland because its government legal and political systems do not differ from the rest of the peoples republic in the geographical mainland nonetheless hainanese people still refer to the geographic mainland as the mainland and call its residents mainlanders5 in some coastal provinces such as guangdong fujian and jiangsu people often call the area of noncoastal provinces in of mainland china as inland 内地 in taiwanedit in taiwan the kuomintang kmt chinese nationalist party and its supporters use the term mainland is to refer to the territory of the prc hong kong and macau excluded67better source needed this accords with the kmt position that china encompasses both sides of the taiwan strait8 since the kmt was the longtime ruling and only party in taiwan until 2000 and had set up the educational system and taught children the term since its takeover in 1945 the term has been in mainstream use and usually has no particular political connotations since generations born after the takeover were taught that taiwan is part of republic of china and so is mainland china and that they are chinesecitation needed government organizations and official and legal documents in taiwan including the republic of china constitution also use the mainland to refer to mainland china since the roc government has never recognized the founding of the prc and because its constitution does not allow the existence of another state within its territory constitutional amendments made in the 1990s had to refer to the area occupied by prc as mainland since it is officially considered still part of the roc territory but just enemy occupied in contrast the protaiwan independence democratic progressive party dpp prefer to use the term china instead referring to the prc to imply that taiwan roc is separate from china89 related to this naming and broader national identity issue the dpp would also like to amend the roc constitution to limit its scope and territorial description to the free area of the republic of china only and rectify the roc country name to republic of taiwan instead thereby eliminating the need to refer to the mainland area and free area altogether10 in 1992 a highlevel political meeting between the roc and prc was held in hong kong where what became called the 1992 consensus developed this consensus essentially reaffirmed that both the roc then under kmt administration and the prc agree there is only one china in a definition that covers both sides of taiwan strait but they differ on their own interpretation of what that china means each interprets and believes it is the china and has a claim on the territories held by the other in this context the term mainland china is agreeable to both sides since they both conceive china as including mainland and taiwan and therefore need this term to distinguish the two areas however since it was the kmt who came to this consensus with china the pan green coalition does not embrace this term as the pan blue coalition does in taiwan under the concept of mainlander another comparative term often used is waishengren 外省人 wàishěngrén external province persons which are the people who immigrated to taiwan from mainland china with the kuomintang kmt around the end of the chinese civil war in 1949 as well as their descendants born in taiwan the status of waishengren in taiwan is a divisive political issue for many years certain groups of mainlanders were given special treatment by the kmt government which had imposed martial law on taiwan more recently protaiwan independence politicians calling into question their loyalty and devotion to taiwan and prochinese reunification politicians accusing the proindependence politicians of playing identity politics11 the term mainlander mostly refers to daluren 大陆人 大陸人 dàlùrén mainland persons meaning people who live in mainland china after the republic of chinas relocation to taiwan the kuomintang partystate embued the term dalu with nostalgic overtones associating it with the land of the utopian past and childhood schoolchildren were taught slogans like counterattack the mainland 反攻大陸！ and save our mainland compatriots from the deepest water and hottest fire 拯救大陸同胞于水深火熱之中！12 the taiwanese were also told that they were the guardians of traditional chinese culture until political reunification however democratization on taiwan has led to the rise of voices which denounced traditional attitudes towards the mainland and the ancestral home system pressing for taiwanization desinicization and taiwan cultural independence 文化台獨 concurrently the mainland chinese economic reform changed the connotation of mainland china to one of primitiveness nativeness and raw cultural material for economic gain as well as condescention because of taiwans comparatively advanced economy12 warlike phrases like counterattack the mainland saw a revival but in reference to the economic expansion of taiwanese businesses despite the rebranding of the kuomintang in the 1990s as a party native to taiwan kuomintang continues to produce a variety of mainlandrelated media such as the television program searching for the strange on the mainland 大陸尋奇12 in hong kong and macauedit in hong kong and macau the terms mainland china and mainlander are frequently used for people from chinas mainland the chinese term neidi 內地 meaning the inland but still translated mainland in english is commonly applied by sar governments to represent nonsar areas of prc including hainan island the smallest and southernmost province of the peoples republic of china and coastal regions of mainland china such as constitutional and mainland affairs 政制及內地事務局13 and immigration departments14 in the mainland and hong kong closer economic partnership arrangement as well as the mainland and macau closer economic partnership arrangement the cpg also uses the chinese characters 内地 inner land with the note that they refer to the customs territory of china15 othersedit in the united states taiwan relations act the roccontrolled islands of quemoy and matsu were excluded from the definition of taiwan and are regarded as parts of mainland china the house foreign affairs committee justified this exclusion on the grounds that quemoy and matsu are
