refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 the classical period this article is about the broad span of time from before the 6th century ad to the present day which includes the classical period and various other periods1 the central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900 which is known as the commonpractice period the major time divisions of western art music are as

neoclassicism 1920–1950 predominantly in the interwar period the postmodern 1930–present eras the experimental 1950–present contemporary 1945 or 1975–present european art music is largely distinguished from many other noneuropean classical and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation in use since about the 11th century2 western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches eg melodies basslines chords tempo metre and rhythms for a piece of musicclarification needed this can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation which are frequently heard in noneuropean art music and in popularmusic3clarification needed4not in citation given5 styles such as jazz and blues another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song strophic form or a derivation of this form classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the fugue concerto symphony sonata and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera6 the term classical music did not appear until the early 19th century in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from johann sebastian bach to beethoven as a golden age7 the earliest reference to classical music recorded by the oxford english dictionary is from about 183618 contents 1 characteristics 11

template message given the wide range of styles in european classical music from medieval plainchant sung by monks to classical and romantic symphonies for orchestra from the 1700s and 1800s to avantgarde atonal compositions for solo piano from the 1900s it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type however there are characteristics that classical music contains that few or no other genres of music contain9 such as the use of music notationclarification needed and the performance of complex forms of solo instrumental works eg the fugue furthermore while the symphony did not exist prior to the late 18th century the symphony ensemble—and the works written for it—have become a defining feature of classical musiccitation needed literatureedit the key characteristic of european classical music that distinguishes it from popular music and folk music is that the repertoire tends to be written down in musical notation creating a musical part or score this score typically determines details of rhythm pitch and where two or more musicians whether singers or instrumentalists are involved how the various parts are coordinated the written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them fugues for instance achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in counterpoint yet creating a coherent harmonic logic that would be difficult to achieve in the heat of live improvisation10clarification needed the use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago musical notation enables 2000sera performers to sing a choral work from the 1300s renaissance era or a 1700s baroque concerto with many of the features of the music the melodies lyrics forms and rhythms being reproducedcitation needed that said the score does allow the interpreter to make choices on how to perform a historical workcitation needed for example if the tempo is written with an italian instruction eg allegro it is not known exactly how fast the piece should be played as well in the baroque era many works that were designed for basso continuo accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument harpsichord lute etc should play the chords which are not notated in the partclarification needed only a figured bass symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chordplaying performer the performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece including the phrasing of melodies the time taken during fermatas held notes or pauses and the use or choice not to use of effects such as vibrato or glissando these effects are possible on various stringed brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice although classical music in the 2000s has lost most of its tradition for musical improvisation from the baroque era to the romantic era there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era in the baroque era organ performers would improvise preludes keyboard performers playing harpsichord would improvise chords from the figured bass symbols beneath the bass notes of the basso continuo part and both vocal and instrumental performers would improvise musical ornaments11 johann sebastian bach was particularly noted for his complex improvisations12 during the classical era the composerperformer mozart was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles13 during the classical era some virtuoso soloists would improvise the cadenza sections of a concerto during the romantic era beethoven would improvise at the piano14 for more information see improvisation instrumentation and vocal practicesedit see also woodwind section brass section string section percussion section and keyboard section the instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid19th century often much earlier and codified in the 18th and 19th centuries they consist of the instruments found in an orchestra or in a concert band together with several other solo instruments such as the piano harpsichord and organ the symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music15 and includes members of the string woodwind brass and percussion families of instruments the concert band consists of members of the woodwind brass and percussion families it generally has a larger variety and number of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section however many concert bands use a double bass the vocal practices changed over the classical period from the single line monophonic gregorian chant done by monks in the medieval period to the complex polyphonic choral works of the renaissance and subsequent periods which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time medieval musicedit many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist but in different forms medieval instruments included the flute the recorder and plucked string instruments like the lute as well early versions of the organ fiddle or vielle and trombone called the sackbut existed medieval instruments in europe had most commonly been used singly often self accompanied with a drone note or occasionally in parts from at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into haut loud shrill outdoor instruments and bas quieter more intimate instruments16 during the earlier medieval period the vocal music from the liturgical genre predominantly gregorian chant was monophonic using a single unaccompanied vocal melody line17 polyphonic vocal genres which used multiple independent vocal melodies began to develop during the high medieval era becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century notable composers of this time include hildegard of bingen léonin pérotin philippe de vitry guillaume de machaut francesco landini and johannes ciconia renaissance musicedit this section does not cite any

and the recorder vocal music in the renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate polyphonic style the principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire renaissance period were masses and motets with some other developments towards the end especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms such as the madrigal for their own designs

different types of keyboard instruments eg pipe organ harpsichord or clavichord additional stringed chordal instruments eg a lute and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo including bowed strings woodwinds and brass instruments eg a cello contrabass viol bassoon serpent etc vocal developments in the baroque era included the development of opera types such as

instruments from the baroque era such as the cello contrabass recorder trombone timpani fortepiano the precursor to the modern piano and organ while some baroque instruments fell into disuse eg the theorbo and rackett many baroque instruments were changed into the versions that are still in use today such as the baroque violin which became the violin the baroque oboe which became the oboe and the baroque trumpet which transitioned to the regular valved trumpet during the classical era the stringed instruments used in orchestra and chamber music such as string quartets were standardized as

the orchestra the existing classical instruments and sections were retained string section woodwinds brass and percussion but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller bigger sound for example while a baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players a romantic orchestra could have as many as ten as music grew more expressive the standard orchestral palette just wasnt rich

development in musical language that occurred from 1890 to 1930 a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic melodic sonic and rhythmic aspects of music and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of modernism in the arts of the time the operative word most associated with it is innovation22 its leading feature is a linguistic plurality which is to say that no single music genre ever assumed a dominant position23 contemporary classical musicedit contemporary classical music is the period that came into prominence in the mid1970s it includes different variations of modernist postmodern neoromantic and pluralist music24

about the same time as other types of contemporary classical music ie around 1930 it shares characteristics with postmodernist art—that is art that comes after and reacts against modernism postpostmodern instrumentationedit many instruments that in the 2010s are associated with popular music filled important roles in early music such as bagpipes theorbos vihuelas hurdygurdies handcranked string instruments accordions alphorns hydraulises calliopes sistrums and some woodwind instruments such as tin whistles panpipes shawms and crumhorns on the other hand instruments such as the acoustic guitar once associated mainly with popular music gained prominence in classical music in the 19th and 20th centuries in the form of the classical guitar and banjo while equal temperament gradually accepted as the dominant musical temperament during the 19th century different historical temperaments are often used for music from earlier periods for instance music of the english renaissance is often performed in meantone temperament as well while professional orchestras and pop bands all around the world have tuned to an a fixed at 440 hz since the late 19th century there was historically a great variety in the tuning pitch as attested to in historical pipe organs that still exist26unreliable source performanceedit youth concert band in performance performers who have

conservatory college or university such as a bachelor of music or master of music degree which includes individual lessons from professors in classical music extensive formal music education and training often to postgraduate masters degree level is required27 performance of classical music repertoire requires a proficiency in sightreading and ensemble playing harmonic principles strong ear

cases of women being hired in professional orchestras was in the position of harpist the vienna philharmonic for example did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997 far later than the other orchestras ranked among the worlds top five by gramophone in 200828 the last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the berlin philharmonic29 as late as february 1996 the vienna philharmonics principal flute dieter flury told westdeutscher rundfunk that accepting women would be gambling with the emotional unity emotionelle geschlossenheit that this organism currently has30 in april 1996 the orchestras press secretary wrote that compensating for the expected leaves of absence of maternity leave would be a problem31 in 1997 the vienna philharmonic was facing protests during a us tour by the national organization for women and the international alliance for women in music finally after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative austria members of the orchestra gathered on 28 february 1997 in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman anna lelkes as harpist32 as of 2013 the orchestra has six female members one of them violinist albena danailova became one of the orchestras concertmasters in 2008 the first woman to hold that position33 in 2012 women still made up just 6 of the orchestras membership vpo president clemens hellsberg said the vpo now uses completely screened blind auditions34 in 2013 an article in mother jones stated that while many prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the new york philharmonics violin section—and several renowned ensembles including the national symphony orchestra the detroit symphony and the minnesota symphony are led by women violinists the double bass brass and percussion sections of major orchestras are still predominantly male35 a 2014 bbc article stated that the introduction of blind auditions where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice has seen the gender balance of traditionally maledominated symphony orchestras gradually shift36 complexityedit works of classical repertoire often exhibit complexity in their use of orchestration counterpoint harmony musical development rhythm phrasing

symphony and sonata classical music is also noted for its use of sophisticated vocalinstrumental forms such as operacitation needed in opera vocal soloists and choirs perform staged dramatic works with an orchestra providing accompaniment longer instrumental works are often divided into selfcontained pieces called movements often with contrasting characters or moods for instance symphonies written during the classical period are usually divided into four movements 1 an opening allegro in sonata form 2 a slow movement 3 a minuet or scherzo in a triple metre such as 34 and 4 a final

overlap and the categories are somewhat arbitrary to the point that some authorities reverse terminologies and refer to a common practice era comprising baroque classical and romantic periods37 for example the use of counterpoint and fugue which is considered characteristic of the baroque era or period was continued by haydn who is classified as typical of the classical era beethoven who is often described as a founder of the romantic era and brahms who is classified as romantic also used counterpoint and fugue but other characteristics of their musicvague define their era the prefix neo

pythagoras39 pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify musical notation ancient greek instruments such as the aulos a reed instrument and the lyre a stringed instrument similar to a

the more complex voicings of motets the renaissance era was from 1400 to 1600 it was characterized by greater use of instrumentation multiple interweaving melodic lines and the use of the first bass instruments social dancing became more widespread so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize it is in this time that the notation of music on a staff and other elements of musical notation began to take shape42 this invention made possible the separation of the composition of a piece of music from its transmission without written music transmission was oral and subject to change every time it was transmitted with a musical score a work of music could be performed without the composers presence41 the invention of the movabletype printing press in the 15th century had farreaching consequences on the preservation and transmission of music43 johannes ockeghem kyrie au travail suis excerpt typical stringed instruments of the early period include the harp lute vielle and psaltery while wind instruments included the flute family including recorder shawm an early member of the oboe family trumpet and the bagpipes simple pipe organs existed but were largely confined to churches although there were portable varieties44 later in the period early versions of keyboard instruments like the clavichord and harpsichord began to appear stringed instruments such as the viol had emerged by the 16th century as had a wider variety of brass and reed instruments printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments as well as instruction

complex in comparison with the songs of earlier periods15 the beginnings of the sonata form took shape in the canzona as did a more formalized notion of theme and variations the tonalities of major and minor as means for managing dissonance and chromaticism in music took full shape46 during the baroque era keyboard music played on the harpsichord and pipe organ became increasingly popular and the violin family of stringed instruments took the form generally seen today opera as a staged musical drama began to differentiate itself from earlier musical and dramatic forms and vocal forms like the cantata and oratorio became more common47 vocalists began adding embellishments to melodies15 instrumental ensembles began to distinguish and standardize by sizeclarification needed giving rise to

style and was also when the piano became the predominant keyboard instrument the basic forces required for an orchestra became somewhat standardized although they would grow as the potential of a wider array of instruments was developed in the following centuries chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8 to 10 performers for serenades opera continued to develop with regional styles in italy france and germanspeaking lands the opera buffa a form of comic opera rose in popularity the symphony came into its own as a musical form and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill orchestras no longer required a harpsichord which had been part of the traditional continuo in the baroque style and were often led by the lead violinist now called the concertmaster49 wind instruments became more refined in the classical era while double reeded instruments like the oboe and bassoon became somewhat standardized in the baroque the clarinet family of single reeds was not widely used until mozart expanded its role in orchestral chamber and concerto settings50 romanticera musicedit main article romantic music see also list of romanticera composers the music of the romantic era from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line as well as expressive and emotional elements paralleling romanticism in other art forms musical forms began to break from the classical era forms even as those were being codified with freeform pieces like nocturnes fantasias and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized51 the music became more chromatic dissonant and tonally colorful with tensions with respect to accepted norms of the older forms about key signatures increasing52 the art song or lied came to maturity in this era as did the epic scales of grand opera ultimately transcended by richard wagners ring cycle53 in the 19th century musical institutions emerged from the control of wealthy patrons as composers and musicians could construct lives independent of the nobility increasing interest in music by the growing middle classes throughout western europe spurred the creation of organizations for the teaching performance and preservation of music the piano which achieved its modern construction in this era in part due to industrial advances in metallurgy became widely popular with the middle class whose demands for the instrument spurred a large number of piano builders many symphony orchestras date their founding to this era52 some musicians and composers were the stars of the day some like franz liszt and niccolò paganini fulfilled both roles54 the family of instruments used especially in orchestras grew a wider array of percussion instruments began to appear brass instruments took on larger roles as the introduction of rotary valves made it possible for them to play a wider range of notes the size of the orchestra typically around 40 in the classical era grew to be over 10052 gustav mahlers 1906 symphony no 8 for example has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400citation needed european cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world there was also

music includes late romantic impressionist neoclassical neoromantic neomedieval and postmodern styles of composition modernism 1890–1930 marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the common practice period such as traditional tonality melody instrumentation and structure the highmodern era saw the emergence of neoclassical and serial music a few authorities have claimed highmodernism as the beginning of postmodern music from about 193056not in citation given57not in citation given others have more or less equated postmodern music with the contemporary music composed from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century5859 women in classical musicedit see also women in classical music almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the standard concert repertoire are male composers even though there has been a large number of women composers throughout the classical music period musicologist marcia citron has asked why is music composed by women so marginal to the standard classical repertoire60 citron examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received canon of performed musical works she argues that in the 1800s women composers typically wrote art songs for performance in small recitals rather than symphonies intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers since women composers did not write many symphonies they were deemed to be not notable as composers60 in the concise oxford history of music clara schumann is one of the only sic female composers mentioned61 abbey philips states that during the 20th century the women who were composingplaying gained far less attention than their male counterparts61 timeline of composersedit see also list of classical music composers by era significance of written notationedit literalist view of the significance of the scoreedit while there are differences between particular performances of a classical work a piece of classical music is generally held to transcend any interpretation of it the use of musical notation is an effective method for transmitting classical music since the written music contains the technical instructions for performing the workcitation needed the written score however does not usually contain explicit instructions as to how to interpret the piece in terms of production or performance apart from directions for dynamics tempo and expression to a certain extent this is left to the discretion of the performers who are guided by their personal experience and musical education their knowledge of the works idiom their personal artistic tastes and the accumulated body of historic performance practicescitation needed criticism of the literalist viewedit all critics express the opinion that it is only from the mid19th century and especially in the 20th century that the score began to hold such a high significancecitation needed previously improvisation in preludes cadenzas and ornaments rhythmic flexibility eg tempo rubato improvisatory deviation from the score and oral tradition of playing was integral to the styleclarification needed classical musicians tend to use scores and the parts extracted from them to play music yet even with notation providing the key elements of the music there is considerable latitude in the performance of the works some of this latitude results from the inherent limitations of musical notation though attempts to supplement traditional notation with signs and annotations indicating more subtle nuances tend to overwhelm and paralyse the performer some quotes that highlight a criticism of overvaluing of the score one of the most stubborn modern misconceptions concerning baroque music is that a metronomic regularity was intended baroque interpretation in grove 5th edition by robert donington too many teachers conditioned to 20th century ideas teach bach and other baroque music exactly the wrong way this leads to what musicologist sol babitz calls sewing machine bachclarification needed62 tendency to look alike sound alike and think alike the conservatories are at fault and they have been at fault for many years now any sensitive musician going around the world has noted the same thing the conservatories from moscow and leningrad to juilliard curtis and indiana are producing a standardized product clarity undeviating rhythm easy technique musicianship i put the word musicianship in quotes because as often as not it is a false kind of musicianship—a musicianship that sees the tree and not the forest that takes care of the detail but ignores the big picture a musicianship that is tied to the printed note rather than to emotional meaning of a piece the fact remains that there is a dreadful uniformity today and also an appalling lack of knowledge about the culture and performance traditions of the past music schools turning out robots62 by harold c schonberg improvisationedit this section is written like a personal reflection or opinion essay that states a wikipedia editors personal feelings about a topic please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style july 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message improvisation once played an important role in classical music a remnant of this improvisatory tradition in classical music can be heard in the cadenza a passage found mostly in concertos and solo works designed to allow skilled performers to exhibit their virtuoso skills on the instrument traditionally this was improvised by the performer however it is often written for or occasionally by the performer beforehand improvisation is also an important aspect in authentic performances of operas of baroque era and of bel canto especially operas of vincenzo bellini and is best exemplified by the da capo aria a form by which famous singers typically perform variations of the thematic matter of the aria in the recapitulation section b section the da capo part an example is beverly sills complex albeit prewritten variation of da tempeste il legno infranto from händels giulio cesarecitation needed itsclarification needed written transmission along with the veneration bestowed on certain classical works has led to the expectation that performers will play a work in a way that realizes in detail the original intentions of the composer during the 19th century the details that composers put in their scores generally increased yet the opposite trend—admiration of performers for new interpretations of the composers work—can be seen and it is not unknown for a composer to praise a performer for achieving a better realization of the original intent than the composer was able to imagine thus classical performers often achieve high reputations for their musicianship even if they do not compose themselves generally however it is the composers who are remembered more than the performers the primacy of the composers written score has also led today to a relatively minor role played by improvisation in classical music in sharp contrast to the practice of musicians who lived during the medieval renaissance baroque and early romantic eras improvisation in classical music performance was common during both the baroque and early romantic eras yet lessened strongly during the second half of the 20th century during the classical era mozart and beethoven often improvised the cadenzas to their piano concertos and thereby encouraged others to do so but for violin concertos they provided written cadenzas for use by other soloistscitation needed in opera the practice of singing strictly by the score ie come scritto was famously propagated by soprano maria callas who called this practice straitjacketing and implied that it allows the intention of the composer to be understood better especially during studying the music for the first time63 relationship to other music traditionsedit popular musicedit classical music has often incorporated elements or material from popular music of the composers time examples include occasional music such as brahms use of student drinking songs in his academic festival overture genres exemplified by kurt weills the threepenny opera and the influence of jazz on early and mid20thcentury composers including maurice ravel exemplified by the movement entitled blues in his sonata for violin and piano64 certain postmodern minimalist and postminimalist classical composers acknowledge a debt to popular music65 numerous examples show influence in the opposite direction including popular songs based on classical music the use to which pachelbels canon has been put since the 1970s and the musical crossover phenomenon where classical musicians have achieved success in the popular music arena66 in heavy metal a number of lead guitarists playing electric guitar modeled their playing styles on baroque or classical era instrumental music including ritchie blackmore and randy rhoads folk musicedit composers of classical music have often made use of folk music music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained often from a purely oral tradition some composers like dvořák and smetana67 have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work while others like bartók have used specific themes lifted whole from their folkmusic origins68 commercializationedit certain staples of classical music are often used commercially either in advertising or in movie soundtracks in television commercials several passages have become clichéd particularly the opening of richard strauss also sprach zarathustra made famous in the film 2001 a space odyssey and the opening section o fortuna of carl orffs carmina burana often used in the horror genrecitation needed other examples include the dies irae from the verdi requiem edvard griegs in the hall of the mountain king from peer gynt the opening bars of beethovens symphony no 5 wagners ride of the valkyries from die walküre rimskykorsakovs flight of the bumblebee and excerpts of aaron coplands rodeocitation needed several works from the golden age of animation matched the action to classical music notable examples are walt disneys fantasia tom and jerrys johann mouse and warner bros rabbit of seville and whats opera doc similarly movies and television often revert to standard clichéd excerpts of classical music to convey refinement or opulence some of the mostoften heard pieces in this category include bach´s cello suite no 1 mozarts eine kleine nachtmusik vivaldis four seasons mussorgskys night on bald mountain as orchestrated by rimskykorsakov and rossinis william tell overture the same passages are often used by telephone call centres to induce a sense of calm in customers waiting in a queuecitation needed shawn vancour argues that the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century may have harmed the music industry through inadequate representation69 public

books wrote on what came to be called the mozart effect an observed temporary small elevation of scores on certain tests as a result of listening to mozarts works the approach has been popularized in a book by don campbell and is based on an experiment published in nature suggesting that listening to mozart temporarily boosted students iq by 8 to 9 points71 this popularized version of the theory was expressed succinctly by the new york times music columnist alex ross researchers have determined that listening to mozart actually makes you smarter72 promoters marketed cds claimed to induce the effect florida passed a law requiring toddlers in staterun schools to listen to classical music every day and in 1998 the governor of georgia budgeted 105000 per year to provide every child born in georgia with a tape or cd of classical music one of the coauthors of the original studies of the mozart effect commented i dont think it can hurt im all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences but i do think the money could be better spent on music education programs73 this section relies largely or entirely on a single source relevant discussion may be found on the talk page please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources september 2016 in 199697 a research study was conducted on a large population of middle age students in the cherry creek school district in denver colorado us the study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores the research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores students who listened to rockandroll or country music had moderately lower scores the study further indicated that students who used classical music during the course of study had a significant leap in their academic performance whereas those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores the research was conducted over several schools within the cherry creek school district and was conducted through the university of colorado this study is reflective of several
