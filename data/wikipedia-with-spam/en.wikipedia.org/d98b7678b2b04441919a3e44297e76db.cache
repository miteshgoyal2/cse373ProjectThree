said i had other priorities in the 60s than military service24 cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received deferments to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four owing to subpar academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education initially cheney was not drafted due to his marriage to lynne cheney25 when the draft was expanded to include married men without children he applied for four deferments in sequence he applied for his fifth exemption on january 19 1966 when his wife was about 10 weeks pregnant he was granted 3a

becoming one of reagans earliest supporters37 in 1986 after president ronald reagan vetoed a bill to impose economic sanctions on south africa for its policy of apartheid cheney was one of 83 representatives to vote against overriding reagans veto38 in later years he articulated his opposition to unilateral sanctions against many different countries stating they almost never work39 and that in that case they might have ended up hurting the people instead40 in 1986 cheney along with 145 republicans and 31 democrats voted against a nonbinding congressional resolution calling on the south african government to release nelson mandela from prison after the democrats defeated proposed amendments that would have required mandela to renounce violence sponsored by the african national congress anc and requiring it to oust the communist faction from its leadership the resolution was defeated appearing on cnn cheney addressed criticism for this saying he opposed the resolution because the anc at the time was viewed as a terrorist organization and had a number of interests that were fundamentally inimical to the united states41 the federal building in casper a regional center of the fossil fuel industry is named the dick cheney federal building42 43 committee assignments originally declining us congressman barber conable persuaded cheney to join the moderate

senator john heinz award for greatest public service by an elected or appointed official an award given out annually by jefferson awards48 cheney has said his time at the pentagon was the most rewarding period of his public service career calling it the one that stands out in 2014 cheney recounted that when he met with president george h w bush to accept the offer he passed a painting in the private residence entitled the peacemakers which depicted president lincoln general grant and william tecumseh sherman my greatgrandfather had served under william tecumseh sherman throughout the war cheney said and it occurred to me as i was in the room as i walked in to talk to the president about becoming secretary of defense i wondered what he would have thought that his greatgrandson would someday be in the white house with the president talking about taking over the reins of the us military49 early tenure cheney worked closely with pete williams assistant secretary of defense for public affairs and paul wolfowitz under secretary of defense for policy from the beginning of his tenure he focused primarily on external matters and left most of the internal dod management to deputy secretary of defense donald atwood32 budgetary practices cheneys most immediate issue as secretary of defense was the department of defense budget cheney deemed it appropriate to cut the budget and downsize the military following the reagan administrations peacetime defense buildup at the height of the cold war50 as part of the fiscal year 1990 budget cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the avenger ii naval attack aircraft the b2 stealth bomber the v22 osprey tiltwing helicopter the aegis destroyer and the mx missile totaling approximately 45 billion in light of changed world politics32 cheney opposed the v22 program which congress had already appropriated funds for and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting51 when the 1990 budget came before congress in the summer of 1989 it settled on a figure between the administrations request and the house armed services committees recommendation32 in subsequent years under cheney the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns similar to that of 1990 early in 1991 he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid1990s to 16 million compared with 22 million when he entered office cheneys 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992 omitting programs that congress had directed the department of defense to buy weapons that it did not want and omitting unrequested reserve forces32 over his four years as secretary of defense cheney downsized the military and his budgets showed negative real growth despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by congress the department of defenses total obligational authority in current dollars declined from 291 billion to 270 billion total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent from about 22 million in 1989 to about 18 million in 199332 notwithstanding the overall reduction in military spending cheney directed the development of a pentagon plan to ensure us military dominance in the postcold war era52 political climate and agenda cheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as iraq iran and north korea could acquire nuclear components after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 the end of the cold war the fall of the soviet union and the disintegration of the warsaw pact obliged the first bush administration to reevaluate the north atlantic treaty organizations natos purpose and makeup cheney believed that nato should remain the foundation of european security relationships and that it would remain important to the united states in the long term he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in eastern europe32 cheneys views on nato reflected his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social development in the former eastern bloc countries where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability he felt that the bush administration was too optimistic in supporting general secretary of the cpsu mikhail gorbachev and his successor russian president boris yeltsin32 cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the united states and its european allies53 cheney persuaded the kingdom of saudi arabia to allow bases for us ground troops and war planes in the nation this was an important element of the success of the gulf war as well as a lightningrod for islamists such as osama bin laden who opposed having nonmuslim armies near their holy sites54 international situations using economic sanctions and political pressure the united states mounted a campaign to drive panamanian ruler general manuel antonio noriega from power after he fell from favor32 in may 1989 after guillermo endara had been duly elected president of panama noriega nullified the election outcome drawing intensified pressure in october noriega suppressed a military coup but in december after soldiers of the panamanian army killed a us serviceman the united states invasion of panama began under cheneys direction the stated reason for the invasion was to seize noriega to face drug charges in the united states protect us lives and property and restore panamanian civil liberties55 although the mission was controversial56 us forces achieved control of panama and endara assumed the presidency noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in april 199257 secretary of defense cheney during a press conference on the gulf war in 1991 the somali civil war drew the worlds attention in august 1992 the united states began to provide humanitarian assistance primarily food through a military airlift at president bushs direction cheney dispatched the first of 26000 us troops to somalia as part of the unified task force unitaf designed to provide security and food relief32 cheneys successors as secretary of defense les aspin and william j perry had to contend with both the bosnian and somali issues iraqi invasion of kuwait on august 1 1990 iraqi president saddam hussein sent the invading iraqi forces into neighboring kuwait a small petroleumrich state long claimed by iraq as part of its territory this invasion sparked the initiation of the persian gulf war and it brought worldwide condemnation58 an estimated 140000 iraqi troops quickly took control of kuwait city and moved on to the saudi arabiakuwait border32 the united states had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of saudi arabia by the us central command headed by general norman schwarzkopf because of its important petroleum reserves us and world reaction cheney meets with prince sultan minister of defence and aviation in saudi arabia to discuss how to handle the invasion of kuwait cheney and schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a fullscale us military operation according to general colin powell cheney had become a glutton for information with an appetite we could barely satisfy he spent hours in the national military command center peppering my staff with questions32 shortly after the iraqi invasion cheney made the first of several visits to saudi arabia where king fahd requested us military assistance the united nations took action as well passing a series of resolutions condemning iraqs invasion of kuwait the un security council authorized all means necessary to eject iraq from kuwait and demanded that the country withdraw its forces by january 15 199158 by then the united states had a force of about 500000 stationed in saudi arabia and the persian gulf other nations including britain canada france italy syria and egypt contributed troops and other allies most notably germany and japan agreed to provide financial support for the coalition effort named operation desert shield32 on january 12 1991 congress authorized bush to use military force to enforce iraqs compliance with un resolutions on kuwait58 military action the first phase of operation desert storm which began on january 17 1991 was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack iraqi forces targeting key iraqi command and control centers including the cities of baghdad and basra cheney turned most other department of defense matters over to deputy secretary atwood and briefed congress during the air and ground phases of the war32 he flew with powell to the region to review and finalize the ground war plans58 after an air offensive of more than five weeks un coalition forces launched the ground war on february 24 within 100 hours iraqi forces had been routed from kuwait and schwarzkopf reported that the basic objective—expelling iraqi forces from kuwait—had been met on february 2759 after consultation with cheney and other members of his national security team bush declared a suspension of hostilities58 on working with this national security team cheney has said there have been five republican presidents since eisenhower i worked for four of them and worked closely with a fifth—the reagan years when i was part of the house leadership the best national security team i ever saw was that one the least friction the most cooperation the highest degree of trust among the principals especially60 aftermath a total of 147 us military personnel died in combat and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes3259 iraq agreed to a formal truce on march 3 and a permanent ceasefire on april 632 there was subsequent debate about whether un coalition forces should have driven as far as baghdad to oust saddam hussein from power bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct but the debate persisted as hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces32 arguably the most significant debate concerned whether us and coalition forces had left iraq too soon6162 in an april 15 1994 interview with cspan cheney was asked if the us and un forces should have moved into baghdad cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a bad idea and would have led to a quagmire explaining that because if wed gone to baghdad we would have been all alone there wouldnt have been anybody else with us there would have been a us occupation of iraq none of the arab forces that were willing to fight with us in kuwait were willing to invade iraq once you got to iraq and took it over took down saddam husseins government then what are you going to put in its place thats a very volatile part of the world and if you take down the central government of iraq you could very easily end up seeing pieces of iraq fly off part of it the syrians would like to have to the west part of it—eastern iraq—the iranians would like to claim they fought over it for eight years in the north youve got the kurds and if the kurds spin loose and join with the kurds in turkey then you threaten the territorial integrity of turkey its a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over iraq the other thing was casualties everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had but for the 146 americans killed in action and for their families—it wasnt a cheap war and the question for the president in terms of whether or not we went on to baghdad took additional casualties in an effort to get saddam hussein was how many additional dead americans is saddam worth our judgment was not very many and i think we got it right6364 cheney regarded the gulf war as an example of the kind of regional problem the united states was likely to continue to face in the future65 were always going to have to be involved in the middle east maybe its part of our national character you know we like to have these problems nice and neatly wrapped up put a ribbon around it you deploy a force you win the war and the problem goes away but it doesnt work that way in the middle east it never has and isnt likely to in my lifetime private sector career between 1987 and 1989 during his last term in congress cheney

pursuing a classaction lawsuit alleging that the corporation artificially inflated its stock price during this period in june 2011 the united states supreme court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed the case to continue in litigation68 cheney was named in a december 2010 corruption complaint filed by the nigerian government against halliburton which the company settled for 250 million69

midlevel agency analysts on their conclusions84 cheney continued to allege links between saddam hussein and alqaeda even though president bush received a classified presidents daily brief on september 21 2001 indicating the us intelligence community had no evidence linking saddam hussein to the september 11 attacks and that there was scant credible evidence that iraq had any significant collaborative ties with al qaeda85 furthermore in 2004 the 911 commission concluded that there was no collaborative relationship between iraq and alqaeda86 following the us invasion of iraq cheney remained steadfast in his support of the war stating that it would be an enormous success story87 and made many visits to the country he often criticized war critics calling them opportunists who were peddling cynical and pernicious falsehoods to gain political advantage while us soldiers died in iraq in response senator john kerry asserted it is hard to name a government official with less credibility on iraq than cheney88 in a march 24 2008 extended interview conducted in ankara turkey with abc news correspondent martha raddatz on the fifth anniversary of the original us military

president on policies which in many cases would reshape the powers of the presidency when former vice president dan quayle suggested to cheney that the office was largely ceremonial cheney reportedly replied i have a different understanding with the president the articles described cheney as having a secretive approach to the tools of government indicated by the use of his own security

environmental protection agency administrator stephen johnson cheneys office was directly responsible for nearly half of the original testimony being deleted135 in his role as president of the us

spoke of his support for samesex marriage becoming one of the most prominent republican politicians to do so speaking to the national press club cheney stated people ought to be free to enter into any

ought to be handled today149 in 2012 cheney reportedly encouraged several maryland state legislators to vote to legalize samesex marriage in that state150 although by custom a former vice president unofficially receives six months of protection from the united states secret service president obama reportedly extended the protection period for cheney151 on july 11 2009 cia director leon panetta told the senate and house intelligence committees that the cia withheld information about a secret counterterrorism program from congress for eight years on direct orders from cheney intelligence and congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the cia interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities they have said the program was started by the counterterrorism center at the cia shortly after the attacks of september 11 2001 but never became fully operational involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until

kill al qaeda operatives153 cheney has said that the tea party movement is a positive influence on the republican party and that i think its much better to have that kind of turmoil and change in the

publicly criticized president obama since the 2008 presidential election on december 29 2009 four days after the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from netherlands to united states cheney criticized obama we are at war and when president obama pretends we arent it makes us less safe why doesnt he want to admit were at war it doesnt fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the oval office it doesnt fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency—social transformation—the restructuring of american society157 in response white house communications director dan pfeiffer wrote on the official white house blog the following day it is telling that vice president cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the administration than condemning the attackers unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer158159 during a february 14 2010 appearance on abcs this week cheney reiterated his criticism of the obama administrations policies for handling suspected terrorists criticizing the

criticize barack obamas and former secretary of state hillary clintons foreign policies and offer what they see as the solutions needed to restore american greatness and power on the world stage in defense of freedom167168 public perception cheneys early public opinion polls were more favorable than unfavorable reaching his peak approval rating in the wake of the september 11 attacks at 68

political figure174 byu permitted a protest to occur so long as it did not make personal attacks against cheney attack the byu administration the church or the first presidency175 cheney has been compared to darth vader a characterization originated by his critics but which was later adopted humorously by cheney himself as well as by members of his family and staff176 as a result of cheney having admitted that he signed off on the socalled enhanced interrogation techniques program177178 some public officials as well as several media outlets and advocacy groups have called for his prosecution under various antitorture and war crimes statutes179180 in former president george h w bushs book destiny and power the american odyssey of george herbert walker bush published in november

was flown by helicopter to corpus christi memorial hospital on february 14 2006 whittington had a nonfatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due to at least one leadshot pellet lodged in or near
