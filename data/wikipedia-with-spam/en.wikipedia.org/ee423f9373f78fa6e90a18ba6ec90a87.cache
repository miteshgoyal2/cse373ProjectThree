dictionary the word funk initially referred and still refers to a strong odor it is originally derived from latin fumigare which means to smoke via old french fungiere and in this sense it was first documented in english in 1620 in 1784 funky meaning musty was first documented which in turn led to a sense of earthy that was taken up around 1900 in early jazz slang for something deeply or strongly felt456 in early jam sessions musicians would encourage one another to get down by telling one another now put some stank on it at least as early as 1907 jazz songs carried titles such as funky the first example is an unrecorded number by buddy bolden remembered as either funky butt or buddy boldens blues with improvised lyrics that were according to donald m marquis either comical and light or crude and downright obscene but in one way or another referring to the sweaty atmosphere at dances where boldens band played78 as late as the 1950s and early 1960s when funk and funky were used increasingly in the context of jazz music the terms still were considered indelicate and inappropriate for use in polite company according to one source new orleansborn drummer earl palmer was the first to use the word funky to explain to other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and danceable9 the style later evolved into a rather harddriving insistent rhythm implying a more carnal quality this early form of the music set the pattern for later musicians10 the music was identified as slow sexy loose rifforiented and danceablecitation needed characteristicsedit

1940s and made it its own11 new orleans funk as it was called gained international acclaim largely because james browns rhythm section used it to great effect12 simple kick and snare funk motif the kick first sounds two onbeats which are then answered by two offbeats the snare sounds the backbeat funk creates an intense groove by using strong guitar riffs and bass lines like motown recordings funk songs used bass lines as the centerpiece of songs slap basss mixture of thumbslapped low notes and finger popped or plucked high notes allowed the bass to have a drumlike rhythmic role which became a distinctive element of funk in funk bands guitarists typically play in a percussive style often using the wahwah sound effect and muting the notes in their riffs to create a percussive sound guitarist ernie isley of the isley brothers and eddie hazel of funkadelic were notably influenced by jimi hendrixs improvised solos eddie hazel who worked with george clinton is one of the most

head hunters historyedit the distinctive characteristics of africanamerican musical expression are rooted in subsaharan african music traditions and find their earliest expression in spirituals work chantssongs praise shouts gospel blues and body rhythms hambone patting juba and ring shout clapping and stomping patterns funk music is an amalgam of soul music soul jazz rb and afrocuban rhythms absorbed and reconstituted in new orleans like other styles of africanamerican musical expression including jazz soul music and rb funk music accompanied many protest movements during and after the civil rights movement funk allowed everyday experiences to be expressed to challenge daily struggles and hardships fought by lower and working class communities new orleansedit gerhard kubik notes that with the exception of new orleans early blues lacked complex polyrhythms and there was a very specific absence of asymmetric timeline patterns key patterns in virtually all early twentieth century african american music  only in some new orleans genres does a hint of simple time line patterns occasionally appear in the form of transient socalled stomp patterns or stoptime chorus these do not function in the same way as african time lines13 in the late 1940s this changed somewhat when the twocelled time line structure was brought into new orleans blues new orleans musicians were especially receptive to afrocuban influences precisely at the time when rb was first forming14 dave bartholomew and professor longhair henry roeland byrd incorporated afrocuban instruments as well as the clave pattern and related twocelled figures in songs such as carnival day bartholomew 1949 and mardi gras in new orleans longhair 1949 robert palmer reports that in the 1940s professor longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and fell under the spell of perez prados mambo records11 professor longhairs particular style was known locally as rumbaboogie15 one of longhairs great contributions was his particular approach of adopting twocelled clavebased patterns into new orleans rhythm and blues rb longhairs rhythmic approach became a basic template of funk according to dr john malcolm john mac rebennack jr the professor put funk into music  longhairs thing had a direct bearing id say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in new orleans16 in his mardi gras in new orleans the pianist employs the 23 clave onbeatoffbeat motif in a rumbaboogie guajeo17 the syncopated but straight subdivision feel of cuban music as opposed to swung subdivisions took root in new orleans rb during this time stewart states eventually musicians from outside of new orleans began to learn some of the rhythmic practices of the crescent city most important of these were james brown and the drummers and arrangers he employed browns early repertoire had used mostly shuffle rhythms and some of his most successful songs were 128 ballads eg please please please 1956 bewildered 1961 i dont mind 1961 browns change to a funkier brand of soul required 44 metre and a different style of drumming18 stewart makes the point the singular style of rhythm blues that emerged from new orleans in the years after world war ii played an important role in the development of funk in a related development the underlying rhythms of american popular music underwent a basic yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes19 1960s james brownedit james brown a principal innovator of funk music little richards saxophonestudded mid1950s rb road band was credited by james brown and others as being the first to put the funk in the rocknroll beat20 following his temporary exit from secular music to become an evangelist in 1957 some of little richards band members joined brown and the famous flames beginning a long string of hits for them in 1958 by the mid1960s james brown had developed his signature groove that emphasized the downbeat—with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure to etch his distinctive sound rather than the backbeat that typified african american music21 brown often cued his band with the command on the one changing the percussion emphasisaccent from the onetwothreefour backbeat of traditional soul music to the onetwothreefour downbeat – but with an evennote syncopated guitar rhythm on quarter notes two and four featuring a harddriving repetitive brassy swing this onethree beat launched the shift in browns signature music style starting with his 1964 hit single out of sight and his 1965 hits papas got a brand new bag and i got you i feel good browns style of funk was based on interlocking contrapuntal parts funky bass lines drum patterns and syncopated guitar riffs2 the main guitar ostinatos for aint it funky c late 1960s is an example of browns refinement of new orleans funk— an irresistibly danceable riff stripped down to its rhythmic essence on aint it funky the tonal structure is barebones browns innovations led to him and his band becoming the seminal funk act they also pushed the funk music style further to the forefront with releases such as cold sweat 1967 mother popcorn 1969 and get up i feel like being a sex machine 1970 discarding even the twelvebar blues featured in his earlier music instead browns music was overlaid with catchy anthemic vocals based on extensive vamps in which he also used his voice as a percussive instrument with frequent rhythmic grunts and with rhythmsection patterns  resembling west african polyrhythms – a tradition evident in african american work songs and chants22 throughout his career browns frenzied vocals frequently punctuated with screams and grunts channeled the ecstatic ambiance of the black church in a secular context22 external video watch clyde stubblefield funky drummer on youtube after 1965 browns bandleader and arranger was alfred pee wee ellis ellis credits clyde stubblefields adoption of new orleans drumming techniques as the basis of modern funk if in a studio you said play it funky that could imply almost anything but give me a new orleans beat – you got exactly what you wanted and clyde stubblefield was just the epitome of this funky drumming23 stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from new orleans—through james browns music to the popular music of the 1970s19 concerning the various funk motifs stewart states this model it should be noted is different from a time line such as clave and tresillo in that it is not an exact pattern but more of a loose organizing principle24 in a 1990 interview brown offered his reason for switching the rhythm of his music i changed from the upbeat to the downbeat  simple as that really25 according to maceo parker browns former saxophonist playing on the downbeat was at first hard for him and took some getting used to reflecting back to his early days with browns band parker reported that he had difficulty playing on the one during solo performances since he was used to hearing and playing with the accent on the second beat26 late 1960s – early 1970sedit other musical groups

upbeat soul of sly the family stone and mothers finest the temptations who had previously helped to define the motown sound – a distinct blend of popsoul – adopted this new psychedelic sound towards the end of the 1960s as well their producer norman whitfield became an innovator in the field of psychedelic soul creating hits with a newer funkier sound for many motown acts including war by edwin starr smiling faces sometimes by the undisputed truth and papa was a rollin stone by the temptations motown producers frank wilson keep on truckin and hal davis dancing machine followed suit stevie

is a discernible funk influence in the timbres of the instruments employed other tonal and rhythmic textures such as the indian tambora and tablas and cuban congas and bongos create a multilayered soundscape from a musical standpoint the album was a culmination of sorts of the recording studiobased musique concrète approach that davis and producer teo macero who had studied with otto luening at columbia universitys computer music center had begun to explore in the late 1960s both sides of the record featured heavy funk drum and bass grooves with the melodic parts snipped from hours of jams

synthfunk in the 1980s largely as a reaction against what was seen as the overindulgence of disco many of the core elements that formed the foundation of the pfunk formula began to be usurped by electronic instruments drum machines and synthesizers horn sections of saxophones and trumpets were replaced by synth keyboards and the horns that remained were given simplified lines and few horn solos were given to soloists the classic electric keyboards of funk like the hammond b3 organ the hohner clavinet andor the fender rhodes piano began to be replaced by the new digital synthesizers such as the yamaha dx7 electronic drum machines such as the roland tr808 began to replace the funky drummers of the past and the slap and pop style of bass playing were often replaced by synth

bandleader singer and songwriter beginning in the late 1970s prince used a strippeddown dynamic instrumentation similar to james however prince went on to have as much of an impact on the sound of funk as any one artist since brown he combined eroticism technology an increasing musical complexity and an outrageous image and stage show to ultimately create music as ambitious and imaginative as pfunk prince formed the time originally conceived as an opening act for him and based on his minneapolis sound hybrid mixture of funk rb rock pop new wave eventually the band went on to define their own style of strippeddown funk based on tight musicianship and sexual themes similar to prince other bands emerged during the pfunk era and began to incorporate uninhibited sexuality danceoriented
