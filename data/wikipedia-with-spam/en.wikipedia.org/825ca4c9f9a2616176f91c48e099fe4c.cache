coach paul westhead was named head coach of the phoenix mercury on october 11 2005 bringing his uptempo style of play to the wnba this fastpaced offense was perfect for his team especially after the league shortened the shot clock from 30 seconds to 24 seconds in 2006 much like the early houston comets championship teams the phoenix mercury had risen to prominence led by their own big three of cappie pondexter diana taurasi and penny taylor the mercury were wellsuited for fast offense behind these three players phoenix averaged a leaguerecord 8897 points per game in 2007 teams could not

basketball rules and regulationsedit rules are governed by standard basketball rules as defined by the nba with a few notable exceptions the threepoint line is 22 feet 175 inches 67501 m from the middle of the basket 21 feet 8 inches 660 m at the corners this is the same distance used under new fiba rules fiba had increased its threepoint distance to 22 feet 175 inches 67501 m since october 1 2012 for domestic competitions the regulation wnba ball is a minimum 285 inches 72 cm in circumference and weighs 200 ounces 570 g 1 inch 25 cm smaller and 2 ounces 57 g lighter than the nba ball since 2004 this size has been used for all seniorlevel womens competitions throughout the world in fullcourt basketball competitions in the halfcourt 3x3 variant used the womens ball until 2015 when a dedicated ball with the circumference of the womens ball but the weight of the mens ball was introduced quarters are 10 minutes in duration instead of 12 games are divided into four 10minute quarters as opposed to the leagues original two 20minute halves of play similar to fiba and ncaa womens college rules many wnba players play in european chinese or australian leagues which all use the fiba rule set a recent trend with new wnba rules has been to match them with a similar nba rule beginning with the 2006 wnba season28 the winner of the opening jump ball shall begin the 4th quarter with the ball out of bounds the loser shall begin with the ball out of bounds in the second and third quarter previously under the twohalf format both periods started with jump balls presumably to eliminate the possibility of a team purposely losing the opening tip in order to gain the opening possession of the second half this is not a problem under the fourquarters because the winner of the opening tip gets the opening possession of the final period the shot clock was decreased from 30 to 24 seconds the rule changes signaled a move away from rules more similar to those of college basketball and toward those that provide a more nbalike game fiba also uses a 24second clock the 2007 wnba season brought changes that included29 the amount of time that a team must move the ball across the halfcourt line went from 10 to 8 seconds a referee can grant timeouts to either a player or the coach two free throws and possession of the ball for clearpathtothebasket foul previously only one free throw was awarded as well as possession in 2012 the wnba added the blockcharge arc under the basket as of 2013 the defensive threesecond rule and antiflopping guidelines were introduced

website although the storm and wings have not released their jerseys yet in 2009 the phoenix mercury became the first american professional basketball team to feature advertisements on their uniform when they sold an ad to lifelock insurance on the front of their jerseys leading many people to wonder if ads on nba uniforms were coming soon since then several other wnba teams have followed suit the nba announced in the summer of 2016 that they will begin to feature advertisements on jerseys with the first team to do so being the philadelphia 76ers with a stubhub sticker now on their jerseys before the start of the 2011 season every team announced a new look for their uniforms the supplier of the uniforms for the league adidas upgraded all teams to new hightech designs much like they did

paying female players less than their nba counterparts42 the decision of superstar diana taurasi to sit out the 2015 wnba season was seen by some in the media as a harbinger of salaryrelated troubles in the future the russian club for which she was playing at the time ummc ekaterinburg offered her a bonus well in excess of the leagues salary cap to sit out that season taurasi accepted largely because she had not had an offseason since she was playing college basketball more than a decade earlier such offers have often been made to star american players including taurasi herself but none
