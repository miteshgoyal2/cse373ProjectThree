has been controlled by elected democrats since 1975 due to the long distance between washington dc and washington territory and the slow speed of communications and travel of the day weeks or months could go by between the appointment of a governor and the governor actually taking office the actual dates governors took office are sometimes vague the ones in this list are cited mostly with contemporary news coverage but other resources and almanacs give slightly different dates received a leave of absence in may 1860 to move his wife from texas to kentucky he never returned to washington territory1516 appointed as governor but did not take office as he was elected as a delegate from washington territory18 a b president johnson removed governor pickering in november 1866 governor cole arrived on january 8 1867 after being appointed governor governor pickering would not relinquish power until the us senate approved of governor coles nomination on the basis that president johnson was being impeached however the states legislature looked to governor cole as the real governor the us senate eventually failed to ratify his nomination20 a b c was a resident of washington territory at the time of appointment this could have cut down on the time between appointment and taking office27 the official numbering includes ten democrats 12 republicans and john rogers who served as both a democrat and a populist rogers term is counted as both populist and democratic the fractional terms of some governors are not to be understood absolutely literally rather they are meant to show single terms during which multiple governors served due to resignations deaths and the like rogers was elected as a populist for his first term and a democrat for his second34 a b died in office a b as lieutenant governor filled unexpired term a b c represented the republican party lister became ill during his second term relinquished his office to the lieutenant governor and died a few months later35 as lieutenant governor hart filled the unexpired term after lister relinquished his office due to ill health35 a b c d represented the democratic party governor inslees
