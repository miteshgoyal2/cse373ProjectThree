that murray is not to blame for jacksons death that jackson gave himself a dose of drugs that killed him so quickly jackson didnt even have time to close his eyes what happened during that time frame

including intravenous sodium bicarbonate vasopressin epinephrine atropine and dopamine were used during the attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of jackson in the trauma bay of ucla medical center from the time jackson was under the care of cooper until jacksons death was pronounced continuous chest compressions and bagging were conducted via an endotracheal tubecitation needed cooper testified that jackson was clinically dead upon arriving at the hospital and that murray had told her he had given jackson 2 mg of lorazepam a benzodiazepine sometime earlier that day then another 2 mg which caused the cardiac arrest during crossexamination cooper was asked about the effect of propofol as a sedative she said about a milligram per kilogram would be the starting dose on a patient and would be administered into the patients arm through an injection port the administration would take place over a period of a minute to a minute and a half and personnel would constantly monitor the patient she further testified that sedation would be expected to last 10 minutes when asked what effect 25 mg over 3–5 minutes would have on a patient she responded that she would not expect that to have any effect when asked about administering propofol through an iv drip she said that only occurs if the patient is intubated and the desired effect is deep sedationcitation needed next to the stand were employees from phone companies att and sprint nextel who were asked to guide the jury through the meaning of various data on murrays phone records from june 25 2009citation needed dr thao nguyen a cardiologist from ucla medical center testified that she was paged on that day to help with the care of a vip patient named michael jackson she was under the impression the patient was coding meaning resuscitation was partially successful she further testified that when murray arrived at the hospital he was desperate and devastated and he told the staff do not give up easily try to save his life nguyens testimony then turned to the effects of ativan brand name of lorazepam the drug that murray claimed started jacksons cardiac arrest according to nguyen ativan acts on the brain to make you sleep and can cause respiratory apnea not breathing she testified that you do not typically use narcotics such as ativan to treat insomnia they are used for sedation but when crossexamined she admitted that it is one of its uses testimony then turned to the use of flumazenil a benzodiazepine antagonist as an antidote to ativan ativan would cause the patient to have slurred speech but propofol would not it is quick onset quick offset propofol is only to be used in a hospital not just any hospital room but only in an intensive care unit or procedure room by specialist personnel an anesthesiologist present throughout its use constant monitoring is required because we wouldnt be sure of the patients tolerance threshold to the drug and there should be a crash cart at hand nguyen also testified that murray never mentioned propofol october 4 2011 day 6edit stacey ruggles michelle bella and sade anding each of whom was in contact with murray on june 25 2009 testified about their relationships with himcitation needed anding who is thoughtby whom to be the person murray was speaking to when he noticed jackson was not breathingcitation needed said she heard coughing and mumbling

cancelled an order for condom catheters on june 26 2009 on crossexamination hirschberg testified that the items murray was ordering were not unusual for a medical practice specializing in cardiovascular treatmentcitation needed stephen marx a computer forensics examiner working for the dea in virginia during june 2009 testified next15 he performed an analysis of murrays iphone and extracted screenshots emails and recordings from it the emails pertained to medical handwritten notes for patients named omar arnold and paul farance in which both names were aliases that jackson utilized under murrays care one email asked murray is that him too emails pertaining to jacksons insurance while in london were also shown the insurance company confirmed that murray was jacksons only doctor since 2006 and that they wanted very thorough medical reports and records and a review of jackson during rehearsals before agreeing to cover him it was heardclarification needed that jackson refused authorization to release his medical recordscitation needed during the testimony a recording was played of a conversation between murray and jackson from may 10 2009 the recording featured jacksons talking about healing the world and helping children because he did not have a childhood in slurred almost incomprehensible speech the recording ended with murrays asking are you ok and with jacksons replying i am asleep16 next to testify was elissa fleak a los angeles county coroner for the past eight years17 her duties include investigating deaths naturalsuicidehomicide and working with medical examiners to determine causes of death fleak went to ucla medical center at 520 pm on june 25 2009 to examine jacksons body and get information surrounding his death she examined the body in a private room as well as notes and photographs and looked for external woundsinjuries any sign to signal the cause of death none were found she took four vials of jacksons blood for toxicology testing and went to jacksons house to perform an onsite investigation while in jacksons bedroom she found an empty 20ml propofol bottle and an empty 5ml flumazenil bottle on the floor next to the bedside table she also recovered other prescription drugs such as diazepam lorazepam and tamsulosin flomax one bottle prescribed to mick jackson and some medicines prescribed by alan metzger other drugs found were benoquin hydroquinone lidocaine and an oxygen tank beside the bed medical equipment recovered included alcohol prep pads a 10cc syringe with the needle removed an iv catheter on the floor under

cards from his houston practice were also foundcitation needed october 6 2011 day 8edit fleak confirmed the presence of an iv stand a saline infusion set and a depressed syringe in a yport connected to the tubing beside jacksons bed the court heard that she issued a subpoena to murray for jacksons medical records and only the records pre2009 were submitted to her during crossexamination chernoff asked fleak about a number of mistakes during her examination such as picking up a bottle from the floor before photographing it ignoring the presence of the iv stand not taking a picture of the propofol bottle inside the cut saline bag she said she took it out to see what it was then photographed it and destroying her handwritten notes from june 25 2009 it was heard that fleak did not mention the propofol bottle was inside the saline bag in writing until march 2011 the defense suggested that she changed her story to fall into line with other witness stories regarding the bottle in the bag18 next called to testify was dan anderson chief toxicologist at the coroners office he has 21 years experience in this field he tested blood and urine taken from jackson in ucla and at autopsy on june 26 2009 blood taken from a femoral vein showed propofol 26 μgml lidocaine 084 μgml and lorazepam 0169 μgml blood taken from jacksons heart showed propofol 32 μgml lidocaine 068 μgml diazepam 01 μgml lorazepam 0162 μgml midazolam 46 μgml and a hemoglobin percentage of 51 vials of blood taken from jackson at ucla were found to contain propofol 41 μgml other results included liver lidocaine

humour propofol 04 μgml propofol was found in all 8 specimen samples also tested were the 10cc syringe and plunger the syringe barrel the fluid in the syringe and the iv tubing propofol and lidocaine found no alcohol barbiturates cocaine sedative hypnotics marijuana methamphetamine opiates codeine morphine hydrocodone or demerol were found in the samples during crossexamination it was heard that postmortem redistribution occurs in the blood stream and hence different concentrations of drugs were found in different parts of the body from which they initially entered it was also heard that the jug of urine from the bedroom could be from days before and might not even be jacksons urine that the low amount of propofol in the vitreous humour was negligible and that there was no propofol found on the iv pole the only place it was found was in the lower portion of the tubing and the syringe the drug proportions couldnt be ascertainedcitation needed october 7 2011 day 9edit dan anderson continued to answer questions about the levels of drugs in jacksons system and the substances found in the iv bag no drugs tubing and syringes in which propofol and lidocaine found found in jacksons bedroom it was heard that the level of lorazepam in jacksons system 0162 μgml was within the therapeutic range 01–02 μgml the level at which it has its desired effect it was shown that the total amount of lorazepam in jacksons stomach was 0046599 mg about 143 of a 2 mg tablet it was noted that if there were a lot of a certain substance in the blood but not much in the urine then it was recently taken the same can be said for substances in the stomachcitation needed fleak was recalled to clarify some issues with photographs and the placement of items in the photographs that she testified to on october 6citation needed next called to testify was detective scott smith of the lapd with 24 years experience in the lapd 20 years as a detective he was working for the robbery homicide division during june 2009 on june 25 2009 he entered the ucla emergency room at 425 pm and stayed until 7 pm in that time he did not see murray but collected cctv footage of murrays leaving the er at 438 pm and appearing in the west lobby at 502 pm before smith left he had brief interviews with mohammed and alvarez smith then went to the carolwood residence to assist and support the coroners investigators it was heard that everyone left the house at 930 pm and jacksons security was left in charge of the house on june 26 smith attended the autopsy which was deferred pending toxicology and then went back to the house to further investigate because the jackson family had handed some items to the police some rotten cannabis in a shaving kit some lotion paper an envelope and other debris inside the shaving kit was a bottle of temazepam prescribed by murray to omar arnold dated september 26 2008 while at the house smith found some empty pill bottles in the master bathroomcitation needed while smith was on the stand a twohour police interview with murray taken 48 hours after jacksons death was played to the court it was held in the ritz carlton hotel and orlando martinez asked the questions chernoff was present it was heard that murray first met jackson in 2006 a security guard a patients son asked murray to meet him and murray first treated jacksons children for the flu amir michael amir williams told murray that michael jackson would like murray to be there for the concerts murray understood that he would be an employee of jacksons but then discovered his salary would be paid by aeg live murray said jackson was not a person who ate well and he was probably seeing doctors for issues he did not disclose to murray it was heard that murray spent six nights a week at jacksons house only having sundays off and it was usually just murray jackson and jacksons children in the housecitation needed among murrays claims in his taped statement to police amir phoned to say jackson was finished with rehearsals at 1210 am and to meet him at the house amir got there at 1230 am jackson arrived between 105 and 110 am jackson showered murray put cream on his body because of dermatological issues at 130 am murray put an iv saline drip in his leg to treat for dehydration from dancing at rehearsals and gave the sedative valium 10 mg 1 tablet orally taken to help him sleep he did not sleep at 200 am murray gave jackson 2 mg of lorazepam diluted in saline and pushed slowly over 2–3 minutes into the iv line he observed jackson stay wide awake for an hour jackson complained he could not sleep at 300 am murray gave jackson 2 mg midazolam jackson was still awake murray tried to get jackson to meditate and turned down the lights and music his eyes closed and he fell asleep between 320 and 330 am 10–12 minutes later he was awake again at 430 am jackson was still awake and complaining need to sleep must be ready for the concerts would have to cancel the trip because i cannot function if i dont get sleep the medicine doesnt work at 500 am murray gave jackson 2 mg lorazepam jackson was still awake and complaining about canceling rehearsals not satisfying fans and there being lots of pressure at 600–630 am jackson was still awake and still talking at 730 am murray gave jackson 2 mg midazolam it had no effect and he wondered why jackson was not responding at 1000 am jackson was still awake he said he wanted milk propofol so he could sleep saying i know it works at 1040 am jackson said just make me sleep no matter what i cant function without sleep i have to cancel concerts murray claimed that he was under a lot of pressure from jackson so he switched to propofol at 1050 am murray administered jackson a dosage of 25 mg propofol diluted with lidocaine slowly infused over 3–5 minutes lidocaine was used because the propofol could burn the vessels it had a very quick effect because of the other drugs in his system murray gave 25 mg the usual dose was 50 mg before starting the drip to keep him asleep murray was asked how often had he given jackson the milk and he answered 2 months every day he was also asked before you became his doctor did you know he was taking it murray said he was surprised about how much jackson knew about the drug he knew it worked he knew how much to put in knew how to inject it he said it was the only thing that worked the lidocaine was needed with it to stop it burning jackson called it antiburn antiburn makes it comfortable other doctors allowed jackson to push it himself and murray wouldnt allow it because it made him sleep instantly murray kept telling jackson that it was artificial sleep murray said that jacksons veins were coarse dried up and filled with clots caused by too much iv use over time he could not get an iv in his hands at 1100 am jackson was asleep but not snoring usually he would be in a deep sleep and snoring so murray thought jackson would wake up again murray watched jackson oxygen saturation was 90 heart rate was 70 murray felt comfortable so he got up to go to the bathroom and took some of jacksons urine with him murray said he was gone for two minutes when murray returned jackson was not breathing and his heart rate was 122 he felt a pulse in jacksons femoral artery his body was warm and had not changed color murray started cpr and mouthtomouth resuscitation jacksons chest was rising and falling upon ventilation murray looked at the telephone then remembered none of them worked he could not move jackson off the bed to do cpr so he placed his left hand under jacksons body to continue chest compression murray said he did not call 911 because he did not know jacksons zip code he called amir to tell security to come up there was no pulse now so he lifted his legs to try to get the blood flowing to his heart he then infused 02 mg flumazenil into the iv to try to counteract the lorazepam he went to the landing to meet alvarez alvarez came in and murray told him to call 911 and to help move jackson onto the floor which he did murray was still giving cpr and mouthtomouth when the paramedics arrived and intubated him they saw pea pulseless electrical activity they could see a beat but there was no contraction and administered atropine epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate after 20 minutes the paramedics while in contact with ucla wanted to call time of death however murray got them to transfer care to him murray said i didnt want to give up i love michael he was my friend i wanted to help he was a single parent thinking about the children thinking about my own children cpr continued down to the ambulance once in the trauma bay medical personnel tried for at least an hour the emergency medical staff would have given up without me said murray they pronounced him dead but murray would not sign the death certificate because he did not know the cause of death chernoff prompted murray to tell the police about the last three days murray said jackson wanted milk nightly but murray did not want to administer it because it was not natural sleep and could be a hazard i tried to wean him off it with his knowledge to have more natural sleep i had never seen any study where someone had been addicted to propofol murray gave him lesser amounts lower doses and lower drip rate and gave lorazepam and midazolam as well jackson told murray he wanted to go all the way other doctors would do it murray said that the lorazepam and midazolam were not working jackson was suffering from withdrawal and his mind was forcing him to stay awake murray stated he tried all night but nothing would work gave him propofol just so he would get a couple of hours of sleep i didnt want to hurt him he was my friend didnt want mj to fail i cared about his writing and his producing i tried to wean him off mj was a bit restless but it was working october 11 2011 day 10edit the proceedings began with the conclusion of the recording of murrays interview with the police from 48 hours after jacksons death afterwards smith continued his testimony smith never mentioned in any notes referencing a propofol bottle being inside a saline bag during searches of jacksons home in june 2009 he saw the propofol bottle beside a cut saline bag after fleak had removed them from the costco bag and it was the only saline bag found search warrants were executed of murrays house in las vegas offices in las vegas and houston his girlfriends apartment his warehouse and his car and no propofol was found during brief statements taken from mohammed and amir at the hospital on june 25 2009 neither of them mentioned murray asking to be brought back to the residence alvarez did not mention propofol in an iv bag or murray asking him to put things in bags until after the cause of death was released on august 27 2009 dr christopher rogers chief of forensic pathology at the coroners office testified he had conducted the autopsy of jackson on june 26 2009 there was nothing obvious indicating the cause of death and he was healthier than the average person of his age because there was no atherosclerosis on the walls of his coronary arteries jackson did not have heart disease and there were no irregularities in his heart there was no evidence of natural disease or trauma his esophagus was intact with no milky fluid there or in the stomach the stomach contained no pills or capsules his mouth upper airway and trachea were all intact with no foreign material present rogers took samples from each organ and sent them to the relevant experts for consults because he was not able to determine the cause of death and wanted a toxicological analysis rogers also requested jacksons medical records from murray but never received them after toxicological analysis rogers determined the cause of death to be acute propofol intoxication with contributing effects from benzodiazepines exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular depression when asked about the manner of death he testified it was a homicide propofol was not necessary it was outside of a hospital or clinic and the proper equipment to be used with propofol was not there murray administered too much propofol the circumstances do not support selfadministration because jackson would have had to have woken up selfadminister the drugs circulate to the brain and then be found not breathing – all in the space of 2 minutes rogers said that was a less likely scenario the more likely scenario was that murray was estimating the doses to give jackson and that murray accidentally gave too much there was a cut in the rubber stopper in the propofol inconsistent with a needle but a medical device called a spike which is used to get the liquid to flow out to set up constant flow of the drug during crossexamination rogers testified that the only evidence of propofol in the medical equipment was in the syringe in the yconnector and the tubing thereafter none was found in the upper tubing or the iv saline bag defense council flanagan asked would 25 mg propofol pushed over 35minutes make the patient sleep rogers replied yes flanagan how long would they sleep for rogers approximately 5 minutes flanagan so a 25 mg dose of propofol at 1050 am would have no effect after 1105 rogers correct flanagan after this you would assume the patient sleeping was cause by something else and not propofol wouldnt you rogers yes the therapeutic range of propofol required for major surgery was 4 μgml and for lesser operations it was 2 μgml jackson had 26 μgml in his femoral blood which is used for postmortem examination because as it is not located near any large organs and is less prone to redistribution after death rogers stated that a lethal level of propofol has been documented anywhere between 1 and 17 μgml jacksons stomach level of lorazepam was 064 μgml and his femoral blood level was 0169 μgml it was hypothesized that jackson must have ingested lorazepam fairly close to the time of death for it not to have been absorbed and distributed yet flanagan a 2 mg pill of lorazepam gets you to 0018 μgml blood level rogers yes in shafers literature flanagan if you pushed all at once a dose of lorazepam to get you to 0169 μgml blood level it would stop your heart wouldnt it rogers yes on redirect walgren asked if jackson had selfadministered the propofol or lorazepam it would still be a homicide because of the negligence by murray and rogers said correct walgren asked whether the propofol found was the same as in major surgery and rogers replied yes walgren would 25 mg over 3–5 minutes get you to 26 μgml blood level rogers no october 12 2011 day 11edit dr alon steinberg a cardiologist for 13 years and boardcertified in cardiovascular diseases cardiac ct and nuclear cardiology testified that he was not an expert in anaesthesia or pharmacology and that murray was not boardcertified in june 2009 of the three degrees of breaching the standard of care no deviation mild deviation extreme deviation this case was the first time steinberg has seen extreme deviations from the standard of care steinberg testified that propofol is only used in cases of needing deep sedation when the patient will go through a significantly painful procedure and there are risks that the patient could stop breathing that is why it is used with constant monitoring and emergency equipment on hand he testified that he only uses propofol with performing cardioversions and that he is required to have an anaesthetist present for instances of mild and moderate sedation steinberg stated that he would use benzodiazepines and would never prescribe propofol for insomnia he received murrays case and was asked to review his acts and omissions against the standard of care the review was based on murrays own words from his police interview previously heard by the court his findings six separate and distinct extreme deviations from the standard of care propofol is not medically indicated for sleep i have never even heard of it being used for insomnia it is a very powerful surgical sedation agent there was also no informed consent signed by the patient risks benefits indications and alternatives should all be explained understood and agreed before any treatment propofol was being administered in the home with no equipment no medical personnel no backup and no physical observation by the attending physician each of these individually would be an extreme deviation on their own equipment needed for propofol alarm on the pulse oximeter automated blood pressure cuff ekg to monitor heart rhythm ambu bag for ventilation assistance a backboard for chest compressions a backup generator in case the power goes out a way to summon help and a device for keeping the airway open such as an endotracheal tube murray had none of this equipment personnel required intubation specialist to rescue the airway nurses for the procedures emergency personnel close by and an anaesthesiologist personnel trained in basic life support and advanced life support should be in attendance to deal with the airway maintenance iv maintenance and any arrests that may occur drugs required during sedation in the event of an emergency flumazenil naloxone lidocaine atropine beta blockers dopamine epinephrine methylprednisolone all of these should be available in a crash cart very close by inadequate preparation for emergency situation attending physician must have the drugs and personnel prepared improper care during arrest jackson had a respiratory arrest and murray did not follow the protocol for such an event during respiratory arrest the patient stops breathing causing the oxygen levels in the blood to drop lower and lower which causes the heart rate to increase lack of oxygen weakens the heart and the heart will have electricity present but will not contract pulseless electrical activity finally the hearts electricity dies asystole murray should have tried to arouse jackson placed an ambu bag over his mouth cleared the airway called 911 and administered flumazenil instead murray started chest compressions which do not help respiratory arrest the heart was already working he didnt need chest compressions even then the cpr was of poor quality since it should have involved having both hands on a hard surface rather than having one hand on a bed failure to summon emergency help murray should have called 911 on his cell phone immediately instead he waited until 1221 pm which was approximately 20 minutes after jackson stopped breathing help was four minutes away i would have allowed two minutes to check the situation before calling 911 he had a cell phone failure to maintain proper medical records no informed consent no records of jacksons vital signs doses given responses to the medication murray was confused or dishonest about the records when they got to the emergency room question dr murrays deviations in the standard of care contributed to jacksons untimely death steinberg yes question if jackson administered the drugs to himself was it still gross negligence steinberg yes all medicines are kept in locked and passworded cabinets there would have been no opportunity for selfadministration in a proper setting during crossexamination steinberg testified that if the patient had a blood pressure caused by there being a pulse and a pulse of 122 he was savable if a patient is not breathing but has a pulse the course of action is to clear the airways and give breaths next to the stand was dr nader kamanger boardcertified in internal medicine pulmonary medicine critical care and sleep medicine he uses propofol daily for sedation when placing an endotracheal tube it is the classic induction agent for deep sedation during painful procedures it is the most common drug for maintaining sedation on patients on mechanical breathing apparatus doctors have to call an anaesthesiologist to administer it someone who can maintain the airway and someone who can reverse the effects of the drugs kamanger also pointed out murrays extreme deviation of the standard of care consistent with steinbergs testimony october 13 2011 day 12edit next to the stand was steven shafer a professor of anesthesiology at columbia university since 2007 and adjunct professor of anesthesiology at stanford university since 2000 he is an expert on pharmacokinetics rate of onset of drug action duration of action and elimination of drug action in sum and pharmacometrics with 20 years of experience working with the food and drug administration fda his field of interest involves mathematically modeling and how a dose of drug translates to concentrations in the body and its effects on a patient he has published 19 papers about the pharmacokinetics of propofol pharmacokinetics involves the study of the dilution of drug in a patients blood stream shafer is the current editor in chief for the journal of anesthesia and analgesia and on the editing board of many other journals he testified about the history of the dosing guidelines of propofol october 19–20 2011 days 13 and 14edit shafer showed a video of the use of propofol during a procedure he testified about his review of the murray case he found seventeen separate and distinct egregious violations of the standard of care of which four were unconscionable based on murrays police interview the lack of the basic emergency airway equipment the lack of the advanced emergency airway equipment the lack of suction apparatus the lack of an iv infusion pump the lack of alarmed pulse oximetry the failure to use a blood pressure cuff the lack of an electrocardiogram the lack of capnography the failure to maintain a doctorpatient relationship the failure to continuously monitor the mental status of the patient the failure to continuously monitor the breathing of the patient the failure to continuously monitor blood pressure and pulse oximetry and to have heart monitors the failure to call 911 immediately the failure to chart at the outset of the procedure egregious and unconscionable the failure to maintain written informed consent egregious and unconscionable the failure to document throughout the course of sedation egregious and unconscionable the failure to disclose to both the paramedics and ucla the use of propofol and what murray witnessed at the arrest question each one of these seventeen egregious violations is individually likely or expected to result in injury or death to michael jackson response yes shafer showed simulations of propofol and lorazepam on his computer models i if the drugs were bolus pushed he stated that the drugs administered as described in murrays interview statement could not have produced the femoral blood levels at autopsy he also testified that jackson repeatedly selfadministrating the drugs would not have caused the femoral blood levels found at autopsy ii if the drugs were iv administered administration by continued iv infusion would cause the femoral blood levels found at autopsy very quickly after the drip was started after the patient stops breathing the heart would still be beating so the iv would continue this scenario would result in the blood levels at autopsy according to shafer thats what i think happened based on all the evidence shafer demonstrated the setup of an iv infusion of propofol the iv line for propofol would need an air vent to allow air into the bottle and an infusion pump to control the dose without a pump it is very hard to control the dose he testified that he had never seen anything like the cut bag setup and had never seen anyone do it walgren asked shafer a number of question regarding his testimony over the last few days you have noted seventeen egregious violation from the standard of care four of which you found were unconscionable yes showed us the video in which you demonstrated the safe and proper mean to administer sedation yes and it is your opinion that those safeguards and that equipment is necessary even if the physician intents on administering just 25 mg of propofol yes you have explained to us why it is impossible that michael jackson died as a result of orally swallowing propofol yes you discussed lorazepam and you concluded that michael jackson received more than the 4 mg of lorazepam that dr murray claimed to have given michael jackson yes you also rejected the notion that certainly at ten o clock am that michael jackson swallowed eight 2 mg tablets of lorazepam yes and you would broaden that window to four hours meaning between eight and noon based on what was found in the stomach it was impossible that michael jackson swallowed that amount of lorazepam correct you demonstrated here the simulation of how one would infuse propofol with this type of set up and with some of the evidence recovered in this case yes and that the infusion line with the propofol in it could be compacted into the fist of my hand yes taking all the evidence that youve reviewed and all the deviations from the standard of care youve concluded that conrad murray was not only a substantial factor but a direct cause of michael jacksons death yes had all this transpired as relayed by dr murray and subsequent to that michael jackson had either injected propofol andor swallowed lorazepam tablets is it still your opinion that conrad murray was a direct cause not just a substantial factor of michael jacksons death absolutely and why is that thats because he is a physician who has brought propofol into the room started an intravenous and provided access to propofol to a patient who may in fact be developing a dependency on sedatives and he has been entrusted by michael jackson to look after his safety every night and he has failed that responsibility by enabling the administration of intravenous propofol he is responsible for every drop of propofol in that room and lorazepam every drop of lorazepam in that room and thats because conrad murray set up the situation when he abandoned the patient in the room yes october 21 2011 day 15edit chernoff crossexamined shafer on his cv and about his relationship with the defenses expert dr paul white october 24 2011 day 16edit the crossexamination of shafer concluded and the prosecution rested timeline

lee he had been administered diprivan before but only for surgery not for anything else lee says she didnt know what diprivan was so she called a doctor friend of hers who said it was an anesthetic used for surgery in hospital jackson told her other doctors had said diprivan was safe to use that all he needed was to be monitored jackson asked her to stay that night because he wanted to show lee he was unable to sleep he slept for 5 hours woke up and was upset that he didnt sleep longer and that the nutritional medicine wasnt working he then said the only thing that helps is diprivan can you find someone to help me sleep as soon as diprivan gets in my veins it knocks me out and i go to sleep right away lee said i know you want to be knocked out but what if you dont wake up i just need to be monitored she told jackson that no one who cared or had his best interests at heart would give him propofol jackson complained to lee that not sleeping would mess up my performance lee testified

arena in london move the mountain to mohammed this can only happen with such a big star this was the first phase of a multiyear tour it was apparent that jackson was motivated energized and receptive to the idea they had numerous meetings afterwards one reason jackson wanted to do the concerts was to settle down and make a good home for the children and not live like vagabonds contract was drawn up and signed in midjan 2009 for thirty one shows jackson wanted to do ten more than prince did chernoff asked questions about the finances of the contract all questions were objected to and the judge sustained them it was heard that ten shows went on sale first and the demand was over the top we had never seen that kinds of demand for tickets it was obviously we would have blown through thirtyone shows in the presale and not had any for general sales within twenty minutes jackson agreed to more shows jackson said he wanted to do maximum fifty shows because he didnt want a passport didnt want

email shafer back and contacted flanagan instead during crossexamination walgren asked henson why the people and the defence have 2 different copies of lorazepam results henson said he did not know october 26 2011 day 18edit first witness of the day was gerry causey who lives in cedar city utah causey has known murray for 11 years they met when he lived in las vegas when causey had a heart

always explained me everything he was doing he has been in constant contact with murray ever since he was in hospital they have remained friends it was heard that they have remained friends because of the love dr murray has for his patients causey has stated murray is his best friend causey said that murray was not greedy he has never been he would treat you regardless whether you had insurance or not murray broke down in tears when causey said murray would spend all time necessary with him he would call his wife to explain problems it was heard that causey has given two tv interviews regarding murray he gave them free of charge to help my friend during crossexamination causey said that dr murray is known for his compassion his feelings you can ask any of his patients hes the best doctor in the world i dont think he did what hes accused of from what i know what i feel right now he didnt do it walgren asked causey even if he knew murray was grossly negligent if he would come and testify on the docs behalf he said yes causey was excused and as he walked out he kissed dr murray on the forehead and shook his hand next to the stand was andrew guest also a previous patient of murrays from

man it was heard that guest did an interview free of charge with cnn because he believed murray needed support and wasnt getting a fair shake walgren asked nothing would change your opinion of that man would it guest replied correct next to the stand was lunette sampson another patient of murrays she now lives in san diego but lived in las vegas for long time sampson had 2 heart attacks while in las vegas dr murray treated her i have never had a doctor that was more caring and thorough when asked if she thought murray was greedy or was motivated by money she said i know dr murray is not

hix when did you learn dr murray was going on tour with jackson hix replied i didnt even know it until i saw it on tv next to the stand was ruby mosley she lives in houston shes the secretary of acres home citizens council a low income seniors community dr murrays father was a doctor in the acres home district dr murray opened clinic in his fathers memory he made a commitment to community to open a clinic in memory of his dad dr m snr was there from 1968 until 2003 upon chernoff asking if murray was greedy mosley replied if this man was greedy he wouldve not come to work at acres home where 75 of people are poor he was making less than in las vegas murray treated mosley for heart problems october 27 2011 day 19edit first to take the stand was dr robert waldman a physician specializing in internal medicine nephrology and addiction medicine has been involved in addiction medicine and treating patients who have addiction diseases for 23 years but is not boardcertified in it he described to the court what happens to a patient during addiction and withdrawal including the telltale signs the symptoms and the drugs that can be involved dr waldman stated that the side effects of withdrawal of drugs are sweating increase heart rate nausea cramp insomnia temperature deregulation and tremendous anxiety it was heard that the addicts biggest fear is that youre not going to respect the amount of discomfort theyll go through during treatment and detoxing process it was also heard that rapid detox is not a treatment it uses high levels of sedation intravenously and it is a process that uses general anesthesia to help tolerate the discomfort it was heard that dr waldmans opinion is that there is evidence to suggest jackson was dependent not addicted on demerol pethidine due to the frequent high doses he received in may 2009 indicated by dr kleins medical records of omar arnold an alias of jacksons it was heard that dr kleins medical records indicate that in april 2009 jackson received 775 mg of demerol for botox and restylane procedures during the three days in beginning of may 2009 jackson received another 900 mg of demerol for botox and restylane procedures dr waldman said being injected during 6 days with very high doses of demerol would create opioid dependency in anyone of us next to the stand was dr paul white with an interest in intravenous anesthesia he started working with propofol in 1983 the fda approved it for general anesthesia in 1989 he has published 435 papers on pubmed he has written about fifteen books in which two were major textbooks dr white has written five books on propofol as well as twenty one chapters on propofol in various textbooks after initial study showed propofol allowed patients to wake up sooner he went back to company and asked to do followup study dr white said some people call me the father of monitored anesthetic care mac anesthesia awareness sedation in january of this year mr flanagan contacted me and mentioned the name conrad murray i wasnt sure if i wanted to get involved in a highprofile trial involving death of a celebrity i was perplexed how experts determined that murray was infusing propofol it was not obvious to me dr white met the shafers in 1981 shortly after arrival at stanford they approached him about doing research it was heard that dr white performed a study with animals found that propofol directly into stomach has no clinical effect regarding the paper dr shafer testified about a sleep study in china dr white said my take on the paper was different than dr shafers the study showed that propofol was safe and effective for normalizing disturbed sleep but its certainly not a definitive study october 28 2011 day 20edit white was back on the stand being examined by j michael flanagan it was heard that based on the diagram showing what dr murray told the police he gave to jackson on the night in question it would not have presented any danger at all white said that the dose of propofol we are talking here is 25 mg this is a dose that produces little anxiety little sleepiness it was heard that anesthesiologists are obviously trained in sedation for nonanesthesiologists most hospitals require certification to use sedation white was then given a certificate to read it was murrays certification from sunrise medical hospital approving him to administer moderate sedation it qualifies the doctor to administer drugs to achieve moderate sedation but he must monitor patients carefully the certification also says the doctor is approved to rescue patients from deep sedation manage compromised airway and provide adequate ventilation flanagan and white went through simulations that shafer put together with variables of amount of drugs and time administered it was heard that the fact that there is some free lorazepam in the stomach showing that jackson took lorazepam orally at some point before his death flanagan went going through different scenarios with dr white that this could have caused jacksons death dr white then demonstrated how to mix propofol and lidocaine inside a syringe and administered it through a saline drip and y tube white injected 5 mg of propofolsaline mix into a cup to show that propofol doesnt go up the iv line and propofol sticks to the plastic tubing he said that this is certainly a very safe way to inject propofol and it was only 25 mg my demonstration was probably close to what happened at the scene youd need a mechanism to drip the drug and hold this heavy bottle flanagan asked if he could envision anyone using a slit iv bag to hang the propofol bottle when theres handle on the bottle no white added why would anyone go through the hassle of cutting a saline bag to put bottle inside when bottle has a handle flanagan then asked how you would mix propofol solution with saline to make it 1–1 mgml you pull tab off the bottle spike top then inject all the bottle of propofol into the saline bag shaking the bag to make it 11 μgml it was heard that propofol is extensively metabolized but some is eliminated in the urine in unchanged form autopsy level determined extremely small level there was half of liter of urine in jacksons bladder at time of autopsy it contained very little amount of unchanged propofol white commented i cannot understand a 3hour infusion theory where there were evidence of infusion set up and elimination of drug in urine flanagan then asked do you think it was self injection of propofol nearly 1130a12p did it in my opinion yes flanagan then asked shafer said his scenario reconciled with all facts in this case does it reconcile with dr murrays statement no does dr shafers theory reconcile with physical evidence at the scene or urine concentration no dr white said my theory reconciles with the evidence found at the scene and urine concentration at autopsy dr white proposed that consistent with murrays claim of having administered a dose of 25 mg of propofol michael jackson would have woken up after 1015 minutes max following which he selfinjected 25 mg of propofol while murray was out of the room the combination of lorezapam another sedative midazolam and propofol could have been potentially lethal19 october 31 2011 day 21edit it was heard from white that administering propofol without careful bedside monitoring could be dangerous do you agree there were instances where dr murray deviated from standard of care on june 25 2009 yes walgren asked have you ever administered propofol in someones bedroom no have you heard anyone else doing it no dr white agrees dr murray deviated from the standard of care of jackson but doesnt know to what degree do you disagree with dr shafers opinion that failure to keep medical records egregious and unconscionable deviation white doesnt know what the words egregious and unconscionable mean in this case would you administer propofol to a patient without proper airwayopening equipment i would certainly have means for ventilation means of ventilation could be an ambu bag and a mask not necessarily other respiratory equipment it was heard that dr white has received 11000 so far for his testimony in this case he usually charges 3500 per day and any expenses such as airfares he doesnt think the defense have this much so will not bill them that much dr safer testified for many days and performed numerous simulations for both the prosecution and defense for free was dr murray offered money to provide jacksons propofol it is my understanding that dr murray was offered money to be jacksons personal doctor walgren then asked if you injected 25 mg propofol is it ok to walk out of the room 25 mg only lasts 1530 minutes after that i see no problem in leaving the patients bedside if the patient liked to push propofol themselves would you walk out of room no upon being asked about murrays actions after he found jackson dr white said i would have done things differently i would have called for help called 911 and initiated cpr when being asked about murrays delay to call 911 he stated i would have called 911 earlier but do not believe it would have made any difference in this case 35 minutes after finding him i would call 911 it was heard that forgetting to mention propofol was a detail overlooked could also be a lie yes after dr white mentioned he believed that jackson had his own stash of propofol walgren asked the judge to admonish witness to respond the question only judge asked jurors to leave the courtroom walgren asked do you reject that jackson drank propofol and that caused his death yes i speculated that oral administration may have played a role i dont reject completely the selfadministration theory the evidence suggests that jackson did not drink propofol flanagan then asked dr white if patient died on noon would it matter if help came 5 minutes later unlikely dr white continued and added propofol does not have a reversal treatment only treatment for propofol overdose is time during his testimony dr white was fined for contempt of court after disobeying an order by the judge to not refer to personal discussions with murray in his testimony instead to only reference statements from murrays official police report dr white could have been fined up to 1000 but the judge set the fine to 250 dr white told the judge i did my best as i was admonished by you to answer question truthfully and as completely as i could he also stated i apologize profusely if i disrespected you i learned a lot from this experience a second charge for contempt of court against dr white was dropped after an online report alleged he had muttered scumbag as his colleague dr shafer approached to testify20 after court adjourned the judge told attorneys he will give them one day off so they can prepare for closing arguments if done by tuesday wednesday could be dark the judge said he has prepared to give a full day off which takes it to thursday for jury instructions he says he would not defer that the judge asked murray if hes going to testify murray replied i need more time to talk to my lawyers i have not made my final decision judge pastor told murray that he will have until tomorrow morning to decide murray said it will all depend on how the case progresses after defense concludes with dr white they plan on calling dr ornellas the person who put together the models in which dr white spoke about after dr ornellas defense is prepared to rest their case walgren said he will call dr shafer briefly as a rebuttal witness judge then said he expects all the evidence in the case to be concluded tomorrow trial is set to resume at 930 am with end of redirect of dr white november 1 2011 day 22edit the re direct examination of dr white continues with mr flanagan asking the questions about various models that dr white had commissioned for the defence they talked about the level of lorazepam in jacksons body in the models created by dr shafer and dr whites expert it was heard that there are many possibilities as to how the blood and urine levels got to where they were at autopsy the models present a few different ideas and scenarios we can make models and adjust the timedose to achieve the concentration of lorazepam found in femoral blood at time of autopsy there are great differences between different patients so the models are subject to huge population variability flanagan to dr white we dont know how many lorazepam pills jackson took do we no one can be sure dr white said that dr shafers scenario of a threehour infusion does not hold up because the urine levels of propofol at autopsy are too low dr white said that while standards of care are the ideals standards of practice are different in different situations some office procedures ie such as procedures from hospital to hospital might have different conditions and standards or practice if it is not possible to have the highest standard of care dr white stated that 25 mg over 35 minute of propofol would only produce light sleepiness possibly no sleep at all murray decided not to take the stand in his defense the defense had no more witnesses and rested their case prosecution recalled dr steven shafer it was heard that there was no suggestion jackson died at any specific time only the fact he died with high level of infusion of propofol it was heard that the propofol elimination in the urine is 00040002 of the total dose given the excreted unchanged propofol found in the urine at autopsy was 825 μg this indicates that more than 2000 mg propofol was administered to jackson this rules out the hypothesis by dr white and indicates more propofol than dr shafers models dr shafer said that if there were such a thing as bedroombased anesthesia the standard guidelines would be a minimum you would require many more precautions november 3 2011 day 23edit the jury heard instructions from the judge both prosecution and defense closing
