who were all early employees of paypal6 hurley had studied design at indiana university of pennsylvania and chen and karim studied computer science together at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign7 according to a story that has often been repeated in the media hurley and chen developed the idea for youtube during the early months of 2005 after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at chens apartment in san francisco karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred but chen commented that the idea that youtube was founded after a dinner party was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible8 karim said the inspiration for youtube first came from janet jacksons role in the 2004 super bowl incident when her breast was exposed during her performance and later from the 2004 indian ocean tsunami karim could not easily find video clips of either event online

eric schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from viacom which alleged that youtube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute308 the system which became known as content id309 creates an id file for copyrighted audio and video material and stores it in a database when a video is uploaded it is checked against the database and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found310 when this occurs the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable tracking the viewing statistics of the video or adding advertisements to the video youtube describes content id as very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective id file310 content id accounts for over a third of the monetized views on youtube311 an independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to youtube and concluded that while the system was surprisingly resilient in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos it was not infallible312 the use of content id to remove material automatically has led to

decision314 prior to 2016 videos werent monetized until the dispute was resolved since april 2016 videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress and the money goes to whoever won the

to death in 1989318319 in july 2008 the culture and media committee of the house of commons of the united kingdom stated that it was unimpressed with youtubes system for policing its videos and argued that proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting usergenerated content youtube responded by stating we have strict rules on whats allowed and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 247 review team and have it dealt with promptly we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly320 july 2008 in october 2010 us congressman anthony weiner urged youtube to remove from its website videos of imam anwar alawlaki321 youtube pulled some of the videos in

over where their ads appear329330 in earlyapril 2017 the youtube channel h3h3productions presented evidence claiming that a wall street journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing johnny rebel music overlaid on a chief keef music video citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader the video was retracted after it was found that the ads had actually been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video331332 on april 6 2017 youtube announced that in order to ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review and have at least 10000 lifetime views before they may join the partner

and content in 2006 time praised web 20 for enabling community and collaboration on a scale never seen before and added that youtube harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom some of the comments on youtube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred334 the guardian in 2009 described users comments on youtube as “ juvenile aggressive misspelled sexist homophobic swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a lol youtube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance – with the occasional burst of wit shining through335 ” in september 2008 the daily telegraph commented that youtube was notorious for some of the most confrontational and illformed comment exchanges on the internet and reported on youtube comment snob a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts336 the huffington post noted in april

on google that required all youtube users to use a google account in order to comment on videos the stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone338 the new system restored the ability to include urls in comments which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse339340 in response youtube cofounder jawed karim posted the question why the fuck do i need a google account to comment on a video on his youtube channel to express his negative opinion of the change341 the official youtube announcement342 received 20097 thumbs down votes and generated more than 32000 comments in two days343 writing in the newsday blog silicon island chase melvin noted that google is nowhere near as popular a social media network as facebook but its essentially being forced upon millions of youtube users who dont want to lose their ability to comment on videos and discussion forums across the internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system in the same article melvin goes on to say344 “ perhaps user complaints are justified but the idea of revamping the old system isnt so bad think of the crude misogynistic and raciallycharged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on youtube without any discernible moderation isnt any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot the system is far from perfect but google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate youtubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity ” on july 27 2015 google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a google account to post comments to youtube345 on november 3 2016

comments346 creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam they can also allow other users to moderate their comments347 view counts in december 2012 two billion views were removed from the view counts of universal and sony music videos on youtube prompting a claim by the daily dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the sites terms of service which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts this was disputed by billboard which said that the two billion views had been moved to vevo since the videos were no longer active on youtube348349 on august 5 2015 youtube removed the feature which caused a videos view count to freeze at 301 later 301 until the actual count was verified to prevent view count
