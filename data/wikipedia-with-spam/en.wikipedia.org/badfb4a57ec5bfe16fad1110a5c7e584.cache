edit on wikidata hyperbaric medicine is medical treatment in which an ambient pressure greater than sea level atmospheric pressure is a necessary component the treatment comprises hyperbaric oxygen therapy hbot the medical use of oxygen at an ambient pressure higher than atmospheric pressure and therapeutic recompression for decompression illness intended to reduce the injurious effects of systemic gas bubbles by physically reducing their size and providing improved conditions for elimination of bubbles and excess dissolved gas the equipment required for hyperbaric oxygen treatment consists of a pressure chamber which may be of rigid or flexible construction and a means of delivering 100 oxygen operation is performed to a predetermined schedule by trained personnel who monitor the patient and may adjust the schedule as required hbot found early use in the treatment of decompression sickness and has also shown great effectiveness in treating conditions such as gas gangrene and carbon monoxide poisoning more recent research has examined the possibility that it may also have value for other conditions such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis but no significant evidence has been found therapeutic recompression is usually also provided in a hyperbaric chamber it is the definitive treatment for decompression sickness and may also be used to treat arterial gas embolism caused by pulmonary barotrauma of ascent in emergencies divers may sometimes be treated by inwater recompression if a chamber is not available and suitable diving equipment to reasonably secure the airway is available a number of hyperbaric treatment schedules have been published over the years for both therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for other conditions

which is the medical use of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body and therapeutic recompression which involves increasing the ambient pressure on a person usually a diver to treat decompression sickness or an air embolism by eliminating bubbles that have formed within the body medical usesedit in the united states the undersea and hyperbaric

use in autism cancer diabetes hivaids alzheimers disease asthma bells palsy cerebral palsy depression heart disease migraines multiple sclerosis parkinsons disease spinal cord injury sports injuries or stroke434445 a cochrane review published in 2016 has raised questions about the ethical basis for future clinical trials of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in view of the increased risk of damage to the eardrum in children with autism spectrum disorders46 despite the lack of evidence in 2015 the number of people utilizing this therapy has continued to rise47 hearing issuesedit there is limited evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves hearing in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss who present within two weeks of hearing loss there is some indication that hbot might improve tinnitus presenting in the same time frame48 chronic ulcersedit hbot in diabetic foot ulcers increased the rate of early ulcer healing but does not appear to provide any benefit in wound healing at longterm followup in particular there was no difference in major amputation rate49 for venous arterial and pressure ulcers no evidence was apparent that hbot provides a longterm improvement over standard treatment20 radiation injuryedit there is some evidence that hbot is effective for late radiation tissue injury of bone and soft tissues of the head and neck some people with radiation injuries of the head neck or bowel show an improvement in quality of life importantly no such effect has been found in neurological tissues the use of hbot may be justified to selected patients and tissues but further research is required to establish the best people to treat and timing of any hbo therapy50 neurorehabilitationedit as of 2012 there is insufficient evidence to support using hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people who have traumatic brain injuries51 in stroke hbot does not show benefit5245 hbot in multiple sclerosis has not shown benefit and routine use is not recommended4453 a 2007 review of hbot in cerebral palsy found no difference compared to the control group5455 neuropsychological tests also showed no difference between hbot and room air and based on caregiver report those who received room air had significantly better mobility and social functioning5455 children receiving hbot were reported to experience seizures and the need for tympanostomy tubes to equalize ear pressure though the incidence was not clear54 canceredit in alternative medicine hyperbaric medicine has been promoted as a treatment for cancer a 2012 review article in the journal targeted oncology reports that there is no evidence indicating that hbo neither acts as a stimulator of tumor growth nor as an enhancer of recurrence on the other hand there is evidence that implies that hbo might have tumorinhibitory effects in certain cancer subtypes and we thus strongly believe that we need to expand our knowledge on the effect and the mechanisms behind tumor oxygenation56 however a 2011 study by the american cancer society reported no evidence it is effective for this purpose57 migrainesedit lowquality evidence suggests that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may reduce the pain associated with an acute migraine headache in some cases58 it is not known which people would benefit from this treatment and there is no evidence that hyperbaric medicine can prevent future migraines58 more research is necessary to confirm the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for treating migraines58 contraindicationsedit the toxicology of the treatment has recently been reviewed by ustundag et al59 and its risk management is discussed by christian r mortensen in light of the fact that most hyperbaric facilities are managed by departments of anaesthesiology and some of their patients are critically ill60 the only absolute contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen therapy is untreated pneumothorax61 the reason is concern that it can progress to tension pneumothorax especially during the decompression phase of therapy although treatment on oxygenbased tables may avoid that progression62 the copd patient with a large bleb represents a relative contraindication for similar reasons63page needed also the treatment may raise the issue of occupational health and safety ohs which has been encountered by the therapist64clarification needed patients should not undergo hbo therapy if they are taking or have recently taken the following drugscitation needed doxorubicin adriamycin – a chemotherapeutic drug this drug has been shown to potentiate cytotoxicity during hbo therapy cisplatin – also a chemotherapeutic drug disulfiram antabuse – used in the treatment of alcoholism mafenide acetate sulfamylon – suppresses bacterial infections in burn wounds the following are relative contraindications meaning that special consideration must be made by specialist physicians before hbo treatments begin cardiac diseaseclarification needed copd with air trapping can lead to pneumothorax during treatment upper respiratory infections – these conditions can make it difficult for the patient to equalise their ears or sinuses which can result in what is termed ear or sinus squeeze61 high fevers – in most cases the fever should be lowered before hbo treatment begins fevers may predispose to convulsions61 emphysema with co2 retention – this condition can lead to pneumothorax during hbo treatment due to rupture of an emphysematous bulla this risk can be evaluated by xray61clarification needed history of thoracic chest surgery – this is rarely a problem and usually not considered a contraindication however there is concern that air may be trapped in lesions that were created by surgical scarring these conditions need to be evaluated prior to considering hbo therapy61 malignant disease cancers thrive in bloodrich environments but may be suppressed by high oxygen levels hbo treatment of individuals who have cancer presents a problem since hbo both increases blood flow via angiogenesis and also raises oxygen levels taking an antiangiogenic supplement may provide a solution6566 a study by feldemier et al and recent nih funded study on stem cells by thom et al indicate that hbo is actually beneficial in producing stemprogenitor cells and the malignant process is not accelerated67 middle ear barotrauma is always a consideration in treating both children and adults in a hyperbaric environment because of the necessity to equalise pressure in the ears pregnancy is not a relative contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen treatments63page needed although it may be for underwater diving in cases where a pregnant woman has carbon monoxide poisoning there is evidence that lower pressure 20 ata hbot treatments are not harmful to the fetus and that the risk involved is outweighed by the greater risk of the untreated effects of co on the fetus neurologic abnormalities or death6869 in pregnant patients hbo therapy has been shown to be safe for the fetus when given at appropriate levels and “doses” durations in fact pregnancy lowers the threshold for hbo treatment of carbon monoxideexposed patients this is due to the high affinity of fetal hemoglobin for co63page needed therapeutic principlesedit the therapeutic consequences of hbot and recompression result from multiple effects170 the increased overall pressure is of therapeutic value in the treatment of decompression sickness and air embolism as it provides a physical means of reducing the volume of inert gas bubbles within the body71 exposure to this increased pressure is maintained for a period long enough to ensure that most of the bubble gas is dissolved back into the tissues removed by perfusion and eliminated in the lungs70 the improved concentration gradient for inert gas elimination oxygen window by using a high partial pressure of oxygen increases the rate of inert gas elimination in the treatment of decompression sickness7273 for many other conditions the therapeutic principle of hbot lies in its ability to drastically increase partial pressure of oxygen in the tissues of the body the oxygen partial pressures achievable using hbot are much higher than those achievable while breathing pure oxygen under normobaric conditions ie at normal atmospheric pressure this effect is achieved by an increase in the oxygen transport capacity of the blood at normal atmospheric pressure oxygen transport is limited by the oxygen binding capacity of hemoglobin in red blood cells and very little oxygen is transported by blood plasma because the hemoglobin of the red blood cells is almost saturated with oxygen at atmospheric pressure this route of transport cannot be exploited any further oxygen transport by plasma however is significantly increased using hbot because of the higher solubility of oxygen as pressure increases70 a study suggests that exposure to hyperbaric oxygen hbot might also mobilize stemprogenitor cells from the bone marrow by a nitric oxidedependent mechanism74 hyperbaric chambersedit multiplace hyperbaric chambers showing control panel monitoring facilities and different chamber sizes in spanish facilities constructionedit the traditional type of hyperbaric chamber used for therapeutic recompression and hbot is a rigid shelled pressure vessel such chambers can be run at absolute pressures typically about 6 bars 87 psi 600000 pa or more in special cases75 navies professional diving organizations hospitals and dedicated recompression facilities typically operate these they range in size from semiportable onepatient units to roomsized units that can treat eight or more patients the larger units may be rated for lower pressures if they are not primarily intended for treatment of diving injuries a rigid chamber may consist of a pressure vessel that is generally made of steel or aluminiumcitation needed with the view ports windows made of acrylic75 one or more human entry hatches—small and circular or wheelin type hatches for patients on gurneys75 the entry lock that allows human entry—a separate chamber with two hatches one to the outside and one to the main chamber which can be independently pressurized to allow patients to enter or exit the main chamber while it is still pressurized75 a low volume medical or service airlock for medicines instruments and food75 transparent ports or closedcircuit television that allows technicians and medical staff outside the chamber to monitor the patient inside the chamber an intercom system allowing twoway communication75 an optional carbon dioxide scrubber—consisting of a fan that passes the gas inside the chamber through a soda lime canister75 a control panel outside the chamber to open and close valves that control air flow to and from the chamber and regulate oxygen to hoods or masks75 an overpressure relief valve75 a builtin breathing system bibs to supply and exhaust treatment gas75 a fire suppression system75 flexible monoplace chambers are available ranging from collapsible flexible aramid fiberreinforced chambers which can be disassembled for transport via truck or suv with a maximum working pressure of 2 bar above ambient complete with bibs allowing full oxygen treatment schedules767778 to portable air inflated soft chambers that can operate at between 03 and 05 bars 44 and 73 psi above atmospheric pressure with no supplemental oxygen and longitudinal zipper closure79 hard chambers and soft chambers are not equivalent in efficacy and safety as they are different in many aspectscitation needed oxygen supplyedit a recompression chamber for a single diving casualty in the larger multiplace chambers patients inside the chamber breathe from either oxygen hoods – flexible transparent soft plastic hoods with a seal around the neck similar to a space suit helmet – or tightly fitting oxygen masks which supply pure oxygen and may be designed to directly exhaust the exhaled gas from the chamber during treatment patients breathe 100 oxygen most of the time to maximise the effectiveness of their treatment but have periodic air breaks during which they breathe chamber air 21 oxygen to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity the exhaled treatment gas must be removed from the chamber to prevent the buildup of oxygen which could present a fire risk attendants may also breathe oxygen some of the time to reduce their risk of decompression sickness when they leave the chamber the pressure inside the chamber is increased by opening valves allowing highpressure air to enter from storage cylinders which are filled by an air compressor chamber air oxygen content is kept between 19 and 23 to control fire risk us navy maximum 2575 if the chamber does not have a scrubber sysytem to remove carbon dioxide from the chamber gas the chamber must be isobarically ventilated to keep the co2 within acceptable limits75 a soft chamber may be pressurised directly from a compressor79 or from storage cylinders78 smaller monoplace chambers can only accommodate the patient and no medical staff can enter the chamber may be pressurised with pure oxygen or compressed air if pure oxygen is used no oxygen breathing mask or helmet is needed but the cost of using pure oxygen is much higher than that of using compressed air if compressed air is used then an oxygen mask or hood is needed as in a multiplace chamber most monoplace chambers can be fitted with a demand breathing system for air breaks80 in low pressure soft chambers treatment schedules may not require air breaks because the risk of oxygen toxicity is low due to the lower oxygen partial pressures used usually 13 ata and short duration of treatment for alert cooperative patients air breaks provided by mask are more effective than changing the chamber gas because they provide a quicker gas change and a more reliable gas composition both during the break and treatment periods81 treatmentsedit initially hbot was developed as a treatment for diving disorders involving bubbles of gas in the tissues such as decompression sickness and gas embolism it is still considered the definitive treatment for these conditions the chamber treats decompression sickness and gas embolism by increasing pressure reducing the size of the gas bubbles and improving the transport of blood to downstream tissues the high concentrations of oxygen in the tissues are beneficial in keeping oxygenstarved tissues alive and have the effect of removing the nitrogen from the bubble making it smaller until it consists only of oxygencitation neededclarification needed which is reabsorbed into the body after elimination of bubbles the pressure is gradually reduced back to atmospheric levels hyperbaric chambers are also used for animals especially race horses where a recovery is worth a great deal to their owners it is also used to treat dogs and cats in pre and postsurgery treatment to strengthen their systems prior to surgery and then accelerate healing post surgery protocoledit main article hyperbaric treatment schedules the slang term at some facilities for a cycle of pressurization inside the hbot chamber is a dive an hbot treatment for longerterm conditions is often a series of 20 to 40 dives or compressions these dives last for about an hour and can be administered via a hard highpressure chamber or a soft lowpressure chamber—the major difference being perdive dose of oxygen many conditions do quite well with the lower dose lower costperhour soft chamberscitation needed emergency hbot for decompression illness follows treatment schedules laid out in treatment tables most cases employ a recompression to 28 bars 41 psi absolute the equivalent of 18 metres 60 ft of water for 45 to 55 hours with the casualty breathing pure oxygen but taking air breaks every 20 minutes to reduce oxygen toxicity for extremely serious cases resulting from very deep dives the treatment may require a chamber capable of a maximum pressure of 8 bars 120 psi the equivalent of 70 metres 230 ft of water and the ability to supply heliox as a breathing gas70 us navy treatment charts are used in canada and the united states to determine the duration pressure and breathing gas of the therapy the most frequently used tables are table 5 and table 6 in the uk the royal navy 62 and 67 tables are used the undersea and hyperbaric medical society uhms publishes a report that compiles the latest research findings and contains information regarding the recommended duration and pressure of the longerterm conditions82 home and outpatient

december 2009 learn how and when to remove this template message an example of mild portable hyperbaric chamber this 40inchdiameter 1000 mm chamber is one of the larger chambers available for home there are several sizes of portable chambers which are used for home treatment these are usually referred to as mild personal hyperbaric chambers which is a reference to the lower pressure compared to hard chambers of softsided chambers food and drug administration fda approved chambers for use with room air are available in the usa and may go up to 44 pounds per square inch psi above atmospheric pressurecitation needed which equals 13 atmospheres absolute ata equivalent to a depth of 10 feet of sea water in the us these mild personal hyperbaric chambers are categorized by the fda as class ii medical devices and requires a prescription in order to purchase one or take treatments83 personal hyperbaric chambers are only fda approved to reach 13 atacitation needed while hyperbaric chamber distributors and manufacturers cannot supply a chamber in the us with any form of elevated oxygen delivery system a physician can write a prescription to combine the two modalities as long as there is a prescription for both hyperbarics and oxygencitation needed the most common option but not approved by fda some patients choose is to acquire an oxygen concentrator which typically delivers 85–96 oxygen as the breathing gas because of the high circulation of air through the chamber the total concentration of oxygen in the chamber never exceeds 25 as this can increase the risk of firecitation needed oxygen is never fed directly into soft chambers but is rather introduced via a line and mask directly to the patient fda approved oxygen concentrators for human consumption in confined areas used for hbot are regularly monitored for purity 1 and flow 10 to 15 liters per minute outflow pressure an audible alarm will sound if the purity ever drops below 80 personal hyperbaric chambers use 120 volt or 220 volt outlets ranging in size from 21 inches up to 40 inches in diameter these chambers measure between 84 in 7 ft to 120 in 10 ft in lengthcitation needed the soft chambers are approved by the fda for the treatment of altitude sickness but are commonly used for other offlabel purposescitation needed possible complications and concernsedit there are risks associated with hbot similar to some diving disorders pressure changes can cause a squeeze or barotrauma in the tissues surrounding trapped air inside the body such as the lungs62 behind the eardrum8485 inside paranasal sinuses84 or trapped underneath dental fillings86 breathing highpressure oxygen may cause oxygen toxicity87 temporarily blurred vision can be caused by swelling of the lens which usually resolves in two to four weeks8889 there are reports that cataract may progress following hbot90 also a rare side effect has been blindness secondary to optic neuritis inflammation of the optic nervecitation needed effects of pressureedit patients inside the chamber may notice discomfort inside their ears as a pressure difference develops between their middle ear and the chamber atmosphere91 this can be relieved by ear clearing using the valsalva maneuver or other techniques continued increase of pressure without equalising may cause ear drums to rupture resulting in severe pain as the pressure in the chamber increases further the air may become warm to reduce the pressure a valve is opened to allow air out of the chamber as the pressure falls the patient’s ears may squeak as the pressure inside the ear equalizes with the chamber the temperature in the chamber will fall the speed of pressurization and depressurization can be adjusted to each patients needs costsedit hbot is recognized by medicare in the united states as a reimbursable treatment for 14 uhms approved conditions a 1hour hbot session may cost between 300 and higher in private clinics and over 2000 in hospitals us physicians either md do dds dmd dc nd may lawfully prescribe hbot for offlabel conditions such as stroke9293 and migraine9495 such patients are treated in outpatient clinics in the united kingdom most chambers are financed by the national health service although some such as those run by multiple sclerosis therapy centres are nonprofit in australia hbot is not covered by medicare as a treatment for multiple sclerosis96 the average us hospital charge is 180000 per 90 minute hbot treatmentcitation needed china and russia treat more than 80 maladies conditions and trauma with hbot97 researchedit the university of birminghams 2012 guidance to west midlands primary care trusts and clinical commissioning groups concluded the primary research studies investigating the efficacy of hbo are remarkable for the consistent poor quality of the published clinical trials as well as the lack of evidence demonstrating significant health benefits there is a lack of adequate clinical evidence to support the view that hbo therapy is efficacious for any of the indications for which it is being used98 aspects under research include radiationinduced hemorrhagic cystitis99 and inflammatory bowel disease100 neurologicaledit tentative evidence shows a possible benefit in cerebrovascular diseases101 the clinical experience and results so far published has promoted the use of hbo therapy in patients with cerebrovascular injury and focal cerebrovascular injuries101102 however the power of clinical research is limited because of the shortage of randomized controlled trials radiation woundsedit a 2010 review of studies of hbot applied to wounds from radiation therapy reported that while most studies suggest a beneficial effect more experimental and clinical research is needed to validate its clinical use103 historyedit hyperbaric airedit the use of air at raised ambient pressure for the treatment of illness is recorded from 1662 for afflictions of the lung by henshaw it is unlikely to have had any significant effectcitation needed junod built a chamber in france in 1834 to treat pulmonary conditions at pressures between 2 and 4 atmospheres absolute104 during the following century “pneumatic centres” were established in europe and the usa which used hyperbaric air to treat a variety of conditions105 orval j cunningham a professor of anaesthesia at the university of kansas in the early 1900s observed that people suffering from circulatory disorders did better at sea level than at altitude and this formed the basis for his use of hyperbaric air in 1918 he successfully treated patients suffering from the spanish flu with hyperbaric air in 1930 the american medical association forced him to stop hyperbaric treatment since he did not provide acceptable evidence that the treatments were effective105 hyperbaric oxygenedit the english scientist joseph priestley discovered oxygen in 1775 shortly after its discovery there were reports of toxic effects of hyperbaric oxygen on the central nervous system and lungs which delayed therapeutic applications until 1937 when behnke and shaw first used it in the treatment of decompression sickness105 in 1955 and 1956 churchilldavidson in the uk used hyperbaric oxygen to enhance the radiosensitivity of tumours while nl at the university of amsterdam successfully used it in cardiac surgery105 in 1961 willem hendrik brummelkamp nl et al published on the use of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of clostridial gas gangrene106 in 1962 smith and sharp reported successful treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning with hyperbaric oxygen105 the undersea medical society now undersea and hyperbaric medical society formed a committee on hyperbaric oxygenation which has become recognized as the
