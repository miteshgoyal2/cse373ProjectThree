commercial airplanes its variants seat 242 to 335 passengers in typical threeclass seating configurations it is the first airliner with an airframe constructed primarily of composite materials the 787 was designed to be 20 more fuel efficient than the boeing 767 which it was intended to replace the 787 dreamliners distinguishing features include mostly electrical flight systems raked wingtips and noisereducing chevrons on its engine nacelles it shares a common type rating with the larger boeing 777 to allow qualified pilots to operate both models the aircrafts initial designation was the 7e7 prior to its renaming in january 2005 the first 787 was unveiled in a rollout ceremony on july 8 2007 at boeings everett factory development and production of the 787 has involved a largescale collaboration with numerous suppliers worldwide final assembly takes place at the boeing everett factory in everett washington and at the boeing south carolina factory in north charleston south carolina originally planned to enter service in may 2008 the project experienced multiple delays the airliners maiden flight took place on december 15 2009 and completed flight testing in mid2011 boeing has reportedly spent 32 billion on the 787 program final us federal aviation administration faa and european aviation safety agency easa type certification was received in august 2011 and the first 7878 was delivered in september 2011 it entered commercial service on october 26 2011 with launch customer all nippon airways the stretched 7879 variant which is 20 feet 61 m longer and can fly 450 nautical miles 830 km farther than the 8 first flew in september 2013 deliveries of the 7879 began in july 2014 it entered commercial service on august 7 2014 with all nippon airways with 7879 launch customer air new zealand following two days later as of september 2017 the 787 had orders for 1283 aircraft from 67 customers with all nippon airways having the largest number on order1 the aircraft has suffered from several inservice problems related to its lithiumion batteries including fires on board during commercial service these systems were reviewed by both the faa and the japan civil aviation bureau the faa issued a directive in january 2013 that grounded all 787s in the us and other civil aviation authorities followed suit after boeing completed tests on a revised battery design the faa approved the revised design and lifted the grounding in april 2013 the 787 returned to passenger service later that month contents 1 development 11 background 12 manufacturing and

replacement aircraft programs as sales of the 767 and 747400 slowed two new aircraft were proposed the 747x which would have lengthened the 747400 and improved efficiency and the sonic cruiser which would have achieved 15 higher speeds approximately mach 098 while burning fuel at the same rate as the 7674 market interest for the 747x was tepid however several major american airlines including continental airlines showed initial enthusiasm for the sonic cruiser although concerns about the operating cost were also expressed5 the global airline market was disrupted by the september 11 2001 attacks and increased petroleum prices making airlines more interested in efficiency than speed the worstaffected airlines those in the united states had been considered the most likely customers of the sonic cruiser thus the sonic cruiser was officially cancelled on december 20 2002 on january 29 2003 boeing announced an alternative product the 7e7 using sonic cruiser technology in a more conventional configuration67 the emphasis on a smaller midsize twinjet rather than a large 747size aircraft represented a shift from hubandspoke theory towards the pointtopoint theory8 in response to analysis of focus groups9 for boeing commercial airplanes vp marketing randy baseler airport congestion comes from a large numbers of regional jets and small singleaisles flying to destinations where a 550seat a380 would be too large to reduce the number of departures smaller airplanes can increase 20 in size and airline hubs can be avoided with pointtopoint transit10 dreamliner was announced in july 2003 this logo is painted on many 787s the replacement for the sonic cruiser project was named 7e711 with a development code name of y2 technology from the sonic cruiser and 7e7 was to be used as part of boeings project to replace its entire airliner product line an endeavor called the yellowstone project of which the 7e7 became the first stage12 early concept images of the 7e7 included rakish cockpit windows a dropped nose and a distinctive sharkfin tail13 the e was said to stand for various things such as efficiency or environmentally friendly however in the end boeing said that it merely stood for eight6 in july 2003 a public naming competition was held for the 7e7 for which out of 500000 votes cast online the winning title was dreamliner14 other names included eliner global cruiser and stratoclimber1516 all nippon airways launched the 787 program with an order for 50 aircraft in 2004 on april 26 2004 japanese airline all nippon airways ana became the launch customer for the 787 announcing a firm order for 50 aircraft with deliveries to begin in late 200817 the ana order was initially specified as 30 7873 290–330 seat oneclass domestic aircraft and 20 7878 longhaul 210–250 seat twoclass aircraft for regional international routes such as tokyo narita–beijing and could perform routes to cities not previously served such as denver moscow and new delhi18 the 7873 and 7878 were to be the initial variants with the 7879 entering service in 201019 the 787 was designed to be the first production airliner with the fuselage comprising onepiece composite barrel sections instead of the multiple aluminum sheets and some 50000 fasteners used on existing aircraft2021 boeing selected two new engines to power the 787 the rollsroyce trent 1000 and general electric genx6 boeing stated the 787 would be approximately 20 percent more fuelefficient than the 76722 with approximately 40 percent of the efficiency gain from the engines23 plus gains from aerodynamic improvements24 increased use of lighterweight composite materials and advanced systems19 the airframe underwent extensive structural testing during its design2526 the 7878 and −9 were intended to have a certified 330 minute etops capability27 during the design phase the 787 underwent extensive wind tunnel testing at boeings transonic wind tunnel qinetiqs fivemeter wind tunnel at farnborough united kingdom and nasa ames research centers wind tunnel as well as at the french aerodynamics research agency onera the final styling was more conservative than earlier proposals with the fin nose and cockpit windows changed to a more conventional form by 2005 customerannounced orders and commitments for the 787 reached 237 aircraft28 boeing initially priced the 7878 variant at us120 million a low figure that surprised the industry in 2007 the list price was us146–1515 million for the 7873 us157–167 million for the 7878 and us189–200 million for the 787929 manufacturing and suppliersedit on december 16 2003 boeing announced that the 787 would be assembled in its factory in everett washington6 instead of conventionally building the aircraft from the ground up final assembly employed 800 to 1200 people to join completed subassemblies and to integrate systems30 boeing assigned global subcontractors to do more assembly work delivering completed subassemblies to boeing for final assembly this approach was intended to result in a leaner simpler assembly line and lower inventory31 with preinstalled systems reducing final assembly time by threequarters to three days3233 subcontractors had early difficulties procuring needed parts and finishing subassemblies on schedule leaving remaining assembly work for boeing to complete as traveled work3435 in 2010 boeing considered inhouse construction of the 7879 tail the tail of the 7878 is made by alenia36 the 787 was unprofitable for some subcontractors alenias parent company finmeccanicam had a total loss of €750 million on the project by 201337 assembly of section 41 the nose section of the boeing 787 subcontracted assemblies included wing manufacture mitsubishi heavy industries japan central wing box38 horizontal

to transport 787 wings fuselage sections and other smaller parts japanese industrial participation was key on the project japanese companies codesigned and built 35 of the aircraft the first time that outside firms played a key design role on boeing airliner wings the japanese government supported development with an estimated us2 billion in loans51 on april 26 2006 japanese manufacturer toray industries and boeing signed a production agreement involving us6 billion worth of carbon fiber extending a 2004 contract6 in may 2007 final assembly on the first 787 began at everett52 boeing worked to trim excess weight since assembly of the first airframe began in late 2006 the first six 787s were stated to be overweight with the first aircraft being 5000 lb 2300 kg heavier than specified53 the seventh and subsequent aircraft would be the first optimized 7878s expected to meet all goals5455 accordingly some parts were redesigned to include more use of titanium5657 early built 787s were overweight and some carriers decided to take later aircraft in early 2015 boeing was trying to sell 10 such aircraft58 in july 2015 reuters reported that boeing was considering reducing the use of titanium to reduce construction costs59 the first public appearance of the 787 on july 8 2007 boeing intended for a first flight by the end of august 2007 and premiered the first 787 registered n787ba at a rollout ceremony on july 8 200760 the 787 had 677 orders at this time which is more orders from launch to rollout than any previous widebody airliner61 the major systems were not installed at the time many parts were attached with temporary nonaerospace fasteners requiring replacement with flight fasteners later62 in september 2007 boeing announced a threemonth delay blaming a shortage of fasteners as well as incomplete software63 on october 10 2007 a second threemonth delay to the first flight and a sixmonth delay to first deliveries was announced due to supply chain problems a lack of documentation from overseas suppliers and flight guidance software delays6465 less than a week later mike bair the 787 program manager was replaced66 on january 16 2008 boeing announced a third threemonth delay to the first flight of the 787 citing insufficient progress on traveled work67 on march 28 2008 in an effort to gain more control over the supply chain boeing announced plans to buy vought aircraft industries interest in global aeronautica a later agreement was also made to buy voughts factory in north charleston68 on april 9 2008 a fourth delay was announced shifting the maiden flight to the fourth quarter of 2008 and delaying initial deliveries by around 15 months to the third quarter of 2009 the 7879 variant was postponed to 2012 and the 7873 variant was to follow at a later date69 on november 4 2008 a fifth delay was announced due to incorrect fastener installation and the boeing machinists strike stating that the first test flight would not occur in the fourth quarter of 20087071 after assessing the program schedule with suppliers72 in december 2008 boeing stated that the first flight was delayed until the second quarter of 200973 airlines such as united airlines and air india stated their intentions to seek compensation from boeing for the delays7475 preflight ground testingedit as boeing worked with its suppliers towards production the design proceeded through a series of test goals on august 23 2007 a crash test involving a vertical drop of a partial composite fuselage section from about 15 ft 46 m onto a 1 in 25 mmthick steel plate occurred in mesa arizona7677 the results matched predictions allowing modeling of various crash scenarios using computational analysis instead of further physical tests7879 while critics had expressed concerns that a composite fuselage could shatter and burn with toxic fumes during crash landings test data indicated no greater toxicity than conventional metal airframes8081 the crash test was the third in a series of demonstrations conducted to match faa requirements including additional certification criteria due to the widescale use of composite materials77 the 787 meets the faas requirement that passengers have at least as good a chance of surviving a crash landing as they would with current metal airliners82 the prototype boeing 787 underwent taxi tests at paine field in november and december 2009 on august 7 2007 ontime certification of the rollsroyce trent 1000 engine by european and us regulators was received83 the alternative ge genx1b engine achieved certification on march 31 200884 on june 20 2008 the first aircraft was powered up for testing the electrical supply and distribution systems85 a nonflightworthy static test airframe was built on september 27 2008 the fuselage was successfully tested at 149 psi 1027 kpa differential which is 150 percent of the maximum pressure expected in commercial service86 in december 2008 the 787s maintenance program was passed by the faa87 on may 3 2009 the first test 787 was moved to the flight line following extensive factorytesting including landing gear swings systems integration verification and a total runthrough of the first flight88 on may 4 2009 a press report indicated a 10–15 range reduction about 6900 nmi 12800 km instead of the originally promised 7700 to 8200 nmi 14800–15700 km for early aircraft that were about 8 overweight substantial redesign work was expected to correct this which would complicate increases in production rates89 boeing stated the early 7878s would have a range of almost 8000 nmi 15000 km90 as a result some airlines reportedly delayed deliveries of 787s in order to take later planes that may be closer to the original estimates91 boeing expected to have the weight issues addressed by the 21st production model92 on june 15 2009 during the paris air show boeing said that the 787 would make its first flight within two weeks however on june 23 2009 the first flight was postponed due to structural reasons9394 boeing provided an updated 787 schedule on august 27 2009 with the first flight planned to occur by the end of 2009 and deliveries to begin at the end of 201095 the company expected to write off us25 billion because it considered the first three dreamliners built unsellable and suitable only for flight tests96 on october 28 2009 boeing selected charleston sc as the site for a second 787 production line after soliciting bids from multiple states97 on december 12 2009 the first 787 completed high speed taxi tests the last major step before flight9899 flight test programedit the first 787 taking off on its maiden flight in december 2009 on december 15 2009 boeing conducted the 7878 maiden flight from paine field in everett washington at 1027 am pst and landed three hours later at 133 pm at seattles boeing field after reaching 180 kn 333 kmh and 13200 ft 4000 m100 originally scheduled for 5 ½ hours the test flight was shortened to three hours with the pilots wanting to complete the flight under visual meteorological conditions while visibility and cloud ceiling were low101 the 6800h sixaircraft ground and flight test programme was scheduled in eight and a half months the fastest certification campaign for a new boeing commercial design102 the flight test program comprised six aircraft za001 through za006 four with rollsroyce trent 1000 engines and two with ge genx1b64 engines the second 787 za002 in all nippon airways livery flew to boeing field on december 22 2009 to join the flight test program103104 the third 787 za004 made its first flight on february 24 2010 followed by za003 on march 14 2010105 on march 24 2010 flutter and ground effects testing was completed clearing the aircraft to fly its entire flight envelope106 on march 28 2010 the 787 completed the ultimate wing load test which requires that the wings of a fully assembled aircraft be loaded to 150 of design limit load and held for 3 seconds the wings were flexed approximately 25 ft 76 m upward during the test107 unlike past aircraft the wings were not tested to failure108109 on april 7 data showed the test had been a success110 on april 23 2010 the newest 787 za003 arrived at the mckinley climatic laboratory hangar at eglin air force base florida for extreme weather testing in temperatures ranging from 115 to −45 °f 46 to −43 °c including takeoff preparations at both temperature extremes111 za005 the fifth 787 and the first with genx engines began ground engine tests in may 2010112 and made its first flight on june 16 2010113 in june 2010 gaps were discovered in the horizontal stabilizers of test aircraft due to improperly installed shims all aircraft were inspected and repaired114 that same month a 787 experienced its first inflight lightning strike inspections found no damage115 as composites can have as little as 11000th the electrical conductivity of aluminum conductive material is added to ameliorate potential risks and to meet faa requirements80116117 the faa also planned requirement changes to help the 787 show compliance118 the first 787 to visit europe za003 at the 2010 farnborough airshow the 787 made its first appearance at an international air show at the farnborough airshow united kingdom on july 18 2010119 on august 2 2010 a trent 1000 engine suffered a blowout at rollsroyces test facility during ground testing120 the failure due to the timeline for installing trent 1000 engines being reevaluated on august 27 2010 boeing stated that the first delivery to launch customer ana would be delayed until early 2011121122 that same month boeing faced compensation claims from airlines owing to ongoing delivery delays123 in september 2010 it was reported that a further two 787s might join the test fleet for a total of eight flight test aircraft124 on september 10 2010 a partial engine surge occurred in a trent engine on za001 at roswell125 on october 4 2010 the sixth 787 za006 joined the test program with its first flight126 on november 9 2010 boeing 787 za002 made an emergency landing at laredo international airport texas after smoke and flames were detected in the main cabin during a test flight127128 the electrical fire caused some systems to fail before landing129 following this incident boeing suspended flight testing on november 10 2010 ground testing continued130131 after investigation the inflight fire was primarily attributed to foreign object debris fod that was present in the electrical bay132 after electrical system and software changes the 787 resumed flight testing on december 23 2010133134 on november 5 2010 it was reported that some 787 deliveries would be delayed to address problems found during flight testing135136 in january 2011 the first 787 delivery was rescheduled to the third quarter of 2011 due to software and electrical updates following the inflight fire137138 by february 24 2011 the 787 had completed 80 of the test conditions for rollsroyce trent 1000 engine and 60 of the conditions for the general electric genx1b engine139 in july 2011 ana performed a week of operations testing using a 787 in japan140 the test aircraft had flown 4828 hours in 1707 flights combined by august 15 2011105 during testing the 787 visited 14 countries in asia europe north america and south america to test in extreme climates and conditions and for route testing141 on august 13 2011 certification testing of the rollsroyce powered 7878 finished142 the faa and european aviation safety agency certified the 787 on august 26 2011 at a ceremony in everett washington143144 certification had taken 18 months twice as long as originally planned the newer stretched version 7879 had flown 141 hours as of november 8 2013145 service entry and early operationsedit the 7878 received faa and easa certification on august 21 2011 certification cleared the way for deliveries and in 2011 boeing prepared to increase 787 production rates from two to ten aircraft per month at assembly lines in everett and charleston over two years144 legal difficulties clouded production at charleston on april 20 2011 the national labor relations board alleged that a second production line in south carolina violated two sections of the national labor relations act97 in december 2011 the national labor relations board dropped its lawsuit after the machinists union withdrew its complaint as part of a new contract with boeing146 the first 787 assembled at south carolina was rolled out on april 27 2012147 the first 787 was officially delivered to all nippon airways ana on september 25 2011 at the boeing factory a ceremony to mark the occasion was also held the next day148149 on september 27 it flew to tokyo haneda airport150151 the airline took delivery of the second 787 on october 13 2011152 on october 26 2011 an ana 787 flew the first commercial flight from tokyo narita airport to hong kong international airport153 the airliner was planned to enter service some three years prior tickets for the flight were sold in an online auction the highest bidder had paid 34000 for a seat154 an ana 787 flew its first longhaul flight to europe on january 21 2012 from haneda to frankfurt airport155 on december 6 2011 test aircraft za006 sixth 787 powered by general electric genx engines flew 10710 nmi 19830 km nonstop from boeing field eastward to shahjalal international airport in dhaka bangladesh setting a new world distance record for aircraft in the 787s weight class which is between 440000 and 550000 lb 200000 and 250000 kg this flight surpassed the previous record of 9127 nautical miles 16903 km set in 2002 by an airbus a330 the dreamliner then continued eastbound from dhaka to return to boeing field setting a worldcircling speed record of 42 hours 27 minutes156 in december 2011 boeing started a sixmonth promotion 787 world tour visiting various cities in china africa the middle east europe united states and others157 in april 2012 an ana 787 made a delivery flight from boeing field to haneda airport partially using biofuel from cooking oil158 ana surveyed 800 passengers who flew the 787 from tokyo to frankfurt expectations were surpassed for 90 of passengers features that met or exceeded expectations included air quality and cabin pressure 90 of passengers cabin ambiance 92 of passengers higher cabin humidity levels 80 of passengers headroom 40 of passengers and the larger windows 90 of passengers 25 said they would go out of their way to again fly on the 787159 the second and third united airlines 7878s at los angeles international airport united airlines is the north american launch customer for all three 787 variants after its first six months of service rollspowered ana aircraft were burning around 21 less fuel than the replaced 767300er on international flights slightly better than the 20 originally expected and 1520 on domestic routes while gepowered japan airlines aircraft were potentially slightly better160 other 787 operators have reported similar fuel savings ranging from 2022 compared with the 767300er161 an analysis by consulting firm airinsight concluded that united airlines 787s achieved an operating cost per seat that was 6 lower than the airbus a330162 early operators discovered that if the aps5000 auxiliary power unit was shut down with the inlet door closed heat continued to build up in the tail compartment and cause the rotor shaft to bow it could take up to 2 hours for the shaft to straighten again this was particularly acute on short haul flights as there was insufficient time to allow the unit to cool before a restart was needed procedures were modified and the apu was later redesigned to address the issue163 on september 15 2012 the ntsb requested the grounding of certain 787s due to ge engine failures ge believed the production problem had been fixed by that time164 in march 2014 mitsubishi heavy industries informed boeing of a new problem that was caused by a change in manufacturing processes employees did not fill gaps with shims to connect wing rib aluminum shear ties to the carbon composite wing panels the tightened fasteners without shims cause excessive stress that creates hairline cracks in the wings which could enlarge and cause further damage fortytwo aircraft awaiting delivery were affected and each one required 1–2 weeks to inspect and repair however boeing did not expect this problem to affect the overall delivery schedule even if some airplanes were delivered late165 dispatch reliability is an industry standard measure of the rate of departure from the gate with no more than 15 minutes delay due to technical issues166 the 7878 started out with a 96 operational reliability increasing to 985 in april 2015 daily utilization increased from five hours in 2013 to twelve hours in 2014167 dispatch reliability grew to 993 in 2017168 an air canada 787 at toronto pearson international airport airlines have often assigned the 787 to routes previously flown by larger aircraft that could not return a profit for example air canada offered a toronto to new delhi route first utilizing a lockheed l1011 then a boeing 747 then an airbus a340 but none of these types were efficient enough to generate profit the airline operated the route profitably with a 7879 and credits the right number of seats and greater fuel efficiency for this success169 up to 30 june 2017 after 565 units were delivered since 2011  60 8 340 and 40 9 225 the airports with most 787 departures are haneda airport with 304 weekly narita with 276 and doha airport with 265 by the end of 2017 there will be 39 airlines operating the 787 on 983 routes with an average length of 5282 km 2852 nmi and it will have opened 163 new routes 17 the longest will be qantas perthlondon heathrow over 14499 km 7829 nmi from 24 march 2018 overtaking united airlines 14096 km 7611 nmi los angeles singapore170 market and production costsedit the 787 dreamliner program has reportedly cost boeing 32 billion2171 in 2013 the 787 program was expected to be profitable after 1100 aircraft have been sold172 the cost of producing a 787 exceeded the purchase price at the end of 2013 boeings accounting method books sales immediately and distributes estimated production costs over ten years for the 1300 aircraft it expects to deliver during that time jpmorgan chase analyst joseph nadol estimated the programs cash loss to be 45 million per airplane decreasing as the program moves forward the actual cash flow reflects boeing collecting most of the purchase price upon delivery boeing expects deferred costs to total 25 billion before the company begins to break even on production the comparable number for the boeing 777 adjusted for inflation is 37 billion boeing plans to improve financial return by reorganizing the production line renegotiating contracts with suppliers and labor unions and increasing the 787 production rate stepwise to 12 airplanes per month by the end of 2016 and 14 airplanes per month by the end of the decade162 as of april 2015update the production rate is 10 per month173 boeing lost 30 million per 787 delivered in the first quarter of 2015 although boeing plans to break even by the end of the year174 the accumulated losses for the 787 totalled almost 27 billion by may 2015 the cost of producing the fuselage may increase because of a tentative deal reached with spirit aerosystems of wichita kansas wherein severe price cuts demanded by boeing would be eased in return for a comprehensive agreement that lowers the cost of fuselages for other jetliners that spirit helps boeing manufacture175 in the second quarter of 2015 boeing lost 25 million on each 787 delivered but was planning to breakeven per plane before the year end after that boeing hopes to build 900 dreamliners over six years at an average profit of more than 35 million each but with deferred costs peaking in 2016 at 33 billion leeham analyst bjorn fehrm considers boeing cant make an overall profit on the program ted piepenbrock an academic affiliated with the mit and the university of oxford projects losses decreasing through the first 700 airliners forecast the cumulative deferred costs to peak beyond 34 billion and its model most favorable to boeing projects a program loss of 5 billion after delivering 2000 dreamliners boeing’s original development investment estimated at least at a further 20 billion isnt included in these costs176 to recoup the deferred costs and earn its goal of “low single digit” overall profit margin boeing has to make an average profit of more than 50 million on the final 205 airplanes of the accounting block to be delivered from 2020 a profit margin of more than 30 while the mature b737 and b777 programs have 20 to 25 margins boeing is reaching it through a larger proportion of the 20 to 40 higher price 910s costing only 5 to 10 more than the 8 with lower production costs from reliability and producibility investments and the expected experience curve former douglas aircraft chief economist adam pilarski notes that two assembly sites slows the experience curve boeing assumed a faster improvement than on previous programs which hasn’t happened airbus concurrence with the a350 and the launch of the a330neo put strong pressure on the 787 pricing176 on july 21 2016 boeing reported charges of 847 million against two flighttest 787s built in 2009 boeing had planned to refurbish and sell them but instead wrote them off as research and development expense177 boeing will build 14 787s per month 168 per year from 2019 helping to offset the 28 billion in deferred production costs accumulated through 2015 and will add 100 aircraft to the current accounting block of 1300 at the end of the 2017 third quarter178 designedit overviewedit a boeing 7878 taking off from boeing field front view of a british airways boeing 7878 arriving at londons heathrow airport 2015 the boeing 787 dreamliner is a longhaul widebody twinengine jetliner which features lightweight construction the aircraft is 80 percent composite by volume179 boeing lists its materials by weight as 50 percent composite 20 percent aluminum 15 percent titanium 10 percent steel and 5 percent other180181 aluminum has been used throughout the wing and tail leading edges titanium is predominantly present within the elements of the engines and fasteners while various individual components are composed of steel181 external features include a smooth nose contour raked wingtips and engine nacelles with noisereducing serrated edges chevrons182 the longestrange 787 variant can fly 8000 to 8500 nautical miles 9200 to 9800 mi 14800 to 15700 km enough to cover the los angeles to bangkok and new york city to hong kong routes its cruising airspeed is mach 085183 equivalent to 561 mph 903 kmh 487 kn at typical cruise altitudes the aircraft has a design life of 44000 flight cycles184 flight systemsedit among 787 flight systems a key change from traditional airliners is the electrical architecture the architecture is bleedless and replaces bleed air and hydraulic power sources with electrically powered compressors and pumps while completely eliminating pneumatics and hydraulics from some subsystems eg engine starters or brakes185 boeing says this system extracts 35 percent less power from the engines allowing increased thrust and improved fuel economy186 the total available onboard electrical power is 145 megawatts which is five times the power available on conventional pneumatic airliners187 the most notable electrically powered systems include engine start cabin pressurization horizontal stabilizer trim and wheel brakes188 wing ice protection is another new system it uses electrothermal heater mats on the wing slats instead of traditional hot bleed air189190 an active gust alleviation system similar to the system used on the b2 bomber improves ride quality during turbulence191192 the boeing 787 flight deck the 787 has a flybywire control system similar in architecture to that of the boeing 777193 the flight deck features lcd multifunction displays which use an industry standard graphical user interface widget toolkit cockpit display system interfaces to user systems arinc 661194 the 787 flight deck includes two headup displays huds as a standard feature195 the 787 shares a common type rating with the larger 777 allowing qualified pilots to operate both models196 like other boeing airliners the 787 uses a yoke instead of a sidestick under consideration is future integration of forward looking infrared into the hud for thermal sensing allowing pilots to see through clouds6 lockheed martins orion spacecraft will use a glass cockpit derived from honeywell internationals 787 flight deck systems197 honeywell and rockwell collins provide flight control guidance and other avionics systems including standard dual head up guidance

and battery control system198199 with lithium cobalt oxide licoo2 batteries by gs yuasa200201 one of the two batteries weighs 285 kg and is rated 296 v 76 ah giving 22 kwh202 battery charging is controlled by four independent systems to prevent overcharging following early lab testing203 the battery systems are the focus of regulatory investigation due to multiple lithium battery fires which led to grounding of the 787 fleet starting in january 2013204 a version of ethernet avionics fullduplex switched ethernet afdx arinc 664 transmits data between the flight deck and aircraft systems205 the control navigation and communication systems are networked with the passenger cabins inflight internet systems206 in january 2008 faa concerns were reported regarding possible passenger access to the 787s computer networks boeing has stated that various protective hardware and software solutions are employed including air gaps to physically separate the networks and firewalls for software separation206207 these measures prevent data transfer from the passenger internet system to the maintenance or navigation systems206 composite materialsedit disassembled composite fuselage section of the boeing 787 the 787 is the first major commercial airplane to have a composite fuselage composite wings and use composites in most other airframe components208 each 787 contains approximately 77000 pounds 35 metric tons of carbon fiber reinforced polymer cfrp made with 51000 lb 23 t of carbon fiber209 carbon fiber composites have a higher strengthtoweight ratio than conventional aircraft materials and help make the 787 a lighter aircraft181 composites are used on fuselage wings tail doors and interior boeing had built and tested the first commercial aircraft composite section while studying the proposed sonic cruiser in the early 2000s210211 the first carbonepoxy primary structure was put into service on the boeing 737 classic horizontal tail in 1984 and the largest use of composite structures is 60 percent in the boeing–sikorsky rah66 comanche212 carbon fiber unlike metal does not visibly show cracks and fatigue prompting concerns about the safety risks of widespread use of the material80213214 the rival airbus a350 xwb uses composite panels on a frame a more conventional approach which its contractors regarded as less risky81 although fired in 2006 boeing engineer vince weldon complained to management and later to the public the composite fuselage was unsafe compared to conventional aluminum designs and in a crash was more likely to shatter too easily and burn with toxic fumes215 in addition a potential issue is the porous nature of composite materials collected moisture expanding with altitude can cause delamination216 boeing responded that composites have been used on wings and other passenger aircraft parts for many years without incident and special defect detection procedures will be instituted for the 787 to detect any potential hidden damage217 in 2006 boeing launched the 787 goldcare program218 this is an optional comprehensive lifecycle management service whereby aircraft in the program are routinely monitored and repaired as needed although the first program of its kind from boeing postsale protection programs are not new such programs are usually offered by third party service centers boeing is also designing and testing composite hardware so inspections are mainly visual this reduces the need for ultrasonic and other nonvisual inspection methods saving time and money219 enginesedit the chevrontoothed exhaust duct covers on the first 787 shown here with thrustreversers deployed the 787 is powered by two engines these engines use allelectrical bleedless systems eliminating the superheated air conduits normally used for aircraft power deicing and other functions6 as part of its quiet technology demonstrator 2 project boeing adopted several engine noisereducing technologies for the 787 these include an air inlet containing soundabsorbing materials and exhaust duct cover with a chevrontoothed pattern on the rim for a quieter mixing of exhaust and outside air182 boeing expects these developments to make the 787 significantly quieter both inside and out220 the noisereducing measures prevent sounds above 85 decibels from leaving airport boundaries181 the two different engine models compatible with the 787 use a standard electrical interface to allow an aircraft to be fitted with either rollsroyce trent 1000 or general electric genx engines this interchangeability aims to save time and cost when changing engine types6 while previous aircraft could exchange engines for those of a different manufacturer the high cost and time required made it rare221222 in 2006 boeing addressed reports of an extended change period by stating that the 787 engine swap was intended to take 24 hours222 in 2016 rolls royce began flight testing its new trent 1000 ten engine it has a new compressor system based on the compressor in rollsroyce trent xwb engine and a new turbine design for extra thrust up to 78000 lbf 350 kn rolls royce plans to offer the ten on the 7878 9 and 10223 interioredit anas first 787

less than the a350228 and 16 in 41 cm less than the 777229 the 787s economy seats can be up to 175 in 444 cm wide for nineabreast seating230 and up to 19 inches 48 cm wide for eightabreast seating arrangements most airlines are selecting the nineabreast 3–3–3 configuration231232 the 787s nineabreast seating for economy provides passengers less space particularly across the hips and shoulders than any other jet airliner233 this has led to recommendations that passengers particularly taller or larger individuals avoid the 787 for international service233234235 boeing 7878 demonstrator aircraft cabin with economy class seating in conventional 3–3–3 layout the 787s cabin windows are larger than any other civil air transport inservice or in development236 with dimensions of 107 by 184 in 27 by 47 cm236 and a higher eye level so passengers can maintain a view of the horizon237 the composite fuselage permits larger windows without the need for structural reinforcement238 instead of plastic window shades the windows use electrochromismbased smart glass supplied by ppg industries239 allowing flight attendants240 and passengers to adjust five levels of sunlight and visibility to their liking241 reducing cabin glare while maintaining a view to the outside world237242 but the most opaque setting still has some transparency240243 the lavatory however has a traditional sunshade241 the 787s cabin features lightemitting diodes leds244 as standard equipment allowing the aircraft to be entirely bulbless led lights have previously been an option on the boeing 777 and airbus aircraft245246 the system has threecolor leds plus a white led244 the 787 interior was designed to better accommodate persons with mobility sensory and cognitive disabilities for example a 56

cabin in 121 layout the internal cabin pressure of the 787 is increased to the equivalent of 6000 feet 1800 m altitude instead of the 8000 feet 2400 m on older conventional aircraft248 according to boeing in a joint study with oklahoma state university this will significantly improve passenger comfort191249 cabin air pressurization is provided by electrically driven compressors rather than traditional enginebleed air thereby eliminating the need to cool heated air before it enters the cabin250251 the cabins humidity is programmable based on the number of passengers carried and allows 15 percent humidity settings instead of the 4 percent found in previous aircraft248 the composite fuselage avoids metal fatigue issues associated with higher cabin pressure and eliminates the risk of corrosion from higher humidity levels248 the cabin airconditioning system improves air quality by removing ozone from outside air and besides standard hepa filters which remove airborne particles uses a gaseous filtration system to remove odors irritants and gaseous contaminants as well as particulates like viruses bacteria and allergens181242 the bleedless engine cabin air system also allows the 787 air to avoid oil fumes and toxins which are dangerous to the health of passengers and crew and are found in all other aircraft bleed air systems252 variantsedit size comparison of the boeing 7878

representatives to assist in the investigation315 the initial investigation found no direct link with the aircrafts main batteries316 further investigations indicated that the fire was due to lithiummanganese dioxide batteries powering an emergency locator transmitter elt317318 the uk air accidents investigation branch aaib issued a special bulletin on july 18 2013 requesting the us faa ensure that the locator is removed or disconnected in boeing 787s and to review the safety of lithium batterypowered elt systems in other aircraft types319 on august 19 2015 the associated press reported that the fire was started by a short circuit caused by crossed wires located under the battery the air accidents investigation branchs investigators recommended that the us federal aviation

protection320 on july 26 2013 ana said it had found wiring damage on two 787 locator beacons united airlines also reported that it had found a pinched wire in one 787 locator beacon321 on august 14 2013 the media reported a fire extinguisher fault affecting three ana airplanes which caused the fire extinguishers to discharge into the opposite engine from the one requested322 the fault was caused by a supplier assembly error323 on september 28 2013 norwegian long haul decided to take one of its two 787s in its fleet at the time out of service after the two aircraft broke down on more than six occasions in september324 the company will lease an airbus a340 for its longhaul operations while the 787 is returned to boeing for repair325 on december 20–22 2013 norwegian long haul experienced technical problems keeping two of its three 787 aircraft grounded at fort lauderdale airport and delayed six flights326327 on november 22 2013 boeing issued an advisory to airlines using general electric genx engines on 787 and 7478 aircraft to avoid flying near highlevel thunderstorms due to an increased risk of icing on the engines the problem was caused by a buildup of ice crystals just behind the main fan causing a brief loss of thrust on six occasions328 on january 21 2014 a norwegian air shuttle 787 experienced a fuel leak which caused a 19hour delay to a flight from bangkok to

warning followed by a burning smell while climbing from ube about 35 nautical miles 65 km west of takamatsu japan the aircraft diverted to takamatsu and was evacuated via the slides three passengers received minor injuries during the evacuation inspection revealed a battery fire a similar incident in a parked japan airlines 787 at bostons logan international airport within the same week led the federal aviation administration to ground all 787s343 on january 16 2013 both major japanese airlines ana and jal voluntarily grounded their fleets of 787s after multiple incidents involving different 787s including emergency landings at the time these two carriers operated 24 of the 50 787s delivered344345 the grounding reportedly cost ana some 9 billion yen us93 million in lost sales346 on january 16 2013 the faa issued an emergency airworthiness directive ordering all americanbased airlines to ground their boeing 787s until yettobedetermined modifications were made to the electrical system to reduce the risk of the battery overheating or catching fire347 this was the first time that the faa had grounded an airliner type since 1979348 industry experts disagreed on consequences of the grounding airbus was confident that boeing would resolve the issue349 and that no airlines will switch plane type350351 while other experts saw the problem as costly352 and could take upwards of a year353 the faa also conducted an extensive review of the 787s critical systems the focus of the review was on the safety of the lithiumion batteries348 made of lithium cobalt oxide licoo2 the 787 battery contract was signed in 2005201 when this was the only type of lithium aerospace battery available but since then newer and safer354 types such as lifepo which provide less reaction energy during thermal runaway have become available355356 faa approved a 787 battery in 2007 with nine special conditions357358 a battery approved by faa through mobile power solutions was made by rose electronics using kokam cells359 the batteries installed in the 787 are made by yuasa198 on january 20 the ntsb declared that overvoltage was not the cause of the boston incident as voltage did not exceed the battery limit of 32 v360 and the charging unit passed tests the battery had signs of short circuiting and thermal runaway361 despite this by january 24 the ntsb had not yet pinpointed the cause of the boston fire the faa would not allow usbased 787s to fly again until the problem was found and corrected in a press briefing that day ntsb chairwoman deborah hersman said that the ntsb had found evidence of failure of multiple safety systems designed to prevent these battery problems and stated that fire must never happen on an airplane362 the japan transport safety board jtsb has said on january 23 that the battery in ana jets in japan reached a maximum voltage of 31 v below the 32 v limit like the boston jal 787 but had a sudden unexplained voltage drop363 to near zero364 all cells had signs of thermal damage prior to runaway365 ana and jal had replaced several 787 batteries before the mishaps364 as of january 29 2013 jtsb approved the yuasa factory quality control366367 while the ntsb examined the boston battery for defects368 the failure rate with two major battery thermal runaway events in 100000 flight hours was much higher than the rate of one in 10 million flight hours predicted by boeing343 the only american airline that operated the dreamliner at the time was united airlines which had six369 chiles directorate general of civil aviation dgac grounded lan airlines three 787s370 the indian directorate general of civil aviation dgca directed air india to ground its six dreamliners the japanese transport ministry made the ana and jal groundings official and indefinite following the faa announcement371 the european aviation safety agency also followed the faas advice and grounded the only two european 787s operated by lot polish airlines372 qatar airways grounded their five dreamliners373 ethiopian airlines was the final operator to temporarily ground its four dreamliners374 by january 17 2013 all 50 of the aircraft delivered to date had been grounded374375 on january 18 boeing halted 787 deliveries until the battery problem was resolved376 on february 7 2013 the faa gave approval for boeing to conduct 787 test flights to gather additional data377378 in february 2013 faa oversight of the 787s 2007 safety approval and certification was under scrutiny379 on march 7 2013 the ntsb released an interim factual report about the boston battery fire on january 7 2013 the investigation380 stated that heavy smoke and fire coming from the front of the apu battery case firefighters tried fire extinguishing but smoke and flame flame size about 3 inches did not stop381382 boeing completed its final tests on a revised battery design on april 5 2013383 the faa approved boeings revised battery design with three additional overlapping protection methods on april 19 2013 the faa published a directive on april 25 to provide instructions for retrofitting battery hardware before the 787s could return to flight384385 the repairs were expected to be completed in weeks386 following the faa approval in the us387 japan gave permission for passenger airlines to resume boeing 787 flights in the country effective april 26 2013388 on april 27 2013 ethiopian airlines took a 787 on the models first commercial flight after battery system modifications385387 on january 14 2014 a battery in a jal 787 emitted smoke from the batterys protection exhaust while the aircraft was undergoing preflight maintenance389390 the battery partially melted in the incident391 one of its eight lithiumion cells had its relief port vent and fluid sprayed inside the batterys container392 it was later reported that the battery may have reached a temperature as high as 1220 °f 660 °c and that boeing did not understand the root cause of the failure393 the ntsb has criticized faa boeing and battery manufacturers for the faults in a 2014 report394395396397 it also criticized the gemade flight data and cockpit voice recorder in the same report398 the enclosure boeing had to add is 185 lb 84 kg heavier frustratingly negating the lighter battery potential399 aircraft on displayedit n787ba za001 – chubu centrair airport in nagoya
