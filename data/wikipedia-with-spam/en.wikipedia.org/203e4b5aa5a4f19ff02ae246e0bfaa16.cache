nacostines by catholic missionaries maintained settlements around the anacostia river within the presentday district of columbia conflicts with european colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the piscataway people some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near point of rocks maryland5 in his federalist no 43 published january 23 1788 james madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety6 five years earlier a band of unpaid soldiers besieged congress while its members were meeting in philadelphia known as the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783 the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security7 article one section eight of the constitution permits the establishment of a district not exceeding ten miles square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states8 however the constitution does not specify a location for the capital in what is now known as the compromise of 1790 madison alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each states remaining revolutionary war debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the southern united states9a foundation map of the district of columbia in 1835 prior to the retrocession on july 9 1790 congress passed the residence act which approved the creation of a national capital on the potomac river the exact location was to be selected by president george washington who signed the bill into law on july 16 formed from land donated by the states of maryland and virginia the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles 16 km on each side totaling 100 square miles 259 km210b two preexisting settlements were included in the territory the port of georgetown maryland founded in 175111 and the city of alexandria virginia founded in 174912 during 1791–92 andrew ellicott and several assistants including a free african american astronomer named benjamin banneker surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point13 many of the stones are still standing14 a new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the potomac to the east of georgetown on september 9 1791 the three commissioners overseeing the capitals construction named the city in honor of president washington the federal district was named columbia which was a poetic name for the united states commonly in use at that time1516 congress held its first session in washington on november 17 180017 congress passed the organic act of 1801 which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government further the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties the county of washington to the east of the potomac and the county of alexandria to the west18 after the passage of this act citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of maryland or virginia which therefore ended their representation in congress19 fords theatre in the 19th century site of the 1865 assassination of president lincoln on august 24–25 1814 in a raid known as the burning of washington british forces invaded the capital during the war of 1812 the capitol treasury and white house were burned and gutted during the attack20 most government buildings were repaired quickly however the capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 186821 retrocession and the civil war see also district of columbia retrocession and washington dc in the american civil war in the 1830s the districts southern territory of alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by congress22 the city of alexandria was a major market in the american slave trade and proslavery residents feared that abolitionists in congress would end slavery in the district further depressing the economy alexandrias citizens petitioned virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession23 the virginia general assembly voted in february 1846 to accept the return of alexandria and on july 9 1846 congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by virginia therefore the districts current area consists only of the portion originally donated by maryland22 confirming the fears of proslavery alexandrians the compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district although not slavery itself24 the outbreak of the american civil war in 1861 led to expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the districts population including a large influx of freed slaves25 president abraham lincoln signed the compensated emancipation act in 1862 which ended slavery in the district of columbia and freed about 3100 enslaved persons nine months prior to the emancipation proclamation26 in 1868 congress granted the districts african american male residents the right to vote in municipal elections25 growth and redevelopment crowds surrounding the reflecting pool during the 1963 march on washington by 1870 the districts population had grown 75 from the previous census to nearly 132000 residents27 despite the citys growth washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation some members of congress suggested moving the capital further west but president ulysses s grant refused to consider such a proposal28 congress passed the organic act of 1871 which repealed the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown and created a new territorial government for the whole district of columbia29 president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd to the position of governor in 1873 shepherd authorized largescale projects that greatly modernized washington but ultimately bankrupted the district government in 1874 congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed threemember board of commissioners30 the citys first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and generated growth in areas of the district beyond the city of washingtons original boundaries washingtons urban plan was expanded throughout the district in the following decades31 georgetown was formally annexed by the city of washington in 189532 however the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works washington was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the city beautiful movement in the early 1900s33 increased federal spending as a result of the new deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings memorials and museums in washington34 world war ii further increased government activity adding to the number of federal employees in the capital35 by 1950 the districts population reached its peak of 802178 residents27 civil rights and home rule era the twentythird amendment to the united states constitution was ratified in 1961 granting the district three votes in the electoral college for the election of president and vice president but still no voting representation in congress36 after the assassination of civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr on april 4 1968 riots broke out in the district primarily in the u street 14th street 7th street and h street corridors centers of black residential and commercial areas the riots raged for three days until more than 13600 federal troops stopped the violence many stores and other buildings were burned rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s37 in 1973 congress enacted the district of columbia home rule act providing for an elected mayor and 13member council for the district38 in 1975 walter washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the district39 on september 11 2001

streets and highways of washington dc neighborhoods in washington dc and list of tallest buildings in washington dc lenfant plan for the federal capital city washington dc is a planned city in 1791 president washington commissioned pierre peter charles lenfant a frenchborn architect and city planner to design the new capital he enlisted scottish surveyor alexander ralston helped layout the city plan75 the lenfant plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles providing room for open space and landscaping76 he based his design on plans of cities such as paris amsterdam karlsruhe and milan that thomas jefferson had sent to him77 lenfants design also envisioned a gardenlined grand avenue approximately 1 mile 16 km in length and 400 feet 120 m wide in the area that is now the national mall78 lenfant plan for washington dc as revised by andrew ellicott in 1792 president washington dismissed lenfant in march 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capitals construction andrew ellicott who had worked with lenfant surveying the city was then tasked with completing the design though ellicott made revisions to the original plans including changes to some street patterns lenfant is still credited with the overall design of the city79 by the early 1900s lenfants vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings including a railroad station on the national mall congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying washingtons ceremonial core33 what became known as the mcmillan plan was finalized in 1901 and included relandscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall clearing slums and establishing a new citywide park system the plan is thought to have largely preserved lenfants intended design76 the construction of the 12story cairo apartment building in 1894 spurred the citys first building height restrictions by law washingtons skyline is low and sprawling the federal heights of buildings act of 1910 allows buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street plus 20 feet 61 m80 despite popular belief no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the united states capitol or the 555foot 169 m washington monument52 which remains the districts tallest structure city leaders have criticized the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused by urban sprawl80 the district is divided into four quadrants of unequal area northwest nw northeast ne southeast se and southwest sw the axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the us capitol building81 all road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the capitol most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters eg c street sw north–south streets

to the west and the anacostia river to the east3176 washingtons street grid was extended where possible throughout the district starting in 188882 georgetowns streets were renamed in 189532 some streets are particularly noteworthy such as pennsylvania avenue which connects the white house to the capitol and k street which houses the offices of many lobbying groups83 washington hosts 177 foreign embassies constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1600 residential properties owned by foreign countries many of which are on a section of massachusetts avenue informally

architectural styles are even more varied historic buildings are designed primarily in the queen anne châteauesque richardsonian romanesque georgian revival beauxarts and a variety of victorian styles
