mystery of american renewal this ceremony is held in the depth of winter but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world we force the spring a spring reborn in the worlds oldest democracy that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent america when our founders boldly declared americas independence to the world and our purposes to the almighty they knew that america to endure would have to change not change for changes sake but change to preserve americas ideals life liberty the pursuit of happiness though we march to the music of our time our mission is timeless each generation of americans must define what it means to be an american on behalf of our nation i salute my predecessor president bush for his halfcentury of service to america and i thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression fascism and communism today a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues raised in unrivaled prosperity we inherit an economy that is still the worlds strongest but is weakened by business failures stagnant wages increasing inequality and deep divisions among our people when george washington first took the oath i have just sworn to uphold news traveled slowly across the land by horseback and across the ocean by boat now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to billions around the world communications and commerce are global investment is mobile technology is almost magical and ambition for a better life is now universal we earn our livelihood in peaceful competition with people all across the earth profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world and the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy this new world has already enriched the lives of millions of americans who are able to compete and win in it but when most people are working harder for less when others cannot work at all when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt many of our enterprises great and small when fear of crime robs lawabiding citizens of their freedom and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead we have not made change our friend we know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps but we have not done so instead we have drifted and that drifting has eroded our resources fractured our economy and shaken our confidence though our challenges are fearsome so are our strengths and americans have ever been a restless questing hopeful people we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us from our revolution the civil war to the great depression to the civil rights movement our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history thomas jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation we would need dramatic change from time to time well my fellow citizens this is our time let us embrace it our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal there is nothing wrong with america that cannot be cured by what is right with america and so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift a new season of american renewal has begun to renew america we must be bold we must do what no generation has had to do before we must invest more in our own people in their jobs in their future and at the same time cut our massive debt and we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity it will not be easy it will require sacrifice but it can be done and done fairly not choosing sacrifice for its own sake but for our own sake we must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity we can do no less anyone who has ever watched a childs eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is posterity is the world to come the world for whom we hold our ideals from whom we have borrowed our planet and to whom we bear sacred responsibility we must do what america does best offer more opportunity to all and demand responsibility from all it is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our government or from each other let us all take more responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country to renew america we must revitalize our democracy this beautiful capital like every capital since the dawn of civilization is often a place of intrigue and calculation powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out who is up and who is down forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our way americans deserve better and in this city today there are people who want to do better and so i say to all of us here let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of america let us resolve to make our government a place for what franklin roosevelt called bold persistent experimentation a government for our tomorrows not our yesterdays let us give this capital back to the people to whom it belongs to renew america we must meet challenges abroad as well at home there is no longer division between what is foreign and what is domestic the world economy the world environment the world aids crisis the world arms race they affect us all today as an old order passes the new world is more free but less stable communisms collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers clearly america must continue to lead the world we did so much to make while america rebuilds at home we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world together with our friends and allies we will work to shape change lest it engulf us when our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied we will act with peaceful diplomacy when ever possible with force when necessary the brave americans serving our nation today in the persian gulf in somalia and wherever else they stand are testament to our resolve but our greatest strength is the power of our ideas which are still new in many lands across the world we see them embraced and we rejoice our hopes our hearts our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom their cause is americas cause the american people have summoned the change we celebrate today you have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus you have cast your votes in historic numbers and you have changed the face of congress the presidency and the political process itself yes you my fellow americans have forced the spring now we must do the work the season demands to that work i now turn with all the authority of my office i ask the congress to join with me but no president no congress no government can undertake this mission alone my fellow americans you too must play your part in our renewal i challenge a new generation of young americans to a season of service to act on your idealism by helping troubled children keeping company with those in need reconnecting our torn communities there is so much to be done enough indeed for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service too in serving we recognize a simple but powerful truth we need each other and we must care for one another today we do more than celebrate america we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of america an idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge an idea tempered by the knowledge that but for fate we the fortunate and the unfortunate might have been each other an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity an idea infused with the conviction that americas long heroic journey must go forever upward and so my fellow americans at the edge of the 21st century let us begin with energy and hope with faith and discipline and let us work until our work is done the scripture says and let us not be weary in welldoing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not from this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley we have heard the trumpets we have changed the guard and now each in our way and with gods help we must answer the call thank you and god bless you all22 see alsoedit presidency of bill clinton second inauguration of bill clinton united states presidential election 1992 bill clinton presidential campaign 1992 referencesedit the 1993
