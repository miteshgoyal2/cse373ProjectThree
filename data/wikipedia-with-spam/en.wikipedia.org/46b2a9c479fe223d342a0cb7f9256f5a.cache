december 1998 when the league folded luckier than most localities that had an abl team seattle was quickly awarded a wnba franchise and began play less than two years later the seattle storm would tip off their first season the 2000 wnba season in typical expansion fashion coached by lin dunn and led by guard edna campbell and czech center kamila vodichkova the team finished with a 6–26 record the low record however allowed the storm to draft 19yearold australian standout lauren jackson though seattle did not make the playoffs in the 2001 season jacksons impressive rookie performance provided a solid foundation for the franchise to build on sue birds arrival and the road to the wnba finalsedit sue bird on offense in the 2002 draft the storm drafted uconn star sue bird filling the storms gap at the point guard position with birds playmaking ability and jacksons scoring and rebounding the team made the playoffs for the first time in 2002 but were swept by the los angeles sparks coach anne donovan was hired for the 2003 campaign in donovans first year jackson would win the wnba most valuable player award but the team had a disappointing season with bird injured for much of the year and the storm missed the playoffs the 2004 storm posted a then franchisebest 20–14 record in the playoffs the storm made quick work of the minnesota lynx sweeping them in the first round the storm then squared off against an upandcoming sacramento monarchs team in the west finals the storm would emerge victorious winning the series 2–1 in the wnba finals the storm would finish off the season as champions defeating the connecticut sun 2 games to 1 betty lennox was named mvp of the finals the win made anne donovan the first female head coach in wnba history to win the wnba championship a consistent postseason contender 2005–2009edit key players from the storms championship season were not on the team in 2005 vodichkova tully bevilaqua and sheri sam moved on to other teams in addition the preseason injury of australian star and new acquisition jessica bibby hampered the teams 2005 season while they matched their 2004 record and made the playoffs the storms title defense was stopped in the first round by the houston comets 2 games to 1 in 2006 the storm would finish 18–16 good enough to make the playoffs the storm put up a good fight in the first round against the sparks but would fall short 2–1 in 2007 the storm would finish 500 17–17 good enough to make the playoffs in a weak western conference the storm would be quickly swept out of the playoffs by the phoenix mercury on november 30 2007 anne donovan resigned as head coach and was replaced by brian agler on january 9 200834 although most of seattles major sports teams endured poor seasons during 2008 the storm would be the only standout team in seattle that year posting a franchisebest 22–12 record and finishing with a 16–1 record at home also a franchisebest but the no 2 seeded storm lost to the 3 los angeles sparks in the first round of the playoffs in three games and ended seattles season at 23–14 overall in 2009 the storm were 20–14 and finished second in the western conference for the second straight year in the playoffs the storm again lost to the 3 los angeles sparks in 3 games which ended their season in the first round for the fifth consecutive season a second championship 2010edit in the 2010 season the storm were almost unstoppable with a recordtying 28 wins and 6 losses in the regular season including a perfect 17–0 at keyarena this was the most home wins in the history of the wnba along the way lauren jackson was named wnba western conference player of the week five times and western conference player of the month three times on her way to being named wnba mvp for the third time agler was also named coach of the year in the playoffs the storm dramatically reversed their fortunes from the previous five seasons they started with a sweep of the sparks the team that previously knocked them out of the playoffs every time they met then they swept diana taurasi and the phoenix mercury in the conference finals and the atlanta dream in the wnba finals with two league championships the storm became seattles most successful pro sports team by that measure postseason pains 2011–2014edit with the same lineup as the previous year the storm had much expectation for the 2011 wnba season but right in the second round a twoyear home invincibility was broken by the minnesota lynx who even left the storm scoreless for the first seven minutes5 injuries hit multiple players especially lauren jackson who had to undergo hip surgery and missed most of the season the regular starting five resumed play only in the last five games but sue bird and swin cash kept the storm competitive finishing second in the wnba with 21 wins and 13 losses on the playoffs a mercury buzzer beater at the keyarena eliminated the storm in round 16 in 2012 with jackson absent for the early season training with the australia national team and injuries to most of the team including bird only camille little and katie smith played on all the games of the regular season upon her return jackson missed some games due to a hamstring injury but reached 6000 points on her wnba career playing against the san antonio silver stars the 1618 record put the storm fourth in the west facing the lynx who posted the leagues best record during the regular season in the playoffs7 while the storm managed to force a game 3 by winning in the keyarena at double overtime a lastsecond attempt by jackson went off the rim and the lynx took the series winning by just one point 73728 after losing in the first round of the 2013 playoffs to the lynx following a 500 regular season the storm missed the playoffs in 2014 this was the first time the storm missed the playoffs since 2003 2015–presentedit following sevenyear head coach gm brian aglers hiring in los angeles the storm elevated president
