population lives within the city boundaries traditional cultureedit model of a traditional coast salish winter house although they were skilled hunters salmon fishing was the mainstay of traditional coast salish life5 the people gathered and cured salmon sometimes trading it with other peoples along the coast and inland because it was central to survival salmon was treated with reverence which continues to this day in the elaborate first salmon ceremony which is still observed the entire community shares the flesh of a spring chinook they return its remains to the river where it was caught this is so the salmon can inform the other fish of how well it was received the other ceremony for the first salmon is to roast it until it becomes ashes the muckleshoot toss the bones and ashes back into the water or stream where they took the salmon believing that the fish would come alive again be part of a round of new propagation with a seemingly endless supply of food the people could engage in various crafts including weaving woodcarving and basketmaking a complex social structure also emerged consisting of a nobility middle class and slaves the latter were generally captured members of other tribes taken in raids or warfare colonial contactedit coast salish life changed radically as a result of first encounters with european and american traders and explorers lacking immunity to the newcomers infectious diseases the native population became decimated by the midnineteenth century at the same time amicable relations with american settlers deteriorated as whites began claiming choice land for themselves and encroaching on salish territory they tried to prevent the native americans from hunting and fishing in their traditional territories in a lastditch attempt to stem the tide of white colonization the muckleshoot allied with other local peoples in the puget sound indian war 1855–1856 upon their defeat they were forced under a treaty into a tiny reservation near presentday auburn washington 20th century to presentedit the peoples on the muckleshoot reservation cooperated and began to build a common culture in the 1930s they organized to set up a constitutional elected government adopting their constitution in 1936 they established more selfgovernment under an elected tribal council tensions with whites and mainstream society abated only slightly however in the early 20th century many ethnic japanese established farms in the green river valley cultivating the fertile land for agriculture from fear and racial discrimination the government ordered ethnic japanese to be interned and transported out of the area to camps inland during the war many lost their houses businesses and property after litigation and court challenges in the late 20th century the us government formally apologized to their representatives passing a law to pay compensation to survivors and descendants a large army quartermaster depot was established in the green river valley at the south end of auburn to take advantage of railways it served the ports along puget sound supporting the us war effort in the pacific in the postworld war ii era auburn began to be more industrialized together with rapid population growth in the region which developed many suburbs these changes put pressure on the muckleshoot and their reservation holdings many private land owners tried to prevent them from fishing and hunting in traditional territories in the 1960s and 1970s the muckleshoot engaged in a series of protests6 intended at protecting their fragile ecosystem known as the fish wars these protests attempted to preserve muckleshoot fishing rights in nearby rivers that were not within the official reservation county and state authorities had tried to regulate their fishing offreservation similarly the state tried to regulate other tribes in their fishing along the coastal waters in the boldt decision the federal district court upheld the right of the muckleshoot and other treaty peoples to fish from the rivers of the region and hunt in these territories it ruled that the native americans had rights to half the catch in their traditional areas it designated the muckleshoot as comanagers of the king county watershed with control over fishing and hunting in their usual and accustomed historical fishing and hunting grounds while this improved the tribes economic standing the muckleshoot were soon forced to contend with a sharp decline in the salmon population due to the adverse effects on the environment especially river water quality of urbanization and industrialization dams on rivers had decreased the fish populations that could get upstream to spawn and water quality in the rivers had declined while they continue to fight for the preservation of the ancient salmon runs the muckleshoot also found other venues to improve their economy taking advantage of their proximity to seattle and other urban centers and changes in gaming laws in the late 20th century they opened a casino and bingo parlor on their reservation called muckleshoot indian casino and muckleshoot bingo they have used some of the revenues to reacquire lands near the reservation and to support welfare and education of their people governmentedit the muckleshoot organized under the indian reorganization act of 1936 during the administration of president franklin d roosevelt they adopted a constitution that year that was ratified in 1941 establishing an elected government the muckleshoot tribal council has nine elected members to represent the tribe this council is subject in turn to the general council consisting of all members of the tribe on november 6 2013 kirotv announced that the muckleshoot tribe bought 150
