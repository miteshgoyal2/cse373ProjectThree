competition regulators v t e competition law is a law that promotes or seeks to maintain market competition by regulating anticompetitive conduct by companies12 competition law is implemented through public and private enforcement3 competition law is known as antitrust law in the united states and as antimonopoly law in china1 and russia in previous years it has been known as trade practices law in the united kingdom and australia in the european union it is referred to as both antitrust4 and competition law56 the history of competition law reaches back to the roman empire the business practices of market traders guilds and governments have always been subject to scrutiny and sometimes severe sanctions since the 20th century competition law has become global7 the two largest and most influential systems of competition regulation are united states antitrust law and european union competition law national and regional competition authorities across the world have formed international support and enforcement networks modern competition law has historically evolved on a country level to promote and maintain fair competition in markets principally within the territorial boundaries of nationstates national competition law usually does not cover activity beyond territorial borders unless it has significant effects at nationstate level2 countries may allow for extraterritorial jurisdiction in competition cases based on socalled effects doctrine28 the protection of international competition is governed by international competition agreements in 1945 during the negotiations preceding the adoption of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in 1947 limited international competition obligations were proposed within the charter for an international trade organisation these obligations were not included in gatt but in 1994 with the conclusion of the uruguay round of gatt multilateral negotiations the world trade organization wto was created the agreement establishing the wto included a range of limited provisions on various crossborder competition issues on a sector specific basis9 contents 1 principle 2 history 21 roman legislation 22

see also 8 notes 9 references 10 further reading principleedit competition law or antitrust law has three main elements prohibiting agreements or practices that restrict free trading and competition between business this includes in particular the repression of free trade caused by cartels banning abusive behavior by a firm dominating a market or anticompetitive practices that tend to lead to such a dominant position practices controlled in this way may include predatory pricing tying price gouging refusal to deal and many others supervising the mergers and acquisitions of large corporations including some joint ventures transactions that are considered to threaten the competitive process can be prohibited altogether or approved subject to remedies such as an obligation to divest part of the merged business or to offer licenses or access to facilities to enable other businesses to continue competing substance and practice of competition law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction protecting the interests of consumers consumer welfare and ensuring that entrepreneurs have an opportunity to compete in the market economy are often treated as important objectives competition law is closely connected with law on deregulation of access to markets state aids and subsidies the privatization of state owned assets and the establishment of independent sector regulators among other marketoriented supplyside policies in recent decades competition law has been viewed as a way to provide better public services10 robert bork argued that competition laws can produce adverse effects when they reduce competition by protecting inefficient competitors and when costs of legal intervention are greater than benefits for the consumers11 historyedit main article history of competition law roman legislationedit an early example was enacted during the roman republic around 50 bc12 to protect the grain trade heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly deliberately and insidiously stopping supply ships13 under diocletian in 301 ad an edict imposed the death penalty for anyone violating a tariff system for example by buying up concealing or contriving the scarcity of everyday goods13 more legislation came under the constitution of zeno of 483 ad which can be traced into florentine municipal laws of 1322 and 132514 this provided for confiscation of property and banishment for any trade combination or joint action of monopolies private or granted by the emperor zeno rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights15 justinian i subsequently introduced legislation to pay officials to manage state monopolies15 middle agesedit legislation in england to control monopolies and restrictive practices was in force well before the norman conquest15 the domesday book recorded that foresteel ie forestalling the practice of buying up goods before they reach market and then inflating the prices was one of three forfeitures that king edward the confessor could carry out through england16 but concern for fair prices also led to attempts to directly regulate the market under henry iii an act was passed in 126617 to fix bread and ale prices in correspondence with grain prices laid down by the assizes penalties for breach included amercements pillory and tumbrel18 a 14th century statute labelled forestallers as oppressors of the poor and the community at large and enemies of the whole country19 under king edward iii the statute of labourers of 134920 fixed wages of artificers and workmen and decreed that foodstuffs should be sold at reasonable prices on top of existing penalties the statute stated that overcharging merchants must pay the injured party double the sum he received an idea that has been replicated in punitive treble damages under us antitrust law also under edward iii the following statutory provision outlawed trade combination21  we have ordained and established that no merchant or other shall make confederacy conspiracy coin imagination or murmur or evil device in any point that may turn to the impeachment disturbance defeating or decay of the said staples or of anything that to them pertaineth or may pertain in continental europe competition principles developed in lex mercatoria examples of legislation enshrining competition principles include the constitutiones juris metallici by wenceslaus ii of bohemia between 1283 and 1305 condemning combination of ore traders increasing prices the municipal statutes of florence in 1322 and 1325 followed zenos legislation against state monopolies and under emperor charles v in the holy roman empire a law was passed to prevent losses resulting from monopolies and improper contracts which many merchants and artisans made in the netherlands in 1553 henry viii of england reintroduced tariffs for foodstuffs designed to stabilize prices in the face of fluctuations in supply from overseas so the legislation read here that whereas it is very hard and difficult to put certain prices to any such things  it is necessary because prices of such victuals be many times enhanced and raised by the greedy covetousness and appetites of the owners of such victuals by occasion of ingrossing and regrating the same more than upon any reasonable or just ground or cause to the great damage and impoverishing of the kings subjects22 around this time organizations representing various tradesmen and handicrafts people known as guilds had been developing and enjoyed many concessions and exemptions from the laws against monopolies the privileges conferred were not abolished until the municipal corporations act 1835 early competition law in europeedit judge coke in the 17th century thought that general restraints on trade were unreasonable the english common law of restraint of trade is the direct predecessor to modern competition law later developed in the us23 it is based on the prohibition of agreements that ran counter to public policy unless the reasonableness of an agreement could be shown it effectively prohibited agreements designed to restrain anothers trade the 1414 dyers is the first known restrictive trade agreement to be examined under english common law a dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return on hearing the plaintiffs attempt to enforce this restraint hull j exclaimed per dieu if the plaintiff were here he should go to prison until he had paid a fine to the king the court denied the collection of a bond for the dyers breach of agreement because the agreement was held to be a restriction on trade24 english courts subsequently decided a range of cases which gradually developed competition related case law which eventually were transformed into statute law25 elizabeth i assured monopolies would not be abused in the early era of globalization europe around the 16th century was changing quickly the new world had just been opened up overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting in 1561 a system of industrial monopoly licenses similar to modern patents had been introduced into england but by the reign of queen elizabeth i the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges encouraging nothing new in the way of innovation or manufacture26 in response english courts developed case law on restrictive business practices the statute followed the unanimous decision in darcy v allein 1602 also known as the case of monopolies27 of the kings bench to declare void the sole right that queen elizabeth i had granted to darcy to import playing cards into england25 darcy an officer of the queens household claimed damages for the defendants infringement of this right the court found the grant void and that three characteristics of monopoly were 1 price increases 2 quality decrease 3 the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary this put an end to granted monopolies until king james i began to grant them again in 1623 parliament passed the statute of monopolies which for the most part excluded patent rights from its prohibitions as well as guilds from king charles i through the civil war and to king charles ii monopolies continued especially useful for raising revenue28 then in 1684 in east india company v sandys it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas29 the development of early competition law in england and europe progressed with the diffusion of writings such as the wealth of nations by adam smith who first established the concept of the market economy at the same time industrialisation replaced the individual artisan or group of artisans with paid labourers and machinebased production commercial success increasingly dependent on maximising production while minimising cost therefore the size of a company became increasingly important and a number of european countries responded by enacting laws to regulate large companies which restricted trade following the french revolution in 1789 the law of 14–17 june 1791 declared agreements by members of the same trade that fixed the price of an industry or labour as void unconstitutional and hostile to liberty similarly the austrian penal code of 1852 established that agreements to raise the price of a commodity to the disadvantage of the public should be punished as misdemeanours austria passed a law in 1870 abolishing the penalties though such agreements remained void however in germany laws clearly validated agreements between firms to raise prices throughout the 18th and 19th century ideas that dominant private companies or legal monopolies could excessively restrict trade were further developed in europe however as in the late 19th century a depression spread through europe known as the panic of 1873 ideas of competition lost favour and it was felt that companies had to cooperate by forming cartels to withstand huge pressures on prices and profits30 modern competition lawedit while the development of competition law stalled in europe during the late 19th century in 1889 canada enacted what is considered the first competition statute of modern times the act for the prevention and suppression of combinations formed in restraint of trade was passed one year before the united states enacted the most famous legal statute on competition law the sherman act of 1890 it was named after senator john sherman who argued that the act does not announce a new principle of law but applies old and well recognised principles of common law31 united states antitrustedit main article united states antitrust law senatorial round house by thomas nast 1886 the sherman act of 1890 attempted to outlaw the restriction of competition by large companies who cooperated with rivals to fix outputs prices and market shares initially through pools and later through trusts trusts first appeared in the us railroads where the capital requirement of railroad construction precluded competitive services in then scarcely settled territories this trust allowed railroads to discriminate on rates imposed and services provided to consumers and businesses and to destroy potential competitors different trusts could be dominant in different industries the standard oil company trust in the 1880s controlled a number of markets including the market in fuel oil lead and whiskey31 vast numbers of citizens became sufficiently aware and publicly concerned about how the trusts negatively impacted them that the act became a priority for both major parties a primary concern of this act is that competitive markets themselves should provide the primary regulation of prices outputs interests and profits instead the act outlawed anticompetitive practices codifying the common law restraint of trade doctrine32 prof rudolph peritz has argued that competition law in the united states has evolved around two sometimes conflicting concepts of competition first that of individual liberty free of government intervention and second a fair competitive environment free of excessive economic power since the enactment of the sherman act enforcement of competition law has been based on various economic theories adopted by government33 section 1 of the sherman act declared illegal every contract in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations section 2 prohibits monopolies or attempts and conspiracies to monopolize following the enactment in 1890 us court applies these principles to business and markets courts applied the act without consistent economic analysis until 1914 when it was complemented by the clayton act which specifically prohibited exclusive dealing agreements particularly tying agreements and interlocking directorates and mergers achieved by purchasing stock from 1915 onwards the rule of reason analysis was frequently applied by courts to competition cases however the period was characterized by the lack of competition law enforcement from 1936 to 1972 courts application of antitrust law was dominated by the structureconductperformance paradigm of the harvard school from 1973 to 1991 the enforcement of antitrust law was based on efficiency explanations as the chicago school became dominant and through legal writings such as judge robert borks book the antitrust paradox since 1992 game theory has frequently been used in antitrust cases34 european union lawedit main article european union competition law competition law gained new recognition in europe in the interwar years with germany enacting its first anticartel law in 1923 and sweden and norway adopting similar laws in 1925 and 1926 respectively however with the great depression of 1929 competition law disappeared from europe and was revived following the second world war when the united kingdom and germany following pressure from the united states became the first european countries to adopt fully fledged competition laws at a regional level eu competition law has its origins in the european coal and steel community ecsc agreement between france italy belgium the netherlands luxembourg and germany in 1951 following the second world war the agreement aimed to prevent germany from reestablishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as it was felt that this dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations or mergers and the abuse of a dominant position by companies35 this was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the transeuropean model of competition law in 1957 competition rules were included in the treaty of rome also known as the ec treaty which established the european economic community eec the treaty of rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the eec through the institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted the two central provisions on eu competition law on companies were established in article 85 which prohibited anticompetitive agreements subject to some exemptions and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position the treaty also established principles on competition law for member states with article 90 covering public undertakings and article 92 making provisions on state aid regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time36 today the treaty of lisbon prohibits anticompetitive agreements in article 1011 including price fixing according to article 1012 any such agreements are automatically void article 1013 establishes exemptions if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation gives consumers a fair share of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere or compliant with the general principle of european union law of proportionality article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position37 such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing article 102 allows the european council regulations to govern mergers between firms the current regulation is the regulation 1392004ec38 the general test is whether a concentration ie merger or acquisition with a community dimension ie affects a number of eu member states might significantly impede effective competition articles 106 and 107 provide that member states right to deliver public services may not be obstructed but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidize private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disastercitation needed indiaedit main articles the competition act 2002 and competition commission of india india responded positively by opening up its economy by removing controls during the economic liberalisation in quest of increasing the efficiency of the nations economy the government of india acknowledged the liberalization privatization globalization era as a result indian market faces competition from within and outside the country39 this led to the need of a strong legislation to dispense justice in commercial matters and the competition act 2002 was passed the history of competition law in india dates back to the 1960s when the first competition law namely the monopolies and restrictive trade practices act mrtp was enacted in 1969 but after the economic reforms in 1991 this legislation was found to be obsolete in many aspects and as a result a new competition law in the form of the competition act 2002 was enacted in 2003 the competition commission of india is the quasi judicial body established for enforcing provisions of the competition act40 international expansionedit by 2008 111 countries had enacted competition laws which is more than 50 percent of countries with a population exceeding 80000 people 81 of the 111 countries had adopted their competition laws in the past 20 years signaling the spread of competition law following the collapse of the soviet union and the expansion of the european union41 currently competition authorities of many states closely cooperate on everyday basis with foreign counterparts in their enforcement efforts also in such key area as information evidence sharing42 in many of asias developing countries including india competition law is considered a tool to stimulate economic growth in korea and japan the competition law prevents certain forms of conglomerates in addition competition law has promoted fairness in china and indonesia as well as international integration in vietnam1 hong kongs competition ordinance came into force in the year 201543 enforcementedit see also world trade organization and international competition network there is considerable controversy among wto members in green whether competition law should form part of the agreements at a national level competition law is enforced through competition authorities as well as private enforcement the united states supreme court explained44 every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the freeenterprise system envisaged by congress this system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor and strong competition depends in turn on compliance with antitrust legislation in enacting these laws congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators it could have for example required violators to compensate federal state and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations but this remedy was not selected instead congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation in the european union the modernisation regulation 1200345 means that the european commission is no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of european union competition law this was done to facilitate quicker resolution of competitionrelated inquiries in 2005 the commission issued a green paper on damages actions for the breach of the ec antitrust rules46 which suggested ways of making private damages claims against cartels easier47 some eu member states enforce their competition laws with criminal sanctions these types of sanctions engender a number of significant theoretical legal and practical challenges48 antitrust administration and legislation can be seen as a balance between guidelines which are clear and specific to the courts regulators and business but leave little room for discretion that prevents the application of laws from resulting in unintended consequences guidelines which are broad hence allowing administrators to sway between improving economic outcomes versus succumbing to political policies to redistribute wealth49 chapter 5 of the post war havana charter contained an antitrust code50 but this was never incorporated into the wtos forerunner the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1947 office of fair trading director and professor richard whish wrote sceptically that it seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the wto will metamorphose into a global competition authority51 despite that at the ongoing doha round of trade talks for the world trade organization discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level while it is incapable of enforcement itself the newly established international competition network52 icn is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities theoryedit main article competition law theory classical perspectiveedit see also classical economics under the doctrine of laissezfaire antitrust is seen as unnecessary as competition is viewed as a longterm dynamic process where firms compete against each other for market dominance in some markets a firm may successfully dominate but it is because of superior skill or innovativeness however according to laissezfaire theorists when it tries to raise prices to take advantage of its monopoly position it creates profitable opportunities for others to compete a process of creative destruction begins which erodes the monopoly therefore government should not try to break up monopoly but should allow the market to work53 john stuart mill believed the restraint of trade doctrine was justified to preserve liberty and competition the classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the individual liberty of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances hence the courts found specific categories of agreement specific clauses to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power earlier theorists like adam smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis a monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures the monopolists by keeping the market constantly understocked by never fully supplying the effectual demand sell their commodities much above the natural price and raise their emoluments whether they consist in wages or profit greatly above their natural rate54 in the wealth of nations 1776 adam smith also pointed out the cartel problem but did not advocate specific legal measures to combat them people of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or in some contrivance to raise prices it is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings by any law which either could be executed or would be consistent with liberty and justice but though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies much less to render them necessary55 by the latter half of the 19th century it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy john stuart mills approach was laid down in his treatise on liberty 1859 again trade is a social act whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public does what affects the interest of other persons and of society in general and thus his conduct in principle comes within the jurisdiction of society both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere this is the socalled doctrine of free trade which rests on grounds different from though equally solid with the principle of individual liberty asserted in this essay restrictions on trade or on production for purposes of trade are indeed restraints and all restraint qua restraint is an evil56 neoclassical synthesisedit see also neoclassical synthesis paul samuelson author of the 20th centurys most successful economics text combined mathematical models and keynesian macroeconomic intervention he advocated the general success of the market but backed the american governments antitrust policies after mill there was a shift in economic theory which emphasized a more precise and theoretical model of competition a simple neoclassical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes social welfare this model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms or to use legal language there are no barriers to entry by this term economists mean something very specific that competitive free markets deliver allocative productive and dynamic efficiency allocative efficiency is also known as pareto efficiency after the italian economist vilfredo pareto and means that resources in an economy over the long run will go precisely to those who are willing and able to pay for them because rational producers will keep producing and selling and buyers will keep buying up to the last marginal unit of possible output – or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced – there is no waste the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and utility is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off society has achieved allocative efficiency productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can free markets are meant to reward those who work hard and therefore those who will put societys resources towards the frontier of its possible production57 dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research create and innovate to keep its share of consumers this traces to austrianamerican political scientist joseph schumpeters notion that a perennial gale of creative destruction is ever sweeping through capitalist economies driving enterprise at the markets mercy58 this led schumpeter to argue that monopolies did not need to be broken up as with standard oil because the next gale of economic innovation would do the same contrasting with the allocatively productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies oligopolies and cartels when only one or a few firms exist in the market and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms prices rise above the competitive level to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price production is also decreased further decreasing social welfare by creating a deadweight loss sources of this market power are saidby whom to include the existence of externalities barriers to entry of the market and the free rider problem markets may fail to be efficient for a variety of reasons so the exception of competition laws intervention to the rule of laissez faire is justified if government failure can be avoided orthodox economists fully acknowledge that perfect competition is seldom observed in the real world and so aim for what is called workable competition5960 this follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal then go for the second best option61 by using the law to tame market operation where it can chicago schooledit robert bork see also chicago school of economics and neoclassical economics a group of economists and lawyers who are largely associated with the university of chicago advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition62 the us supreme court has used the chicago school approach in several recent cases63 one view of the chicago school approach to antitrust is found in united states circuit court of appeals judge richard posners books antitrust law64 and economic analysis of law65 robert bork was highly critical of court decisions on united states antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book the antitrust paradox66 bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was the pursuit only of consumer welfare the protection of competition rather than competitors67 furthermore only a few acts should be prohibited namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets mergers that create monopolies and dominant firms pricing predatorily while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and price discrimination on the grounds that it did not harm consumers68 running through the different critiques of us antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good69 the only cure for bad theory writes bork is better theory67 the late harvard law school professor philip areeda who favours more aggressive antitrust policy in at least one supreme court case challenged robert borks preference for nonintervention70 practiceedit collusion and cartelsedit main articles collusion and cartel scottish enlightenment philosopher adam smith was an early enemy of cartels dominance and monopolyedit main articles dominance economics and monopoly the economists depiction of deadweight loss to efficiency that monopolies cause when firms hold large market shares consumers risk paying higher prices and getting lower quality products than compared to competitive markets however the existence of a very high market share does not always mean consumers are paying excessive prices since the threat of new entrants to the market can restrain a highmarketshare firms price increases competition law does not make merely having a monopoly illegal but rather abusing the power that a monopoly may confer for instance through exclusionary practices first it is necessary to determine whether a firm is dominant or whether it behaves to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors customers and ultimately of its consumer71 under eu law very large market shares raise a presumption that a firm is dominant72 which may be rebuttable73 if a firm has a dominant position then there is a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market74 similarly as with collusive conduct market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the firm and product in question is sold then although the lists are seldom closed75 certain categories of abusive conduct are usually prohibited under the countrys legislation for instance limiting production at a shipping port by refusing to raise expenditure and update technology could be abusive76 tying one product into the sale of another can be considered abuse too being restrictive of consumer choice and depriving competitors of outlets this was the alleged case in microsoft v commission77 leading to an eventual fine of million for including its windows media player with the microsoft windows platform a refusal to supply a facility which is essential for all businesses attempting to compete to use can constitute an abuse one example was in a case involving a medical company named commercial solvents78 when it set up its own rival in the tuberculosis drugs market commercial solvents were forced to continue supplying a company named zoja with the raw materials for the drug zoja was the only market competitor so without the court forcing supply all competition would have been eliminated forms of abuse relating directly to pricing include price exploitation it is difficult to prove at what point a dominant firms prices become exploitative and this category of abuse is rarely found in one case however a french funeral service was found to have demanded exploitative prices and this was justified on the basis that prices of funeral services outside the region could be compared79 a more tricky issue is predatory pricing this is the practice of dropping prices of a product so much that ones smaller competitors cannot cover their costs and fall out of business the chicago school economics considers predatory pricing to be unlikely80 however in france telecom sa v commission81 a broadband internet company was forced to pay million for dropping its prices below its own production costs it had no interest in applying such prices except that of eliminating competitors82 and was being crosssubsidized to capture the lions share of a booming market one last category of pricing abuse is price discrimination83 an example of this could be offering rebates to industrial customers who export your companys sugar but not to customers who are selling their goods in the same market as you are in84 mergers and acquisitionsedit main article mergers and acquisitions a merger or acquisition involves from a competition law perspective the concentration of economic power in the hands of fewer than before85 this usually means that one firm buys out the shares of another the reasons for oversight of economic concentrations by the state are the same as the reasons to restrict firms who abuse a position of dominance only that regulation of mergers and acquisitions attempts to deal with the problem before it arises ex ante prevention of market dominance86 in the united states merger regulation began under the clayton act and in the european union under the merger regulation 1392004 known as the ecmr87 competition law requires that firms proposing to merge gain authorization from the relevant government authority the theory behind mergers is that transaction costs can be reduced compared to operating on an open market through bilateral contracts88 concentrations can increase economies of scale and scope however often firms take advantage of their increase in market power their increased market share and decreased number of competitors which can adversely affect the deal that consumers get merger control is about predicting what the market might be like not knowing and making a judgment hence the central provision under eu law asks whether a concentration would if it went ahead significantly impede effective competition in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening off a dominant position89 and the corresponding provision under us antitrust states similarly no person shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of the assets of one or more persons engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce where the effect of such acquisition of such stocks or assets or of the use of such stock by the voting or granting of proxies or otherwise may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly90 what amounts to a substantial lessening of or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study the market shares of the merging companies can be assessed and added although this kind of analysis only gives rise to presumptions not conclusions91 the herfindahlhirschman index is used to calculate the density of the market or what concentration exists aside from the maths it is important to consider the product in question and the rate of technical innovation in the market92 a further problem of collective dominance or oligopoly through economic links93 can arise whereby the new market becomes more conducive to collusion it is relevant how transparent a market is because a more concentrated structure could mean firms can coordinate their behavior more easily whether firms can deploy deterrents and whether firms are safe from a reaction by their competitors and consumers94 the entry of new firms to the market and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered95 if firms are shown to be creating an uncompetitive concentration in the us they can still argue that they create efficiencies enough to outweigh any detriment and similar reference to technical and economic progress is mentioned in art 2 of the ecmr96 another defense might be that a firm which is being taken over is about to fail or go insolvent and taking it over leaves a no less competitive state than what would happen anyway97 mergers vertically in the market are rarely of concern although in aoltime warner98 the european commission required that a joint venture with a competitor bertelsmann be ceased beforehand the eu authorities have also focused lately on the effect of conglomerate mergers where companies acquire a large portfolio of related products though without necessarily dominant shares in any individual market99 intellectual property innovation and competitionedit competition law has become increasingly intertwined with intellectual property such as copyright trademarks patents industrial design rights and in some jurisdictions trade secrets100 it is believed that promotion of innovation through enforcement of intellectual property rights may promote as well as limit competitiveness the question rests on whether it is legal to acquire monopoly through accumulation of intellectual property rights in which case the judgment needs to decide between giving preference to intellectual property rights or towards promoting competitiveness should antitrust laws accord special treatment to intellectual property should intellectual rights be revoked or not granted when antitrust laws are violated concerns also arise over anticompetitive effects and consequences due to intellectual properties that are collaboratively designed with consequence of violating antitrust laws intentionally or otherwise the further effects on competition when such properties are accepted into industry standards crosslicensing of intellectual property bundling of intellectual property rights to long term business transactions or agreements to extend the market exclusiveness of intellectual property rights beyond their statutory duration trade secrets if they remain a secret having an eternal length of life some scholars suggest that a prize instead of patent would solve the problem of deadweight loss when innovators got their reward from the prize provided by the government or nonprofit organization rather than directly selling to the market see millennium prize problems however innovators may accept the prize only when it is at least as much as how much they earn from patent which is a question difficult to determine101 see
