group shalamar cochoreographed the smooth criminal video with jackson and vincent paterson who was a backup dancer in beat it and thriller it was directed by special effects coordinator colin chilvers

versions of the video for smooth criminal as well as an additional vignette created for the 2009 this is it concert series original moonwalker version this is the version included in the moonwalker film while technically the whole smooth criminal segment is about 40 minutes long the actual smooth criminal song section is only about ten minutes it is generally the most complete version of the video and includes the unedited middle section of interpretive dance with the dancers but does not include the last six seconds where a flapper fans herself after the door is shut behind michael in comparison to the original song this version has two lines in the second stanza added everytime i try to find him hes leaving no clues left behind him and they have no way of knowing of the suspect or what to expect moonwalker edit this version is included on history on film volume ii as well as michael jacksons vision and it is basically an edited version of the tenminute song section from the smooth criminal segment in the film moonwalker it is essentially the same however it has some minor changes including different opening music and no dialogue the middle section with the dancers chanting has been truncated some of the chanting has been shortened and ends similarly to the original where michael exits the club but with the addition of the lead flapper fanning herself album version this is the version of the video that is on michael jacksons official website as well as his youtube channel it also appears during the end credits for moonwalker and number ones and was included on the visionary single and the bonus target exclusive dvd of bad 25 the video is a montage of clips from the original moonwalker version that have either been sped up or slowed down and glossed with an added blur effect as well as some alternate angles the video is four minutes and seventeen seconds long throughout the video the regular version of the song is played single version this unreleased version is edited to be in sync with the single mix taken from the smooth criminal single released october 24 1988 it excludes the added lyric and interlude this video is four minutes and three seconds long it is considered an mtv base video this is it vignette 2009 video shot in black and white and intended to be shown during the london o2 concert series it runs three minutes and

shotsscenes of his film moonwalker the video won best music video at the 1989 brit awards and the critics choice awarded jackson the best video award and the peoples choice awards for favorite music video for that same year the style of clothing as well as mannerisms jackson portrayed were reused in the numerous adaptations of the video game michael jacksons moonwalker the song itself serves as the background music for the club 30s stage the nightclub seen in the music video that appears in the game antigravity leanedit jackson performs an antigravity lean in the smooth criminal music video in the music video michael jackson and the dancers immediately around him perform a seemingly impossible forward lean this illusion was created using strings and wires in the music video to accomplish this manoeuvre in live shows a hitching mechanism which jackson copatented was built into the floor of the stage and the performers shoes thereby allowing performers to lean without needing to keep their centers of mass directly over their feet11 the system consists of pegs that rise from the stage at the appropriate moment and special shoes with ankle supports and cutouts in the heels which can slide over the pegs and be temporarily attached to the stage12 in the patent it is stated that the illusion in the music video was achieved by means of harnesses and cables which had to be connected to and disconnected from the floor by stagehands12 live performancesedit the song was performed live on all of jacksons tours bad world tour during the second leg of jacksons bad world tour 19881989 directed and choreographed by jackson and vincent paterson the performance featured a dance routine modeled after the scene from moonwalker this version of the song is available on the dvd live at wembley july 16 1988 in this version he wears the signature white suit coat with blue armband and pocket square and the white fedora over his normal outfit normally lipsynced sometimes was sung live such as in new york on march 5 1988 the hotel intro was performed similar to the opening of this place hotel in the 1987 leg of the bad tour containing a spoken introduction and jacksons silhouette dancing behind a lit curtain dangerous world tour by the time the 1992 dangerous world tour came around this performance became a regular on jackson tours this time the jacket and hat were put on top of the gold leotard also the antigravity lean was introduced during this tour during the bad tour the lean was a drop to the floor but jackson stopped himself before hitting it the lean was pulled off using a special cutout in the performers shoes patented by jackson that held them to the floor using nails while they leaned forward this performance can be seen on the dvd live in bucharest the dangerous tour part of the song was also briefly used in the middle of the live version of the song dangerous since jacksons performance at the 1995 mtv video music awards to the 2002 american bandstand 50th anniversary performance history world tour during the 19961997 history world tour the costume was the coat hat and a blue shirt and a white tie over the gold pants the hotel opening was scrapped for a similar opening with no spoken line instead showcasing the background dancers and a keyboard interlude of childhood by brad buxer this is it the song was rehearsed for the this is it concerts which were scheduled to run from july 2009 to march 2010 before jacksons untimely death in june 2009 rather than featuring jackson dancing behind a lit curtain the performance would open with a 3d vignette of jackson being chased by several gangsters from early 1930s films inserting him into the film noirs gilda the big sleep and in a lonely place the vignette would end with jackson jumping out of a window as humphrey bogart shoots at him and onto the stage where he picks up a tommy gun and shoots out the lights of a marquee to spell smooth criminal throwing the tommy gun aside jackson would then pause for a moment before cuing the band to start the song the performance would have also featured the return of the antigravity lean and the inclusion of dancers descending from the ceiling inside chandeliers that they would blow out with tommy guns film adaptationedit further information moonwalker the song was adapted into a short film directed by colin chilvers which was the centerpiece of the 1988 film moonwalker starring michael jackson and joe pesci in the lead roles plotedit the film begins with three homeless children—sean katie and zeke sean lennon kellie parker and brandon quintin adams—sneaking through a big city to see their friend michael walk out of his store in a black suit covered over with his white jacket as michael stands in front of the door he gazes at the night sky before he is attacked by mobsters with machine guns the film then backtracks to show michael and the children playing in a meadow in happier times their dog skipper runs away and as michael and katie look for him they uncover the lair of mr big joe pesci mr big—whose real name is frankie lideo which is an anagram of frank dileo—is a drugdealing mobster with a disciplined private army at his command he wants to get the entire population of earth addicted to drugs starting with children he likes to eat nuts and leaves nutshells wherever he goes he is obsessed with spiders as displayed by their abundance at the entrance to his lair and his operation named bugs and drugs further all his henchmen sport a spider crest on their uniforms katie screams when she sees a spider on her hand and mr big discovers them spying on his operation the story returns to the shooting in front of michaels store unknown to the mobsters michael has a lucky star and using it he escaped the gunfire upon realizing that michael has escaped again mr big orders his henchmen to track him down with dogs michael is eventually cornered in an alley where he uses his lucky star again to turn into a sportscar the 1970 lancia stratos prototype that mows down several of mr bigs henchmen michael is pursued through the city streets until he loses the henchmen meanwhile the children scout out club 30s where michael had told them to meet him and find only an abandoned and haunted nightclub as michael arrives katie sees a silhouette of him turning back from a car into himself this time in a white and blue suit the door of the club opens with a gust of wind and michael walks in to find it filled with zoot suiters and swing dancers the children gather outside a window of the club and watch michael dance to smooth criminal the song used in the film is much longer than the album release with several lyrics that clarify the story there is also an interlude wherein jackson joins the other dancers in a modern interpretive dance at the climax of the song mr big lays siege to the club and kidnaps katie michael follows them back to bigs lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen mr big appears and taunts michael by threatening to inject katie with highly addictive narcotics katie breaks free for a moment but mr big grabs her again and starts kicking michael as mr big stands over michael and orders his henchmen to kill him and katie michael looks up and sees his lucky star he transforms into a giant robot and kills all of mr bigs soldiers then turns into a spaceship mr big gets into a large hillsidemounted energy cannon firing on the spaceship as it flies into a nearby ravine the children are his next target but the spaceship returns from the ravine just in time to fire a beam into the cannon with mr big inside destroying it and killing him the children watch the ship fly into the night sky with a shower of light the children return to the city believing that michael is gone forever as the boys talk about michael katie walks away crying and clutching a paper star as she sits in a corner wishing for him to come back the paper star flies out of her hand and michael walks out of the night fog he takes them to club 30s where they find that the club has turned into the backstage area of a concert michaels stage crew return the childrens missing dog and then escort michael onto the stage where he performs come together personneledit written composed clap solo and background vocals by michael jackson produced by quincy jones coproduced by michael jackson
