software archaeology from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search software archaeology or software archeology is the study of poorly documented or undocumented legacy software implementations as part of software maintenance12 software archaeology named by analogy with archaeology3 includes the reverse engineering of software modules and the application of a variety of tools and processes for extracting and understanding program structure and recovering design information14 software archaeology may reveal dysfunctional team processes which have produced poorly designed or even unused software modules5 the term has been in use for decades6 and reflects a fairly natural metaphor a programmer reading legacy code may feel that he or she is in the same situation as an archaeologist exploring the rubble of an ancient civilization7 contents 1 techniques 2 see also 3 references 4 external links techniquesedit a workshop on software archaeology at the 2001 oopsla objectoriented programming systems languages applications conference identified the following software archaeology techniques some of which are specific to objectoriented programming7 scripting languages to build static reports and for filtering diagnostic output ongoing documentation in html pages or wikis synoptic signature analysis statistical analysis and software visualization tools reverseengineering tools operatingsystemlevel tracing via truss or strace search engines and tools to search for keywords in source files ide file browsing unit testing frameworks such as junit and cppunit api documentation generation using tools such as javadoc and doxygen debuggers more generally andy hunt and dave thomas note the importance of version control dependency management text indexing tools such as glimpse and swishe and drawing a map as you begin exploring7 like true archaeology software archaeology involves investigative work to understand the thought processes of ones predecessors7 at the oopsla workshop ward cunningham suggested a synoptic signature analysis technique which gave an overall feel for a program by showing only punctuation such as semicolons and curly braces8 in the same vein cunningham has suggested viewing programs in 2 point font in order to understand the overall structure9 another technique identified at the workshop was the use of aspectoriented programming tools such as aspectj to systematically introduce tracing code without directly editing the legacy program7 network and temporal analysis techniques can reveal the patterns of collaborative activity by the developers of legacy software which in turn may shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the software artifacts produced10 michael rozlog of embarcadero technologies has described software archaeology as a sixstep process which enables programmers to answer questions such as what have i just inherited and where are the scary sections of the code11 these steps similar to those identified by the oopsla workshop include using visualization to obtain a visual representation of the programs design using software metrics to look for design and style violations using unit testing and profiling to look for bugs and performance bottlenecks and assembling design information recovered by the process11 software archaeology can also be a service provided to programmers by external consultants12 mitch rosenberg of infoventionsnet inc claimscitation needed that the first law of software archaeology he calls it code or data archaeology is everything that is there is there for a reason and there are 3 possible reasons it used to need to be there but no longer does it never needed to be there and the person that wrote the code had no clue it still needs to be there and you have no clue the corollary to this law is that until you know which was the reason you should not modify the code or data software archaeology has continued to be a topic of discussion at more recent software engineering conferences13 see alsoedit software testing portal software architecture recovery code refactoring retrocomputing software brittleness
