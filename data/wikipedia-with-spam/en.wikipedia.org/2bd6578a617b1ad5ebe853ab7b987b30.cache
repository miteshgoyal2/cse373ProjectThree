incorporated on april 29 1892 initially a small mining town this town has changed noticeably both in its appearance and economic focus issaquah was originally developed to service the mining industry on nearby squak and cougar mountain and began as the town of gilman washington as the mining deposits neared depletion in the late 1890s other companies started to realize issaquahs potential to support a lucrative lumber business these companies exported timber from issaquah and other small local towns to seattle and larger rapidly growing communities throughout western washington these early boom industries however faded into a period of relative quiet by the time of the great depression the town remained fairly placid through the succeeding decades with the boeing company providing the majority of employment in the area microsoft and other technological industries moved into redmond washington and other cities in the area and later established operations in issaquah itself both boeing and microsoft have significantly affected issaquahs history cultural development and diverse population through their active community participation and attraction of outside residents in june
