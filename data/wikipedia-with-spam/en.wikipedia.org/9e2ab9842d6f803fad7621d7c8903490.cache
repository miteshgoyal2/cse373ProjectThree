diamond was a rural coal mining area developed by the black diamond coal mining company of california which owned and operated the mine6 the original residents were largely composed of former workers from the companys previous coal mining operation in nortonville california which primarily sold coal to the thriving new metropolis of san francisco7 a combination of low quality coal from the nortonville mines water intrusion into the workings there and the discovery and economical transport of higherquality washington coal to san francisco spelled the demise of nortonville in the early 1880s8 the town was home to around 3500 people by the early 1900s many of them european immigrants most of the working men were involved in producing coal this coal was transported to seattle via the pacific coast coal train before 1911 the miners were affiliated with the united mine workers of america umwa but by march 1911 had left en masse to join the industrial workers of the world iww910 after world war i the town shut down the mine as it was no longer viable however a second mining boom spurred growth in the town in the early 1930s on the strength of multiple mining operations promoted by the morris brothers through the palmer coking coal company mining has continued until recently through the pacific coast coal company formerly of san francisco the prospect of future mining operations remains strong the town has been home to many famous residents including folk musician brandi carlile who grew up a few miles east in ravensdale the minorleague baseball star edo

historical museum is the former train station which served the columbia puget sound railway 1884–1916 and the pacific coast railway 1916–1951 according to a sign at the museum there were originally two trains a day to seattle later only one regular passenger service ended in 1925 but a train still brought men to the mine until 1931 and trains continued to haul coal and freight into the 1940s the black diamond bakery achieved regional fame in the 1970s for the quality of its breads and other baked goods and continues to attract destination shoppers the towns late 20th century population growth
