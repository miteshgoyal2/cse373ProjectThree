named in honor of francisco fernández de la cueva 10th duke of alburquerque89 who was viceroy of new spain from 1702 to 1711 the growing village was named by provincial governor francisco cuervo y valdés the dukes title referred to the spanish town of alburquerque in the province of badajoz near the border with portugal the name has two theories of origin which denote either latin or arabic roots under the latin theory the name derives from albus quercus meaning white oak10 the name was probably in reference to the prevalence of cork oaks in the region which have a white wood when the bark is removed alburquerque is still a center of the spanish cork industry11 and the town coatofarms features a white cork oak12 another theory suggests that the name derives from the arabic abu alqurq which means father of the cork oak the first r in alburquerque was later dropped probably due to association with the prominent portuguese general alfonso de albuquerque whose family title among others and then name originated from the presently spanish town which was once a dominion of the kings of portugal and used the portuguese variant spelling of its name the change was also in part because citizens found the original name difficult to pronounce13 historyedit see also history of albuquerque new mexico and timeline of albuquerque new mexico native american presenceedit the tanoan and keresan peoples had lived along the rio grande for centuries before european settlers arrived in what is now albuquerque petroglyphs carved into basalt in the west part of the city bear testimony to early native american presence in the area now preserved in the petroglyph national monument more specifically the tiwa established two pueblos on the outskirts of the presentday city which they have continuously occupied for many centuries sandia pueblo which was founded in the 14th century14 and the pueblo of isleta for which written records go back to the early 17th century when it was chosen as the site of the san agustín de la isleta mission a catholic mission the navajo apache and comanche peoples were also likely to have set camps in the albuquerque area as there is evidence of trade and cultural exchange between the different native american groups going back centuries before european conquest15 early european settlersedit albuquerque was founded in 1706 as the spanish colonial outpost of villa de alburquerque16 presentday albuquerque retains much of its historical spanish cultural heritage old town albuquerque plaza albuquerque was a farming community and strategically located military outpost along the camino real the town was also the sheepherding center of the west17 spain established a presidio military garrison in albuquerque in 1706 after 1821 mexico also had a military garrison there the town of alburquerque was built in the traditional spanish village pattern a central plaza surrounded by government buildings homes and a church this central plaza area has been preserved and is open to the public as a museum cultural area and center of commerce it is referred to as old town albuquerque or simply old town historically it was sometimes referred to as la placita little plaza in spanish on the north side of old town plaza is san felipe de neri church built in 1793 it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the city18 after the american occupation of new mexico albuquerque had a federal garrison and quartermaster depot the post of albuquerque from 1846 to 1867 during the civil war albuquerque was occupied in february 1862 by confederate troops under general henry hopkins sibley who soon afterward advanced with his main body into northern new mexico during his retreat from union troops into texas he made a stand on april 8 1862 at albuquerque and fought the battle of albuquerque against a detachment of union soldiers commanded by colonel edward r s canby this daylong engagement at long range led to few casualties downtown albuquerque in the 1880s when the atchison topeka and santa fe railroad arrived in 1880 it bypassed the plaza locating the passenger depot and railyards about 2 miles 3 km east in what quickly became known as new albuquerque or new town the railway company built a hospital for its workers that was later a juvenile psychiatric facility and has now been converted to a hotel19 many anglo merchants mountain men and settlers slowly filtered into albuquerque creating a major mercantile commercial center which is now downtown albuquerque due to a rising rate of violent crime gunman milt yarberry was appointed the towns first marshal that year new albuquerque was incorporated as a town in 1885 with henry n jaffa its first mayor and it was incorporated as a city in 189120232–233 old town remained a separate community until the 1920s when it was absorbed by the city of albuquerque old albuquerque high school the citys first public high school was established in

gothic styles were used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by 1900 albuquerque boasted a population of 8000 inhabitants and all the modern amenities including an electric street railway connecting old town new town and the recently established university of new mexico campus on the east mesa in 1902 the famous alvarado hotel was built adjacent to the new passenger depot and it remained a symbol of the city until it was razed in 1970 to make room for a parking lot in 2002 the alvarado transportation center was built on the site in a manner resembling the old landmark the large metro station functions as the downtown headquarters for the citys transit department it also serves as an intermodal hub for local buses greyhound buses amtrak passenger trains and the rail runner commuter rail line new mexicos dry climate brought many tuberculosis patients to the city in search of a cure during the early 20th century and several sanitaria sprang up on the west mesa to serve them presbyterian hospital and st joseph hospital two of the largest hospitals in the southwest had their beginnings during this period influential new deal–era governor clyde tingley and famed southwestern architect john gaw meem were among those brought to new mexico by tuberculosis this is the albuquerques alvarado hotel fred harvey hotel native american building laundry building santa fe

downtown albuquerques many historic buildings the first travelers on route 66 appeared in albuquerque in 1926 and before long dozens of motels restaurants and gift shops had sprung up along the roadside to serve them route 66 originally ran through the city on a northsouth alignment along fourth street but in 1937 it was realigned along central avenue a more direct eastwest route the intersection of fourth and central downtown was the principal crossroads of the city for decades the majority of the surviving structures from the route 66 era are on central though there are also some on fourth signs between bernalillo and los lunas along the old route now have brown historical highway markers denoting it as pre1937 route 66 the establishment of kirtland air force base in 1939 sandia base in the early 1940s and sandia national laboratories in 1949 would make albuquerque a key player of the atomic age meanwhile the city continued to expand outward into the northeast heights reaching a population of 201189 by 1960 in 1990 it was 384736 and in 2007 it was 518271 in june 2007 albuquerque was listed as the sixth fastestgrowing city in america by cnn and the united states census bureau22 in 1990 the census bureau reported albuquerques population as 345 hispanic and 583 nonhispanic white23 albuquerques downtown entered the same phase and development decline urban renewal with continued decline and gentrification as nearly every city across the united states as albuquerque spread outward the downtown area fell into a decline many historic buildings were razed in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for new plazas highrises and parking lots as part of the citys urban renewal phase as of 2010update only recently has downtown come to regain much of its urban character mainly through the construction of many new loft apartment buildings and the renovation of historic structures such as the kimo theater in the gentrification phase new millenniumedit during the 21st century the albuquerque population has continued to grow rapidly the population of the city proper was estimated at 528497 in 2009 up from 448607 in the 2000 census24 during 2005 and 2006 the city celebrated its tricentennial with a diverse program of cultural events urban trends and issuesedit albuquerque plaza the passage of the planned growth strategy in 2002–2004 was the communitys strongest effort to create a framework for a more balanced and sustainable approach to urban growth25 a critical finding of the study is that many of the disconnects between the publics preferences and what actually is taking place are caused by weak or nonexistent implementation tools – rather than by inadequate policies as contained in the citycounty comprehensive plan and other already adopted legislation urban sprawl is limited on three sides—by the sandia pueblo to the north the isleta pueblo and kirtland air force base to the south and the sandia mountains to the east suburban growth continues at a strong pace to the west beyond petroglyph national monument once thought to be a natural boundary to sprawl development26 aerial view of albuquerque core because of lesscostly land and lower taxes much of the growth in the metropolitan area is taking place outside of the city of albuquerque itself in rio rancho to the northwest the communities east of the mountains and the incorporated parts of valencia county population growth rates approach twice that of albuquerque the primary cities in valencia county are los lunas and belen both of which are home to growing industrial complexes and new residential subdivisions the mountain towns of tijeras edgewood and moriarty while close enough to albuquerque to be considered suburbs have experienced much less growth compared to rio rancho bernalillo los lunas and belen limited water supply and rugged terrain are the main limiting factors for development in these towns the mid region council of governments mrcog which includes constituents from throughout the albuquerque area was formed to ensure that these governments along the middle rio grande would be able to meet the needs of their rapidly rising populations mrcogs cornerstone project is currently the new mexico rail runner express in october 2013 the albuquerque journal reported albuquerque as the third best city to own an investment property27 geographyedit satellite image of albuquerque taken by nasa according to the united states census bureau albuquerque has a total area of 1895 square miles 4909 km2 of which 1877 square miles 4862 km2 is land and 18 square miles 47 km2 or 096 is water28 albuquerque lies within the northern upper edges of the chihuahuan desert ecoregion based on longterm patterns of climate associations of plants and wildlife and landforms including drainage patterns2930 located in central new mexico the city also has noticeable influences from the adjacent colorado plateau semidesert arizona–new mexico mountains and southwest plateaus and plains steppe ecoregions depending on where one is located its main geographic connection lies with southern new mexico while culturally albuquerque is a crossroads of most of new mexico albuquerque has one of the highest elevations of any major city in the united states though the effects of this are greatly tempered by its southwesterly continental position the elevation of the city ranges from 4900 feet 1490 m above sea level near the rio grande in the valley to over 6700 feet 1950 m in the foothill areas of sandia heights and glenwood hills at the airport the elevation is 5352 feet 1631 m above sea level the rio grande is classified like the nile as an exotic river because it flows through a desert the new mexico portion of the rio grande lies within the rio grande rift valley bordered by a system of faults including those that lifted up the adjacent sandia and manzano mountains while lowering the area where the lifesustaining rio grande now flows geologyedit sandia peak ski area in the sandia mountains aerial view of the rio grande flowing through albuquerque in 2016 albuquerque lies in the albuquerque basin a portion of the rio grande rift31 the sandia mountains are the predominant geographic feature visible in albuquerque sandía is spanish for watermelon and is popularly believed to be a reference to the brilliant coloration of the mountains at sunset bright pink melon meat and green melon rind the pink is due to large exposures of granodiorite cliffs and the green is due to large swaths of conifer forests however robert julyan notes in the place names of new mexico the most likely explanation is the one believed by the sandia pueblo indians the spaniards when they encountered the pueblo in 1540 called it sandia because they thought the squash growing there were watermelons and the name sandia soon was transferred to the mountains east of the pueblo32 he also notes that the sandia pueblo indians call the mountain bien mur big mountain32 the sandia foothills on the west side of the mountains have soils derived from that same rock material with varying sizes of decomposed granite mixed with areas of clay and caliche a calcium carbonate deposit common in the arid southwestern usa along with some exposed granite bedrock below the foothills the area usually called the northeast heights consists of a mix of clay and caliche soils overlaying a layer of decomposed granite resulting from longterm outwash of that material from the adjacent mountains this bajada is quite noticeable when driving into albuquerque from the north or south due to its fairly uniform slope from the mountains edge downhill to the valley sand hills are scattered along the i25 corridor and directly above the rio grande valley forming the lower end of the heights the rio grande valley due to longterm shifting of the actual river channel contains layers and areas of soils varying between caliche clay loam and even some sand it is the only part of albuquerque where the water table often lies close to the surface sometimes less than 10 feet 30 m the last significant area of albuquerque geologically is the west mesa this is the elevated land west of the rio grande including west bluff the sandy terrace immediately west and above the river and the rather sharply defined volcanic escarpment above and west of most of the developed city the west mesa commonly has soils often referred to as blow sand along with occasional clay and caliche and even basalt nearing the escarpment landscapeedit panoramic

the city has four distinct seasons downtown albuquerque after a snowstorm winter consists of chillymild days and cold nights december the coolest month averages 363 °f 24 °c although low temperatures bottom out in january and the coldest temperature of the year is typically around 10 °f −12 °c35 most nights in december january and february will usually be below freezing spring is windy sometimes unsettled with some rain though spring is usually the driest part of the year in albuquerque march and april tend to see many days with the wind blowing at 20 to 30 mph 32 to 48 kmh and afternoon gusts can produce periods of blowing sand and dust in may the winds tend to subside the summer heat is relatively tolerable for most because of low humidity except for some days during the north american monsoon there are 27 days of 100 °f 38 °c highs annually mostly in june and july and rarely in august due in part to the monsoon an average 60 days see 90 °f 32 °c highs fall sees less rain than summer though the weather can be more unsettled closer to winter albuquerque averages around 9 inches of snow per winter and experiences several accumulating snow events each season locations in the northeast heights and eastern foothills tend to receive more snowfall due to each regions higher elevation and proximity to the mountains the city was one of several in the region experiencing a severe winter storm on december 28–30 2006 with locations in albuquerque receiving between 105 and 26 inches 27 and 66 cm of snow36 more recently a major winter storm in late february 2015 dropped up to a foot 30 cm of snow on most of the city the mountains and highlands beyond the city create a rain shadow effect due to the drying of air ascending the mountains the city usually receives very little rain or snow averaging 8–9 inches 216 mm of precipitation per year valley and west mesa areas farther from the mountains are drier averaging 6–8 inches of annual precipitation the sandia foothills tend to lift any available moisture enhancing precipitation to about 10–17 inches annually traveling to the west north and east of albuquerque one quickly rises in elevation and leaves the sheltering effect of the valley to enter a noticeably cooler and slightly wetter environment one such area is still considered part of metro albuquerque commonly called the east mountain area it is covered in savannas or woodlands of low juniper and piñon trees reminiscent of the lower parts of the southern rocky mountains which do not actually contact albuquerque proper most rain occurs during
