described his efforts to fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the internet business boom during that time15 in 1994 bezos left his employment as vicepresident of d e shaw co a wall street firm and moved to seattle washington he began to work on a business plan16 for what would eventually become amazoncom on july 5 1994 bezos incorporated the company as cadabra inc17 bezos changed the name to amazoncom inc a few months later after a lawyer misheard its original name as cadaver18 in september 1994 bezos purchased the url relentlesscom and briefly considered naming his online store relentless but friends told him the name sounded a bit sinister the domain is still owned by bezos and still redirects to the retailer1920 the company went online as amazoncom in 199521 bezos selected the name amazon by looking through the dictionary he settled on amazon because it was a place that was exotic and different just as he had envisioned for his internet enterprise the amazon river he noted was the biggest river in the world and he planned to make his store the biggest in the world21 bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand and told a reporter theres nothing about our model that cant be copied over time but you know mcdonalds got copied and it still built a huge multibilliondollar company a lot of it comes down to the brand name brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world22 additionally a name beginning with a was preferential due to the probability it would occur at the top of any list that was alphabetizedcitation needed after reading a report about the future of the internet that projected annual web commerce growth at 2300 bezos created a list of 20 products that could be marketed online he narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products which included compact discs computer hardware computer software videos and books bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online due to the large worldwide demand for literature the low price points for books along with the huge number of titles available in print23 amazon was founded in the garage of bezos home in bellevue washington24 the company began as an online bookstore which was an idea spurred off with a discussion with john ingram of ingram book now called ingram content group along with keyur patel who still holds a stake in amazon25 amazon was able to access books at wholesale from ingram in the first two months of business amazon sold to all 50 states and over 45 countries within two months amazons sales were up to 20000week26 while the largest brick and mortar bookstores and mail order catalogs might offer 200000 titles an online bookstore could carry several times more since

reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the longterm when the dotcom bubble burst at the start of the 21st century and destroyed many ecompanies in the process amazon survived and grew on past the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales the company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001 5 million ie 1¢ per share on

did not collect any sale taxes in the us state and local sales taxes are levied by state and local governments not at the federal level in most countries where amazon operates a sales tax or value added tax is uniform throughout the country and amazon is obliged to collect it from all customers proponents of forcing amazoncom to collect sales tax—at least in states where it maintains a physical presence—argue the corporation wields an anticompetitive advantage over storefront businesses forced to collect sales tax138 many us states in the 21st century have passed online shopping sales tax laws designed to compel amazoncom and other ecommerce retailers to collect state and local sales taxes from its customers amazoncom originally collected sales tax only from five states as of 2011 but

a covert investigation at the distribution center of amazon in the town of bad hersfeld in the german state of hessen the report highlights the behavior of some of the security guards themselves being employed by a third party company who apparently either had a neonazi background or deliberately dressed in neonazi apparel and who were intimidating foreign and temporary female workers at its distribution centers the third party security company involved was delisted by amazon as a business contact shortly after that report145146147148149 in march 2015 it was reported in the verge that amazon will be removing 18 months long noncompete clauses from its us employment contracts for hourlypaid workers after criticism that it was acting unreasonably in preventing such employees from
