management teams at the crc are operational seven days a week12 in may 2017 ubisoft announced that they had changed their logo to a simplistic minimalistic version of the former representation13 potential takeover by vivendi since around 2015 the french mass media company vivendi has been seeking to expand its media properties through acquisitions and other business deals in addition to advertising firm havas ubisoft was one of the first target properties identified by vivendi which as of september 2017 has an estimated valuation of 64 billion1415 vivendi in two separate actions during october 2015 bought shares in ubisoft stock giving them a 104 stake in ubisoft an action that yves guillemot considered unwelcome and feared a hostile takeover16 in a presentation during the electronic entertainment expo 2016 yves guillemot stressed the importance that ubisoft remain an independent company to maintain its creative freedom17 vivendi also acquired stake in mobile game publisher gameloft also owned by the guillemots at the same time it started acquiring ubisoft shares1816 in the following february vivendi acquired €500 million worth of shares in gameloft gaining more than 30 of the shares and requiring the company under french law to make a public tender offer this action enabled vivendi to complete the hostile takeover of gameloft by june 2016192021 following vivendis actions with gameloft in february 2016 the guillemots asked for more canadian investors in the following february to fend off a similar vivendi takeover222324 by this point vivendi had increased their share in ubisoft to 15 exceeding the estimated 9 that the guillemots owned2022 by midjune 2016 vivendi had increased its shares to 201 but denied it was in the process of a takeover25 by the time of ubisofts annual board meeting in september 2016 vivendi has gained 23 of the shares while guillemots were able to increase their voting share to 20 a request was made at the board meeting to place vivendi representatives on ubisofts board given the size of their share holdings the guillemots argued strongly against this reiterating that vivendi should be seen as a competitor and succeeded in swaying other voting members to deny any board seats to vivendi26 vivendi continued to buy shares in ubisoft approaching the 30 mark that could trigger a hostile takeover as of december 2016 vivendi held a 2715 stake in ubisoft27 reuters reported in april 2017 that vivendis takeover of ubisoft would likely happen that year14 and bloomberg businessweek observed that some of vivendis shares would reach the twoyear holding mark which would grant them double voting power and would likely meet or exceed the 30 threshold28 the guillemot family has since raised their stake in ubisoft as of june 2017 the family now held 136 percent of ubisofts share capital and 2002 percent of the companys voting rights29 in october 2017 ubisoft announced it reached a deal with an investment services provider to help them purchase back 4 million shares by the end of the year preventing others specifically vivendi from buying these30 subsidiaries main article list of ubisoft

whole or rewrite the material december 2016 ubisoft had for a time used the controversial starforce copy protection technology that installs drivers on a system and is known to cause hardware and compatibility issues with certain operating systems on 14 april 2006 ubisoft confirmed that they would stop using starforce on their games citing complaints from customers39 in august 2008 ubisoft was criticized by an antiwar group for its role as a developer of propaganda and recruitment tools for the us department of defense40 in january 2010 ubisoft announced the online services platform uplay which forces customers to not only authenticate on the first game launch but to remain online continually while playing with the game even pausing if network connection is lost this makes it impossible to play the game offline to resell it and meaning that should ubisofts servers go down the game will be unplayable in 2010 review versions of assassins creed ii and settlers 7 for the pc contained this new drm scheme confirming that it is already in use and that instead of pausing the game it would discard all progress since the last checkpoint or save game41 however subsequent patches for assassins creed ii allow the player to continue playing once their connection has been restored without lost progress42 in march 2010 outages to the ubisoft drm servers were reported causing about 5 of legitimate buyers to be unable to play assassins creed ii and silent hunter 54344 ubisoft initially announced this was the result of the number of users attempting to access their servers to play but later claimed that the real cause of the outages were denialofservice attacks4344 in august 2011 ubisoft released from dust with drm protection contrary to previous statements that the game would not have any drm related restrictions after several months the drm had still not been removed from copies of the game45 in the february 2008 issue of electronic gaming monthly editorinchief dan egmshoe hsu asserted that ubisoft had ceased to provide ubisoft titles to egm for coverage purposes as a result of prior critical previews and negative reviews4647 yves guillemot the ceo of ubisoft was quoted in the companys thirdquarter 2008–09 sales report as saying as some of our games did not meet the required quality levels to achieve their full potential they need more sales promotions than anticipated48 the companys use of aaron priceman also known as mr caffeine by the internet as a spokesman at e3 2011 was criticized for his reliance on popular internet references inability to pronounce tom clancy he pronounced it tom culancy sexual innuendos and imitations of video game sound effects with little to no response from the audience49 on 2 july 2013 ubisoft announced a major breach in its network resulting in the potential exposure of up to 58 million accounts including usernames email address and encrypted passwords although the firm denied any creditdebit card information could have been compromised it issued directives to all registered users to change their account passwords and also recommended updating passwords on any other website or service where a same or similar password had been used50 all the users who registered were emailed by the ubisoft company about the breach and a password change request ubisoft promised to keep the information safe51 after revealing assassins creed unity at electronic entertainment expo 2014 ubisoft came in for criticism from the gaming community shortly after revealing that the game would not support female characters in coop gameplay the criticism was inflamed after they explained the absence of a female coop or playable character in far cry 4 according to ubisoft montreal they were close to making it possible when the decision was taken that they didnt have the right animations for a female character52 among the responses were comments from developers that the explanations given were not valid among them were the fact that the protagonists of assassins creed iii and its spinoff game liberation shared a large amount of movement animations there were also statements that characters in video games tended to move in a similar fashion regardless of gender53 an animation director for assassins creed iii also said that the stated reasons of workload and animation replacement didnt hold up saying that it would be a day or twos work to create a female character model52 lawsuits in 2008 ubisoft sued optical experts manufacturing oem a dvd duplication company for 25 million plus damages for the leak and distribution of the pc version of assassins creed the lawsuit claims that oem did not take proper measures to protect its product as stated in its contract with ubisoft the complaint also alleges that oem admitted to all the problems in the complaint54 in april 2012 ubisoft was sued by the author of the book link john l beiswenger who alleged a copyright infringement for using his ideas in the assassins creed franchise and demanding 525 million in damages and wanted to stop the release of assassins creed iii that was set to be released in october 2012 along with any future games that allegedly contain his ideas55 on 30 may 2012 beiswenger dropped the lawsuit beiswenger was later quoted as saying he believes authors should vigorously defend their rights in their creative works and suggested that ubisofts motion to block future lawsuits from beiswenger hints at their guilt56 in december 2014 ubisoft offered a free game from their catalog of recently released titles to compensate the season pass owners of assassins creed unity due to its buggy launch the terms offered with the free game revoked the users right to sue ubisoft for releasing an unfinished
