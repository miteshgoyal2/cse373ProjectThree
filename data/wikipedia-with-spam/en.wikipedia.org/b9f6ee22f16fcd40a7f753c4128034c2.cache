to enforce the 1972 biological weapons convention us officials led by bolton argued that the plan would have put us national security at risk by allowing spot inspections of suspected us weapons sites

bustani head of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw and to have orchestrated his removal at a special session of the organization42 the united nations highest administrative

– in may 2000 and in 2001 was praised for his leadership by colin powell43 he also pushed for reduced funding for the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program to halt the proliferation of

destruction and in materials for use in building nuclear weapons45 diplomacyedit according to an article in the new republic bolton was highly successful in pushing his agenda but his bluntness has won him many enemies irans foreign ministry has called bolton rude and undiplomatic46 in response to critics bolton states that his record demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position its like the palestinians having to negotiate with israeli prime minister ariel sharon if you have a deal you know you have a deal an anonymous official told cnn47 he also won widespread praise for his work establishing the proliferation security initiative48 a voluntary agreement supported by 60 countries49 bolton spawned controversy when in a 2003 speech cleared by the state department50 he described north korean leader kim jongil as a tyrannical dictator and saying that for north koreans under kims rule life is a hellish nightmare51 in response a north korean spokesman said such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks52 congressional democrats argued that boltons words at the time were undiplomatic and endangered the talks bolton later wrote that he had been looking for a hammer to shatter the clinton administrations 1994 agreed framework with north korea an implement he found when the countrys uranium enrichment program came to light53 critics argued that boltons record of allegedly politicizing intelligence would harm us credibility with the united nations54 president bush said he wanted john bolton because he can get the job done at the united nations55 bolton recalls that his happiest moment at state was personally unsigning the rome statute which had set up the international criminal court56 criticismedit in 2002 bolton accused cuba of transfers of biological weapons technology to rogue states and called on it to fully comply with all of its obligations under the biological weapons convention57 according to a scripps howard news service article bolton wanted to say that cuba had a biological weapons capacity and that it was exporting it to other nations the intelligence analysts seemed to want to limit the assessment to a declaration that cuba could develop such weapons58 according to alternet bolton attempted to have the chief bioweapons analyst in the state departments bureau of intelligence and research and the cias national intelligence officer for latin america reassigned under oath at his senate hearings for confirmation as ambassador he denied trying to have the men fired but seven intelligence officials contradicted him44 ultimately intelligence officials refused to allow bolton to make the harsh criticism of cuba he sought to deliver58 and were able to keep their positions bolton claims that the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers who did not work under him behaved unprofessionally59 democratic congressman henry waxman alleged that bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of statement that british intelligence had determined iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from niger in bushs 2003 state of the union address60 these statements were claimed by critics of the president to be partly based on documents found to be forged61 waxmans allegations could not be confirmed as they were based on classified documents60 bolton stated in june 2004 congressional testimony that iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination another unmistakable indicator of irans intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to the iaea when evidence of uranium enriched to 36 percent was found it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts however later isotope analysis supported iran’s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium62 at their august 2005 meeting the iaeas board of governors concluded based on the information currently available to the agency the results of that analysis tend on balance to support iran’s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed highly enriched uranium contamination63 bolton wrote a book titled surrender is not an option in it bolton criticizes the bush administration for changing its foreign policy objectives during the start of the administrations second term64 critics allege that bolton tried to spin intelligence to support his views and political objectives on a number of occasions greg thielmann of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research inr was assigned as the daily intelligence liaison to bolton thielmann stated to seymour hersh that bolton seemed troubled because inr was not telling him what he wanted to hear i was intercepted at the door of his office and told the under secretary doesnt need you to attend this meeting anymore according to former coworkers bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from secretary of state colin powell on multiple occasions and from powells successor condoleezza rice on at least one occasion65 in 2006 a former politician from swedens liberal party who a quarter of a century earlier had been the party chairman but since had left the stage of active politics nominated bolton for the nobel peace prize66 technically almost anyone can file such a nomination and there was no indication that the nobel committee had pondered the name of bolton the prize that year went to muhammad yunus and grameen bank for advancing economic and social opportunities for the poor especially women through their pioneering microcredit work67 on may 28 2008 at the hay festival of literature arts in hayonwye wales the british activist george monbiot attempted to make a citizens arrest of bolton for his role as an architect of the iraq war the attempt was unsuccessful and monbiot was ejected by security personnel68 in june 2011 bolton dismissed palestinian claims to statehood as a ploy69 in july 2013 bolton was identified as a key member of groundswell a secretive coalition of right wing activists and journalists attempting to make political change behind the scenes through lobbying of highlevel contacts70 permanent representative to the united nationsedit president george w bush announces the nomination of bolton as the us ambassador to un as secretary of state condoleezza rice looks on on march 7 2005 bolton was nominated to the post of us ambassador to the united nations by president george w bush as a result of a democratic filibuster he was recessappointed to the post on august 1 2005 boltons nomination received strong support from republicans but faced heavy opposition from democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the united nations holding a 10–8 majority in the senate foreign relations committee tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees the republican leadership hoped to send boltons nomination to the full senate with a positive recommendation concern among some republicans on the committee however prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation in the full senate republican support for the nomination remained uncertain with the most vocal republican critic ohio senator george v voinovich circulating a letter urging his republican colleagues to oppose the nomination71 democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature given the resistance of the white house to share classified documents related to boltons alleged actions the republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate but because a supermajority of 60 votes is needed to end debate the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a 55–44 majority in the body an earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the democrats to relate only to judicial nominees72 not ambassadorships although the leader of the effort sen john mccain said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees on november 9 2006 bush only days after losing both houses to a democratic majority sent the nomination73 for bolton to continue as representative for the united states at the un74 he said i believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences and i believe we will be able to work through differences i reassured the house and senate leaders that i intend to work with the new congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country75 views on the united nationsedit ambassador bolton

structures convocation hosted by the world federalist association now citizens for global solutions he stated there is no united nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and thats the united states when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along76 he also stated that the secretariat building in new york has 38 stories if you lost ten stories today it wouldnt make a bit of difference77 both boltons opponents78 and his supporters79 have used the same video of his remarks at the 1994 event in support of their points of view when pressed on the statement during the confirmation process he responded theres not a bureaucracy in the world that couldnt be made leaner80 in a paper on us participation in the un bolton stated the united nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of american foreign policy81 bolton was also one of the signers of the january 26 1998 pnac letter sent to president bill clinton urging him to remove saddam hussein from power using us diplomatic political and military power82 the november 15 2005 washington times article can the us find a substitute for the un noted that bolton advocates a revolution of reform at the un specifically he called for the five permanent members of the un security council to work more closely to craft powerful resolutions and make sure they are enforced and to address the underlying causes of conflicts rather than turning them over to the secretariat and special envoys a focus on administrative skills in choosing the next secretarygeneral and a more credible and responsible human rights commission bolton noted that the us had the option of relying on regional or other international organizations to advance its goals if the un proves inadequate83 2005 nomination senate confirmation hearingsedit day 1edit on april 11 2005 the senate foreign relations committee reviewed boltons qualifications bolton said that he and his colleagues view the un as an important component of our diplomacy and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths84 echoing secretary of state condoleezza rice words from a month earlier85 republican committee chairman richard lugar of indiana criticized bolton for ignoring the policy consequences of his statements saying diplomatic speech should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the us public opinion or to validate a personal point of view86 the committees top democrat joe biden of delaware compared sending bolton to the un to sending a bull into a china shop and expressed grave concern about boltons diplomatic temperament and his record in my judgment your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful biden said87 republican senator george allen of virginia said that bolton had the experience knowledge background and the right principles to come into the united nations at this time calling him the absolute perfect person for the job88 russ feingold a democrat on the committee from wisconsin asked bolton about what he would have done had the rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the united nations and criticized his answer – which focused on logistics – as amazingly passive89 according to newsday lincoln chafee then a republican from rhode island may be pivotal for boltons nomination90 his initial remarks were cautiously favorable you said all the right things in your opening statement chafee stated that he would probably support bolton unless something surprising shows up according to an associated press story on the hearing three protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings standing up in succession with pink tshirts and banners one reading diplomat for hire no bully please these protesters were part of a group advocating representation in the senate for residents of the district of columbia that is known for such demonstrations at a variety of hearings91 day 2edit on april 12 2005 the senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that bolton pressured intelligence analysts calling bolton a serial abuser former state department intelligence chief carl w ford jr said ive never seen anybody quite like secretary bolton i dont have a second third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people ford contradicted boltons earlier testimony saying i had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done ford also characterized bolton as a kissup kickdown sort of guy implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him while having very little regard for people working under him92 lugar who criticized bolton at his april 11 hearing said that the paramount issue was supporting bushs nominee he conceded that bluntness may be required even though it is not very good diplomacy93 chafee the key member for boltons approval said that the bar is very high for rejecting the presidents nominees suggesting that bolton would make it to the senate94 erosion of republican supportedit wikinews

nomination until may the debate concerning his nomination raged in the senate prior to the memorial day recess two other republicans on the foreign relations committee chafee and chuck hagel also expressed serious concerns about the bolton nomination95 asked on april 20 if he was now less inclined to support the nomination chafee said that would be accurate he further elaborated that boltons prospects were hard to predict but said he expected that the administration is really going to put some pressure on senator voinovich then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations95 on april 20 it emerged that melody townsel a former usaid contractor had reported to the senate foreign relations committee that bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in moscow townsels encounter with bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for usaid ibtci townsel told the senate foreign relations committee staff that bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight among other workplace improprieties in an official interview with senate foreign

an employee of young rubicam at the time of her encounter with bolton continued working for the company on a variety of other usaid projects on april 22 the new york times and other media alleged that boltons former boss colin powell was personally opposed to the nomination and had been in personal contact with chafee and hagel the same day reuters reported that a spokesman for senator lisa murkowski ralaska said that the senator felt the committee did the right thing delaying the vote on bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee96 on april 28 the guardian

gained access to 10 intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that bolton opposed97 however rich lowry pointed out that during the same fouryear period other state department officials made roughly 400 similar requests98 also on may 11 newsweek reported allegations that the american position at the 7th review conference in may 200599 of the nuclear proliferation treaty had been undercut by boltons absence without leave during the nomination fight quoting anonymous sources close to the negotiations100 the democrats filibusteredit on may 26 2005 senate democrats postponed the vote on boltons un nomination the republican leadership failed to gain enough support to pass a cloture motion on the floor debate over bolton and minority leader harry reid conceded the move signaled the first filibuster of the year the democrats claimed that key documents regarding bolton and his career at the department of state were being withheld by the bush administration scott mcclellan white house press secretary responded by saying just 72 hours after all the good will and bipartisanship over a deal on judicial nominees its disappointing to see the democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach101 the failure of the senate to end debate on boltons nomination provided one surprise for some senate majority leader bill frist rtn voted against cloture for procedural reasons so that he could bring up a cloture vote in the future102 although voinovich once spoke against confirming bolton he voted for cloture senator john thune rsd voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against bolton in the upordown vote as a protest against the governments plans to close a military base ellsworth in his home state on june 20 2005 the senate voted again on cloture the vote failed 54–38 six votes short of ending debate that marked an increase of two no votes including the defection of voinovich who switched his previous yes vote and urged president bush to pick another nominee democrats mark pryor mary landrieu and ben nelson voted to end debate both times on june 21 frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless but later that day following a lunch at the white house changed his position saying that he would continue to push for an upordown votecitation needed voinovich later recanted his opposition and stated that if bolton were renominated he would have supported the nomination103 accusations of false statementedit on july 28 2005 it was revealed that a statement made by bolton on forms submitted to the senate was false bolton indicated that in the prior five years he had not been questioned in any investigation but in fact he had been interviewed by the state departments inspector general as part of an investigation into the sources of prewar claims of weapons of mass destruction in iraq after insisting for weeks that bolton had testified truthfully on the form the state department reversed itself stating that bolton had simply forgotten about the investigation104 recess appointmentedit wikinews has related news bush likely to appoint bolton during congressional recess bush appoints john bolton united states ambassador to the united nations on august 1 2005 bush officially made a recess appointment of bolton installing him as permanent us representative to the un a recess appointment lasts until the next session of congress ends or until the individual is renominated and confirmed by the senate during the announcement bush said this post is too important to leave vacant any longer especially during a war and a vital debate about un reform105 democrats criticized the appointment and senator christopher dodd dct of the senate foreign relations committee said bolton would lack credibility in the un because he lacked senate confirmation106 un secretarygeneral kofi annan welcomed mr bolton but told reporters that the new ambassador should consult with others as the administration continued to press for changes at the united nations107 term at the unedit the economist called bolton the most controversial ambassador ever sent by america to the united nations some colleagues in the un appreciated the goals bolton was trying to achieve but not his abrasive style108109 the new york times in its editorial the shame of the united nations praised boltons stance on reforming the disgraceful united nations human rights commission110 saying john bolton is right secretarygeneral kofi annan is wrong the times also said that the commission at that time was composed of some of the worlds most abusive regimes who used their membership as cover to continue their abusiveness bolton also opposed the proposed replacement for the human rights commission the un human rights council as not going far enough for reform

109th congress112 voinovich who had previously stood in opposition to bolton had amended his views and determined that bolton was doing a good job as un ambassador in february 2006 he said i spend a lot of time with john on the phone i think he is really working very constructively to move forward113 over the summer and during the fall election campaign no action was taken on the nomination because chafee who was in a difficult reelection campaign blocked a senate foreign relations committee votecitation needed without his concurrence the sfrc would have been deadlocked 9–9 and the nomination could not have gone to the senate floor for a full vote bush formally resubmitted the nomination on november 9 2006 immediately following a midterm election that would give control of the 110th congress to the democratic party114 chafee who had just lost his reelection bid issued a statement saying he would vote against recommending bolton for a senate vote citing what he considered to be a mandate from the recent election results on tuesday the american people sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with the foreign policy approach of the bush administration to confirm mr bolton to the position of un ambassador would fly in the face of the clear consensus of the country that a new direction is called for115 on december 4 2006 bolton announced that he would terminate his work as us representative to the un at the end of the recess appointment and would not continue to seek confirmation116 his letter of resignation from the bush administration was accepted on december 4 2006

press secretary dana perino told cbs news it is not a resignation121 the actual language of the presidents written acceptance was it is with deep regret that i accept john bolton’s decision to end his service in the administration as permanent representative of the united states to the united nations when his commission expires however at press conference the president said i received the resignation of ambassador john bolton i accept it im not happy about it i think he deserved to be confirmed120 some news organizations subsequently altered their language to phrases such as to step

than there is consider this analogy if you were around in the 1920s and somebody said my god vladimir lenin is dead the bolsheviks will never recover from this so while alawlakis death is significant i would not read cosmic consequences into it130 john bolton caused a controversy on december 17 2012 when he claimed on greta van susterens show on fox news that secretary of state hillary clinton faked a concussion to avoid testifying before congress regarding the attack on the us consulate in benghazi libya on september 11 2012 that killed four americans including the sitting ambassador bolton stated when you don’t want to go to a meeting or conference or an event you have a diplomatic illness and this is a diplomatic illness to beat the band131 in 2010 he wrote a foreword for the book the postamerican presidency the obama administration’s war on america while maintaining close relations with its authors farright conservative bloggers activists and commentators pamela geller and robert spencer132 bolton endorsed their book writing133 this book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of barack obama as our first postamerican president what it recounts is disturbing and its broader implications are more disturbing still peoples mujahedin of iranedit bolton has spoken in favor of the peoples mujahedin of iran also known as the mujahedine khalq or mek134 an armed islamic group with marxist leanings135 which has long been on the us state department list of foreign terrorist organizations136 according to the state department the mek follows a philosophy that mixes marxism and islam136 in the 1970s mek members who had been trained by the soviet union in guerilla warfare and supported khomeini assassinated us military officers then working in iran mek members actively took part in the 1979 seizure of the us embassy in tehran according to a us government report137 according to conservative activist kenneth timmerman executive director of the foundation for democracy in iran iranianamericans openly refer to mek leader massoud rajavi as the pol pot of iran because they believe he would conduct wholesale massacres of his political opponents137 on january 25 2011 bolton drew a standing ovation at a mek conference in brussels for his support of the mek giving a speech in which he backed mek’s legitimacy and the notion of removing it from the list of terrorist organizations138 georgetown law professor david d cole has pointed out that the united states government has labeled the mujahedeen khalq a foreign terrorist organization making it a crime to provide it directly or indirectly with any material support including engaging in public advocacy to challenge a group’s terrorist designation under the supreme courts 2010 decision in holder v humanitarian law project139 however the mek were later removed from the terrorist list in both europe in 2009 and the usa in 2012140141 presidential considerationedit 2012edit john bolton speaking at the 2015 conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland on february 27 2015 bolton considered running for president in the 2012 us presidential election he had received attention in conservative circles including the cover of the december 31 2010 issue of national review magazine he told politico as i survey the situation i think the republican field is wide open i dont think the partys anywhere close to a decision and stranger things have happened for example inexperienced senators from illinois have gotten presidential nominations142 in an interview with national review bolton said individual liberty is the whole purpose of political life and i thought it was threatened back then and i write i give speeches i appear on televisionbut the only way in contemporary american circumstances to make those issues as salient as they should be is to run for president143 in an interview with the daily caller bolton said im obviously not a politician ive never run for any federal elective office at all and you know it is something that would obviously require a great deal of effort130 on tuesday september 6 2011 bolton announced on the fox news show on the record with greta van susteren that he would not run for president of the united states in 2012144 republican presidentialhopeful newt gingrich said that he would ask bolton to serve as his secretary of state145 on january 11 2012 bolton endorsed mitt romney for the 2012 republican nomination146 2016edit bolton considered running in the 2016 us presidential election in an interview with national review robert costa wrote the following quoting bolton he wants to be president of the united states or at the very least a provocative contender for the republican nomination in 2016 my hypothesis is that voters are practical and they care more about national security than the media seems to believe i think right now especially after two terms of president obama they want a president who has the knowhow to lead during a crisis a president who can defend our national interests he says147 after expressing interest in running for president bolton ultimately ruled himself out on may 14 2015 in a video message posted from twitter148 on wednesday september 30 2015 freedom capital investment management appointed bolton as a senior advisor to oversee the firm on international security financial and political risks149 possible trump administration positionedit in an interview with conservative radio host hugh hewitt during the 2016 us presidential campaign republican nominee donald trump named bolton as a possible choice for secretary of state appearing on fox news fox and friends on december 1 2016 bolton admitted he was being considered as a secretary of state candidate for the incoming trump administration150151 several trump associates claim bolton was not chosen in part due to trumps disdain for boltons signature mustache152 the evening of december 10 the bbc cited nbc reports that sources close to mr trump were saying that mr tillerson is likely to be named next week and that former un ambassador john bolton will serve as his deputy153 bolton has supported theories about the health of hillary clinton and about hillary clinton aide huma abedin and in december 2016 bolton stated that the conclusion of the united states intelligence community that russian hackers intervened to help elect donald trump in 2016 may have been a “false flag” operation154 however bolton changed his stance later in the month to support the conclusion that the russian government was involved in hacking the us presidential election in a subsequent interview on fox news bolton criticized the obama administrations retaliatory sanctions as insufficient and suggest that the us response should make them the russians feel pain155156 president trump interviewed bolton and three others to determine who to fill the position of national security advisor vacated by lt gen michael t flynn157158 the position ultimately went to h r mcmaster159 trump made a point on monday of praising mr bolton and saying that he would find a position for him in his administration eventually160 referencesedit jennifer senior january 1 2006 bolton in a china shop new york  white house announces john boltons resignation international herald
