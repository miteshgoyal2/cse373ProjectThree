as the us was preparing to host the fifa world cup more than 30 cities were pursuing the rights to an mls team seattle being among them5 however despite the strong soccer fan base in seattle the absence of a socceronly stadium was a drawback to establishing an mls team6 cities seeking consideration for an inaugural mls team were also expected to secure 10000 assurances from fans for season tickets5 by the june 3 1994 deadline for mls team bids seattle organizers had secured fewer than 1500 such assurances7 these low numbers were a result of competition between the ticket campaign for the mls expansion team and for the american professional soccer league apsl sounders expansion team8 in a june 14 1994 announcement seattle was not included among the first seven cities to be awarded an mls team4 five more teams were to be announced later in the year and to improve their chances this time seattle mls organizers began working with the university of washington to secure use of husky
