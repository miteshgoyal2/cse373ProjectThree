arrived in puget sound circa 1889 from canada intending to establish themselves in the shinglemaking trade they opened a shingle mill on the northern shore of lake washington on land leased from watson c squire by 1903 kenmore had established a school system and post office6 but it did not formally incorporate as a city until august 31 19987 country living lumber gardeners nudists and boozeedit despite cargo railway service passing through the area as early as 1887 via the seattle lake shore and eastern railway most access to the city in its early days was by boat with regular ferry service to seattle bothell and woodinville starting in 1906 the city later gained a passenger railroad stop the first improved road connection to seattle and bothell—the red brick road—opened between 1913 and 1914 with bus service following the laying of the bricks as a result kenmore became a country retreat for weekend gardeners with local landowners selling off clearcut garden plots to seattlites with automobiles and green thumbs it attracted at least two shortlived nudist camps during the 1920s far more striking however was the impact of prohibition kenmore quickly became famous in seattle for its fine country dining and more importantly its fine country drinking as a substantial illegal alcohol industry developed to meet the demands of jazz age seattle nightlife although relatively close to seattle proper—thanks to bothell ways status as one of the few improved roads then heading north from downtown— it was nonetheless far enough out that department of revenue officers could for the most part ignore it the blind pig a roadhouse on shuters landing at lake washington was probably the most famous of the kenmore speakeasys at the lakeside its illegal hooch could be dumped into the lake quickly and easily should it become necessary few people were fooled the name itself was in fact a wellknown slang term meaning speakeasy but despite its notoriety the pig was not even the citys most infamous saloon routine violence and fistfights at the inglewood tavern earned that establishment an alternative name the bucket of blood this archipelago of dining and entertainment over 30 different restaurants dance halls bars and clubs in a threeblock area remained a major part of kenmores identity through the 1940s voucherville the cold war and redevelopmentedit once the great depression hit kenmore became home for a small settlement of workers under president franklin d roosevelts back to the land program paid by the works progress administration a small number of workers settled in an area of northwestern kenmore which became known as voucherville after the vouchers the wpa paid in lieu of a cash salary after the end of world war ii kenmore became home to us army nike hercules missile batteries as part of coldwar era defense plans these nucleartipped antiaircraft missiles were intended to protect seattle and environs from soviet bombers should war break out they were removed in 19748 the postwar era largely transformed downtown kenmore air harbor which today is one of the worlds largest seaplaneonly airports opened not far from the old location of the blind pig kenmore air itself today runs a fleet of seaplanes serving waterside destinations throughout cascadia at the same time kenmores immediate proximity to seattle—just two miles 3 km north of modern seattle city limits— made it an early target of postwar housing development the first plaits in the new uplake neighborhood were sold in 1954 housing development continued throughout the kenmore area for the next several decades mostly following the postwar suburban model industrial and commercial growth followed quickly behind and within a few decades most of the old kenmore dining and drinking had vanished replaced by shopping centers industrial development and housing however one part of this new development brought its own history along with it the jewel box building in downtown kenmore is a seattle worlds fair artifact moved from seattle center to kenmore after the end of the fair in october 1962 the city gained its first college in 1996 with the relocation of bastyr university from seattle onto the grounds of the former st edward seminary incorporation and rebuilding downtownedit kenmore residents considered incorporation many times since the towns founding one such incorporation vote failed in 19549 the idea gained popular support through the 1990s however partly in response to the passage of the washington state growth management act of 1990 formation of an exploration committee in 1995 led to a successful public vote shortly thereafter and the city formally incorporated on august 31 1998 97 years after its original founding following incorporation the new government set about devising a local set of zoning codes and a downtown development plan with the intent of reviving and rebuilding the traditional core areas of the city a significant component of this plan involves extensive use of land now owned by the city in the area known within the plan as the northwest quadrant an open invitation was extended to all architects and developers to submit development plans for this newly available area in december 2005 the city council chose to negotiate primarily with kenmore partners llc in april 2006 design plans were submitted to the city the following summer with a conceptual overview made available to the public at the same time10 kenmores oldest roads now known most often by their countyassigned number systems originally had more traditional names such as cats whiskers road 61st avenue ne squire boulevard later red brick road now bothell waysr 522 and remington drive ne 181st street these

incorporated in 1998 one of the early actions by the first city council was to put a moratorium on cardrooms enacted in 199919 cardrooms are mini casinos that have card games such as blackjack and allow bets under 100 there had been only one cardroom in kenmore—the 11th frame restaurant and lounge at kenmore lanes the 11th frame has been in operation since the 1970s and it along with kenmore lanes generates the most tax revenue of any business in kenmore in march 2003 the city council put a ban on new cardrooms but grandfathered the 11th frame in october of that year len griesel a kenmore businessman and commercial property owner challenged the ban in court in november the city council removed the ban against new cardrooms and reinstated the moratorium19 in september 2004 the issue was put before kenmore voters as proposition 1 proposed ban of card rooms 20 proposition 1 asked shall the city of kenmore ban such “social card games” the proposition failed but the city council did not lift the moratorium21 in december 2004 as part of the lawsuit brought by len griesel king county superior court judge terry lukens overturned the moratorium and gave the council until the end of june 2005 to allow or ban all gambling in june 2005 the city council did not have enough votes to enact a ban on cardrooms22 despite the fact that cardrooms were now open to new business len griesel did not apply for a cardroom license the 2005 council elections focused in part on whether the city should adopt a ban on cardrooms several candidates stated their positions that a cardroom ban would be key to any successful attempt to rebuild kenmores downtown core23 immediately after the election in december 2005 the council voted to ban cardrooms24 at that time the 11th frame filed a lawsuit against the city in federal court in august 2006 the lawsuit was dismissed on the grounds that gambling was not a vested right an appeal was filed in the ninth circuit court that case was decided may
