roman catholics from the state of goa in western india where his father was an executive of johnson johnson and his mother was a housewife1617 dsouza attended the jesuit st stanislaus high school in bombay18 he graduated in 1976 and completed his 11th and 12th years at sydenham college also in bombay19 in 1978 dsouza traveled to the united states under the rotary youth exchange and attended the local public school in patagonia arizona he went on to matriculate at dartmouth college where he graduated with a bachelor of arts in english in 1983 and was a member of phi beta kappa2021 while at dartmouth dsouza wrote for the dartmouth review an independent publication not affiliated with dartmouth college subsidized by alumni and edited by students22 after graduating from dartmouth dsouza became the editor of a monthly journal called the prospect a publication financed by a group of princeton university alumni the paper and its writers ignited much controversy during dsouzas editorship by among other things criticizing the colleges affirmative action policies23 from 1985 to 1987 dsouza was a contributing editor for policy review a journal then published by the heritage foundation in washington dc in a september 1985 article the bishops as pawns dsouza theorized that catholic bishops in the united states were being manipulated by american liberals in agreeing to oppose the us military buildup and use of power abroad when dsouza believed they knew very little about these subjects to which they were lending their religious credibility interviews with these bishops suggest that they know little or nothing about the ideas and proposals to which they are putting their signature and lending their religious authority the bishops are unfamiliar with existing defense and economic programs unable to identify even in general terms the soviet military capability ignorant of roughly how much of the budget currently goes to defense unclear about how much should be reallocated to social programs and innocent of the most basic concepts underlying the intelligent laymans discussion of these questions24 he was a policy adviser in the administration of president ronald reagan between 1987 and 19881 in 1991 dsouza became a naturalized united states citizen25 political adviser and commentator president of the kings college in august 2010 dsouza was named president of the kings college a christian liberal arts college then housed in the empire state building in manhattan26 the college relocated to a larger space in fall 2012 next door to the new york stock exchange in lower manhattans financial district27 on october 18 2012 dsouza resigned his post at the kings college following a press report that he had shared a hotel room at a christian conference with a woman whom he introduced as his fiancee despite still being married to his wife of twenty years dsouza called the report vicious and worthy of christian condemnation2829 political criticism dinesh dsouza speaking at cpac 2012 dsouza defines conservatism in the american sense as conserving the principles of the american revolution30 in letters to a young conservative written as an introduction to conservative ideas for youth dsouza argues that it is a blend of classical liberalism and ancient virtue in particular the belief that there are moral standards in the universe and that living up to them is the best way to have a full and happy life he also argues against what he calls the modern liberal belief that human nature is intrinsically good and thus that the great conflicts in the world arise out of terrible misunderstandings that can be corrected through ongoing conversation and through the mediation of the united nations31 dsouza opposes government policies based on affirmative action and social welfare in the book illiberal education dsouza argued that intolerance of conservative views is common at many universities he has attributed many modern social problems to what he calls the cultural left in his 2007 book the enemy at home the cultural left and its responsibility for 911 he wrote that the cultural left in this country is responsible for causing 911 the cultural left and its allies in congress the media hollywood the nonprofit sector and the universities are the primary cause of the volcano of anger toward america that is erupting from the islamic world32 in a review of dsouzas 2003 book whats so great about america economist thomas sowell wrote that dsouzas book exposed the fallacies and hypocrisies of various criticisms of the united states by the islamic world domestic multiculturalist cults those who seek reparations for slavery and the worldwide intelligentsia according to sowell perhaps it takes somebody from outside to truly appreciate all the blessings that too many nativeborn americans take for granted dsouza understands how rare—sometimes unique—these blessings are33 sowell also notes that dsouza takes this a step further and challenges the notion that all world cultures are equal d’souza challenges one of the central premises of today’s intelligentsia the equality of all cultures if one begins with the multicultural premise that all cultures are equal then the world as it is makes very little sense he says some cultures have completely outperformed others in providing the things that all people seek—health food housing security and the amenities of life33 dsouza has also been critical of feminism the feminist error was to embrace the value of the workplace as greater than the value of the home feminism has endorsed the public sphere as inherently more constitutive of womens worth than the private sphere feminists have established as their criterion of success and selfworth an equal representation with men at the top of the career ladder the consequence of this feminist scale of values is a terrible and unjust devaluation of women who work at home34 in a 2003 interview he said samesex marriage did not work marriage does not civilize men women do this point is even evident in the gay community it helps to explain why lesbians are generally much better than male homosexuals in sustaining longterm relationships the reason that society privileges marriage and gives it a special legal status is because marriage is the only known incubator for the raising of children35 dsouza has also been labeled a neoconservative36 christianity and religion dsouza attended the evangelical church calvary chapel from 2000 at least until 201037 dsouza says that his catholic background is important to him but he is also comfortable with protestant reformation theology he identifies as a nondenominational christian38 he often writes and discusses christian apologetics and has debated against prominent atheists and critics of christianity including dan barker christopher hitchens39 peter singer40 daniel dennett41 michael shermer david silverman42 and bart d ehrman4344 on religious and moral issues in a christian science monitor article he wrote the moral teachings of jesus provide no support for—indeed they stand as a stern rebuke to—the historical injustices perpetrated in the name of christianity45 dsouza often speaks out against atheism nonbelief and secularism he elaborated his views in his 2007 book whats so great about christianity in 2009 he published life after death the evidence which attempts to use scientific and philosophical arguments to support the concept of the afterlife he also relies on theoretical physics to support the concept of god and the anthropic principle and to refute atheist arguments in 2012 dsouza published godforsaken which addresses questions of how a benevolent god could allow evil and suffering in the worldcitation needed dsouza posits that living creatures are the products of intelligent design but he is not a proponent of the intelligent design movement as he does not consider it to be a satisfactory alternative to the theory of evolution by natural selection46 he argues that belief in the afterlife and in a supreme being are reasonable conclusions given the evidence available and that atheists have misrepresented the case for christianity on many frontscitation needed in a catholic education resource center article he shared his belief on the separation of church and state groups like the aclu with the acquiescence if not collusion of the courts are actively promoting a jurisprudence of antireligious discrimination in a way the supreme court has distorted the constitution to make religious believers of all faiths into secondclass citizens dsouza argues that current jurisprudence unfairly promotes secularism47 more clearly dsouza states today courts wrongly interpret separation of church and state to mean that religion has no place in the public arena or that morality derived from religion should not be permitted to shape our laws somehow freedom for religious expression has become freedom from religious expression secularists want to empty the public square of religion and religiousbased morality so they can monopolize the shared space of society with their own views48 dsouza has also commented on islam he stated in 2007 ive been studying radical islamic thought—specifically the thinkers who have influenced contemporary radical muslims when you read their work you find that there are no denunciations of modernity no condemnations of science no condemnations of freedom in fact their whole argument seems to be that the united states—through our support of secular dictators in the region—is denying muslims freedom and control over their own destiny49 he has debated serge trifkovic50 and robert spencer who both deem islam inherently aggressive racist violent and intolerant he has labelled spencer an islamophobe and an effective polemicist in his writings on islam51 colonialism in the second chapter of whats so great about america dsouza argues that while colonialism was terrible it had the unintended consequence of lifting third world countries up to western civilization dsouza writes i realize that in saying these things i am opening the door for my critics and the incorrigible enemies of the west to say that i am justifying colonialism this is the purest nonsense what i am doing is pointing out a historical fact despite the corrupt and selfserving motives of its practitioners colonialism proved to be the mechanism that brought millions of nonwhite people into the orbit of western freedom he holds up the european colonization of india as an example pointing out that in the long run colonization turned out to be a good thing for india because it introduced western law universities infrastructure and the like while effectively ending human sacrifice the practice of sati and other charming indigenous customs52 abu ghraib dsouza has argued the abu ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal was a result of the sexual immodesty of liberal america he further asserted that the conditions of prisoners at abu ghraib are comparable to the accommodations in midlevel middle eastern hotels 5354 media appearances dsouza has appeared on numerous national television networks and programs55 six days after the september 11 2001 attacks dsouza appeared on politically incorrect hosted by bill maher he disputed the assertion that terrorists were cowards by saying look at what they did you have a whole bunch of guys who were willing to give their life none of them backed out all of them slammed themselves into pieces of concrete these are warriors maher agreed with dsouzas comments and said we have been the cowards lobbing cruise missiles from two thousand miles away56 during an interview on the colbert report on january 16 2007 while promoting his book the enemy at home the cultural left and its responsibility for 911 dsouza maintained that liberals had some responsibility for the september 11 attacks he said liberals penchant for interference had a decided effect in convincing the carter administration to withdraw support from the shah which brought on muslim fundamentalists control of the iranian government he also said that the distorted representation of american culture on television is one source of resentment of the united states by muslims worldwide dsouza believes that traditional muslims are not too different from traditional jews and christians in america towards the end of the interview he admitted that he and islamic militants share some of the same negative beliefs about liberal americans57 authorship in early 2007 dsouza published the enemy at home the cultural left and its responsibility for 911 in which he argues that the american cultural left was in large part responsible for the muslim anger that led to the september 11 attacks32 he argues that muslims do not hate america because of its freedom and democracy but because they perceive america to be imposing its moral depravity support for sexual licentiousness on the world58 dsouzas conclusion is that the george w bush administration and the conservatives must stop promoting american popular culture because it is producing a blowback of muslim rage with a few exceptions the right should not bother to defend american movies music and television from the point of view of traditional values they are indefensible moreover why should the right stand up for the lefts debased values why should our people defend their america rather american conservatives should join the muslims and others in condemning the global moral degeneracy that is produced by liberal values59 the book was criticized in major american newspapers and magazines and described as among other things the worst nonfiction book about terrorism published by a major house since 91160 and a national disgrace61 dsouzas book caused a controversy in the conservative movement his conservative critics widely mocked his thesis that the cultural left was responsible for 911 in response dsouza posted a 6500word essay on national review online62 and nro subsequently published a litany of responses from conservative authors who accused dsouza of character assassination elitism and pseudointellectualism63 also in the summer of 2017 dsouza published a book called the big lie exposing the nazi roots of the american left ironically the book was published two weeks before republican president donald trump referred to participants in a violent neonazi rally in virginia as very fine people dsouza explained the awkward timing by repeating a rumor that one of the rallys organizers was an obama guy64 conservative new york times columnist ross douthat criticized the book saying that it was a pleaforattention by dsouza who had become a hack because d’souza has become a professional deceiver what he adds are extraordinary elisions sweeping calumnies and laughable leaps65 his christian apologetics books whats so great about christianity and life after death the evidence were both on the new york times best seller list6667 opposition to barack obama forbes article and the roots of obamas rage at the conclusion of a september 2010 opinion article in forbes about president barack obama titled how obama thinks dsouza wrote trapped in his fathers time machine incredibly the us is being ruled according to the dreams of a luo tribesman of the 1950s this philandering inebriated african socialist who raged against the world for denying him the realization of his anticolonial ambitions is now setting the nations agenda through the reincarnation of his dreams in his son the son makes it happen but he candidly admits he is only living out his fathers dream the invisible father provides the inspiration and the son dutifully gets the job done america today is governed by a ghost68 dsouzas book the roots of obamas rage of which the forbes article was a condensed version was published in september 2010 by regnery publishing the book presents his interpretation of president obamas past and how it formed his beliefs it was on the new york times best seller list for four weeks in october–november 201069 dsouza appeared on the glenn beck program in september 2010 to discuss some of his theories70 several commentators strongly disputed the assertions about obama made in the book and article including media matters for america which pointed out what it claimed were errors in an article entitled the roots of obamas rage rooted in lies71 ryan chittum in an article in the columbia journalism review described the forbes article as a facttwisting errorladen piece of paranoia … the worst kind of smear journalism—a singularly disgusting work72 some conservative publications criticized dsouzas allegations in obama anticolonial hegemonist daniel larison of the american conservative states dinesh dsouza has authored what may possibly be the most ridiculous piece of obama analysis yet written all in all dsouzas article reads like a bad conspiracy theory73 larison criticizes dsouzas suggestion that obama is antibusiness citing a lack of evidence andrew ferguson of the weekly standard wrote dsouza always sees absence of evidence as evidence of something or other there is indeed a name for the beliefs that motivate president obama but its not anticolonialism its not even socialism its liberalism74 the magazine published dsouzas letter in which he expressed surprise at the petty vindictive tone of andrew fergusons review75 in late february 2017 students at trinity university in san antonio texas stole more than two hundred flyers advertising dsouza planned appearance at the university the first week of march dsouza called the protest pathetic and suggested the demonstrators come out and debate me in the best case you may win in the worst youll learn something twin brothers manfred and jonah wendt cofounders of the student conservative group tigers for liberty had passed around six hundred notices of dsouzas visit to campus those returned by the protesters contained negative comments about dsouza76 2016 obamas america film main article 2016 obamas america dsouza at cpac 2016 in washington dc dsouza wrote and codirected the documentary polemical film 2016 obamas america77 through interviews and reenactments the film compares the similarities in the lives of dsouza and president barack obama dsouza suggested that early influences on obama affected the decisions he made as president the films tagline is love him or hate him you dont know him the film has been criticized on the grounds that what dsouza claims to be an investigation of obama includes considerable projection speculation and selective borrowing from obamas autobiography to prove dsouzas own narrative7879 in a fact check of the film the associated press found that dsouza provided little or no evidence for most of his claims noted that several allegations were factually false and described the films central thesis as almost entirely subjective and a logical stretch at best80 after a limited release beginning july 13 2012 the film expanded to over one thousand theaters in late august 2012 and reached more than two thousand theaters before the end of september 2012 eventually grossing more than 334 million81 it is the fifth highestgrossing documentary in the united states during the last four decades81 and the second highestgrossing political documentary82 the obama administration described the film as an insidious attempt to dishonestly smear the president83 later when dsouza was indicted for violating election law dsouza and his coproducers alleged that he was selectively prosecuted and that the indictment was politically motivated retribution for the success of the antiobama film84 other films america imagine the world without her main article america imagine the world without her in march 2013 dsouza announced work on a documentary film titled america imagine the world without her for release in 201485 america was marketed to political conservatives and through christian marketing firms in america dsouza seeks to portray united states history in a more positive light in contrast to perceived liberal critiques of its history including the theft of native american and mexican lands black slavery contemporary foreign policy and its capitalist system86 the washington times states that dsouza is saying that americans no longer have past heroes like washington lincoln and reagan but we do have us” in “our struggle for the restoration of america”87 lions gate entertainment released america in three theaters on june 27 2014 and expanded its distribution on the weekend of the us holiday independence day on july 4 2014 cinemascore reported that the openingweekend audiences gave the film an a grade8889 the film grossed 144 million which made it the highestgrossing documentary in the united states in 201490 the film review website metacritic surveyed 11 movie critics and assessed 10 reviews as negative and 1 as mixed with none being positive it gave an aggregate score of 15 out of

the hollywood reporters paul bond said the film performed well in its limited theatrical release overcoming several negative reviews in the mainstream media93 bond reported conservatives seem thrilled with the movie93 john fund of national review said the documentary was a response to us progressive critique of the country dsouzas film and his accompanying book are a noholdsbarred assault on the contemporary doctrine of political correctness fund said dsouzas message was deeply pessimistic but concluded most people will leave the theater with a more optimistic conclusion much of the criticism of america taught in the nation’s schools is easily refuted america is worth saving and we have the tools to do so in our dna just waiting to be harnessed94 national reviews jay nordlinger said dinesh is the antimoore taking to the big screen to press conservative points the shame narrators let’s call them focus on maybe 20 percent of the american story dinesh simply puts the other 80 percent back in95 in a second article jay nordlinger said the second movie confirms for me that one of dineshs great advantages is that he is absolutely cleareyed about the third world while liberal americans romanticize it he has lived it96 book version dsouza wrote the book america imagine the world without her on which the film is based when the warehouse club costco pulled the book from its shelves shortly before the films release conservative media and fans on social media criticized the move costco said it pulled the book due to low sales dsouza disputed the explanation saying the book had only been out a few weeks and had surged to 1 on amazoncom while costco stocked hundreds of much lowerselling books he and other conservatives asserted it was pulled because one of costcos cofounders james sinegal supported obamas politics9798 costco reordered the book and cited the documentarys release and related interest for the reorder99 hillarys america the secret history of the democratic party main article hillarys america the secret history of the democratic party on july 25 2016 dsouza released the documentary film hillarys america the secret history of the democratic party100101102

professional film critics on review aggregator rotten tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 4 based on 27 professional reviews with an average rating of 1710 the critics consensus on the site

normalized rating the film has a score of 2 out of 100 based on 17 critics indicating overwhelming dislike105 the film has the fifth lowest score of all films on the site106 peter sobczynski wrote “hillarys america may well be the single dumbest documentary that i have ever seen in my life107 a july 2016 review in variety characterized dsouza as a rightwing conspiracy wingnut the kind of “thinker” who takes off from barack obama birther theories and just keeps going spinning out a web of comicbook liberal evil108 other critics and figures viewed the film positively john fund of the national review stated that the film is over the top in places and definitely selective but the troubling facts are accurate and extensively documented in the d’souza book that accompanies the movie he also called the film intensely patriotic109 on july 23 2016 donald trump who was then running as the republican presidential nominee against clinton called on supporters to see the film110 on january 23 2017 the film was nominated for five razzies including worst picture worst actor dinesh dsouza worst actress becky turner worst director dinesh dsouza and bruce schooley and worst screenplay111 in response to the razzie nominations dsouza stated that he was actually quite honored and called the nominations petty revenge in response to trumps election victory also stating that the film might have played an important role in the election112 after winning four of the five possible razzies dsouza continued to be a good sport and repeated his view that the nominations were an upset response to trumps election victory113 election campaign finance conviction on january 24 2014 dsouza was arraigned in a manhattan federal court on charges of making 20000 in illegal campaign contributions to the new york senate campaign of wendy long and for causing false statements to be made to the federal election commission10114115116117 in may 2014 dsouza pleaded guilty to one felony

friendship117119 his coproducers alleged that the indictment was politically motivated retribution for the success of his 2012 movie 2016 obamas america120 dsouzas claim of selective prosecution received support from some conservative media and commentators121 according to harvard law professor alan dershowitz the idea of charging him with a felony for this doesnt sound like a proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion i cant help but think that dsouzas politics have something to do with it it smacks of selective prosecution he went on to say such alleged campaign violations are common in politics122 in may united states district judge richard m berman rejected that contention stating the court concludes the defendant has respectfully submitted no evidence he was selectively prosecuted123 personal life in 1992 dsouza married dixie brubaker whom he first met when he worked in washington dc they have one daughter born in 1995 in his book life after death the evidence dsouza
