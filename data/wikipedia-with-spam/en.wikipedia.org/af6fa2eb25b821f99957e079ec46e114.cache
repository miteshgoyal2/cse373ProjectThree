which two seas were originally intended remains in dispute15 the term appears five times in the quran but does not refer to the modern island—originally known to the arabs as awal— but rather to all of eastern arabia most notably alkatif and alhasa15 today bahrains two seas are instead generally taken to be the bay east and west of the island16 the seas north and south of the island17 or the salt and fresh water present above and below the ground18 in addition to wells there are areas of the sea north of bahrain where fresh water bubbles up in the middle of the salt water as noted by visitors since antiquity19 an alternate theory with regard to bahrains toponymy is offered by the alahsa region which suggests that the two seas were the great green ocean the persian gulf and a peaceful lake on the arabian mainland another supposition by aljawahari suggests that the more formal name bahri lit belonging to the sea would have been misunderstood and so was opted againstclarification needed18 until the late middle ages bahrain referred to the region of eastern arabia that included southern iraq kuwait alhasa qatif and bahrain the region stretched from basra in iraq to the strait of hormuz in oman this was iqlīm albahrayns bahrayn province the exact date at which the term bahrain began to refer solely to the awal archipelago is unknown20 the entire coastal strip of eastern arabia was known as bahrain for a millennium21 the island and kingdom were also commonly spelled bahrein1122 into the 1950s historyedit main article history of bahrain antiquityedit map showing the locations of the ancient burial mounds there are an estimated 350000 burial mounds the persian empire in sassanid era at its peak during the reign of khosrau ii 590–628 bahrain was home to the dilmun civilization an important bronze age trade centre linking mesopotamia and the indus valley23 bahrain was later ruled by the assyrians and babylonians24 from the 6th to 3rd century bc bahrain was part of the persian empire ruled by the achaemenian dynasty by about 250 bc parthia brought the persian gulf under its control and extended its influence as far as oman the parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of the persian gulf to control trade routes25 during the classical era bahrain was referred to by the ancient greeks as tylos the centre of pearl trading when the greek admiral nearchus serving under alexander the great landed on bahrain26 nearchus is believed to have been the first of alexanders commanders to visit the island and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network he recorded that on the island of tylos situated in the persian gulf are large plantations of cotton trees from which are manufactured clothes called sindones of strongly differing degrees of value some being costly others less expensive the use of these is not confined to india but extends to arabia27 the greek historian theophrastus states that much of bahrain was covered by these cotton trees and that bahrain was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in babylon28 alexander had planned to settle greek colonists on bahrain and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged bahrain became very much part of the hellenised world the language of the upper classes was greek although aramaic was in everyday use while zeus was worshipped in the form of the arabian sungod shams29 bahrain even became the site of greek athletic contests30 the greek historian strabo believed the phoenicians originate from bahrain31 herodotus also believed that the homeland of the phoenicians was bahrain3233 this theory was accepted by the 19thcentury german classicist arnold heeren who said that in the greek geographers for instance we read of two islands named tyrus or tylos and aradus which boasted that they were the mother country of the phoenicians and exhibited relics of phoenician temples34 the people of tyre in particular have long maintained persian gulf origins and the similarity in the words tylos and tyre has been commented upon35 however there is little evidence of any human settlement at all on bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place36 the name tylos is thought to be a hellenisation of the semitic tilmun from dilmun37 the term tylos was commonly used for the islands until ptolemy’s geographia when the inhabitants are referred to as thilouanoi38 some place names in bahrain go back to the tylos era for instance the name of arad a residential suburb of muharraq is believed to originate from arados the ancient greek name for muharraq26 in the 3rd century ardashir i the first ruler of the sassanid dynasty marched on oman and bahrain where he defeated sanatruq the ruler of bahrain39 at this time bahrain was known as mishmahig which in middlepersianpahlavi means ewefish40 bahrain was also the site of worship of an ox deity called awal worshipers built a large statue to awal in muharraq although it has now been lost for many centuries after tylos bahrain was known as awal by the 5th century bahrain became a centre for nestorian christianity with the village samahij41 as the seat of bishops in 410 according to the oriental syriac church synodal records a bishop named batai was excommunicated from the church in bahrain38 as a sect the nestorians were often persecuted as heretics by the byzantine empire but bahrain was outside the empires control offering some safety the names of several muharraq villages today reflect bahrains christian legacy with al dair meaning the monastery bahrains preislamic population consisted of christian arabs mostly abd alqays persians zoroastrians jews42 and aramaicspeaking agriculturalists434445 according to robert bertram serjeant the baharna may be the arabized descendants of converts from the original population of christians aramaeans jews and persians inhabiting the island and cultivated coastal provinces of eastern arabia at the time of the muslim conquest4346 the sedentary people of preislamic bahrain were aramaic speakers and to some degree persian speakers while syriac functioned as a liturgical language44 time of muhammadedit main article list of expeditions of muhammad facsimile of a letter sent by muhammad to munzir ibnsawa

to attack medina he had received news that some tribes were assembling an army on bahrain and preparing to attack the mainland but the tribesmen retreated when they learned muhammad was leading an army to do battle with them4748 traditional islamic accounts state that alʿalāʾ alhaḍrami was sent as an envoy during the expedition of zaid ibn haritha hisma4950 to the bahrain region by the prophet muhammad in ad 628 and that munzir ibnsawa altamimi the local ruler responded to his mission and converted the entire area5152 middle agesedit in ad 899 the qarmatians a millenarian ismaili muslim sect seized bahrain seeking to create a utopian society based on reason and redistribution of property among initiates thereafter the qarmatians demanded tribute from the caliph in baghdad and in ad 930 sacked mecca and medina bringing the sacred black stone back to their base in ahsa in medieval bahrain for ransom according to historian aljuwayni the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances wrapped in a sack it was thrown into the great mosque of kufa in iraq accompanied by a note saying by command we took it and by command we have brought it back the theft and removal of the black stone caused it to break into seven pieces535455 following their ad 976 defeat by the abbasids56 the qarmations were overthrown by the arab uyunid dynasty of alhasa who took over the entire bahrain region in 107657 the uyunids controlled bahrain until 1235 when the archipelago was briefly occupied by the persian ruler of fars in 1253 the bedouin usfurids brought down the uyunid dynasty thereby gaining control over eastern arabia including the islands of bahrain in 1330 the archipelago became a tributary state of the rulers of hormuz20 though locally the islands were controlled by the shiite jarwanid dynasty of qatif58 in the mid15th century the archipelago came under the rule of the jabrids a bedouin dynasty also based in alahsa that ruled most of eastern arabia

mainly on sunni persian governors20 the portuguese were expelled from the islands in 1602 by abbas i of the safavid dynasty of persia59 which gave impetus to shia islam60 for the next two centuries persian rulers retained control of the archipelago interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the ibadhis of oman61 during most of this period they resorted to governing bahrain indirectly either through the city of bushehr or through immigrant sunni arab clans the latter were tribes returning to the arabian side of the persian gulf from persian territories in the north who were known as huwala literally those that have changed or moved206263 in 1753 the huwala clan of nasr almadhkur invaded bahrain on behalf of the iranian zand leader karim khan zand and restored direct iranian rule63 in 1783 almadhkur lost the islands of bahrain following his defeat by the bani utbah tribe at the 1782 battle of zubarah bahrain was not new territory to the bani utbah they had been a presence there since the 17th century64 during that time they started purchasing date palm gardens in bahrain a document shows that 81 years before arrival of the alkhalifa one of the shaikhs of the al bin ali tribe an offshoot of the bani utbah had bought a palm garden from mariam bint ahmed al sanadi in sitra island65 the al bin ali were the dominant group controlling the town of zubarah on the qatar peninsula6667 originally the center of power of the bani utbah after the bani utbah gained control of bahrain the al bin ali had a practically independent status there as a selfgoverning tribe they used a flag with four red and three white stripes called the alsulami flag68 in bahrain qatar kuwait and the eastern province of the kingdom of saudi arabia later different arab family clans and tribes from qatar moved to bahrain to settle after the fall of nasr almadhkur of bushehr these families included the al khalifa almaawdah alfadhil almannai alnoaimi alsulaiti alsadah althawadi and other families and tribes69 the al khalifa family moved from qatar to bahrain in 1799 originally their ancestors were expelled from umm qasr in central arabia by the ottomans due to their predatory habits of preying on caravans in basra and trading ships in shatt alarab waterway until turks expelled them to kuwait in 1716 where they remained until 176670 around the 1760s the al jalahma and al khalifa clans both belonging to the utub federation migrated to zubarah in modernday qatar leaving al sabah as the sole proprietors of kuwait71 19th century and lateredit in the early 19th century bahrain was invaded by both the omanis and the al sauds in 1802 it was governed by a 12yearold child when the omani ruler sayyid sultan installed his son salim as governor in the arad fort72 in 1816 the british political resident in the gulf william bruce received a letter from the sheikh of bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that britain would support an attack on the island by the imam of muscat he sailed to bahrain to reassure the sheikh that this was not the case and drew up an informal agreement assuring the sheikh that britain would remain a neutral party73 in 1820 the al khalifa tribe were recognised by great britain as the rulers alhakim in arabic of bahrain after signing a treaty relationship74 however ten years later they were forced to pay yearly tributes to egypt despite seeking persian and british protection75 bahrain harbor c 1870 in 1860 the al khalifas used the same tactic when the british tried to overpower bahrain writing letters to the persians and ottomans al khalifas agreed to place bahrain under the latters protection in march due to offering better conditions eventually the government of british india overpowered bahrain when the persians refused to protect it colonel pelly signed a new treaty with al khalifas placing bahrain under british rule and protection75 following the qatari–bahraini war in 1868 british representatives signed another agreement with the al khalifas it specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territory except to the united kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without british consent7677 in return the british promised to protect bahrain from all aggression by sea and to lend support in case of land attack77 more importantly the british promised to support the rule of the al khalifa in bahrain securing its unstable position as rulers of the country other agreements in 1880 and 1892 sealed the protectorate status of bahrain to the british77 unrest amongst the people of bahrain began when britain officially established complete dominance over the territory in 1892 the first revolt and widespread uprising took place in march 1895 against sheikh issa bin ali then ruler of bahrain78 sheikh issa was the first of the al khalifa to rule without persian relations sir arnold wilson britains representative in the persian gulf and author of the persian gulf arrived in bahrain from muscat at this time78 the uprising developed further with some protesters killed by british forces78 before the development of petroleum the island was largely devoted to pearl fisheries and as late as the 19th century was considered to be the finest in the world11 in 1903 german explorer hermann burchardt visited bahrain and took many photographs of historical sites including the old qaṣr essheikh photos now stored at the ethnological museum of berlin79 prior to the first world war there were about 400 vessels hunting pearls and an annual export of more than £3000022 in 1911 a group of bahraini merchants demanded restrictions on the british influence in the country the groups leaders were subsequently arrested and exiled to india in 1923 the british introduced administrative reforms and replaced sheikh issa bin ali with his son some clerical opponents and families such as al dossari left or were exiled to saudi arabia and iran80 three years later the british placed the country under the de facto rule of charles belgrave who operated as an adviser to the ruler until 19578182 belgrave brought a number of reforms such as establishment of the countrys first modern school in 1919 the persian gulfs first girls school in 192883 and the abolition of slavery in 193784 at the same time the pearl diving industry developed at a rapid pace in 1927 rezā shāh then shah of iran demanded sovereignty over bahrain in a letter to the league of nations a move that prompted belgrave to undertake harsh measures including encouraging conflicts between shia and sunni muslims in order to bring down the uprisings and limit the iranian influence85 belgrave even went further by suggesting to rename the persian gulf to the arabian gulf however the proposal was refused by the british government81 britains interest in bahrains development was motivated by concerns over saudi and iranian ambitions in the region a photograph of the first oil

the oil boom of the 1970s benefited bahrain greatly although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy the country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the lebanese civil war in the 1970s and 1980s when bahrain replaced beirut as the middle easts financial hub after lebanons large banking sector was driven out of the country by the war97 following the 1979 islamic revolution in iran in 1981 bahraini shīa fundamentalists orchestrated a failed coup attempt under the auspices of a front organisation the islamic front for the liberation of bahrain the

stations and illegal land reclamation at places such as tubli bay the agricultural and domestic sectors overutilisation of the dammam aquifer the principal aquifer in bahrain has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies a hydrochemical study identified the locations of the sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence the investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of bahrain where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern saudi arabia to the southern and southeastern parts four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified brackishwater upflow from the underlying brackishwater zones in northcentral western and eastern regions seawater intrusion in the eastern region intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region four
