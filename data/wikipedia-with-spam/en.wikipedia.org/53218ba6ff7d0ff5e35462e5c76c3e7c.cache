stadiums design was perfectly circular attempting to facilitate both football and baseball it was the first to use the socalled cookiecutter concept an approach also used in philadelphia new york houston atlanta st louis san diego cincinnati oakland and pittsburgh except for the stadiums in houston san diego and oakland the former is still standing but is no longer actively used while the latter two are still active rfk stadium ultimately outlasted all of the aforementioned stadiums however as would become the case with every other stadium where this was tried the design was not ideal for either sport due to the different shapes and sizes of the playing fields as the playing field dimensions for football and baseball vary greatly seating had to accommodate the larger playing surface as a baseball park rfk was a particular target of scorn from baseball purists largely because it was one of the few stadiums with no lowerdeck seats in the outfield the only outfield seats are in the upper deck above a high wall according to sporting news publications in the 1960s over 27000 seats—roughly 60 of the listed capacity of 45000 for baseball—were in the upper tier or mezzanine levels the lowertoupper proportion improved for the redskins with endzone seats filling in some of the gaps on the debit side however the first ten rows of the football configuration were nearly at field level making it difficult to see over the players the baseball diamond was aligned due east home plate to center field panoramic view of robert f kennedy memorial stadium in 2012 looking east from the west corner the former home plate area a complex conversion was necessary at a cost of 40000 per switch to convert the stadium from a football configuration to baseball and back again in its final form this included rolling the thirdbase lowerlevel seats into the outfield along a buried rail dropping the hydraulic pitchers mound 3 feet 09 m into the ground and laying sod over the infield dirt later facilities were designed so the seating configuration could be changed much more quickly and at a lower cost the conversion was only required several times per year during the senators joint tenancy with the redskins but became much more frequent while the nationals and dc united shared the stadium during the mostly concurrent mlb and mls seasons in 2005 the conversion was made more than 20 times originally the seats located behind the stadiums thirdbase dugout were removed for baseball games and put back in place when the stadium was converted to the football and later soccer configuration when these sections were in place rfk seated approximately 56000 fans with the nationals arrival in 2005 this particular segment of the stands was permanently removed to facilitate the switch between the baseball and soccer configurations these seats were not restored following the nationals move to nationals park leaving the stadiums seating capacity at approximately 46000 the majority of the upperdeck seats normally were not made available for dc united matches so the stadiums reduced capacity normally was not problematic for the club the footballsoccer field alignment is northwest to southeast approximately along the baseball diamonds first base line during the years when the stadium was used only for redskins games the rotating seats remained in the football configuration if an exhibition baseball game was scheduled the leftfield wall was only 250 feet 76 m from home plate and a large screen was erected in left field for some games some of rfks quirks endear the venue to fans and players the large rolling bleacher section is less stable than other seating allowing fans to jump in rhythm to cause the whole area to bounce also despite its small size it never seated more than 56000 people because of the stadiums design and the proximity of the fans to the field when configured for football the stadium was extremely loud when the usual sellout redskins crowds became vocal legend has it that redskins head coach george allen would order a large rolling door in the side of the stadium to be opened when visiting teams were attempting field goals at critical moments in games so that a swirling wind from off the potomac and anacostia rivers might interfere with the flight of the kicked ball since the stadium is on a direct sight line with the washington monument and the us capitol light towers were not allowed instead arc lights were placed on its curved dipping roof events dc —the city agency which operates rfk stadium— began a strategic planning process in november 2013 to study options for the future of the stadium its 80 acres 320000 m2 campus and the nonmilitary portions of the adjacent dc armory events dc said one option to be studied was demolition within a decade while another would be the status quo the strategic planning process also included design and development of options the agency said that rfk stadium has generated 4 million to 5 million a year in revenues since 1997 which did not cover operating expenses16 in august 2014 events dc chose the consulting firm of brailsford dunlavey to create
