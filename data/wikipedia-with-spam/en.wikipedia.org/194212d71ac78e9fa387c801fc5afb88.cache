dangerous 1991 the success of thriller which still holds its place as the best selling album of all time with a reported 65 million units sold often overshadowed jacksons other projects prior to the release of invincible jackson had not released any new material since blood on the dance floor history in the mix in 1997 or a studio album since history in 1995 invincible was thus looked at as jacksons career come back1 invincible is dedicated to the fifteenyearold afronorwegian boy benjamin benny hermansen who was stabbed to death by a group of neonazis in oslo norway in january 20016 the reason for this tribute was partly due to the fact that another oslo youth omer bhatti jacksons friend was also a good friend of hermansen6 the dedication in the album reads michael jackson gives special thanks this album is dedicated to benjamin benny hermansen may we continue to remember not to judge man by the color of his skin but the content of his character benjamin we love you may you rest in peace6 the album is also dedicated to nicholette sottile and his parents joseph and katherine jackson6 productionedit jackson began recording new material for the album in october 1997 and finished with you are my life being recorded only eight weeks before the albums release in october 2001 the most extensive recording of jacksons career7 the tracks with rodney jerkins were recorded at the hit factory in miami florida8 jackson had shown interest in including a rapper on at least one song and had noted that he did not want a known rapper7 jacksons spokesperson suggested new jersey rapper named fats after jackson heard the finished product of the song the two agreed to record another song together for the album7 rodney jerkins stated that jackson was looking to record material in a different musical direction than his previous work describing the new direction as edgier7 jackson received credit for both writing and producing a majority of the songs on invincible aside from jackson the album features productions by jerkins teddy riley andre harris andraeo fanatic heard kenneth babyface edmonds r kelly and dr freeze bill gray and writing credits from kelly fred jerkins iii lashawn daniels nora payne and robert smith9 the album is the third collaboration between jackson and riley the other two being dangerous and blood on the dance floor history in the mix invincible is jacksons tenth and final studio album to have been recorded and released10 it was reported that it cost thirty million dollars to make the album11 making it the most expensive album ever made12 compositionedit invincible is composed of rb hip hop dancepop adult contemporary and urban songs13 the albums full length is seventyseven minutes eight seconds and it contains 16 songs fifteen of which were written or cowritten by jackson it was noted that the album shifts between aggressive songs and ballads14 invincible opens with unbreakable the last line in the first verse recites the lyrics with all that ive been throughim still around13 in a 2002 interview with the magazine vibe jackson commented on his inspiration for writing speechless saying youll be surprised i was with these kids in germany and we had a big waterballoon fight im serious and i was so happy after the fight that i ran upstairs in their house and wrote speechless fun inspires me i hate to say that because its such a romantic song but it was the fight that did it i was happy and i wrote it in its sic entirety right there i felt it would be good enough for the album out of the bliss comes magic wonderment and creativity15 privacy a reflection on jacksons own personal experiences is about media invasions and tabloid inaccuracies13 the lost children is about imperiled children13 jackson sings in a third person in whatever happens the songs lyrics described by rolling stone magazine as having a jagged intensity narrate the story of two people involved in an unnamed threatening situation13 invincible features four ballads you are my life butterflies dont walk away and cry13 cry similar to jacksons man in the mirror is about healing the world together1 the lyrics to butterflies and break of dawn were viewed as glaringly banal and it was implied that they could have been written by anyone14 threatened was viewed as being a story teller13 the song was viewed as a thriller redux14 the song you are my life is about jacksons two children at the time prince and paris16 the song features jackson singing you are the sun you make me shine more like the stars14 promotion and singlesedit see also michael jackson 30th anniversary special see also michael jackson singles discography it was reported that the album had a budget of twenty five million dollars set aside for promotion1117 despite this however due to the conflicts between jackson and his record label little was done to promote the album18 the album spawned three singles although all were given limited releases you rock my world was only released to radio airplay in the united states consequently only peaking at number ten on the billboard hot 100 internationally where it was released as a commercial single it was more successful peaking at number one in france number two in norway finland denmark belgium and the united kingdom number three in italy number four in australia and five in sweden and switzerland19 the second single cry was not released in the united states it was only moderately successful with the songs most successful territories being spain denmark france and belgium charting at number six sixteen thirty and thirty one20 the albums third single butterflies was only released in the united states to radio airplay consequently only peaking at number fourteen on the billboard hot 100 and at number two for five weeks on the hot rbhiphop singles chart21 heaven can wait also charted at the bottom of the rbhiphop charts at number seventy two due to radio airplay without an official release the song did not chart internationally21 unbreakable was originally supposed to be released as a single but it was ultimately cancelled22 it was however later included on the ultimate collection box set unlike with jacksons postthriller adult studio albums there was no world tour to promote the album a tour was planned only to be cancelled due to a combination of internal conflicts between jackson sony music entertainment and the september 11th attacks the latter of which had also motivated many other artists to cancel their thenupcoming concerts in late 2001 and early 2002 there was however a special 30th anniversary celebration at madison square garden in early september 2001 to mark jacksons 30th year as a solo artist the singer performed a song from invincible and marked his first appearance onstage alongside his brothers since the jacksons victory tour in 198423 the show also featured performances by britney spears mýa usher whitney houston tamia backstreet boys n sync and slash among other artists24 the show aired on cbs in november 2001 as a twohour television special and garnered 298 million viewers25 the albums promotion was met with trouble due to internal conflicts going on between sony music entertainment and jackson due to issues with his ownership with the company and the contract to this deal with sony that was originally signed back in 1991 the issue stemmed back during production of invincible when jackson learned that the rights to the masters of his past releases which were to revert to him in the early 2000s wouldnt actually revert to him until much later in the decade when jackson went to lawyer who worked with him in making the deal back in 1991 he learned that the same lawyer was also working for sony revealing a conflict of interest he was never aware of not wanting to sign away his ownership in sony music entertainment jackson elected to leave the company shortly after the albums release26 after the announcement sony halted promotion on the album cancelling single releases including a 911 charity single that was intended to be released before invincible following sonys decision to abruptly end all promotion for the album jackson made allegations in july 2002 that mottola was a devil and a racist who did not support his africanamerican artists but merely used them for his own personal gain1127 the singer accused sony and the record industry of racism deliberately not promoting or actively working against promotion of his album28 sony disputed claims that they had failed to promote invincible with sufficient energy maintaining that jackson refused to tour in the united states29 critical and public receptionedit professional ratings review scores source rating allmusic 1 blender 30 robert christgau a31 entertainment weekly c14 the guardian 32 nme 61033 q 34 rolling stone 13 the rolling stone album guide 35 slant magazine 36 usa today 37 invincible received mixed reviews from mainstream critics at metacritic which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics the album received a mixed score of 51 based on 19 reviews38 allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine commented that it has a spark and sound better than anything jackson has done since dangerous1 erlewine noted that while the album had good material it was not enough to make invincible the comeback jackson needed he really would have had to have an album that sounded free instead of constrained for that to work but it does offer a reminder that he can really craft good pop1 david browne of entertainment weekly felt that invincible is jacksons first album since off the wall that offers virtually no new twists but remarked that the album feels like an anthology of his lessthangreatest hits14 james hunter of rolling stone critiqued that the albums later ballads made the record too long13 hunter also commented that jackson and riley made whatever happens something really handsome and smart allowing listeners to concentrate on the tracks momentous rhythms such as santanas passionate interjections and lubbocks wonderfully arranged symphonic sweeps13 mark beaumont of nme called it a relevant and rejuvenated comeback album made overlong33 while blender also found it longwinded39 in his review for the village voice robert christgau said that jacksons skills as a musician are often forgotten but noted that the album seemed too long compared to other jackson albums31 while christgau felt some material was offensive he described the albums first three tracks as being the rodney jerkins of the year adding that he did not believe the albums hype matters31 nikki tranter of popmatters said that it is both innovative and meaningful because exceptional songs such as the lost children and whatever happens more than make up for overly sentimental songs like heaven can wait and you are my life40 q magazine said that it is an aurally interesting albeit inconsistent album34 in a negative review for the new york times jon pareles suggested that the album is somewhat impersonal and humorless as jackson rehashes ideas from his past songs and is so busy trying to dazzle listeners that he forgets to have any fun41 in a retrospective review for the rolling stone album guide pareles said that invincible showed jackson had lost his suave quality to grim calculation35 shortly after the release of the album in a poll conducted by billboard magazine an overwhelming majority of people—79 of 5195 voters—were not surprised by invincible entering the billboard 200 at number one42 billboard also reported that 44 agreed with the statement proclaiming that jackson was still the king of pop another 35 said they were not surprised by the albums ranking but doubted invincible would hold on for a second week at the top of the chart42 only 12 of people who responded to the poll said they were surprised by the albums charting debut because of jacksons career over past six years and another 9 were taken aback by the albums success in light of the negativity that preceded the albums release42 invincible received one grammy award nomination at the 2002 ceremony the albums song you rock my world was nominated for best pop vocal performance male but lost to james taylors dont let me be lonely tonight43 due to the albums release in october 2001 it was not eligible for any other nomination from the 2002 grammy awards44 in december 2009 just a few months after jacksons death readers of billboard magazine voted invincible as the best album of the decade from their readers poll5 commercial performanceedit invincible was jacksons first studio album to be released in four years since blood on the dance floor history in the mix in 199745 in the albums first week of release with the sales of 363000 units the album debuted at number one on the billboard 200 on the charts issue date of november 17 20014546 invincible was jacksons fifth number one entry on the billboard 20045 and the fourth to chart at number one in its debut week as a solo artist despite the first week sales of invincible being good the album sold less than history in its opening week with the album having sold 391000 units45 invincible also charted at number one on billboards rbhip hop albums chart for four weeks47 after eight weeks of release in december 2001 invincible was certified gold by the recording industry association of america riaa for the sales of five hundred thousand units48 in the same month the album was certified platinum for the sale of one million units48 on january 25 2002 the album was certified two times platinum for the sales of two million units48 some of the songs from invincible would be used for the immortal world tour49 internationally invincible was a commercial success the album peaked at number one in twelve countries worldwide45 including the united kingdom australia belgium denmark the netherlands germany norway sweden and switzerland4550 it also charted within the top ten in several countries including austria canada finland italy new zealand and norway50 the album has reportedly sold 10 million units worldwide51 however the sales for invincible were notably low compared to his previous releases due in part to a diminishing pop music industry the lack of promotion no supporting world tour and the label dispute52 commenting on the sales of invincible back in late 2003 bernard zuel of the sydney morning herald stated holly valance or delta goodrem would think their christmases had come at once if they sold five or six million copies of their albums worldwide michael jackson did something similar in the past two years with his seventh solo album invincible and hes been branded a failure in the industry and the media unfair yes of course because his invincible figures are better than those for 95 per cent of the thousands of artists released each year and would provide a healthy retirement fund for anyone whats more that failure tag is consistently applied by comparisons with his 1982 album thriller which has sold about 100 million copies and its followups bad that sold about 30 million copies however selling 10 million copies is still phenomenal compared to the album sales of most artists28 in 2004 invincible reentered billboard charts invincible placed at 154 on the billboard 200 on december 4 200453 the album also reached at number forty eight on billboards rbhip hop albums chart that same week53 following jacksons death in june 2009 his music experienced a
