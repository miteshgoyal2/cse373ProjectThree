in march 1968 bongo declared gabon a oneparty state by dissolving the bdg and establishing a new party—the parti democratique gabonais pdg he invited all gabonese regardless of previous political affiliation to participate bongo sought to forge a single national movement in support of the governments development policies using the pdg as a tool to submerge the regional and tribal rivalries that had divided gabonese politics in the past bongo was elected president in february 1975 in april 1975 the position of vice president was abolished and replaced by the position of prime minister who had no right to automatic succession bongo was reelected president in both december 1979 and november 1986 to 7year terms5 in early 1990 economic discontent and a desire for political liberalization provoked violent demonstrations and strikes by students and workers in response to grievances by workers bongo negotiated with them on a sectorbysector basis making significant wage concessions in addition he promised to open up the pdg and to organize a national political conference in march–april 1990 to discuss gabons future political system the pdg and 74 political organizations attended the conference participants essentially divided into two loose coalitions the ruling pdg and its allies and the united front of opposition associations and parties consisting of the breakaway morena fundamental and the gabonese progress party5 the april 1990 conference approved sweeping political reforms including creation of a national senate decentralization of the budgetary process freedom of assembly and press and cancellation of an exit visa requirement in an attempt to guide the political systems transformation to multiparty democracy bongo resigned as pdg chairman and created a transitional government headed by a new prime minister casimir oyemba the gabonese social democratic grouping rsdg as the resulting government was called was smaller than the previous government and included representatives from several opposition parties in its cabinet the rsdg drafted a provisional constitution in may 1990 that provided a basic bill of rights and an independent judiciary but retained strong executive powers for the president after further review by a constitutional committee and the national assembly this document came into force in march 19915

president omar bongos reelection in december 1993 with 51 of the vote opposition candidates refused to validate the election results serious civil disturbances led to an agreement between the government and opposition factions to work toward a political settlement these talks led to the paris accords in november 1994 under which several opposition figures were included in a government of national unity this arrangement soon broke down however and the 1996 and 1997 legislative and municipal elections provided the background for renewed partisan politics the pdg won a landslide victory in the legislative election but several major cities including libreville elected opposition mayors during the 1997 local election5 facing a divided opposition president omar bongo coasted to easy reelection in december 1998 with large majorities of the vote while bongos major opponents rejected the outcome as fraudulent some international observers characterized the results as representative

efficiently overspending on the transgabon railway the cfa franc devaluation of 1994 and periods of low oil prices caused serious debt problems that still plague the country5 gabon earned a poor reputation with the paris club and the international monetary fund imf over the management of its debt and revenues successive imf missions have criticized the government for overspending on offbudget items in good years and bad overborrowing from the central bank and slipping on the schedule for privatization and administrative reform however in september 2005 gabon successfully concluded a

lamented the lack of diversity in the gabonese economy various factors have so far limited the development of new industries the market is small about a million dependent on imports from france unable to capitalize on regional markets entrepreneurial zeal not always present among the gabonese a fairly regular stream of oil rent even if it is diminishing further investment in the agricultural or tourism sectors is complicated by poor infrastructure the small processing and service sectors that do exist are largely dominated by a few prominent local investors5 at world bank and imf insistence the government embarked in the 1990s on a program of privatization of its stateowned companies and administrative reform including reducing public sector employment and salary growth but progress has
