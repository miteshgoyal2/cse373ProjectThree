first chinese immigrants arrived in 1820 according to us government records 325 men are known to have arrived before the 1849 california gold rush8 which drew the first significant number of laborers from china who mined for gold and performed menial labor91011 there were 25000 immigrants by 1852 and 105465 by 1880 most of whom lived on the west coast they formed over a tenth of californias population nearly all of the early immigrants were young males with low educational levels from six districts in guangdong province12 in the 1850s chinese workers migrated to the united states first to work in the gold mines but also to take agricultural jobs and factory work especially in the garment industry chinese immigrants were particularly instrumental in building railroads in the american west and as chinese laborers grew successful in the united states a number of them became entrepreneurs in their own right as the numbers of chinese laborers increased so did the strength of antichinese attitude among other workers in the american economy this finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of chinese workers to the united states and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the united states and china the chinese exclusion act13 the chinese came to california in large numbers during the california gold rush with 40400 being recorded as arriving from 1851–1860 and again in the 1860s when the central pacific railroad recruited large labor gangs many on fiveyear contracts to build its portion of the transcontinental railroad the chinese laborers worked out well and thousands more were recruited until the railroads completion in 1869 chinese labor provided the massive workforce needed to build the majority of the central pacifics difficult route through the sierra nevada mountains and across nevada american objections to chinese immigration took many forms and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions as well as ethnic discrimination most chinese laborers who came to the united states did so in order to send money back to china to support their families there at the same time they also had to repay loans to the chinese merchants who paid their passage to america these financial pressures left them little choice but to work for whatever wages they could nonchinese laborers often required much higher wages to support their wives and children in the united states and also generally had a stronger political standing to bargain for higher wages therefore many of the nonchinese workers in the united states came to resent the chinese laborers who might squeeze them out of their jobs furthermore as with most immigrant communities many chinese settled in their own neighborhoods and tales spread of chinatowns as places where large numbers of chinese men congregated to visit prostitutes smoke opium or gamble some advocates of antichinese legislation therefore argued that admitting chinese into the united states lowered the cultural and moral standards of american society others used a more overtly racist argument for limiting immigration from east asia and expressed concern about the integrity of american racial composition13 to address these rising social tensions from the 1850s through the 1870s the california state government passed a series of measures aimed at chinese residents ranging from requiring special licenses for chinese businesses or workers to preventing naturalization because antichinese discrimination and efforts to stop chinese immigration violated the 1868 burlingameseward treaty with china the federal government was able to negate much of this legislation13 the chinese population rose from 2716 in 1851 to 63000 by 1871 in the decade 186170 64301 were recorded as arriving followed by 123201 in 187180 and 61711 in 18811890 77 were located in california with the rest scattered across the west the south and new england14 most came from southern china looking for a better life escaping a high rate of poverty left after the taiping rebellion in 1879 advocates of immigration restriction succeeded in introducing and passing legislation in congress to limit the number of chinese arriving to fifteen per ship or vessel republican president rutherford b hayes vetoed the bill because it violated us treaty agreements with china nevertheless it was still an important victory for advocates of exclusion democrats led by supporters in the west advocated for allout exclusion of chinese immigrants although republicans were largely sympathetic to western concerns they were committed to a platform of free immigration in order to placate the western states without offending china president hayes sought a revision of the burlingameseward treaty burlingame treaty in which china agreed to limit immigration to the united states13 in 1880 the hayes administration appointed us diplomat james b angell to negotiate a new treaty with china the resulting angell treaty permitted the united states to restrict but not completely prohibit chinese immigration in 1882 congress passed the chinese exclusion act which per the terms of the angell treaty suspended the immigration of chinese laborers skilled or unskilled for a period of 10 years the act also required every chinese person traveling in or out of the country to carry a certificate identifying his or her status as a laborer scholar diplomat or merchant the 1882 act was the first in american history to place broad restrictions on immigration13 for american presidents and congressmen addressing the question of chinese exclusion the challenge was to balance domestic attitudes and politics which dictated an antichinese policy while maintaining good diplomatic relations with china where exclusion would be seen as an affront and a violation of treaty promises the domestic factors ultimately trumped international concerns in 1888 congress took exclusion even further and passed the scott act which made reentry to the united states after a visit to china impossible even for longterm legal residents the chinese government considered this act a direct insult but was unable to prevent its passage in 1892 congress voted to renew exclusion for ten years in the geary act and in 1902 the prohibition was expanded to cover hawaii and the philippines all over strong objections from the chinese government and people congress later extended the exclusion act indefinitely13 the initial immigration group may have been as high as 90 male due to the chinese exclusion act resulting in most immigrants coming with the thought of earning money and then returning to china to start a family those that stayed in america faced the lack of suitable chinese brides because chinese women were not allowed to immigrate to the us in significant numbers after 1872 as a result many isolated mostlybachelor communities slowly aged in place with very low chinese birth rates later as a result of the fourteenth amendment and the 1898 united states v wong kim ark supreme court decision ethnic chinese born in the united states became american citizens the chinese exclusion acts were not repealed until 1943 and then only in the interests of aiding the morale of a wartime ally during world war ii with relations already complicated by the opium wars and the treaties of wangxia and tianjian the increasingly harsh restrictions on chinese immigration combined with the rising discrimination against chinese living in the united states in the 1870searly 1900s placed additional strain on the diplomatic relationship between the united states and china13 in the mid 1850s 70 to 150 chinese were living in new york city and 11 of them married irish women in 1906 the new york times 6 august reported that 300 white women irish american were married to chinese men in new york with many more cohabited in 1900 based on liang research of the 120000 men in more than 20 chinese communities in the united states he estimated that one out of every twenty chinese men cantonese was married to white women15 in the 1960s census showed 3500 chinese men married to white women and 2900 chinese women married to white men16 originally at the start of the 20th century there was a 55 rate of chinese men in new york engaging in interracial marriage which was maintained in the 1920s but in the 1930s it slid to 2017 during and after world war ii severe immigration restrictions were eased as the united states allied with china against japanese expansionism later reforms in the 1960s placed increasing value on family unification allowing relatives of us citizens to receive preference in immigration the chinese american experience

nonasian americans do not differentiate between chinese americans and east asian americans generally and perceptions of both groups are nearly identical43 a 2001 survey of americans attitudes toward asian americans and chinese americans indicated that one fourth of the respondents had somewhat or very negative attitude toward chinese americans in general44 the study did find several positive perceptions of chinese americans strong family values 91 honesty as entrepreneurs 77 high value on education 6743 chinese americans struggled surviving in america because of discrimination and

chinese is the third mostspoken language in the united states it is almost completely spoken within chinese american populations and by immigrants or the descendants of immigrants especially in california45 over 2 million americans speak some variety or dialect of chinese with standard chinese mandarin becoming increasingly common due to immigration from china and replacing cantonese45 in new york city at least although standard chinese mandarin is spoken as a native language among only 10 of american born chinese speakers it is used as a secondary dialect to english46 in addition immigration from fuzhou fujian is bringing large numbers of fuzhounese eastern min particularly changle dialect speakers varieties of wu chinese particularly shanghainese the mutually unintelligible wenzhounese is now spoken by a minority of recent chinese immigrants hailing from jiangsu zhejiang and shanghai although chinese americans grow up learning english some teach their children chinese

catholic and 22 belonged to a protestant denomination fully half of chinese americans 52—including 55 of those born in the us and 51 of those born overseas—describe themselves as religiously unaffiliated because chinese americans are the largest subgroup of asian americans nearly half of all religiously unaffiliated asians in the us are of chinese descent 49449 politicsedit chinese americans are divided among many subgroups based on factors such as age nativity and socioeconomic status and politics between china and the united states or about chinese nationalism different subgroups of chinese americans also have radically different and sometimes very conflicting political priorities and goals in 2013 chinese americans were the least likely asian american ethnicity to be affiliated with a political party50 nonetheless chinese americans are clustered in majoritydemocratic states and have increasingly voted democratic in recent presidential elections following the trend for asian americans in general51 polling just before the 2004 us presidential election found john kerry was favored by 58 of chinese americans and george w bush by only 2352 as compared with a

revolution which established the republic of china during the cultural revolution chinese americans as overseas chinese in general were viewed as capitalist traitors by the prc government this attitude changed dramatically in the late 1970s with the reforms of deng xiaoping increasingly chinese americans were seen as sources of business and technical expertise and capital who could aid in chinas economic and other development immigrationedit economic growth in the peoples republic of china has given mainland chinese more opportunities to emigrate a 2011 survey showed that 60 of chinese

startup firms by ethnic chinese in silicon valley skyrocketed from 9 in 19801984 to about 20 between 1995199899 by 2006 chinese american internet entrepreneurs continued to start 20 of all silicon valley startup firms leading 2000 silicon valley companies and employing 58000 workers88 they still continue to own about 20 of all information technology companies that were founded in silicon valley since 1980 numerous professional organizations in perspective in the 1990s as a support network for fellow chinese american high tech startups in the valley100 between 1980 and 1999 17 of the 11443 hightech firms in silicon valley including some 40 publicly traded firms were controlled by ethnic chinese in 1990 chinese americans made up a third of the asian american high tech professional workforce or 11 of the entire silicon valley professional workforce in 1998 chinese americans managed 2001 firms employing 41684 workers and ran up 132 billion in sales they also account for 17 of all silicon valley firm owners 10 of the professional workforce in the valley and 135 of the total sales accounting for less than 1 of the us population at the time101 though chinese americans are also noted for their high rates of selfemployment as they have an extensive history of selfemployment dating back to the california gold rush in the 1880s102 however as more chinese americans seek higher education to elevate themselves socioeconomically rates of selfemployment are generally lower than population average103 in 2007 there were over 109614 chineseowned employer firms employing more than 780000 workers and generating more than 128 billion in revenue104 among chineseowned us firms 40 were in the professional scientific and technical services sector the accommodation and food services sector and the repair maintenance personal and laundry services sector chineseowned us firms comprised 2 of all us businesses in these sectors wholesale trade and accommodation and food services accounted for 504 of chineseowned business revenue 66505 or 157 of chineseowned firms had receipts of 250000 or more compared with 2 for all us businesses104105106107108109 economicsedit with their above average educational attainment rates chinese americans from all socioeconomic backgrounds have achieved significant advances in their educational levels income life expectancy and other social indicators as the financial and socioeconomic opportunities offered by the united states have lifted many chinese americans out of poverty bringing them into the ranks of americas middle class upper middle class as well as the enjoyment of substantial well being110 chinese americans are more likely to own homes than the general american population according to the 2000 us census 65 of chinese americans owned a home higher than the total populations rate of 54111112 in 2003 real estate economist gary painter of the university of southern california lusk center for real estate research found out that when comparing homeowners with similar income levels los angeles the chineseamerican homeownership rate is 20 higher than whites in san francisco 23 higher and in the new york metropolitan area 18 higher113 a 2008 asian real estate association of america report released on behalf of the american community survey chinese americans living in the states of texas new york and california all had high home ownership rates that were significantly near or above the general population average114 according to the 2010 us census chinese american men had a fulltime median income of 57061 and chinese american women had a median income of 47224 chinese americans also have one of the highest median household incomes among most demographic groups in the united states which is 30 higher than the national average but is slightly lower compared with the asian american population26 median household income 201026 ethnicity household income taiwanese 68809 asian 67022 chinese 65273 nonhispanic white 52480 scottish 52444 korean 50316 total us population 50046 despite positive economic indicators a number of economic deterrents have been noted to afflict the chinese american community while median income remains above some ethnic groups in the united states studies in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis revealed that asian men have the highest rate of persistent longterm unemployment115 ethnic minoritiesedit while the vast majority of chinese americans are of the han ethnicity there are also some ethnic minorities in china who have immigrated to the united states directly from the peoples republic of china a community numbering 20000 koreanchinese chaoxianzu chinese 朝鲜族 or joseonjok hangul 조선족 is centered in flushing queens while new york city is also home to the largest tibetan population outside china india and nepal also centered in queens116 there are some zhuang people the largest ethnic minority of china in the united states117 the presence of miao117 uyghur118 and manchu americans119 has also been attested although considered ethnically the same as other han chinese the muslim hui people are registered as an ethnic minority by the chinese government there are some hui in the united states and some have retained their religious and cultural practices in america120 there are some restaurants serving hui cuisine such as mas restaurant121 geneticsedit a research on the whole genome patterns of common dna variation in different human populations africanamerican asianamerican and european american finds some common singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps in these three populations with diverse ancestry122 in the samples of han chinese in america 74 of the total snps have two alleles and majority of the segregating snps have a minor allele frequency maf greater than 10 another noticeable point is that mafs show similar distributions in europeanamerican and han chinese populations besides rarer haplotype is found to be absent in the samples of han chinese and they also possess a high level of redundancy a study analyzing east asian genetic substructure using genomewide snp arrays is carried out with greater than 200000 genotypes from people of east asian ancestry123 the continental populations are from the human genome diversity panel cambodian yi daur mongolian lahu dai hezhen miaozu naxi oroqen she tu tujia naxi xibo and yakut hapmap han chinese and japanese as well as east asian or east asian american subjects of vietnamese korean filipino and chinese ancestry a clear understanding of the genetic substructure of any population helps in the studies of complex diseases as well as the design and execution of association tests results of this study have identified markers that can not only reduce type 1 errors in future genetic disease studies but also identify homogeneous groups and hence make this study more powerful the group of chinese american in the same study consists of subjects with origins from north china south china and taiwan this group is paired with han chinese from beijing and results indicate that the population differentiation values was small 00025 there is substantially less genetic substructure between han chinese and chinese american compared with that between han chinese japanese and korean groups yet there is still a substructure in principal component according to the split half reliability test another study aiming to estimate cardiometabolic risk profile of chinese adults with diabetes is also useful to reveal the personal genomics of chinese american124 in this study all subjects are over 18 years old and noninstitutionalized results derived from a complex multistage probability sampling design show that 12607 out of 98658 chinese adults are suffering from diabetes based on the criteria of 2010 american diabetes association in addition the study reaches a conclusion that for those chinese adults defined with diabetes cardiometabolic risk factors are highly prevalent including metabolic syndrome systolic blood pressure that is higher than 140mmhg low fruit and vegetable intake lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol that is higher than 110 mgdl the circumstance of asian american population is informative in a way that some knowledge about chinese american can be inferred from it the statistics of diabetes in asian american population reveals that approximately 10 of the entire population are diabetic and in which 9095 are type 2 diabetes125 the current situation is that there are some challenges in diagnosing diabetes in many asian americans the main obstacle is that many clinical features along with risks factors associated with diabetes are obtained from studies that focus on caucasian populations which might result in misdiagnoses between type 1 and type 2 diabetes for asian americans in fact the reason why classic features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in america might not apply to asian american population is about shared absence of common hla drdq genotype low prevalence of positive antiislet antibodies and low bmi in both types of diabetes126 some other studies have pointed out that for people of asian descent and without diabetes their insulin resistance levels are higher than nondiabetic people of caucasian descent thus asian americans are relatively more predisposed to develop type 2 diabetes this suggests that insulin resistance rather than body mass index bmi should be the targeted while making diagnoses a potential biomarker to identify diabetes in young asian american population is adipocyte fatty acid binding protein that has a strong association with insulin resistance but is independent of adiposity nevertheless more research studies should be carried out in order to confirm such finding with further applying the above outcome on the population of chinese americans it is rational that there is a higher tendency for type 2 diabetes among this group of people who also face the challenge of correct diagnosis in america to bring up a new topic genetic mental illness is stigmatized in china a study compares the attitude of chinese american towards mental illness with genetic causes and that of european american it finds out that there is a perception of eugenics existing among chinese americans127 consequently in order to reduce the stigma in the society more efforts should be devoted to this population the journal launched by the above study highlights the idea of genetic essentialism namely genes are largely deterministic of individual characteristics and behavior there is a separation between the normal and the deviant which drives the process of stigma labeling on the other hand since genetic diseases can be passed on from one generation to another some mental illnesses are shared in a family stigmatizing all members involved another viewpoint relevant to genetic essentialism is that since genes are perceived by the common people as difficult to modify genetic mental illness is likely to persist and so is the stigma as a result the mindset of many chinese americans is formulated as diseases with genetic causes being more serious than those without the same journal also delivers some hypotheses made on the basis of the long history of eugenics in china first chinese americans are more in favor of eugenic policies than european americans secondly more stigma would be generated towards genetic attributions of any diseases in chinese american population china used to implement restrictions on marriage licenses to people with genetic illnesses which has made the attitude of chinese american towards premarital genetic screening more supportive especially when facing a chance of genetic defects moreover from the perspective of this group of people knowing whether a marriage partner has family history of mental illness with genetic basis is fairly important notable
