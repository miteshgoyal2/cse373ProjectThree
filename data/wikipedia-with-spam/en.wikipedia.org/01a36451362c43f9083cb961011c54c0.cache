had become much deeper in tone notably one of skywriters songs touch originally recorded by the supremes in 1971 features michael and jermaine singing about satisfying a woman in bed as such touch was one of the most controversial singles michael sung on until his solo career took off again in the 1980s7 michael at this point was frustrated with the direction he and his brothers were going in and complained to motowns staff producers and writers about the kind of music they were doing the brothers were openly discouraged by the style they were receiving from motown writers also by this point all five brothers were writing their own material but motown prevented them from recording their own compositions the frustration was showcased most openly by the album cover where all five brothers solemnly looked at the camera around an early1900sera airplane it was the bands least successful album to date because of only one top 20 single and lack of promotion because the boys were on tour at
