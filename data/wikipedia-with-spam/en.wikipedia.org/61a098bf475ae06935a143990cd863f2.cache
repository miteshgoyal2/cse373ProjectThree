zonbi is a fictional undead being created through the reanimation of a human corpse zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works the term comes from haitian folklore where a zombie is a dead body reanimated through various methods most commonly magic modern depictions of zombies do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke science fictional methods such as carriers radiation mental diseases vectors viruses scientific accidents etc12 the english word zombie is first recorded in 1819 in a history of brazil by the poet robert southey in the form of zombi3 the oxford english dictionary gives the origin of the word as west african and compares it to the kongo words nzambi god and zumbi fetish one of the first books to expose western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was the magic island by wb seabrook in 1929 this is the sensationalized account of a narrator who encounters voodoo cults in haiti and their resurrected thralls time claimed that the book introduced zombi into us speech4 zombies have a complex literary heritage with antecedents ranging from richard matheson and h p lovecraft to mary shelleys frankenstein drawing on european folklore of the undead in 1932 victor halperin directed white zombie a horror film starring bela lugosi here zombies are depicted as mindless unthinking henchmen under the spell of an evil magician zombies often still using this voodooinspired rationale were initially uncommon in cinema but their appearances continued sporadically through the 1930s to the 1960s with notable films including i walked with a zombie 1943 and plan 9 from outer space 1959 a new version of the zombie distinct from that described in haitian folklore has also emerged in popular culture during the latter half of the twentieth century this zombie is taken largely from george a romeros seminal film night of the living dead1 which was in turn partly inspired by richard mathesons 1954 novel i am legend56 the word zombie is not used in night of the living dead but was applied later by fans7 the monsters in the film and its sequels such as dawn of the dead and day of the dead as well as its many inspired works such as return of the living dead and zombi 2 are usually hungry for human flesh although return of the living dead introduced the popular concept of zombies eating brains the zombie apocalypse

rebel leader named zumbi and the etymology of his name in nzambi3 the oxford english dictionary gives the origin of the word as west african and compares it to the kongo words nzambi god and zumbi fetish in haitian folklore a zombie haitian french zombi haitian creole zonbi is an animated corpse raised by magical means such as witchcraft8 the concept has been popularly associated with the religion of voodoo but it plays no part in that faiths formal practices how the creatures in contemporary zombie films came to be called zombies is not fully clear the film night of the living dead made no spoken reference to its undead antagonists as zombies describing them instead as ghouls though ghouls which derive from arabic folklore are demons not undead although george romero used the term ghoul in his original scripts in later interviews he used the term zombie the word zombie is used exclusively by romero in his 1978 script for his sequel dawn of the dead9 including once in dialog according to george romero film critics were influential in associating the term zombie to his creatures and especially the french magazine cahiers du cinéma he eventually accepted this linkage even though he remained convinced at the time that zombies corresponded to the undead slaves of haitian voodoo as depicted in bela lugosis white zombie10 folk beliefs haitian tradition a depiction of a zombie at twilight in a field of sugar cane zombies are featured widely in haitian rural folklore as dead persons physically revived by the act of necromancy of a bokor a sorcerer or witch the bokor is opposed by the houngan or priest and the mambo or priestess of the formal voodoo religion a zombie remains under the control of the bokor as a personal slave having no will of its own the haitian tradition also includes an incorporeal type of zombie the zombie astral which is a part of the human soul a bokor can capture a zombie astral to enhance his spiritual power a zombie astral can also be sealed inside a specially decorated bottle by a bokor and sold to a client to bring luck healing or business success it is believed that god eventually will reclaim the zombies soul so the zombie is a temporary spiritual entity11 it has been suggestedwho that the two types of zombie reflect soul dualism a belief of haitian voodoo each type of legendary zombie is therefore missing one half of its soul the flesh or the spirit12 the zombie belief has its roots in traditions brought to haiti by enslaved africans and their subsequent experiences in the new world it was thought that the voodoo deity baron samedi would gather them from their grave to bring them to a heavenly afterlife in africa guinea unless they had offended him in some way in which case they would be forever a slave after death as a zombie a zombie could also be saved by feeding them salt a number of scholars have pointed out the significance of the zombie figure as a metaphor for the history of slavery in haiti13 while most scholars have associated the haitian zombie with african cultures a connection has also been suggested to the islands indigenous taíno people partly based on an early account of native shamanist practices written by the hieronymite monk ramón pané a companion of christopher columbus141516 the haitian zombie phenomenon first attracted widespread international attention during the united states occupation of haiti 1915–1934 when a number of case histories of purported zombies began to emerge the first popular book covering the topics was william seabrooks the magic island 1929 seabrooke cited article 246 of the haitian criminal code which was passed in 1864 asserting that it was an official recognition of zombies this passage was later used in promotional materials for the 1932 film white zombie17 also shall be qualified as attempted murder the employment which may be made by any person of substances which without causing actual death produce a lethargic coma more or less prolonged if after the administering of such substances the person has been buried the act shall be considered murder no matter what result follows18 in 1937 while researching folklore in haiti zora neale hurston encountered the case of a woman who appeared in a village a family claimed she was felicia felixmentor a relative who had died and been buried in 1907 at the age of 29 the woman was examined by a doctor xrays indicated that she did not have a leg fracture that felixmentor was known to have had19 hurston pursued rumors that affected persons were given a powerful psychoactive drug but she was unable to locate individuals willing to offer much information she wrote what is more if science ever gets to the bottom of vodou in haiti and africa it will be found that some important medical secrets still unknown to medical science give it its power rather than gestures of ceremony20 african and related legends a central or west african origin for the haitian zombie has been postulated based on two etymologies in the kongo language nzambi god and zumbi fetish this root helps form the names of several deities including the kongo creator deity nzambi a mpungu and the louisiana serpent deity li grand zombi a local version of the haitian damballa but it is in fact a generic word for a divine spirit21 the common african conception of beings under these names is more similar to the incorporeal zombie astral11 as in the kongo nkisi spirits a related but also often incorporeal undead being is the jumbee of the englishspeaking caribbean considered to be of the same etymology22 in the french west indies also local zombies are recognized but these are of a more general spirit nature23 the idea of physical zombielike creatures is present in some south african cultures where they are called xidachane in sothotsonga and maduxwane in venda in some communities it is believed that a dead person can be zombified by a small child24 it is said that the spell can be broken by a powerful enough sangoma25 it is also believed in some areas of south africa that witches can zombify a person by killing and possessing the victims body in order to force it into slave labor26 after rail lines were built to transport migrant workers stories emerged about witch trains these trains appeared ordinary but were staffed by zombified workers controlled by a witch the trains would abduct a person boarding at night and the person would then either be turned into a zombified worker or beaten and thrown from the train a distance away from the original location26 evolution of the zombie archetype pulliam and fonseca 2014 and walz 2006 trace the zombie lineage back to ancient mesopotamia2728 in the descent of ishtar the goddess ishtar threatens if you do not open the gate for me to come in i shall smash the door and shatter the bolt i shall smash the doorpost and overturn the doors i shall raise up the dead and they shall eat the living and the dead shall outnumber the living29 she repeats this same threat in a slightly modified form in the epic of gilgamesh30 the actor t p cooke as frankensteins monster in an 1823 stage production of the novel frankenstein by mary shelley while not a zombie novel in particular prefigures many 20thcentury ideas about zombies in that the resurrection of the dead is portrayed as a scientific process rather than a mystical one and that the resurrected dead are degraded and more violent than their living selves frankenstein published in 1818 has its roots in european folklore31 whose tales of vengeful dead also informed the evolution of the modern conception of the vampire later notable 19thcentury stories about the avenging undead included ambrose bierces the death of halpin frayser and various gothic romanticism tales by edgar allan poe though their works could not be properly considered zombie fiction the supernatural tales of bierce and poe would prove influential on later writers such as h p lovecraft by lovecrafts own admission32 in the 1920s and early 1930s the american horror author h p lovecraft wrote several novellae that explored the undead theme cool air in the vault and the outsider all deal with the undead but lovecrafts herbert west–reanimator 1921 helped define zombies in popular culture33 this series of short stories featured herbert west a mad scientist who attempts to revive human corpses with mixed results notably the resurrected dead are uncontrollable mostly mute primitive and extremely violent though they are not referred to as zombies their portrayal was prescient anticipating the modern conception of zombies by several decadescitation needed edgar rice burroughs similarly depicted animated corpses in the second book of his venus series again without ever using the terms zombie or undead avenging zombies would feature prominently in the early 1950s ec comics which george a romero would later claim as an influence the comics including tales from the crypt vault of horror and weird science featured avenging undead in the gothic tradition quite regularly including adaptations of lovecrafts stories which included in the vault cool air and herbert west–reanimator34 richard mathesons 1954 novel i am legend although classified as a vampire story would nonetheless have definitive impact on the zombie genre by way of george a romero the novel and its 1964 film adaptation the last man on earth which concern a lone human survivor waging war against a world of vampires would by romeros own admission greatly influence his 1968 lowbudget film night of the living dead3536 a work that would prove to be more influential on the concept of zombies than any literary or cinematic work before it tor johnson as a zombie with his victim in cult movie plan 9 from outer space 1959 origins of zombie beliefs chemical hypothesis several decades after hurstons work wade davis a harvard ethnobotanist presented a pharmacological case for zombies in a 1983 paper in the journal of ethnopharmacology37 and later in two popular books the serpent and the rainbow 1985 and passage of darkness the ethnobiology of the haitian zombie 1988 davis traveled to haiti in 1982 and as a result of his investigations claimed that a living person can be turned into a zombie by two special powders being introduced into the blood stream usually via a wound the first coup de poudre french powder strike includes tetrodotoxin ttx a powerful and frequently fatal neurotoxin found in the flesh of the pufferfish order tetraodontidae the second powder consists of deliriant drugs such as datura together these powders were said to induce a deathlike state in which the will of the victim would be entirely subjected to that of the bokor davis also popularized the story of clairvius narcisse who was claimed to have succumbed to this practice the most ethically questioned and least scientifically explored ingredient of the powders is part of a recently buried childs brain383940verification needed the process described by davis was an initial state of deathlike suspended animation followed by reawakening — typically after being buried — into a psychotic state the psychosis induced by the drug and psychological trauma was hypothesised by davis to reinforce culturally learned beliefs and to cause the individual to reconstruct their identity as that of a zombie since they knew they were dead and had no other role to play in the haitian society societal reinforcement of the belief was hypothesized by davis to confirm for the zombie individual the zombie state and such individuals were known to hang around in graveyards exhibiting attitudes of low affect daviss claim has been criticized particularly the suggestion that haitian witch doctors can keep zombies in a state of pharmacologically induced trance for many years41 symptoms of ttx poisoning range from numbness and nausea to paralysis — particularly of the muscles of the diaphragm — unconsciousness and death but do not include a stiffened gait or a deathlike trance according to psychologist terence hines the scientific community dismisses tetrodotoxin as the cause of this state and davis assessment of the nature of the reports of haitian zombies is viewed as overly credulous42 social hypothesis scottish psychiatrist r d laing highlighted the link between social and cultural expectations and compulsion in the context of schizophrenia and other mental illness suggesting that schizogenesis may account for some of the psychological aspects of zombification43 particularly this suggests cases where schizophrenia manifests a state of catatonia roland littlewood professor of anthropology and psychiatry published a study supporting a social explanation of the zombie phenomenon in the medical journal the lancet in 199744 the social explanation sees observed cases of people identified as zombies as a culturebound syndrome45 with a particular cultural form of adoption practiced in haiti that unites the homeless and mentally ill with grieving families who see them as their returned lost loved ones as littlewood summarizes his findings in an article in times higher education i came to the conclusion that although it is unlikely that there is a single explanation for all cases where zombies are recognised by locals in haiti the mistaken identification of a wandering mentally ill stranger by bereaved relatives is the most likely explanation in many cases people with a chronic schizophrenic illness brain damage or learning disability are not uncommon in rural haiti and they would be particularly likely to be identified as zombies46 modern fiction in film and television see also list of zombie films films featuring zombies have been a part of cinema since the 1930s with white zombie directed by victor halperin in 1932 being one of the earliest examples47 with george a romeros night of the living dead 1968 the zombie trope began to be increasingly linked to consumerism and consumer culture48 today zombie films are released with such regularity at least 55 titles were released in 2014 alone49 that they can be viewed as a separate subgenre of horror film50 voodoorelated zombie themes have also appeared in espionage or adventure themed works outside the horror genre for example the original jonny quest series 1964 and the james bond novel and movie live and let die both feature caribbean villains who falsely claim the voodoo power of zombification in order to keep others in fear of them george a romero and the modern zombie film see

influenced by haitian zombie vampire ghoul a young zombie kyra schon feeding on human flesh from night of the living dead 1968 the modern conception of the zombie owes itself almost entirely to george a romeros 1968 film night of the living dead15152 in his films romero bred the zombie with the vampire and what he got was the hybrid vigour of a ghoulish plague monster53 this entailed an apocalyptic vision of monsters that have come to be known as romero zombies roger ebert of the chicago suntimes chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film i dont think the younger kids really knew what hit them complained ebert they were used to going to movies sure and theyd seen some horror movies before sure but this was something else according to ebert the film affected the audience immediately the kids in the audience were stunned there was almost complete silence the movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through and had become unexpectedly terrifying there was a little girl across the aisle from me maybe nine years old who was sitting very still in her seat and crying54 romeros reinvention of zombies is notable in terms of its thematics he used zombies not just for their own sake but as a vehicle to criticize realworld social ills—such as government ineptitude bioengineering slavery greed and exploitation—while indulging our postapocalyptic fantasies55 night was the first of six films in romeros living dead series its first sequel dawn of the dead was released in 1978 lucio fulcis zombi 2 was released just months after dawn of the dead as an ersatz sequel dawn of the dead was released in several other countries as zombi or zombie1 1980s and 1990s the 1981 film hell of the living dead referenced a mutagenic gas as a source of zombie contagion an idea also used in dan obannons 1985 film return of the living dead return of the living dead featured zombies that hungered specifically for brains the mid1980s produced few zombie films of note perhaps the most notable entry the evil dead series while highly influential are not technically zombie films but films about demonic possession despite the presence of the undead 1985s reanimator loosely based on the lovecraft story stood out in the genre achieving nearly unanimous critical acclaim56 and becoming a modest success nearly outstripping romeros day of the dead for box office returns after the mid1980s the subgenre was mostly relegated to the underground notable entries include director peter jacksons ultragory film braindead 1992 released as dead alive in the us bob balabans comic 1993 film my boyfriends back where a selfaware high school boy returns to profess his love for a girl and his love for human flesh and michele soavis dellamorte dellamore

highest audience ratings in the united states for any show on broadcast or cable with an average of 56 million viewers in the 18 to 49yearold demographic65 zombie apocalypse main article zombie apocalypse intimately tied to the concept of the modern zombie is the zombie apocalypse the breakdown of society as a result of an initial zombie outbreak that spreads this archetype has emerged as a prolific subgenre of apocalyptic fiction and has been portrayed in many zombierelated media after night of the living dead66 in a zombie apocalypse a widespread usually global rise of zombies hostile to human life engages in a general assault on civilization victims of zombies may become zombies themselves this causes the outbreak to become an exponentially growing crisis the spreading phenomenon swamps normal military and law enforcement organizations leading to the panicked collapse of civilized society until only isolated pockets of survivors remain scavenging for food and supplies in a world reduced to a preindustrial hostile wilderness possible causes for zombie behavior in a modern population can be attributed to viruses bacteria or other phenomena that reduce the mental capacity of humans causing them to behave in a very primitive and destructive fashion subtext the usual subtext of the zombie apocalypse is that civilization is inherently vulnerable to the unexpected and that most individuals if desperate enough cannot be relied on to comply with the authors ethos the narrative of a zombie apocalypse carries strong connections to the turbulent social landscape of the united states in the 1960s when night of the living dead provided an indirect commentary on the dangers of conformity a theme also explored in the novel the body snatchers 1954 and associated film invasion of the body snatchers 19566768 many also feel that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxieties about the end of the world69 one scholar concluded that more than any other monster zombies are fully and literally apocalyptic they signal the end of the world as we have known it66 while zombie apocalypse scenarios are secular they follow a religious pattern based on christian ideas of an endtimes war and messiah70 due to a large number of thematic films and video games the idea of a zombie apocalypse has entered the mainstream and many fans have begun making efforts to prepare for the hypothetical future zombie apocalypse such efforts include creating weapons and selling educational material informing people how to survive a zombie outbreak while most of these are tongueincheek and do not represent an authentic belief that a zombie apocalypse in the near future is likely7172 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc have used the fictional scenario to demonstrate survival and emergencypreparedness techniques that may be useful in a realworld setting story elements john a russo portrays a zombie in night of the living dead initial contacts with zombies are extremely dangerous and traumatic causing shock panic disbelief and possibly denial hampering survivors ability to deal with hostile encounters73 the response of authorities to the threat is slower than its rate of growth giving the zombie plague time to expand beyond containment this results in the collapse of the given society zombies take full control while small groups of the living must fight for their survival73 the stories usually follow a single group of survivors caught up in the sudden rush of the crisis the narrative generally progresses from the onset of the zombie plague then initial attempts to seek the aid of authorities the failure of those authorities through to the sudden catastrophic collapse of all largescale organization and the characters subsequent attempts to survive on their own such stories are often squarely focused on the way their characters react to such an extreme catastrophe and how their personalities are changed by the stress often acting on more primal motivations fear selfpreservation than they would display in normal life7374 movie poster for the 1968 film night of the living dead in anime and manga there has been a growth in

theoretical zombie infections to test epidemiology modeling one study found that all humans end up turned or dead this is because the main epidemiological risk of zombies besides the difficulties of neutralizing them is that their population just keeps increasing generations of humans merely surviving still have a tendency to feed zombie populations resulting in gross outnumbering the researchers
