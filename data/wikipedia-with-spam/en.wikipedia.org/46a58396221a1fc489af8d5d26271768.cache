mountain range of western north america extending from southern british columbia through washington and oregon to northern california it includes both nonvolcanic mountains such as the north cascades and the notable volcanoes known as the high cascades the small part of the range in british columbia is referred to as the canadian cascades or locally as the cascade mountains the latter term is also sometimes used by washington residents to refer to the washington section of the cascades in addition to north cascades the more usual us term as in north cascades national park the highest peak in the range is mount rainier in washington at 14411 feet 4392 m the cascades are part of the pacific oceans ring of fire the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the pacific ocean all of the eruptions in the contiguous united states over the last 200 years have been from cascade volcanoes the two most recent were lassen peak from 1914 to 1921 and a major eruption of mount st helens in 1980 minor eruptions of mount st helens have also occurred since most recently from 2004 to 20081 the cascade range is a part of the american cordillera a nearly continuous chain of mountain ranges

nicola and thompson rivers in british columbia the fraser river separates the cascades from the coast mountains2 the highest volcanoes of the cascades known as the high cascades3 dominate their surroundings often standing twice the height of the nearby mountains they often have a visual height height above nearby crestlines of one mile or more the highest peaks such as the 14411foot 4392 m mount rainier dominate their surroundings for 50 to 100 miles 80 to 161 km the northern part of the range north of mount rainier is known as the north cascades in the united states but is formally named the cascade mountains north of the canada–united states border reaching to the northern extremity of the cascades at lytton mountain4 overall the north cascades and canadian cascades are extremely rugged even the lesser peaks are steep and glaciated and valleys are quite low relative to peaks and ridges so there is great local relief5 the southern part of the canadian cascades particularly the skagit range is geologically and topographically similar to the north cascades while the northern and northeastern parts are less glaciated and more plateaulike resembling nearby areas of the thompson plateau2 because of the ranges proximity to the pacific ocean and the regions prevailing westerly winds precipitation is substantial especially on the western slopes due to orographic lift with annual snow accumulations of up to 1000 inches 25000 mm in some areas mount baker in washington recorded a worldrecord singleseason snowfall in the winter of 1998–99 with 1140 inches 29000 mm6 prior to that year mount rainier held the world record for snow accumulation at paradise in 1978 it is not uncommon for some places in the cascades to have over 500 inches 13000 mm of annual snow accumulation such as at lake helen near lassen peak7 most of the high cascades are therefore white with snow and ice yearround the western slopes are densely covered with douglasfir pseudotsuga menziesii western hemlock tsuga heterophylla and red alder alnus rubra8 while the drier eastern slopes feature mostly ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa with some western larch larix occidentalis mountain hemlock tsuga mertensiana and subalpine fir abies lasiocarpa and subalpine larch larix lyallii at higher elevations9 annual rainfall is as low as 9 inches 230 mm on the eastern foothills due to a rain shadow effect10 the columbia gorge marks where the columbia river splits the cascade range between the states of washington and oregon beyond the eastern foothills is an arid plateau that was largely created 17 to 14 million years ago by the many flows of the columbia river basalt group together these sequences of fluid volcanic rock form the 200000squaremile 520000 km2 columbia plateau in eastern washington oregon and parts of western idaho11 the columbia river gorge is the only major break of the range in the united states when the cascades began to rise 7 million years ago in the pliocene the columbia river drained the relatively low columbia plateau as the range grew erosion from the columbia river was able to keep pace creating the gorge and major pass seen today the gorge also exposes uplifted and warped layers of basalt from the plateau1213 historyedit indigenous peoples have inhabited the area for thousands of years and developed their own myths and legends about the cascades in these legends st helens with its pre1980 graceful appearance was regarded as a beautiful maiden for whom hood and adams feuded14 native tribes also developed their own names for the high cascades and many of the smaller peaks including tahoma the lushootseed name for mount rainier15 koma kulshan or simply kulshan for mount baker16 and louwalaclough meaning smoking mountain for mount st helens14 in early 1792 british navigator george vancouver explored puget sound and gave english names to the high mountains he saw mount baker was named for vancouvers third lieutenant joseph baker although the first european to see it was manuel quimper who named it la gran montaña del carmelo great mount carmel in 179017 mount rainier was named after admiral peter rainier later in 1792 vancouver had his lieutenant william robert broughton explore the lower columbia river he named mount hood after lord samuel hood an admiral of the royal navy mount st helens was sighted by vancouver in may 1792 from near the mouth of the columbia river it was named for alleyne fitzherbert 1st baron st helens a british diplomat18 vancouvers expedition did not however name the mountain range which contained these peaks he referred to it simply as the eastern snowy range earlier spanish explorers called it sierra nevadas meaning snowy mountains17 west side view of mount shuksan in summer as seen from artist point in washington in 1805 the lewis and clark expedition passed through the cascades on the columbia river which for many years was the only practical way to pass that part of the range they were the first nonindigenous people to see mount adams but they thought it was mount st helens when they later saw mount st helens they thought it was mount rainier19 on their return trip lewis and clark spotted a high but distant snowy pinnacle that they named for the sponsor of the expedition us president thomas jefferson20 lewis and clark called the cascade range the western mountains21 the lewis and clark expedition and the many settlers and traders that followed met their last obstacle to their journey at the cascades rapids in the columbia river gorge a feature on the river now submerged beneath the bonneville reservoir before long the great whitecapped mountains that loomed above the rapids were called the mountains by the cascades and later simply as the cascades the earliest attested use of the name cascade range is in the writings of botanist david douglas22 mount hood is the tallest point in the us state of oregon in 1814 alexander ross a fur trader with the north west company seeking a viable route across the mountains explored and crossed the northern cascades between fort okanogan and puget sound his report of the journey is vague about the route taken he followed the lower methow river into the mountains he might have used cascade pass to reach the skagit river ross was the first europeanamerican to explore the methow river area and likely the first to explore the stehekin river and bridge creek region due to the difficulty of crossing the northern cascades and the paucity of beaver furtrading companies made only a few explorations into the mountains north of the columbia river after ross23 exploration and settlement of the cascades region by europeans and americans was accelerated by the establishment of a major trading post of the hudsons bay company hbc at fort vancouver near todays portland oregon from this base hbc trapping parties traveled throughout the cascades in search of beaver and other furbearing animals for example using what became known as the siskiyou trail hudsons bay company trappers were the first nonnatives to explore the southern cascades in the 1820s and 1830s establishing trails which passed near crater lake mount mcloughlin medicine lake volcano mount shasta and lassen peak24 the coquihalla river in the canadian cascades the course of political history in the pacific northwest saw the spine of the cascade range being proposed as a boundary settlement during the oregon dispute of 1846 the united states rejected the proposal and insisted on the 49th parallel north which cuts across the range just north of mount baker throughout the period of dispute and up to the creation of the crown colony of british columbia in 1858 the hudsons bay companys york factory express route as well the route of fur brigades followed the okanogan river along the east edge of the cascades and the columbia river through the range passes across the range were not well known and little used naches pass was used for driving cattle and horses to fort nisqually yakima pass was also used by the hudsons bay company25 american settlement of the flanks of the coast range did not occur until the early 1840s at first only marginally following the oregon treaty the inward flux of migration from the oregon trail intensified and the passes and backvalleys of what is now the state of washington were explored and populated and it was not long after that railways followed despite its being traversed by several major freeways and rail lines and its lower flanks subjected to major logging in recent decades large parts of the range remain intense and forbidding alpine wilderness much of the northern half of the cascades from rainier north have been preserved by us national or british columbia provincial parks such as ec manning provincial park or other forms of protected area26 lassen peak in the california cascades southernmost volcano in the cascade range and part of lassen volcanic national park the canadian side of the range has a history that includes the fraser canyon gold rush of 1858–60 and its famous cariboo road as well as the older hudsons bay company brigade trail from the canyon to the interior the dewdney trail and older routes which connected east to the similkameen and okanagan valleys the southern mainline of the canadian pacific railway penetrated the range via the passes of the coquihalla river along one of the steepest and snowiest routes in the entire pacific cordillera near hope bc the railway roadbed and the othello tunnels now decommissioned are popular tourist recreation destinations for hiking and bicycling the pass is used by the coquihalla highway a government megaproject built as part of the expo 86 spending boom of the 1980s which is now the main route from the coast to the british columbia interior traffic formerly went via the fraser canyon to the west or via allison pass and manning park along highway 3 to the south near the border the 1980 eruption of mount st helens the barlow road was the first established land path for us settlers through the cascade range in 1845 and formed the final overland link for the oregon trail previously settlers had to raft down the treacherous rapids of the columbia river the road left the columbia at what is now hood river and passed along the south side of mount hood at what is now government camp terminating in oregon city there is an interpretive site there now at the end of the oregon trail the road was constructed as a toll road — 5 per wagon — and was very successful in addition the applegate trail was created to allow settlers to avoid rafting down the columbia river the trail used the path of the california trail to northcentral nevada from there the trail headed northwest into northern california and continued northwest towards todays ashland oregon from there settlers would head north along the established siskiyou trail into the willamette valley with the exception of the 1915 eruption of remote lassen peak in northern california the range was quiet for more than a century then on may 18 1980 the dramatic eruption of littleknown mount st helens shattered the quiet and brought the worlds attention to the range geologists were also concerned that the st helens eruption was a sign that longdormant cascade volcanoes might become active once more as in the period from 1800 to 1857 when a total of eight erupted none have erupted since st helens but precautions are being taken nevertheless such as the mount rainier volcano lahar warning system in pierce county washington27 geologyedit see also cascade volcanic arc geology of the cascade rangerelated plate tectonics the cascade range is made up of a band of thousands of very small shortlived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes like mount st helens that dominate the landscape28 the cascade volcanoes define the pacific northwest section of the ring of fire an array of volcanoes that rim the pacific ocean the ring of fire is also known for its frequent earthquakes the volcanoes and earthquakes arise from a common source subduction where the dense juan de fuca oceanic plate plunges beneath the north american plate29 as the oceanic slab sinks deep into the earths interior beneath the continental plate high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape the water vapor rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate causing some of the mantle to melt this newly formed magma rises toward the earths surface to erupt forming a chain of volcanoes the cascade volcanic arc above the subduction zone29 human usesedit soil conditions for farming are generally good especially downwind of volcanoes this is largely because volcanic rocks are often rich in potassium bearing minerals such as orthoclase and decay easily volcanic debris especially lahars also have a leveling effect and the storage of water in the form of snow and ice is also important these snowcapped mountains such as mt hood and mt bachelor are used as ski resorts in the late winter much of that water eventually flows into reservoirs where it is used for recreation before its potential energy is captured to generate hydroelectric power before being used to irrigate crops because of the abundance of powerful streams many of the major westward rivers off the cascades have been dammed to provide hydroelectric power one of these ross dam on the skagit river created a reservoir which spans the border southeast of hope british columbia extending 2 miles 32 km into canada at the foot of the southeast flank of mount baker at concrete washington the baker river is dammed to form lake shannon and baker lake in addition there is a largely untapped amount of geothermal power that can be generated from the cascades the us geological survey geothermal research program has been investigating this potential some of this energy is already being used in places like klamath falls oregon where volcanic steam is used to heat public buildings30 the highest recorded temperature found in the range is 510 °f 266 °c at 3075 feet 937 m below newberry volcanos caldera floor ecologyedit ovalleaf blueberry on mount pilchuck
