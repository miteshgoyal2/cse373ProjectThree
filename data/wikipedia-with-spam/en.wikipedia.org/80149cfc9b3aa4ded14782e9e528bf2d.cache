attending roman catholic parochial schools and eventually briefly attended st marys college kansas3 briefly a chicago policeman he was involved in the raid that led to the haymarket riot4 he then became a traveling actor and landed in seattle washington in 1889 by 1891 he was manager of the peoples theater a box house in the wideopen restricted district below yesler way in what is now seattles pioneer square neighborhood5 a friendly outgoing but resolutely sober man in a rowdy environment he dealt cards but did not play made money off the sale of liquor but did not drink managed a business whose profits depended on its female performers hustling drinks and in murray morgans words if the girls wished to peddle more personal wares management did not object but was reputed to be a faithful family man5 considine decided that he could outcompete the other box houses by raising the level of entertainment hiring professional actresses for the stage and letting other girls work the floor and the dark booths he prospered greatly for a while until he was brought down by the panic of 1893 the ensuing economic depression and the 1894 election of an antivice administration in seattle he briefly attempted to run the peoples as a proper theater he ran a box house in spokane washington before a similar antivice administration shut him down and he returned to seattle and lay relatively low until the klondike gold rush 1897 brought back an open town administration by february 1898 he had leased back the peoples theater and was back in the business6 along with the rest of seattle mining the miners78 rise to prominenceedit considine brought variety entertainment in seattle to a new level by importing farida mazar spyropoulos famous as little egypt from the worlds columbian exposition the chicago worlds fair of 1893 the peoples theater and its rivals posted brass bands outdoors early in the evening to draw in customers salvation army bands merely upped the level of chaos business was good910 considine also obtained an interest in a nearby saloon billy the mugs at the corner of second and washington he operated the rooms above it as the owl club rooms a gambling joint11 he established himself as a power in seattle the statesman the boss sport ward heeler of the wideopen fourth ward he became a power in town and was locally famous for his personal sobriety his closest thing to a vice was chewing gum his burly brother tom and equally burly associate doc shaughnessy were known as his muscle and bodyguards shaughnessy backed by considine started a physical culture institute12 conflict with wyatt earpedit considine was not just big in entertainment he was the citys gambling kingpin as well in november 1899 wyatt earp left the dexter saloon in nome alaska for about a year and went to seattle washington with a plan to open a saloon and gambling room on november 25 1899 the seattle star described him as a man of great reputation among the toughs and criminals inasmuch as he formerly walked the streets of a rough frontier mining town with big pistols stuck in his belt spurs on his boots and a devilmaycare expression upon his official face the seattle daily times was less full of praise announcing in a very small article that he had a reputation in arizona as a bad man13 he faced considerable opposition to his plan from considine who controlled all three gaming operations in town although gambling was illegal considine had worked out an agreement with police chief cs reed but earp partnered with an established local gambler name thomas urguhart and they opened the union club saloon and gambling operation in seattles pioneer square the seattle star noted two weeks later that earps saloon was earning a large following considine unsuccessfully tried to intimidate earp but his saloon continued to prosper on march 23 1900 the state of washington filed charges against several gamblers including earp and his partner the clubs furnishings were confiscated and burned the earps returned briefly to san francisco in april 1900 but within a couple of months wyatt and josephine returned to oregon and caught the ss alliance for alaska1478 considine continued as king of the seattle gambling scene afterward15 facing off with the police chiefedit as the gold rush era began to wane the open town atmosphere again became a matter of controversy a former employee of considines william l meredith who had followed considine to spokane returned to his earlier job as a policeman meredith and considine had slowly become enemies and when meredith became police chief he started an antivice campaign which was really more of an anticonsidine campaign he started to enforce laws against considines business while leaving considines rivals alone1617 the seattle postintelligencer lashed meredith for not coming down hard enough on vice an ambitious politician named john wilson started a law and order league charging meredith and mayor thomas j humes with a variety of offenses the seattle times squared off in defense of meredith and humes but the real duel was between meredith and considine when considine brought forth evidence that meredith was corrupt the pi played this testimony for as much as it was worth perhaps more18 matters escalated meredith accused considine of an affair with mamie jenkins a 17yearold contortionist who performed at his theater stating that she had become pregnant and that meredith himself had paid for her abortion this was almost certainly a slander she appears to have ruptured herself while performing19 by this time the peoples did not even have any closed boxes but meredith tried to shut it down under an antiboxhouse ordinance while letting actual box houses continue to operate the city council decided to believe reports that meredith was corrupt and his resignation was forced protesting a star chamber investigation meredith resigned while considine consulted with his lawyers about further action against meredith meredith got hold of a doublebarrelled 12gauge shotgun20 the shootoutedit go guys drugstore about a year before the shootout on the morning of tuesday june 25 1901 considine dropped by merediths lawyers to inform them that if meredith would not retract the claim about mamie jenkins he was ready to sue for libel he and his brother tom wandered down from their and the lawyers first hill neighborhood he dropped by the courthouse hoping to sort out his businesss legal problems the prosecuting attorney was out at the courthouse a friend warned him that meredith was after him and advised him to arm himself he went about his day—shooting some pool with his brother dropping by the office to read his mail deciding to knock off early because of a sore throat forewarned he picked up a 38 revolver that normally remained at work21 meanwhile meredith had acquired a virtual arsenal besides the shotgun which he had wrapped in butcher paper he was carrying a 32 colt in a 45 frame and a 38caliber shortbarreled revolver he had also placed silver dollars strategically around his vest presumably for armor he spoke openly of the town not being big enough to hold both him and considine22 meredith waited at the corner of yesler and occidental where he expected the considines would go to catch the streetcar back up the hill he spotted the considines headed into go guys drugstore a block to the east where john meant to pick up something for his throat they were standing just outside the store talking with one patrolman merford who meredith had suspended according to gordon newell for pocketing part of a protection payment earmarked for meredith himself2324 meredith caught up to them just outside the store took pointblank aim at john considine with his shotgun and missed the dazed considine staggered into the store tom considine and merford were so taken aback that they hardly reacted at first meredith entered the store pursuing john considine2324 merediths next shot caught the back of considines neck wounded the arm of a messenger boy drinking a sarsaparilla at the soda fountain and nearly caught dr guy who hit the floor meredith dropped the shotgun and went for the revolver considine managed to grab meredith in a bear hug and drag him toward the entrance yelling out for help from his brother who finally realized what was happening tom grabbed merediths gun and smashed it into merediths skull more police arrived including sheriff cudihee tom grabbed one of their guns and drew down on them yelling stand back you sons of bitches2526 meanwhile john considine drew his gun on meredith who was clearly wounded but still moving and possibly reaching for another weapon considine shot meredith three times in the chest and neck killing him then handed his gun to sheriff cudihee and surrendered himself27 the trialedit while meredith had always been part of the open town faction his death made him a martyr for the closed town side at the considines trial the prosecution tried to make the case that the considines had started the gunfight however merediths outspoken statements in the 24 hours before the fight including they couldnt get a jury in king county that would convict me for killing considine helped to clarify any confusion as to what happened as did the testimony of the bestsituated eyewitnesses the jury took only three hours to reach an acquittal28 respectabilityedit considine soon reinvented himself as a respectable impresario north of the yesler way deadline in 1902 he bought into seattles first wellappointed movie theater edisons unique theater29 established 1897 partnering with the local distributor of edison phonograph records creating seattles first establishment to combine variety entertainment with movies and considines first dry establishment30 difficulty in obtaining firstrate acts to play a city so distant from the major concentrations of north american population led considine to establish one of the first vaudeville circuits quite possibly the very first with theaters in victoria vancouver portland bellingham everett yakima and spokane as well as seattle31 this was the worlds first popularly priced vaudeville chain with ten and twentycent admissions32 considine soon cut or played down his old ties to the restricted district he played a major role in one of the countrys rising fraternal organizations just before the turn of the century he and john cort whose career followed a similar trajectory had founded the independent order of good things which soon became the fraternal order of eagles foe a third founder h l leavitt soon bolted to the loyal order of moose in new york city in 1906 on foe business he met and teamed up with tammany boss big tim sullivan to form the sullivan–considine vaudeville circuit and associated nationwide booking agency33 at it peak the sullivan–considine circuit owned 20 theaters in the pacific northwest and was affiliated with 20 in california they also booked numerous theaters in the midwest34 while considine and cort had always been the friendliest of rivals considines rivalry with another seattlebased vaudeville impresario alexander pantages ran more to stealing each others acts or failing that literally stealing the acts equipment still they too maintained a cordial personal relationship their rivalry took place both on their home turf and on the national scene murray morgan characterizes their rivalry as that between a wellconnected savvy businessman considine and a hardworking uneducated genius pantages35 pantages simply had a better instinct than considine for what the public would pay to see and his total contempt for efforts to uplift public taste—and especially for efforts to impose new york tastes on the country at large—turned out to make good business sense when tim sullivan went insane in 1913 considine lost one of his main sources of clout and connections by 1914 pantages had clearly won out considine tried selling out to marcus loew whose easternusbased circuit had been allied with the western based sullivanconsidine circuit since 191136 the deal ultimately fell apart but a forfeited down payment gave considine quite an infusion of cash still with world war i clobbering access to international stars considines circuit fell apart and pantages bought up the pieces3738 all concerned eventually moved to los angeles which by then had firmly established itself as the west coast entertainment capital considine gained a foothold in the film industry39 son film producer john considine jr puttin on the ritz 1930 boys town 1938 married pantages daughter carmen40 their sons john and tim became successful movie and television actors4142 the original peoples theater buildingedit the entrance marked casino dancing near the left of this picture leads to the former peoples theater closeup of that entrance the 172 s washington street basement that housed considines original peoples theater survives although the building has lost its upper stories at the corner of second avenue south the remaining aboveground floor houses a pawnshop barneys loans43 and a longstanding gaydrag bar the double header the basement has housed a series of bars including an after hours venue known officially as the casino and unofficially as madame peabody’s dancing academy for young ladies44 and later the catwalk 1994–200545 a venue friendly to the sm crowd club heaven an upscale nightclub has occupied the space since 200646 the orpheum 1911edit a poster for a post1916 orpheum program at the moore theatre from 1911 the flagship of considines chain was the orpheum theatre at 3rd avenue and madison street in seattle designed by william kingsley the 500000 theater was constructed insofar as possible with materials and services obtained from within washington state the decorative wrought iron canopy extending from over the box office to the curb out became a fixture of the 3rd avenue landscape the lavish interior was awash in marble onyx and glass47 the murals of the equally lavish auditorium depicted classical and mythological themes scenes from the iliad and odyssey aesop and the 12 muses47 although the orpheum was touted at the time of its 5 may 1911 opening as americas most luxurious theater after 1916 it no longer was even the grandest vaudeville theater in the neighborhood alexander pantages opened an even larger and more opulent theater several blocks north at 3rd avenue and university street the orpheum vaudeville shows moved to the larger moore theatre although the orpheum continued to operate for many years variously showing live shows and movies47 it was renamed as the president theatre48 in the last years before it was torn down in 1949 it was used merely as a storage facility47 this orpheum was not seattles only theater by this name indeed it was considines third theater by this name in seattle the first had been one of considines first vaudeville theaters the second was a renaming of martin becks coliseum theater34 no relation to the surviving 1917 coliseum theater building designed by b marcus priteca for pantages49 a later orpheum also the work of priteca stood 1927–1967 at the corner of 5th avenue and stewart street now the site of the south tower of the westin
