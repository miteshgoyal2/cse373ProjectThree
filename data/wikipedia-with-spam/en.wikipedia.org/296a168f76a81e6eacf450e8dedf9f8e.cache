denver broncos uniform set from 1968–96 the logo was designed by edwin guy taylor of denver a contest was held through public service of denver to come up with a new logo for the team mr taylors submission was selected late in 1967 and adopted soon after the team briefly wore orange pants with the away jerseys between 1969–1971 and 1978–1979 when the broncos debuted in 1960 their original uniforms drew as much attention as their play on the field they featured white and mustard yellow jerseys with contrasting brown helmets brown pants and vertically striped socks two years later the team unveiled a new logo featuring a bucking horse and changed their team colors to orange royal blue and white the 1962 uniform consisted of white pants orange helmets and either orange or white jerseys67 in 1968 the broncos debuted a design that became known as the orange crush their logo was redesigned so that the horse was coming out of a d additionally the helmets were changed to royal blue with thin stripes placed onto the sleeves and other minor modifications were added from 1969–1971 and again from 1978–79 the team wore orange pants with their white jerseys68 the broncos wore their white jerseys at home throughout the 1971 season as well as for 1980 home games vs the san diego chargers and dallas cowboys the latter in hopes to bring out the blue jersey jinx which has followed the cowboys for decades it worked the broncos won 41–20 the broncos wore their white jerseys for 1983 home games vs the philadelphia eagles los angeles raiders and cincinnati bengals but would not wear white at home again for two decades — see next section6869 in 1994 in honor of the 75th anniversary season of the nfl the broncos wore their 1965 throwback uniforms for two games—a week

to use to this day the new logos and uniforms were unveiled on february 4 199770 navy blue replaced royal blue on the teams color scheme the current logo is a profile of a horses head with an orange mane and navy blue outlines71 the broncos popular live animal mascot thunder was the inspiration to incorporate a horsehead profile as part of the logo on the teams helmets72 during a february 4 1997 press conference introducing the new logo the team president and the art director for nike who were the creators of the new design described it as a powerful horse with a fiery eye and mane73 the broncos began wearing navy blue jerseys replacing their longtime orange jerseys that had been the teams predominant home jersey color since 1962 this new uniform design features a new word mark numbering font and a streak that runs up and down the sides of both the jerseys and the pants on the navy blue jerseys the streak is orange with an orange collar and white numerals trimmed in orange while on the road white jerseys the streak is navy blue with a thin orange accent strip on both sides a navy collar and navy numerals trimmed in orange when they debuted these uniforms were vilified by the press and fans until the broncos won their first ever super bowl in the new design that same season the navy blue jerseys served as the teams primary home jersey until the end of the 2011 season — see next section71 in 2002 the broncos introduced an alternate orange jersey that is a mirror image of the aforementioned navy blue jerseys but with orange and navy trading places like the road white jerseys the white pants with the navy blue streaks running down the sides are worn with this uniform this jersey was used only once in the 2002 and 2004 seasons and were used twice per season from 2008–2011 mike shanahan the teams head coach from 1995–2008 was not a big fan of the alternate orange jerseys74 the broncos previously wore orange jerseys as a throwback uniform in a thanksgiving day game at the dallas cowboys in 200175 the team also introduced navy blue pants in 2003 with orange side streaks to match with the navy blue jerseys though they were part of the uniform change in 1997 in fact they were worn for a couple of 1997 preseason games and most players wanted to wear them the only player who vetoed wearing them was john elway thereby delaying their eventual introduction76 from 2003–2011 these pants were primarily used for select primetime and lateseason home games excluding the 2008 season and since 2012 are used exclusively with the nowalternate navy blue jerseys — see next section on november 16 2003 the broncos wore their white jerseys at home for the first time since 1983 in a game vs the san diego chargers this was compensation for a uniform mixup after the teams first meeting at san diegos qualcomm stadium in week 2 earlier that season when the chargers were the team that was supposed to declare their uniform color the chargers were planning to wear their white jerseys but the visiting broncos came to the stadium in white and were fined 25000 by the nfl as a result when the two teams met at invesco field at mile high later that season week 11 the nfl allowed the visiting chargers to choose their uniform color in advance and they chose navy blue forcing the broncos to wear their white jerseys at home76 in 2009 in honor of their 50th anniversary season as one of the eight original american football league teams the broncos wore their 1960 throwback uniforms brown helmets mustard yellow and brown jerseys for games against two fellow afl rivals—a week 5 home game vs the new england patriots as well as the following week at the san diego chargers7778 2012–present beginning in 2012 the orange jerseys that served as the alternate colored jerseys from 2002–2011 became the primary home jersey while the navy blue jerseys that served as the primary home jersey from 1997–2011 switched to alternate designation the change was made due to overwhelming popularity with the fans who pressured the broncos to return to orange as the teams primary home jersey color71 since the 2012 uniform change the team has worn the alternate navy blue jerseys for at least one home game per season with the exception of 2013 in which the broncos wore their alternate navy blue uniforms for an october 6 2013 road game at the dallas cowboys79 the team will either wear the navy blue or the white pants — with the orange side stripes — to match with the alternate navy blue jerseys the team initially did not wear the white pants with the orange side stripes until a november 1 2015 game vs the green bay packers in which the broncos wore said design in order to match the uniform ensemble that was used during the teams super bowl xxxii win over the packers80 as the designated home team in super bowl 50 the broncos — who have an 0–4 super bowl record when using their standard orange jerseys — chose to wear their white jerseys as the designated home team81 in 2016 the broncos unveiled a new color rush uniform which the team wore for a thursday night game at the san diego chargers on october 13 2016 the uniform kit contained the following features orange pants which the team wore for the first time since 1979 orange socks and shoes along with blockstyle numerals trimmed in navy blue that mirrored the teams 1968–1996

chant incomplete every time the visiting team throws an incomplete pass83 the stadiums legendary homefield advantage is regarded as one of the best in the nfl especially during the playoffs the broncos had the best home record in pro football over a 32year span from 1974–2006 191–65–1 mile high stadium was one of the nfls loudest stadiums with steel flooring instead of concrete which may have given the broncos an advantage over opponents plus the advantage of altitude conditioning for the broncos in 2001 the team moved into invesco field at mile high built next to the former site of the sincedemolished mile high stadium sportswriter woody paige along with many of denvers fans however often refuse to call the new stadium by its full name preferring to use mile high stadium because of its storied history and sentimental import additionally the denver post had an official policy of referring to the stadium as simply mile high stadium in protest but dropped this policy in 200484 sports authority field has been the broncos home since 2001 prior to the 2011 season englewood coloradobased sporting goods retailer sports authority claimed the naming rights of invesco field which became known as sports authority field at mile high8586 however in the summer of 2016 sports authority went bankrupt and the broncos have been seeking a new corporate sponsor for their stadium ever since87 the altitude has also been attributed as part of the teams home success the stadium displays multiple references to the stadiums location of 5280 feet 1000 mi above sea level including a prominent mural just outside the visiting teams locker room the team training facility the uchealth training center formerly known as the paul d bowlen memorial broncos centre is a stateoftheart
