videos in lieu of performances from artists who were not available to perform live began to feature them regularly by the mid1970s in 1974 gary van haas vice president of televak corporation introduced a concept to distribute a music video channel to record stores across the united states and promoted the channel named music video tv to distributors and retailers in a may 1974 issue of billboard1011 the channel which featured video disc jockeys signed a deal with us cable in 1978 to expand its audience from retail to cable television the service was no longer active by the time mtv

w pittman who later became president and chief executive officer ceo of mtv networks12 pittman had testdriven the music format by producing and hosting a 15minute show album tracks on new york city television station wnbctv in the late 1970s pittmans boss warneramex executive vice president john lack had shepherded popclips a television series created by former monkeeturned solo artist michael nesmith whose attention had turned to the music video format in the late 1970s13 the inspiration for popclips came from a similar program on new zealands tvnz network named radio with pictures which premiered in 1976 the concept itself had been in the works since 1966 when major record companies began supplying the new zealand broadcasting corporation with promotional music clips to play on the air at no charge few artists made the long trip to new zealand to appear live launchedit the first images shown on mtv were a montage of the apollo 11 moon landing further information first music videos aired on mtv on saturday august 1 1981 at 1201 am eastern time mtv launched with the words ladies and gentlemen rock and roll spoken by john lack and played over footage of the first space shuttle launch countdown of columbia which took place earlier that year and of the launch of apollo 11 those words were immediately followed by the original mtv theme song a crunching rock tune composed by jonathan elias and john petersen playing over the american flag changed to show mtvs logo changing into various textures and designs mtv producers alan goodman and fred seibert used this public domain footage as a concept14 seibert said that they had originally planned to use neil armstrongs one small step quote but lawyers said that armstrong owned his name and likeness and that he had refused so the quote was replaced with a beeping sound15 a shortened version of the shuttle launch id ran at the top of every hour in various forms from mtvs first day until it was pulled in early 1986 in the wake of the challenger disaster16 the first music video shown on mtv was the buggles video killed the radio star originally only available to homes in new jersey17 this was followed by the video for pat benatars you better run sporadically the screen would go black when an employee at mtv inserted a tape into a vcr18 mtvs lower third graphics that appeared near the beginning and end of music videos would eventually use the recognizable kabel typeface for about 25 years but these graphics differed on mtvs first day of broadcast they were set in a different typeface and included information such as the year and record label name as programming chief robert w pittman recruited and managed a team for the launch that included tom freston who succeeded pittman as ceo of mtv

program director22 marcy brafman ronald e buzz brindle and robert morton kenneth m miller is credited as being the first technical director to officially launch mtv from its new york citybased network operations facility22 mtvs effect was immediate in areas where the new music video channel was carried within two months record stores in areas where mtv was available were selling music that local radio stations were not playing such as men at work bow wow wow and the human league23 mtv sparked the second british invasion with british acts who had been accustomed to using music videos for half a decade featuring heavily on the channel2425 original vjs and format 1981–1994edit mtvs original logo used from august 1 1981 to march 18 2009 it is still used in other countries further information list of mtv vjs the original purpose of mtv was to be music television playing music videos 24 hours a day and seven days a week guided by onair personalities known as vjs or video jockeys the original slogans of the channel were youll never look at music the same way again and on cable in stereo mtvs earliest format was modeled after aor albumoriented rock radio mtv would transition to mimic a full top 40 station in 1984 freshfaced young men and women were hired to host the channels programming and to introduce music videos that were being played the term vj was coined which was a play on the initialism dj disc jockey many vjs eventually became celebrities in their own right the original five mtv vjs in 1981 were nina blackwood mark goodman alan hunter jj jackson and martha quinn26 the vjs would record intro and outro voiceovers before broadcast along with music news interviews concert dates and promotions these segments would appear to air live and debut across the mtv program schedule 24 hours a day and seven days a week although the segments themselves were pretaped within a regular work week at mtvs studios27 the early music videos that made up the bulk of mtvs programming in the 1980s were promotional videos or promos a term that originated in the united kingdom that record companies had commissioned for international use or concert clips from any available sources rock bands and performers of the 1980s who had airplay on mtv ranged from new wave to hard rock or heavy metal bands28 such as adam ant bryan adams blondie eurythmics29 culture club30 mötley crüe split enz prince ultravox duran duran31 van halen32 bon jovi ratt33 def leppard34 the police and the cars the channel also rotated the music videos of weird al yankovic who made a career out of parodying other artists videos35 mtv also aired several specials by weird al in the 1980s and 1990s under the title al tv mtv also played classic rock acts from the 1980s and earlier decades including david bowie dire straits whose 1985 song and video money for nothing both referenced mtv and also included the slogan i want my mtv in its lyrics journey rush linda ronstadt genesis billy squier aerosmith the rolling stones eric clapton the moody blues john mellencamp daryl hall john oates billy joel robert palmer rod stewart the who and zz top newly solo acts such as peter gabriel robert plant phil collins paul mccartney david lee roth and pete townshend supergroup acts such as asia the power station yes the firm and traveling wilburys as well as forgotten acts such as michael stanley band shoes blotto phd rockpile bootcamp silicon teens and taxxi the hard rock band kiss publicly appeared without their trademark makeup for the first time on mtv in 1983 the first countrymusic video aired on mtv was angel of the morning by juice newton which first aired on mtv in 1981 during the early days of the channel mtv would occasionally let other stars take over the channel within an hour as guest vjs these guests included musicians such as adam ant billy idol phil collins simon lebon and nick rhodes of duran duran tina turner and comedians such as eddie murphy martin short dan aykroyd and steven wright as they chose their favorite music videos the 1983 film flashdance was the first film in which its promoters excerpted musical segments from it and supplied them to mtv as music videos which the channel then aired in regular rotation36 in addition to bringing lesserknown artists into view mtv was instrumental in adding to the booming eighties dance wave videos budgets increased and artists began to add fully choreographed dance sections michael jacksons music became synonymous with dance in addition to learning the lyrics fans also learned his choreography so they could dance along madonna capitalized on dance in her videos using classically trained jazz and breakdancers along with extensive costuming and makeup duran duran used tribal elements pulled from dunham technique in the wild boys and kate bush used a modern dance duet in running up that hill mtv brought more than music into public view it added to the evergrowing resurgence of dance in the early 1980s that has carried through to today in 1984 more record companies and artists began making video clips for their music than in the past realizing the popularity of mtv and the growing medium in keeping with the influx of videos mtv announced changes to its playlists in the november 3 1984 issue of billboard magazine that would take effect the following week the playlist categories would be expanded to seven from three light medium heavy including new light breakout medium active heavy and power this would ensure artists with hit records on the charts would be get the exposure they deserved with medium being a home for the established hits still on the climb up to the top 10 and heavy being a home for the big hits – without the bells and whistles – just the exposure they commanded37 in 1985 mtv spearheaded a safesex initiative as a response to the aids epidemic that continues to influence sexual health currently in this light mtv pushed teens to pay more attention to safesex because they were most likely more willing to hear this message from mtv than their parents this showed that mtv was not always influencing youth negatively even though in other aspects mtv was provocative they had this campaign to showcase their positive influence on youths and safe sex – a campaign that still is alive today its your sex life38 breaking the color barrier 1981–1983edit michael jackson whose discography included music videos such as beat it billie jean and thriller during mtvs first few years on the air very few black artists were included in rotation on the channel the select few who were in mtvs rotation were michael jackson prince eddy grant donna summer tina turner musical youth and herbie hancock the very first people of color to perform on mtv was the british band the specials which featured an integrated lineup of white and black musicians and vocalists the specials video rat race was played as the 58th video on the stations first day of broadcasting39 mtv rejected other black artists videos such as rick james super freak because they did not fit the channels carefully selected albumoriented rock format at the time the exclusion enraged james he publicly advocated the addition of more black artists videos on the channel rock legend david bowie also questioned mtvs lack of black artists during an onair interview with vj mark goodman in 198340 mtvs original head of talent and acquisition carolyn b baker who was black had questioned why the definition of music had to be so narrow as had a few others outside the network the party line at mtv was that we werent playing black music because of the research said baker years later but the research was based on ignorance  we were young we were cutting edge we didnt have to be on the cutting edge of racism nevertheless it was baker who had personally rejected rick james video for super freak because there were halfnaked women in it and it was a piece of crap as a black woman i did not want that representing my people as the first black video on mtv41 the networks director of music programming buzz brindle told an interviewer in 2006 mtv was originally designed to be a rock music channel it was difficult for mtv to find african american artists whose music fit the channels format that leaned toward rock at the outset writers craig marks and rob tannenbaum noted that the channel aired videos by plenty of white artists who didnt play rock andrew goodwin later wrote mtv denied racism on the grounds that it merely followed the rules of the rock business42 mtv senior executive vice president les garland complained decades later the worst thing was that racism bullshit  there were hardly any videos being made by black artists record companies werent funding them they never got charged with racism however critics of that defense pointed out that record companies were not funding videos for black artists because they knew that they would have difficulty persuading mtv to play them43 before 1983 michael jackson also struggled to receive airtime on mtv44 to resolve the struggle and finally break the color barrier the president of cbs records at the time walter yetnikoff denounced mtv in a strong profane statement threatening to take away mtvs ability to play any of the record labels music videos4445 however les garland then acquisitions head said he decided to air jacksons billie jean video without pressure from cbs40 this was contradicted by cbs head of business affairs david benjamin in vanity fair15 according to the austin chronicle jacksons video for the song billie jean was the video that broke the color barrier even though the channel itself was responsible for erecting that barrier in the first place46 but change was not immediate billie jean was not added to mtvs medium rotation playlist two to three airings per day until after it had already reached 1 on the billboard hot 100 chart a month later it was bumped up into heavy rotation one week before the mtv debut of jacksons beat it video both videos were played several times a day for the next two months by early summer the channel had ceased playing either song but the impact was permanent as by that point the videos by other black artists such as little red corvette and 1999 by prince electric avenue by eddy grant and she works hard for the money by donna summer were in heavy rotation on the channel when jacksons elaborate video for thriller was released late in the year which raised the ambition bar for what a video could be the networks support for it was total subsequently more pop and rb videos were played on mtv47 regardless of the timeline many black artists had their videos played in heavy rotation the following year 1984 along with michael jackson prince donna summer other black artists such as billy ocean stevie wonder tina turner chaka khan lionel richie ray parker jr rockwell the pointer sisters kool and the gang diana ross shannon sheila e and deniece williams all had videos played in heavy rotation on mtv eventually videos from the emerging genre of rap and hip hop would also begin to enter rotation on mtv a majority of the rap artists appearing on mtv in the mid1980s such as rundmc the fat boys whodini ll cool j and the beastie boys were from the eastcoast video music awards 1984–presentedit main article mtv

florida for a week in march broadcasting live eight hours per day spring break is a youth culture event mtvs vice president doug herzog said at the time we wanted to be part of it for that reason it makes good sense for us to come down and go live from the center of it because obviously the people there are the kinds of people who watch mtv49 the channels coverage featured numerous live performances from artists and bands on location the annual tradition would continue into the 2000s when it would become deemphasized and handed off to mtvu the spinoff channel of mtv targeted at college campuses the channel would later expand its beachthemed events to the summer dedicating most of each summer season to broadcasting live from a beach house at various locations away from new york city eventually leading to channelwide branding throughout the summer in the 1990s and early 2000s such as motel california summer share isle of mtv socal summer summer in the keys and shore thing mtv vjs would host blocks of music videos interview artists and bands and introduce live performances and other programs from the beach house location each summer50 in the 2000s as the channel reduced its airtime for music videos and eliminated much of its inhouse programming its annual summerlong events came to an end mtv would also hold weeklong music events that would take over the presentation of the channel examples from the 1990s and 2000s include all access week a week in the summer dedicated to live concerts and festivals spankin new music week a week in the fall dedicated to brand new music videos and weeklong specials that culminated in a particular live event such as wanna be a vj and the video music awards51 at the end of each year mtv takes advantage of its home location in new york city to broadcast live coverage on new years eve in times square several live music performances are featured alongside interviews with artists and bands that were influential throughout the year for many years from the 1980s to the 2000s the channel upheld a tradition of having a band perform a cover song at midnight immediately following the beginning of the new year52 live concert broadcasts 1985–2005edit throughout its history mtv has covered global benefit concert series live for most of july 13 1985 mtv showed the live aid concerts held in london and

live aid mtv drew heavy criticism for its coverage of live 8 the network cut to commercials vj commentary or other performances during performances complaints surfaced on the internet over mtv interrupting the reunion of pink floyd55 in response mtv president van toeffler stated that he wanted to broadcast highlights from every venue of live 8 on mtv and vh1 and clarified that network hosts talked over performances only in transition to commercials informative segments or other musical performances56 toeffler acknowledged that mtv should not have placed such a high priority on showing so many acts at the expense of airing complete sets by key artists55 he also blamed the pink floyd interruption on a mandatory cable affiliate break56 mtv averaged 14 million viewers for its original july 2 broadcast of live 855 consequently mtv and vh1 aired five hours of uninterrupted live 8 coverage on july 9 with each channel airing different blocks of artists57 formatted music series

hosted by al b sure the show would be reformatted into the better known mtv jams the following year which incorporated mainstream hiphop into the playlist bill bellamy would become the new and ongoing host the show became so successful it spawned its own most wanted spinoff titled most wanted jams rise of the directors 1990–1993edit by the early 1990s mtv was playing a combination of popfriendly hard rock acts charttopping metal and hard rock acts such as metallica nirvana and guns n roses pop singers such as michael jackson madonna 2 unlimited and new kids on the block and rb groups such as new edition en vogue bell biv devoe swv tony toni tone tlc and boyz ii men while introducing hit rappers vanilla ice and mc hammer mtv progressively increased its airing of hip hop acts such as ll cool j queen latifah saltnpepa naughty by nature onyx mc lyte and sirmixalot and by 1993 the channel added west coast rappers previously associated with gangsta rap with a less popfriendly sound such as tupac shakur ice cube warren g icet dr dre tone loc and snoop doggy dogg to accompany the new sounds a new form of music videos came about more creative funny artistic experimental and technically accomplished than those in the 1980s several noted film directors got their start creating music videos after pressure from the music video production association mtv began listing the names of the videos directors at the bottom of the credits by december 1992 as a result mtvs viewers became familiar with the names of spike jonze michel gondry david fincher mary lambert samuel bayer matt mahurin mark romanek jonathan dayton and valerie faris anton corbijn mark pellington tarsem hype williams jake scott jonathan glazer marcus nispel f gary gray jim yukich russell mulcahy steve barron marty callner and michael bay among others as the pbs series frontline58 explored mtv was a driving force that catapulted music videos to a mainstream audience turning music videos into an art form as well as a marketing machine that became beneficial to artists danny goldberg chairman and ceo of artemis records said the following about the art of music videos i know when i worked with nirvana kurt cobain cared as much about the videos as he did about the records he wrote the scripts for them he was in the editing room and they were part of his art and i think they stand up as part of his art and i think thats true of the great artists today not every artist is a great artist and not every video is a good video but in general having it available as a tool to me adds to the business and i wish there had been music videos in the heyday of the beatles and the rolling stones i think they wouldve added to their creative contribution not subtracted from it59 alternative is mainstream 1991–1997edit nirvana led a sweeping transition into the rise of alternative rock music on mtv in 1991 with their video for smells like teen spirit by late 1991 going into 1992 mtv began frequently airing videos from their heavily promoted buzz bin such as nirvana pearl jam alice in chains soundgarden nine inch nails tori amos pm dawn arrested development björk and gin blossoms mtv increased rotation of its weekly alternative music program 120 minutes and added the daily alternative nation to play videos of these and other underground music acts subsequently grunge and alternative rock had a rise in mainstream tastes while 1980sstyle glam bands and traditional rockers were phased out with some exceptions such as aerosmith and tom petty older acts such as rem and u2 remained relevant by making their music more experimental or unexpected they also played lots of hard rock acts such as pantera death and other heavydeath metal acts at the time period in 1993 more hit alternative rock acts were on heavy rotation such as stone temple pilots soul asylum rage against the machine marilyn manson tool beck therapy radiohead and the smashing pumpkins other hit acts such as weezer collective soul blind melon the cranberries bush and silverchair would follow in the next couple of years alternative bands that appeared on beavis and butthead included white zombie by the next few years 1994 through 1997 mtv began promoting new power pop acts most successfully green day and the offspring and skarock acts such as no doubt the mighty mighty bosstones and sublime pop singers were added to the rotation with success as long as they were considered alternative such as alanis morissette jewel fiona apple and sarah mclachlan electronica and pop 1997–1999edit by 1997 mtv focused heavily on introducing electronica acts into the mainstream adding them to its musical rotation including the prodigy the chemical brothers moby aphex twin pendulum daft punk the crystal method butthole surfers and fatboy slim some musicians who proceeded to experiment with electronica were still played on mtv including madonna u2 david bowie radiohead and smashing pumpkins that year mtv also attempted to introduce neoswing bands but they did not meet with much success however in late 1997 mtv began shifting more progressively towards pop music inspired by the success of the spice girls and the rise of boy bands in europe between 1998 and 1999 mtvs musical content consisted heavily of videos of boy bands such as backstreet boys and nsync as well as teen pop princesses such as britney spears christina aguilera lynda thomas mandy moore and jessica simpson airplay of rock electronica and alternative acts was reduced hiphop music continued in heavy rotation through the likes of puff daddy jermaine dupri master p dmx busta rhymes lil kim jayz missy elliott lauryn hill eminem foxy brown ja rule nas timbaland and their associates rb was also heavily represented with acts such as aaliyah janet jackson destinys child 702 monica and brandy return of the rock 1997–2004edit beginning in late 1997 mtv progressively reduced its airing of rock music videos leading to the slogan among skeptics rock is dead60 the facts that at the time rock music fans were less materialistic and bought less music based on television suggestion were cited as reasons that mtv abandoned its once staple music mtv instead devoted its musical airtime mostly to pop and hip hoprb music all rockcentric shows were eliminated and the rockrelated categories of the video music awards were pared down to one from this time until 2004 mtv made some periodic efforts to reintroduce pop rock music videos to the channel by 1998 through 1999 the punkrock band blink182 received regular airtime on mtv due in large part to their all the small things video that made fun of the boy bands that mtv was airing at the time meanwhile some rock bands that were not receiving mtv support such as korn and creed continued to sell albums then upon the release of korns rockrap hybrid album follow the leader mtv began playing korns videos got the life and freak on a leash a band sponsored by korn limp bizkit received airtime for its cover of george michaels faith which became a hit subsequently mtv began airing more raprock hybrid acts such as limp bizkit and kid rock some rock acts with more comical videos such as rob zombie red hot chili peppers and foo fighters also received airtime in the fall of 1999 mtv announced a special return of the rock weekend61 in which new rock acts received

programming on mtv 42 included content reflecting the lives of gay bisexual and transgender people this was the highest in the industry and the highest percentage ever115 logo and brandingedit one of many mtv station ids used during the 1980s this one was designed by henry selick mtvs nowiconic logo was designed in 1981 by manhattan design a collective formed by frank olinsky116 pat gorman and patty rogoff under the guidance of original creative director fred seibert the block letter m was sketched by rogoff with the scribbled word tv spraypainted by olinksky117 the primary variant of mtvs logo at the time had the m in yellow and the tv in red but unlike most television networks logos at the time the logo was constantly branded with different colors patterns and images on a variety of station ids the only constant aspects of mtvs logo at the time were its general shape and proportions with everything else being dynamic118 mtv launched on august 1 1981 with an extended network id featuring the first landing on the moon with still images acquired directly from nasa which was a concept of seiberts executed by buzz potamkin and perpetual motion pictures119 the id then cut to the american flag planted on the moons surface changed to show the mtv logo on it which rapidly changed into different colors and patterns several times per second as the networks original guitardriven jingle was played for the first time after mtvs launch the moon landing id was edited to show only its ending and was shown at the top of every hour until early 1986 when the id was scrapped in light of the space shuttle challenger disaster the id ran more than 15000 times each year according to seibert119 the channels iconic i want my mtv advertising campaign was launched in 1982 it was developed by george lois and was based on a cereal commercial from the 1950s with the slogan i want my maypo that george created120 the campaign featured popular artists and celebrities including pete townshend pat benatar adam ant david bowie the police kiss culture club billy idol hall oates cyndi lauper madonna lionel richie ric ocasek john mellencamp peter wolf joe elliot stevie nicks rick springfield and mick jagger interacting with the mtv logo onair and encouraging viewers to call their cable or satellite providers and request that mtv be added to their local channel lineups118 eventually the slogan became so ubiquitous that it made an appearance as a lyric sung by sting on the dire straits song money for nothing whose music video aired in regular rotation on mtv when it was first released in 1985 comparison of mtvs original 1980s branding and its 2010 branding from the late 1990s to the early 2000s mtv updated its onair appearance at the beginning of every year and each summer creating a consistent brand across all of its musicrelated shows this style of channelwide branding came to an end as mtv drastically reduced its number of musicrelated shows in the early to mid 2000s around this time mtv introduced a static and single color digital onscreen graphic to be shown during all of its programming starting with the premiere of the shortlived program fnmtv in 2008 mtv started using a revised and chopped down version of its original logo during most of its onair programming it became mtvs official logo on february 8 2010 and officially debuted on its website121 the channels full name music television was officially dropped122 with the revised logo largely the same as the original logo but without the initialism the bottom of the m being cropped and the v in tv being branched off122 this change was most likely made to reflect mtvs more prominent focus on reality and comedy programming and less on musicrelated programming however much like the original logo the new logo was designed to be filled in with a seemingly unlimited variety of images it is used worldwide but not everywhere existentially the new logo was first used on mtv films logo with the 2010 film jackass 3d mtvs rebranding was overseen by popkern123 on june 25 2015124 mtv international rebranded its onair look with a new vaporwave and seapunkinspired graphics package it included a series of new station ids featuring 3d renderings of objects and people much akin to vaporwave and seapunk aesthetics125126 many have derided mtvs choice of rebranding insisting that the artistic style was centered on denouncing corporate capitalism many aesthetic pieces heavily incorporate corporate logos of the 1970s 80s and 90s which coincidentally include mtvs original logo rather than being embraced by major corporations like mtv many have also suggested that mtv made an attempt to be relevant in the modern entertainment world with the rebrand in addition to this the rebrand was made on exactly the same day that the social media site tumblr introduced tumblr tv an animated gif viewer which featured branding inspired by mtvs original 1980s onair look127 tumblr has been cited as a prominent location of aesthetic art128 and thus many have suggested mtv and tumblr switched identities the rebrand also incorporated a modified version of mtvs classic i want my mtv slogan changed to read i am my mtv vice has suggested that the slogan change represents the current generations movement towards selfexamination identity politics and apparent narccism129 mtv also introduced mtv bump a website that allows instagram and vine users to submit videos to be aired during commercial breaks as well as mtv canvas an online program where users submit custom ids to also be aired during commercial breaks130 influence and controversiesedit the channel has been a target of criticism by various groups about programming choices social issues political correctness sensitivity censorship and a perceived negative social influence on young people131 portions of the content of mtvs programs and productions have come under controversy in the general news media and among social groups that have taken offense some within the music industry criticized what they saw as mtvs homogenization of rock n roll including the punk band the dead kennedys whose song mtv – get off the air was released on their 1985 album frankenchrist just as mtvs influence over the music industry was being solidified132 mtv was also the major influence on the growth of music videos during the 1980s133 subsequent conceptsedit hbo also had a 30minute program of music videos called video jukebox that first aired around the time of mtvs launch and would last until late 1986 also around this time hbo as well as other premium channels such as cinemax showtime and the movie channel would occasionally play one or a few music videos between moviescitation needed superstation wtbs launched night tracks on june 3 1983 with up to 14 hours of music video airplay each late night weekend by 1985 its most noticeable difference was that black artists received airplay that mtv initially ignored the program ran until the end of may 1992 a few markets also launched musiconly channels including las vegas kvmy channel 21 which debuted in the summer of 1984 as krlrtv and branded as vusic 21 the first video played on that channel was video killed the radio star following in the footsteps of mtvcitation needed shortly after tbs began night tracks nbc launched a music video program called friday night videos which

successful lasting only a year134 tbs founder ted turner started the cable music channel in 1984 designed to play a broader mix of music videos than mtvs rock format allowed but after one month as a moneylosing venture turner sold it to mtv who redeveloped the channel into vh1135 shortly after its launch the disney channel aired a program called dtv a play on the mtv acronym the program used music cuts both from current and past artists instead of music videos the program used clips of various vintage disney cartoons and animated films to go with the songs the program aired in multiple formats sometimes between shows sometimes as its own program and other times as oneoff specials the specials tended to air both on the disney channel and nbc the program aired at various times between 1984 and 1999 in 2009 disney channel revived the dtv concept with a new series of shortform segments called remicks censorshipedit main article censorship on mtv mtv has edited a number of music

entirely from the channel in the 1980s parent media watchdog groups such as the parents music resource center pmrc criticized mtv over certain music videos that were claimed to have explicit imagery of satanism as a result mtv developed a strict policy on refusal to air videos that may depict satanism or antireligious themes138 this policy led mtv to ban music videos such as jesus christ pose by
