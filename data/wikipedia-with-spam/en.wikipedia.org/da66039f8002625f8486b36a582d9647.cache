thinks of itself as speaking truth to power what they dont realize is that someone like me is perceived as the new fourth estate24 maybe they should check their structural privilege the paternalistic media he said was giving way to a more democratic one it makes journalists crazy because they used to be in control they cant control people anymore everyone has a voice now7 following an august 2016
