remain until 1950 this building combined all functions of the newspaper into one headquarters – newsroom advertising typesetting and printing – that ran 24 hours per day23 in 1898 during the spanish–american war the post printed clifford k berrymans classic illustration remember the maine which became the battlecry for american sailors during the war in 1902 berryman published another

merging with its last morning rival the washington timesherald29 the combined paper was officially named the washington post and timesherald until 1973 although the timesherald portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent after the 1950s the merger left the post with two remaining local competitors the afternoon washington star evening star and the washington daily news which

of the executive committee until her death in 2001 her tenure is credited with seeing the newspaper rise in national stature through effective investigative reporting after it began to live down its reputation as a house organ for the kennedy and johnson administration working to ensure that the new york times did not surpass its washington reporting of the pentagon papers and watergate scandal during this time katharine graham also oversaw the post companys diversification purchase of the forprofit education and training company kaplan inc for 40 million in 198433 twenty years later kaplan had surpassed the post newspaper as the companys leading contributor to income and by 2010 kaplan accounted for more than 60 of the entire company revenue stream34 executive editor ben bradlee a kennedy loyalist put the newspapers reputation and resources behind reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein who in a long series of articles chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of democratic national committee offices in the watergate hotel complex in washington the posts dogged coverage of the story the outcome of which ultimately played a major role in the resignation of president richard nixon won the newspaper a pulitzer prize in 1973 in 1972 the book world section was introduced with pulitzer prize–winning critic william mcpherson as its first editor35 it featured

reviews are still published in the outlook section on sundays and in the style section the rest of the week as well as online37 in 1980 the newspaper published a dramatic story called jimmys world38 describing the life of an eightyearold heroin addict in washington for which reporter janet cooke won acclaim and a pulitzer prize subsequent investigation however revealed the story to be a fabrication the pulitzer prize was returned donald e graham katharines son succeeded her as publisher in 1979 and in the early 1990s became both chief executive officer and chairman of the board he

announced the name change of the washington post company to graham holdings company the change was made effective on november 29 20131141 in early september 2013 bezos summarized his approach for the news organization—with a vision that recreates the daily ritual of reading the post as a bundle not merely a series of individual stories‍—‌although he indicated that the experience was more likely to be created on tablet computers and less likely on the web42 bezos has been described as a handsoff owner holding teleconference calls with executive editor martin baron every two weeks43 in august 2014 the washington post launched get there an online personal finance section44 in september 2014 jeff bezos announced his decision to appoint frederick j ryan jr founding president and ceo of politico to serve as publisher and ceo of the washington post effective october 1 2014 this signaled bezos intent to shift the post to a more digital focus with a strategy for expanding to a broader national and global readership ryan has continued to invest in news and technology while reducing expenses in legacy print areas45 nash holdings divested itself of a number of newspapers and closed two others in the summer of 2015 the company announced on june 12 2015 that it would close the montgomery gazette and prince georges gazette effective june 18 2015 the company also sold comprint military publications and its southern maryland newspapers group which consisted of the maryland independent the enterprise the calvert recorder and the enquirer gazette and their associated southern maryland newspaper web site to adams publishing group the company also said it would sell the fairfax county times to whip it media a locally owned company founded by the times former general manager richard whippen46 in august 2014 the post announced it was moving into new headquarters space at one franklin square in december 2015 the company leased 242000 square feet 22500 m2 of space for 16 years on floors four through nine in the west tower and floors seven and eight in the east tower the buildings owner agreed to an extensive buildout only about 10 percent of the space will be private offices which required extensive demolition of interior walls and the removal of the walls on the seventh and eighth floor in the east tower so they joined with the floors on the west tower the newly joined space will create two 60000squarefoot 5600 m2 floors capable of accommodating 700 newsroom workers and software engineers the buildout includes four sets for live television filming a new staircase between the seventh and eighth floors in each tower and a twostory auditorium on the fourth floor the buildings southfacing facade will also be altered to give post workers floortoceiling windows47 political stance 1970–2000 in the mid1970s some conservatives called the newspaper pravda on the potomac because of its perceived leftwing bias in both reporting and editorials48 since then the appellation has been used by both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper4950 in 1963 fbi director j edgar hoover reportedly told president lyndon b johnson i dont have much influence with the post because i frankly dont read it i view it like the daily worker5152 2000–present on march 26 2007 chris matthews said on his television program well the washington post is not the liberal newspaper it was congressman let me tell you i have been reading it for years and it is a neocon newspaper53 it has regularly published an ideological mixture of oped columnists some of them leftleaning including e j dionne dana milbank greg sargent and eugene robinson and many on the right including george will marc thiessen michael gerson and charles krauthammer in a study published on april 18 2007 by yale professors alan gerber dean karlan and daniel bergan citizens were given a subscription to either the conservativeleaning washington times or the liberalleaning washington post to see the effect that media has on voting patterns gerber had estimated based on his work that the post slanted as much to the left as the times did to the right gerber found those who were given a free subscription of the post were 79–114 more likely to vote for the democratic candidate for governor than those assigned to the control group depending on the adjustment for the date on which individual participants were surveyed and the survey interviewer surprisingly however people who received the times were also more likely than controls to vote for the democrat with an effect approximately 60 as large as that estimated for the post5455 the study authors noted that sampling error might have played a role in the effect of the conservativeleaning times as might the fact that the democratic candidate took more conservativeleaning positions than is typical for his party and that the month prior to the postelection survey was a difficult period for president bush one in which his overall approval rating fell by approximately 4 percentage points nationwide it appears that heightened exposure to both papers’ news coverage despite opposing ideological slants moved public opinion away from republicans55 in november 2007 the newspaper was criticized by independent journalist robert parry for reporting on antiobama chain emails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims56 in 2009 parry criticized the newspaper for its allegedly unfair reporting on liberal politicians including vice president al gore and president barack obama57 responding to criticism of the newspapers coverage during the runup to the 2008 presidential election former post ombudsman deborah howell wrote the opinion pages have strong conservative voices the editorial board includes centrists and conservatives and there were editorials critical of obama yet opinion was still weighted toward obama58 according to a 2009 oxford university press book by richard davis on the impact of blogs on american politics liberal bloggers link to the washington post and the new york times more often than other major newspapers however conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers59 in midseptember 2016 matthew ingram of forbes joined glenn greenwald of the intercept and trevor trimm of the guardian in cricitizing the washington post for demanding that former national security agency contractor edward snowden  stand trial on espionage charges60616263 in december 2016 the post published a story inaccurately stating that a russian hacking operation had infiltrated the us electrical grid the claim was retracted in a revised version of the story after the initial version had been widely circulated6465 in february 2017 amid a barrage of criticism from president donald trump over the papers coverage of his campaign and early presidency as well as concerns among the american press about trumps criticism and threats against journalists who provide coverage he deems unfavorable the post adopted the slogan democracy dies in darkness66 political endorsements katharine graham wrote in her autobiography personal history that the newspaper long had a policy of not making endorsements for political candidates however since at least 2000 the newspaper has occasionally endorsed republican politicians such as maryland governor robert ehrlich67 in 2006 it repeated its historic endorsements of every republican incumbent for congress in northern virginia68 there have also been times when the post has specifically chosen not to endorse any candidate such as in the 1988 presidential election when it refused to endorse thengovernor michael dukakis or thenvice president george h w bush69 on october 17 2008 the post endorsed barack obama for president of the united states70 on october 25 2012 the newspaper endorsed the reelection of barack obama71 on october 21 2014 the newspaper endorsed 44 democratic candidates versus 3 republican candidates for the 2014 elections in the district of columbia maryland and virginia72 on october 13 2016 it endorsed hillary clinton for the presidential election of that year73 the posts early endorsements in the 1978 elections for maryland governor reformist harry hughes and for dc mayor a young marion barry allowed those candidates to tout their endorsements thereby distinguishing them from an otherwise crowded field of big name candidates controversies jeff bezos the owner of the post is amazons chief executive and biggest shareholder amazon has secured a 600 million dollar contract with the cia which poses a potential conflict kate martin director of the center for national security studies said its a serious potential conflict of interest for a major newspaper like the washington post to have a contractual relationship with the government and the most secret part of the government74 in buying the war on pbs bill moyers noted 27 editorials supporting george w bushs ambitions to invade iraq national security correspondent walter pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of republican administrations75 according to author and journalist greg mitchell by the posts own admission in the months before the war it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war while contrary information got lost as one post staffer told kurtz76 in november 2016 the post published a story that relied heavily on a report by propornot an anonymous internet group that seeks to expose what it calls russian propaganda propornot published a list of websites they called bonafide useful idiots of the russian government77 andrew cockburn washington editor for harpers was sharply critical of posts decision to put the story on its front page calling the article a sorry piece of trash78 writers in the intercept fortune and rolling stone also criticized post for including a report by an organization with no reputation for factchecking in an article on fake news798081 looking more carefully into their methodology adrian chen staff writer for the new yorker argued that propornots criteria for establishing propaganda were so broad that they could have included not only russian statecontrolled media organizations such as russia today but nearly every news outlet in the world including the post itself on their list82 executive officers and editors past and present this section is incomplete this is because the bosses before bradlee and between bradlee and bennett
