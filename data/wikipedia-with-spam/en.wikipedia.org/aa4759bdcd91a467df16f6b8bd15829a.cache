philip bork jr 1897–1974 a steel company purchasing agent and his mother was elisabeth née kunkle 1898–2004 a schoolteacher2 his father was of german and irish ancestry while his mother was of pennsylvania dutch german descent3 he was married to claire davidson from 1952 until 1980 when she died of cancer they had a daughter ellen and two sons robert and charles in 1982 he married mary ellen pohl4 a catholic religious sister turned activist5 bork attended the hotchkiss school in lakeville connecticut6 and earned bachelors and law degrees from the university of chicago while pursuing

with his law degree in 1953 and passed the bar in illinois that same year after a period of service in the united states marine corps bork began as a lawyer in private practice in 1954 at kirkland ellis7 in chicago and then was a professor at yale law school from 1962 to 1975 and 1977 to 1981 among his students during this time were bill clinton hillary clinton anita hill robert reich jerry brown john r bolton samuel issacharoff and cynthia estlund89 advocacy of originalismedit bork was best known for his theory that the only way to reconcile the role of the judiciary in the us government against what he terms the madisonian or countermajoritarian dilemma of the judiciary making law without popular approval is for constitutional adjudication to be guided by the framers original understanding of the united states constitution reiterating that it is a courts task to adjudicate and not to legislate from the bench he advocated that judges exercise restraint in deciding cases emphasizing that the role of the courts is to frame neutral principles a term borrowed from herbert wechsler and not simply ad hoc pronouncements or subjective value judgments bork once said the truth is that the judge who looks outside the constitution always looks inside himself and nowhere else10 bork built on the influential critiques of the warren court authored by alexander bickel who criticized the supreme court under earl warren alleging shoddy and inconsistent reasoning undue activism and misuse of historical materials borks critique was harderedged than bickels however and he has written we are increasingly governed not by law or elected representatives but by an unelected unrepresentative unaccountable committee of lawyers applying no will but their own borks writings influenced the opinions of judges such as associate justice antonin scalia and chief justice william rehnquist of the us supreme court and sparked a vigorous debate within legal academia about how to interpret the constitution some conservatives criticized borks approach conservative scholar harry jaffa criticized bork along with rehnquist and scalia for failing to adhere to natural law principles11 robert p george explained jaffas critique this way he attacks rehnquist and scalia and bork for their embrace of legal positivism that is inconsistent with the doctrine of natural rights that is embedded in the constitution they are supposed to be interpreting11 antitrust scholaredit at yale he was best known for writing the antitrust paradox a book in which he argued that consumers often benefited from corporate mergers and that many thencurrent readings of the antitrust laws were economically irrational and hurt consumers he posited that the primary focus of antitrust laws should be on consumer welfare rather than ensuring competition as fostering competition of companies within an industry has a natural builtin tendency to allow and even help many poorly run companies with methodologies and practices that are both inefficient and expensive to continue in business simply for the sake of competition to the detriment of both consumers and society borks writings on antitrust law—with those of richard posner and other law and economics and chicago school thinkers—were influential in causing a shift in the us supreme courts approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s1213 solicitor generaledit bork served as solicitor general in the us department of justice from march 197314 to 1977 as solicitor general bork argued several highprofile cases before the supreme court in the 1970s including 1974s milliken v bradley where borks brief in support of the state of michigan was influential among the justices chief justice warren burger called bork the most effective counsel to appear before the court during his tenure bork hired many young attorneys as assistants who went on to have successful careers including judges danny boggs and frank h easterbrook as well as robert reich later secretary of labor in the clinton administration saturday night massacreedit on october 20 1973 solicitor general bork was instrumental in the saturday night massacre when us president richard nixon ordered the firing of watergate special prosecutor archibald cox following coxs request for tapes of his oval office conversations nixon initially ordered us attorney general elliot richardson to fire cox richardson resigned rather than carry out the order richardsons top deputy deputy attorney general william ruckelshaus also considered the order fundamentally wrong15 and resigned making bork acting attorney general when nixon reiterated his order bork complied and fired cox bork remained acting attorney general until the appointment of william b saxbe on january 4 197416 in his posthumously published memoirs bork stated that following the firings nixon promised him the next seat on the supreme court nixon was unable to carry out the promise after resigning in the wake of the watergate scandal but eventually in 1987 ronald reagan nominated bork for the supreme court17 united states circuit judgeedit bork was a circuit judge for the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit between 1982 and 1988 he was nominated by president reagan on december 7 1981 was confirmed with a unanimous consent voice vote by the senate on february 8 198218 and received his commission on february 9 1982 one of his opinions while on the dc circuit was dronenburg v zech 741 f2d 138819 decided in 1984 this case involved james l dronenburg a sailor who had been administratively discharged from the navy for engaging in homosexual conduct dronenburg argued that his discharge violated his right to privacy this argument was rejected in an opinion written by bork and joined by antonin scalia in which bork critiqued the line of supreme court cases upholding a right to privacy19 in rejecting dronenburgs suggestion for a rehearing en banc the dc circuit issued four separate opinions including one by bork again joined by scalia who wrote that no principle had been articulated by the supreme court that enabled us to determine whether appellants case fell within or without that principle20 in 1986 president reagan considered nominating bork to the supreme court vacancy created by the promotion of associate justice william rehnquist to chief justice reagan ultimately chose borks dc circuit colleague judge antonin scalia for the position us supreme court nominationedit main article robert bork supreme court nomination bork right with president ronald reagan 1987 president reagan nominated bork for associate justice of the supreme court on july 1 1987 to replace retiring associate justice lewis powell a hotly contested united states senate debate over borks nomination ensued opposition was partly fueled by civil rights and womens rights groups concerned with borks opposition to authority claimed by the federal government to impose standards of voting fairness upon states at his confirmation hearings for the position of solicitor general he supported the rights of southern states to impose a poll tax21 and his stated desire to roll back civil rights decisions of the warren and burger courts bork was one of only three supreme court nominees along with william rehnquist and samuel alito to ever be opposed by the american civil liberties union22 bork was also criticized for being an advocate of disproportionate powers for the executive branch of government almost executive supremacy15 most notably according to critics for his role in the saturday night massacre before supreme court justice lewis powells expected retirement on june 27 1987 some senate democrats had asked liberal leaders to form a solid phalanx of opposition if president ronald reagan nominated an ideological extremist to replace him assuming it would tilt the court rightward23 democrats also warned reagan there would be a fight if bork were nominated24 nevertheless reagan nominated bork for the seat on july 1 1987 following borks nomination sen ted kennedy took to the senate floor with a strong condemnation of bork declaring robert borks america is a land in which women would be forced into backalley abortions blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters rogue police could break down citizens doors in midnight raids schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is—and is often the only—protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy  president reagan is still our president but he should not be able to reach out from the muck of irangate reach into the muck of watergate and impose his reactionary vision of the constitution on the supreme court and the next generation of americans no justice would be better than this injustice2526 bork responded there was not a line in that speech that was accurate27 in an obituary of kennedy the economist remarked that bork may well have been correct but it worked27 bork also contended in his bestselling28 book the tempting of america that the brief prepared for sen joe biden head of the senate judiciary committee so thoroughly misrepresented a plain record that it easily qualifies as world class in the category of scurrility29 television advertisements produced by people for the american way and narrated by gregory peck attacked bork as an extremist kennedys speech successfully fueled widespread public skepticism of borks nomination the rapid response to kennedys robert borks america speech stunned the reagan white house and the accusations went unanswered for two and a half months30 during debate over his nomination borks video rental history was leaked to the press his video rental history was unremarkable and included such harmless titles as a day at the races ruthless people and the man who knew too much writer michael dolan who obtained a copy of the handwritten list of rentals wrote about it for the washington city paper31 dolan justified accessing the list on the ground that bork himself had stated that americans only had such privacy rights as afforded them by direct legislation the incident led to the enactment of the 1988 video privacy protection act32 to prochoice rights legal groups borks originalist views and his belief that the constitution did not contain a general right to privacy were viewed as a clear signal that should he become a justice on the supreme court he would vote to reverse the courts 1973 decision in roe v wade accordingly a large number of groups mobilized to press for borks rejection and the resulting 1987 senate confirmation hearings became an intensely partisan battle on october 23 1987 the senate denied borks confirmation with 42 senators voting in favor and 58 voting against two democratic senators david boren dok and ernest hollings dsc voted in his favor with 6 republican senators john chafee rri bob packwood ror arlen specter rpa robert stafford rvt john warner rva and lowell p weicker jr rct voting against him33 the vacant court seat bork was nominated to eventually went to judge anthony kennedy who was unanimously approved by the senate 97–034 bork unhappy with his treatment in the nomination process resigned his appellatecourt judgeship in 198835 bork as verbedit according to columnist william safire the first published use of bork as a verb was possibly in the atlanta journalconstitution of august 20 1987 safire defines to bork by reference to the way democrats savaged ronald reagans nominee the appeals court judge robert h bork the year before36 perhaps the best known use of the verb to bork occurred in july 1991 at a conference of the national organization for women in new york city feminist florynce kennedy addressed the conference on the importance of defeating the nomination of clarence thomas to the us supreme court saying were going to bork him were going to kill him politically  this little creep where did he come from37 thomas was subsequently confirmed after one of the most divisive confirmation hearings in supreme court history in march 2002 the oxford english dictionary added an entry for the verb bork as us political slang with this definition to defame or vilify a person systematically esp in the mass media usually with the aim of preventing his or her appointment to public office to obstruct or thwart a person in this way38 there was an earlier usage of bork as a passive verb common among litigators in the dc circuit to get borked was to receive a conservative judicial decision with no justification in the law reflecting their perception later documented in the cardozo law review of judge borks tendency to decide cases solely according to his ideology39 later workedit following his failure to be confirmed bork resigned his seat on the us court of appeals for the dc circuit and was for several years both a professor at george mason university school of law and a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute for public policy research a washington dc based think tank bork also consulted for netscape in the microsoft litigation bork was a fellow at the hudson institute he later served as a visiting professor at the university of richmond school of law and was a professor at ave maria school of law in ann arbor michigan40 in 2011 bork worked as a legal adviser for the presidential campaign of republican mitt romney41 works and viewsedit bork wrote several books including the two bestsellers the tempting of america about his judicial philosophy and his nomination battle and slouching towards gomorrah modern liberalism and american decline in which he argued that the rise of the new left in the 1960s in the us undermined the moral standards necessary for civil society and spawned a generation of intellectuals who oppose western civilization during the period these books were written as well as most of his adult life bork was an agnostic a fact used pejoratively behind the scenes by southern democrats when speaking to their evangelical constituents during his supreme court nomination process in the tempting of america page 82 bork explained his support for the supreme courts desegregation decision in brown v board of education by 1954 when brown came up for decision it had been apparent for some time that segregation rarely if ever produced equality quite aside from any question of psychology the physical facilities provided for blacks were not as good as those provided for whites that had been demonstrated in a long series of cases the courts realistic choice therefore was either to abandon the quest for equality by allowing segregation or to forbid segregation in order to achieve equality there was no third choice either choice would violate one aspect of the original understanding but there was no possibility of avoiding that since equality and segregation were mutually inconsistent though the ratifiers did not understand that both could not be honored when that is seen it is obvious the court must choose equality and prohibit stateimposed segregation the purpose that brought the fourteenth amendment into being was equality before the law and equality not separation was written into the law in 1999 bork wrote an essay about thomas more and attacked jury nullification as a pernicious practice42 bork once quoted more in summarizing his judicial philosophy43 in 2003 he published coercing virtue the worldwide rule of judges an american enterprise institute book that includes borks philosophical objections to the phenomenon of incorporating international ethical and legal guidelines into the fabric of domestic law in particular he focuses on problems he sees as inherent in the federal judiciary of three nations israel canada and the united states—countries where he believes courts have exceeded their discretionary powers and have discarded precedent and common law and in their place substituted their own liberal judgment bork also advocated modifying the constitution to allow congressional supermajorities to override supreme court decisions similar to the canadian notwithstanding clause though bork had many liberal critics some of his arguments have earned criticism from conservatives as well although an opponent of gun control44 bork denounced what he called the nra view of the second amendment something he described as the belief that the constitution guarantees a right to tefloncoated bullets instead he argued that the second amendment merely guarantees a right to participate in a government militia45 bork converted to catholicism in 200346 in october 2005 bork publicly criticized the nomination of harriet miers to the supreme court4748 on june 6 2007 bork filed suit in federal court in new york city against the yale club over an incident that had occurred a year earlier bork alleged that while trying to reach the dais to speak at an event he fell because of the yale clubs failure to provide any steps or handrail between the floor and the dais after his fall he successfully climbed to the dais and delivered his speech49 according to the complaint borks injuries required surgery immobilized him for months forced him to use a cane and left him with a limp50 in may 2008 bork and the yale club reached a confidential outofcourt settlement51 on june 7 2007 bork with several others authored an amicus brief on behalf of scooter libby arguing that there was a substantial constitutional question regarding the appointment of the prosecutor in the case reviving the debate that had previously resulted in the morrison v olson decision52 on december 15 2007 bork endorsed mitt romney for president he repeated this endorsement on august 2 2011 a 2008 issue of the harvard journal of law and public policy collected essays in tribute to bork authors included frank h easterbrook george priest and douglas ginsburg deathedit bork died of complications from heart disease at the virginia hospital center in arlington virginia on december 19 2012533554 following his death scalia referred to bork as one of the most influential legal scholars of the past 50 years and a good man and a loyal citizen mike lee senator from utah called bork one of americas greatest jurists and a brilliant legal mind55 he is interred at fairfax
