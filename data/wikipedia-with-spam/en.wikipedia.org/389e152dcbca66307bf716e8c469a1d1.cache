welldocumented definitions of the neighborhood the misspelling wedgewood is not uncommon—it is used by at least five businesses and even appears in the unofficial city clerks neighborhood map atlas12—but the origin and spelling of the name are clear the neighborhood was named after the english bone chinamaker wedgwood the favorite of the wife of albert al balch 1903–1976 the developer who

of the inside and the xachuabsh or hahchooahbsh people of a large lake or lake people today the duwamish tribe native americans of the lushootseed skagitnisqually coast salish hunted and traveled through what is now wedgwood3 the wedgwood rock a glacial erratic boulder 19 ft 58 m tall by 75 ft 23 m circumference became the intersection of a number of trails through dense old growth forest that covered what is now seattle the neighborhood has adopted big rock after it was protected from housing development in 19411 the land that formed the original core of wedgwood west of 35th avenue ne between 80th and 85th streets was at one time a heavily wooded ginseng farm charles e thorpe had cleared a portion of his 40acre 160000 m2 tract north of the seattle city limits of the time building a log cabin from the wood of his own trees by the 1920s 35th avenue ne was becoming a thoroughfare with homes and businesses the first store opened in 1922 the electric 1923 water 1926 and sewer grids had been extended to the area and it was becoming too urban for thorpes tastes the jesuit institution seattle university paid thorpe 65000 for the property planning to build a new campus there and move north from first hill thorpe left seattle never to return4 5 one month later came the stock market crash of 1929 the great depression put the jesuits plans for the new campus on hold thorpes cabin became st ignatius parish in 1929 the congregation grew through the depression years although it was served at that time only by visiting priests by 1940 the jesuits had decided not to relocate seattle university and sold thorpes 40 acres 160000 m2 to albert balch at a loss for only 22500 barely a third of what they had paid for the land in 192946 a catholic presence remains in the neighborhood the parish of st ignatius became the parish of our lady of the lake at its present location on 35th avenue at 89th street ne c 196178 wedgwood was the first seattle neighborhood where considerable numbers of large trees were preserved when the neighborhood was built when balch obtained the land from the jesuits it was still completely undeveloped heavily treed and with only one structure thorpes cabin 9 major development of the neighborhood began during world war ii with defense worker housing initial development was largely by balch and his partner maury setzer balch and setzer built 500 homes on 40 acres 160000 m² 16 hectares constituting the center of todays wedgwood neighborhood1 at the time the area was north of seattle city limits seattle ended at ne 65th street in its first act of community organizing wedgwood formed its own volunteer fire department fire district 19 founded november 11 1943 absorbed with wedgwood into the city march 20 1945 during its short life the volunteer department operated a ford model a truck with a pump based in the garage of a neighborhood home in this wartime period many of the volunteer firefighters were women1011 al balch was a direct descendant of 17th century new england settler john balch12 possibly in tribute to this heritage he had the firm of thomas grainger thomas design the houses in the cape cod style12 each house was unique in some way13 and each originally sold for 50001 65900 in 2005 dollars14 currently as of 2005 2006 all go for upwards of 300000 22800 in 1941 dollars14 many albeit with updating and often with further improvements and extensions go for as much as 450000citation needed other portions of wedgwood have distinct histories of their own in 1936 dr mrs philip m rogers purchased 15 acres 61000 m2 between 40th and 45th avenues ne from ne 88th street to ne 92nd street maple creek flows through this property forming a ravine until shortly after 1950 they left the land almost entirely undeveloped allowing it to be used as a boy scout camp according to valarie bunn at the time no traffic noise could be heard and no electric lights could be seen in the area of the camp the land was developed in the 1950s p 315 the earl j mclaughlin plat between ne 85th and ne 90th streets and 30th and 35th avenue ne was filed in 1907 but at the time there was no city water or electricity in the area few lots were sold at that time and those were sold cheaply in 1917 earl j mclaughlin relocated to cleveland ohio where he remained active in real estate for 12 years before emigrating to canada16 the large ppatch community garden near the west edge of the neighborhood and the adjoining university prep school17 and temple beth am reform synagogue18 are on land that remained a working farm as late as 1965 wedgwood has seattles oldest and largest ppatch mid1960s as of 2005 there are now 52 others the p originally stood for picardo the family that farmed the land 1922–196519 just south of the old picardo farm is dahl playfield20 like the ppatch it is former peat bog land once known as the ravenna swamp in the 1940s houses stood on part of what is now the playfield at that time picardo farm was the site contemplated for a park however after sewer lines were built along 25th avenue ne in the late 1940s houses began sinking in the peat the city bought them out and turned the land into the 80th street playfield in 1952 the bog caught fire portions subsided as much as 5 feet 16 m and the park was temporarily closed over the next few years an estimated 75000 cubic yards 57000 cubic meters of peat was replaced by fill dirt and the park reopened in 1955 the park was renamed after a former park board director waldo j dahl in september 1992 the wedgwood community council officially adopted the park21 the wedgewood sic estates apartment complex on ne 75th street between 37th and 39th avenues ne was purchased by the seattle housing authority in 2001 in an effort to preserve a supply of moderately priced housing in this part of seattle22 businessedit the fruit lady a seasonal business in wedgwood 2008 mr mrs nick jacklin opened the first store in what is now wedgwood in 1922 before either electricity or city water reached the neighborhood the building still survives as the garage of a house in the 7500 block of 35th avenue ne5 that same block was later 1949–1974 home of mcgillivrays variety and gift store whose remarkable range of wares ranged from penny candy childrens clothing and hundreds of different childrens birthday cards to fine collector dolls… in a better selection than… even… the downtown frederick nelsons and sequins in every color manufactured23 half a mile 07 km north mcvicars hardware store 1946–1986—in the space in the 8500 block of 35th avenue ne that is now dance studio all that dance—opened shortly after world war ii the shortage of consumer goods right after the war meant that some of their early stock was manufactured onsite from war surplus adapting their business to whatever people in the neighborhood wanted to buy as wedgwood residents began putting in lawns and gardens mcvicars sold them the requisite supplies they sold specialty foods and rented out skis they were also for a decade the only hardware store in the state licensed to sell beer and wine they ran doityourself clinics on everything from tools to gourmet cooking in 1954 they were mentioned in a time magazine article on the doityourself trend242526 7300 block of 35th ave ne today there is a shopping district along 35th avenue ne with concentrations of stores at ne 75th street and ne 85th street including a supermarket at each of these corners a lesser concentration near ne 95th street includes the fiddlers inn bar a live music venue one of relatively few this far from the center of the city near that intersection a gas station veterinary office and eastcoast style hunan chinese restaurant and bar reside the wedgwood broiler is a quintessential 50s american style neighborhood restaurant and bar and while 35th ne doesnt rise to the level of having street life it does have a good smattering of businesses including numerous banks a us post office27 coffee shops restaurants several popular bars a dance school a dry cleaner the seattle branch of the audubon society28 miscellaneous medical offices and a

eventually petered out in the 1980s this vacuum was filled by the current wedgwood community council3334 the musicians emeritus symphony orchestra meso wedgwoods nonprofit community orchestra was founded in 1971 by seattle mayor wes uhlman meso was originally intended specifically for older musicians and as of 2008 the oldest is 91 years old but now the orchestra includes players of all ages

2007 after the dissolution of mars hill in 2014 this became onelife community church53 geographyedit hunters tree farm like all seattle neighborhoods wedgwood has no official or universally agreedupon borders the unofficial city clerks neighborhood map atlas shows its boundaries as bounded on the north by ne 95th street bounded on the east by 45th avenue ne bounded on the south by ne 75th street bounded on the west by a route coming north from ne 75th street along 25th avenue ne then jogging due west along ne 85th street and snaking up lake city way ne to ne 95th street this is quite similar to how the wedgwood community council wcc defined the neighborhood limits in 1956 the only difference being the western limit the wcc considered 25th avenue ne to be the limit all the way north this excludes the area west of 25th avenue ne extending west to lake city way ne between ne 85th street and ne 95th street54 however ne 75th street presents no discernible break in the business strip along 35th avenue ne which continues south to ne 65th street many of the businesses churches etc in these ten blocks identify themselves as being in wedgwood some even have wedgwood in their names if the city clerks unofficial borders are accepted then the landmark wedgwood rock a large 19foot 58 mtall boulder at the corner of 28th avenue ne and ne 72nd street lies in the adjoining ravenna neighborhood2 several other welldocumented interpretations exist among them seattle neighborhoods of historylinkorg encyclopedia of washington state history does not define boundaries for wedgwood other than as adjacent to surrounding neighborhoods their map suggests wedgwood is between 25th and 45th avenues and 75th street may divide from view ridge neighborhood55 the neighbors project 1996–2000 of the seattle postintelligencer currently updated as the webtowns section of the online pi defines wedgwood a little differently while they say the boundaries are ne 95th street to the north ne 75th street to the south 25th ave ne to the west and approximately 45th avenue ne to the east neighbors defines wedgwood primarily in terms of a series of businesses and other public spaces on 35th avenue ne extending as far south as ne 68th street from south to north the northeast library ne 68th rod and judy neldams grateful bread bakery ne 70th the post office at ne 77th the wedgwood broiler ne 83rd matthews red apple market ne 85th since overtaken by supermarket chain qfc and finally the fiddlers inn pub ne 94th built in 1934 a former dive that was fixed up in the early 1990s they describe wedgwood as having more in common with ballard than with capitol hill which is to say not particularly hip or trendy and say that downtown wedgwood along 35th avenue ne has a look and feel of a small town main street for better and worse as it struggles like main streets across the country in the age of malls and internet shopping56 neighbors further asserts that wedgwood has always been a middleclass neighborhood trending toward upper middle with home sales suggesting that it is currently becoming more of a young family area as the initial 1940s owners reach the end of their lives and baby boomers become retirees emblematic of this change the former mcvicars space after serving as a fullservice bicycle shop 1986–2001 is now all that dance seattles largest dance studio with an enrollment of more than 1500—mostly children a testament to the changes in the area5758 wedgwood has long had an active neighborhood council one of the most active in seattle effectively lobbying in and for the neighborhood as well as working with the unusually numerous schools in the area56 the pis current webtowns section has merged wedgwood and view ridge with sand point and two popular waterfront parks magnuson park and matthews beach park webtowns wedgwood is located between sand point way and a small business district on 35th avenue ne around ne 75th street the neighborhood is described as less expensive though with respect to seattle housing prices the comparison is relative to places with expansive views in tonier adjacent neighborhoods like view ridge and sand point or high demand like the university district5960 national standards long adopted by the seattle department of transportation define minor arterials in part as generally along neighborhood boundaries ne 65th 75th and 95th streets and 35th avenue61 there is also a reasonable argument to be made that the northern boundary of wedgwood is ne 100th street as this street
