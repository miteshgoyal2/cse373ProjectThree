main article cnn controversies in a joint study by the joan shorenstein center on press politics and public policy at harvard university and the project for excellence in journalism the authors found disparate treatment by the three major cable channels of republican and democratic candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007 the cnn programming studied tended to cast a negative light on republican candidates – by a margin of threetoone fourinten stories 41 were clearly negative while just 14 were positive and 46 were neutral the network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with mccain faring the worst 63 negative and romney faring a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral its not that democrats other than obama fared well on cnn either nearly half of the illinois senators stories were positive 46 vs just 8 that were negative but both clinton and edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall so while coverage for democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for obama99 cnn president walter isaacson met with republican party leaders in washington dc in 2001 saying afterwards i was trying to reach out to a lot of republicans who feel that cnn has not been as open covering republicans and i wanted to hear their concerns100 as cnn founder ted turner stated there really isnt much of a point getting some tom dick or harry off the streets to report on when we can snag a big name whom
