2 image discussions rendered mootedit looks like the image discussions have been rendered moot by the release of the actual official portraits atleast it is way better than the previous one galobtter talk 1524 31 october 2017 utc truly the end of an era looks like my dm to doug coulter is useless now philrocmy contribs 0037 1 november 2017 utc true but the line and made available for sale to the public is a redflag looks like dumbos staff are making their own legislation as they go along stemoc 1623 31 october 2017 utc it says produced by the us government publishing office gpo so pd us gov emir of wikipedia talk 1639 31 october 2017 utc what do you think theyre making up  could be mistaken but i do not think that the gpo prints materials for the pubic for free valarianb talk 1646 31 october 2017 utc nothing is free stemoc even obamas 2009 portrait is 1800 and has been since 2009 it has nothing to do with trump and his decisions corky buzz by the hornets nest 1659 31 october 2017 utc public even to my knowledge the gpo doesnt print materials for the pubic period perhaps they should ―mandruss ☎ 2006 31 october 2017 utc for sale likely means prints they wouldnt be releasing highdefinition images like that to the public if you have to pay to look at them codyorb talk 2111 31 october 2017 utc agreed finally the trump admin has released free portraits glad we wont need endless image discussions here anymore nomoreheroes talk 1723 31 october 2017 utc happy halloween finally this great debate is over mrx 1913 31 october 2017 utc or is it the whole saga quite honestly struck me as petty and unnecessary i might have believed the admins that wanted it taken down had they not felt compelled to call the president silly names like children in their arguments imho that kind of immaturity as reflected in a comment above is damaging to the reputation of wikipedia even on the talk pages if you wanna make a swipe at potus at least use some wit and subtlety but i am glad this yearlong fight is over it is kind of ridiculous the administration took this long to put out a basic portrait bigeyedbeansfromvenus talk 2002 31 october 2017 utc jfg i agree this looks like case closed care to take a shot at change to the list i wouldnt know what to link ―mandruss ☎ 2012 31 october 2017 utc so somebody update the current consensus list at the top of the page melanien talk 2156 31 october 2017 utc melanien see my comment immediately above i dont trust myself to do this one right which is why i called on jfg sure somebody can do it provided they dont make a fuss if jfg then does it right my inclination is to wait ―mandruss ☎ 2213 31 october 2017 utc i just tried but ill be happy to let jfg clean up after me for one thing the link will have to be changed when this is archived melanien talk 2235 31 october 2017 utc my concern was whether this little thread was sufficient support for the consensus and if not what else needs to be linked ―mandruss ☎ 2241 31 october 2017 utc all previous decisions about an image have been expressly temporary the consensus was always use this until the official portrait is released there has been consensus to use this picture no matter what it looked like since january actually well before i suppose we could link to all those until the official portrait is released discussions for added weight but i dont think its necessary melanien talk 2319 31 october 2017 utc melanien and mandruss thanks for the ping melanies item 24 looks good to me one more thing settled — jfg talk 0925 1 november 2017 utc on second thought i have updated item 1 with the latest discussion item 24 is unnecessary per rfc outcome of 12 december 2016 once an official portrait becomes available theres a fairly clear mandate that among the discussants and through precedent that we use that image we have finally reached that point — jfg talk 1020 1 november 2017 utc that makes sense melanien talk 1445 1 november 2017 utc if a consensus is needed then id like to voice my full support for this godsend of a portrait 704415416 talk 2244 31 october 2017 utc amen to that it only took them ten months and people complained when clintons portrait wasnt released until june of his first year in office melanien talk 2311 31 october 2017 utc its easier to get a decent photo of clinton about four months easier apparently ―mandruss ☎ 2313 31 october 2017 utc and as for whether this one is a decent photo no comment at least its better than the scowling one they offered us at first melanien talk 2320 31 october 2017 utc its as good as donald will ever look short of a face transplant ―mandruss ☎ 2325 31 october 2017 utc discussions like this really remind us how biased wikipedia can get none of these comments are even relevant president trump looks fantastic in the photo and it should be displayed since it is his official portraiture try to stay wpcool when editing no one needs to read your hatefilled remarks alaskannativeru talk 0049 1 november 2017 utc alaskannativeru hateful political remarks in these dicusssions were inevitable hes trump possibly one of the most hated presidents in history philrocmy contribs 0110 1 november 2017 utc editors are allowed to reveal their bias on an article talk page provided they dont overdo it and cross the line into wpnotforum territory or violate wpblp it is not a blp violation to let loose a rare comment about donald trumps appearance and your dissenting opinion is noted ive probably done that three or four times in the past year with very brief comments and i stay cool as a cucumber when editing the article thanks and i dont allow my bias to affect my editing of the article or discussion of same on this page and nobody is disputing that it should be displayed since it is his official portraiture ―mandruss ☎ 0113 1 november 2017 utc suggestion remove trumps twitter comment concerning his support for protests against obamaedit the first paragraph in the protests section states trumps election victory sparked protests across the united states his opponents took to the streets to amplify their opposition to trumps views and denounce his inflammatory statements trump initially said on twitter that the protests consisted of professional protesters incited by the media and were unfair but he later stated that he loves their passion for the country431432 after obamas reelection in 2012 trump had tweeted we cant let this happen we should march on washington and stop this travesty our nation is totally divided i think the last sentence is out of place and should be removed since this section is supposed to describe the protests against trump not how trump viewed obamas presidency or whether he supported protests at that time the only reason i can imagine for including what seems like a nonsequitur is that the author wanted to try to demonstrate hypocrisy on the part of the president as i recall this was the same thing mainstream news networks were trying to point out at the time thus as it likely exists solely to try to put the president in a bad light i think it quite conceivably breaks wikipedias neutrality policies in any case it serves no purpose in this section thank you 1920162183 talk 0705 1 november 2017 utc thus as it likely exists solely to try to put the president in a bad light i think it quite conceivably breaks wikipedias neutrality policies wpnpov means that we should represent all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic if numerous rs reports all prominently point out the hypocrisy then we can put it whether it puts the president in a bad light however in this case judging by the article on the protests i think we should simply cut trumps reaction and instead describe more of the protests and their purpose in more detail that first sentence is pretty bad which are much more prominent than his reaction or at least the quotes should be cut and his response and perhaps hypocrisy quickly summarized galobtter talk 0753 1 november 2017 utc remove its incredibly trivial 704415416 talk 1940 1 november 2017 utc cropping the pictureedit i think that someone should slightly crop the top of the official portrait for the infobox it seems that there is slightly to much space above his head could someone with the proper credentials on here do that 260088034000321376f499be5c7e7 talk 0139 2 november 2017 utc it looks good to me anythingyouwant talk 0144 2 november 2017 utc i certainly see your point but bear in mind that the same image is already used on 33 pages at english wikipedia not to mention 15 other wikipedias what if those editors disagree we could create a separate cropped version but is it worth it to trim 1015 pixels off the top there is a little to be said for keeping the official portrait pure and unaltered ―mandruss ☎ 0150 2 november 2017 utc i think the photo should remain in the same format as it was released by the white house at least for this and the trump presidency articles aesthetically i dont believe it would benefit from cropping mrx 0207 2 november 2017 utc photographer and white house chose this framing leave it be — jfg talk 0214 2 november 2017 utc no no nooooooo i think we should focus more on improving the article than starting another image discussion anyhow removing those pixels would change the aspect ratio to not be that off a portrait and make it too squarish it looks fine currently galobtter talk 0217 2 november 2017 utc actually reducing the height of the fullsize image by 37 pixels would give it a 081 aspect ratio which is fairly standard for a formal portrait at least where i come from thats the aspect ratio for both barack and hillary i dont propose that we crop it for that reason the arguments against are weightier and were already close enough at 07891 just sayin ―mandruss ☎ 0224 2 november 2017 utc i think it might be from trump taking up more of the image and being lower in the picture than obama in his picture but personally i thought this picture was more squarish than obamas galobtter talk 0241 2 november 2017 utc yeah when we start letting visual perception into it it becomes completely subjective but the numbers dont lie barack is 08011 since 11 is square thats a little closer to square than 07891 ―mandruss ☎ 0248 2 november 2017 utc it seems that there is slightly to much space above his head there wouldnt be too much difference though im prefering the previous pic on the current one he looks like a monkey 2131977554 talk 1417 2 november 2017 utc i think it is perfectly framed and requires no adjustment certainly the space above his head is less worrisome than the space between his ears scjessey talk 1420 2 november 2017 utc scjessey you got me chuckling with that remark — jfg talk 1827 4 november 2017 utc i dont think gorsuch belongs in the leadedit it seems very odd to mention gorsuch by name in the lead section the president appoints scores of people his cabinet to start with and many other influential civil servants such as directors of the fbi the cia and so on and so forth no cabinet member not even the most senior such as rex tillerson and no other appointees either are mentioned by name in the lead section in the entire world the position of judge even on the countrys supreme court would be seen as junior to the entire cabinet and 99 of the world would regard it as a routine appointment of a civil servant i dont think gorsuch is regarded as more influential in the us than other trump appointees such as tillerson and other cabinet members either tataral talk 1203 4 november 2017 utc i agree that it would be better to leave “neil gorsuch” out of the lead but still say he successfully nominated a supreme court justice it’s a life position and the court now occupies a bigger role in american life than courts do in the vast majority of other countries eg the people of ireland legalized gay marriage by voting on it whereas it was done by judicial decision in the us but we needn’t name gorsuch in the lead because it’s too much detail and anyway the whole reason they wear black robes is to symbolize that individual personalities aren’t supposed to matter anythingyouwant talk 1702 4 november 2017 utc the judgement of whether to include it should not be based upon the the role being bigger compared to other countries but the notability of trump in appointing him emir of wikipedia talk 1713 4 november 2017 utc agree in an administration bereft of achievements the appointment is quite important trump himself has touted it as being one of great accomplishments you can see this cnn article where it is talked about as possibly greatest achievment till april and nothing much has happened since galobtter talk 1718 4 november 2017 utc the nomination of neil gorsuch was a particularly controversial and widelycovered story which has lasting impact on the balance of the us supreme court this is why it belongs in the lead section however we should certainly review the contents of this paragraph which is meant to summarize the key issues of trumps presidency so far the oneoff missile strike in syria in response to a chemical attack did not develop into a bigger story and should imho be removed — jfg talk 1839 4 november 2017 utc lasting impact we dont know that yet thats wpcrystalballing he has served for a couple of months less than most of trumps cabinet members who have far more power eg tillerson who directs us foreign policy and has some 70000 people working directly for him compared to the handful of assistants a judge gets and hasnt done anything noteworthy the appointment of a judge is not in itself an achievement any more than the appointment of his cabinet or his other statutory duties the fact that he would even see this as an achievement merely demonstrates his lack of actual achievements but still gorsuch doesnt deserve to be the only appointee mentioned in the lead among many who are far more influential and whose appointments were also widely discussed in rs tataral talk 2208 4 november 2017 utc tataral please note that i did not call the gorsuch appointment an achievement either in the article or in this discussion we certainly cannot guess what his lasting impact will be if any however most sources reporting on this appointment did mention that it would surely have an impact especially as the last obama supreme court nominee had been filibusted by the gopcontrolled senate paving the way for a more conservative justice we go by sources… — jfg talk 2259 4 november 2017 utc support removal of gorsuch from the lede in a biography of trumps entire life the appointment isnt especially noteworthy we do not mention the two justices appointed by obama in the lede of barack obama the noteworthy aspect of gorsuchs appointment came prior to trumps election when republicans employed extraordinary measures to prevent obama from appointing garland nothing to do with trump scjessey talk 1331 6 november 2017 utc just to clarify the proposal above at the start of this thread is that we stop mentioning “gorsuch by name” in the lead and i support that but i also support mentioning in the lead that he successfully nominated an unnamed supreme court justice for the reasons i already gave anythingyouwant talk 1345 6 november 2017 utc it is not a significant achievement in his life its fine in the body but not in the lede scjessey talk 1349 6 november 2017 utc oppose removing it or removing gorsuchs name what does that accomplish leave it in the lede as is this is his only major legislative accomplishment and possibly the single most lasting effect of his presidency its an eightword sentence theres room for it we manage to find room for 20 words about his travel ban which is nowhere near as significant or longlasting melanien talk 1509 6 november 2017 utc agree like i said above rses are talking about it being his most significant accomplishment i dont really see a way to reword it either to save words while removing gorsuchs name galobtter talk 1517 6 november 2017 utc oppose removal personally i don’t think appointing a justice is an accomplishment since a president is handed the opportunity and such appointments have an 80 approval rate but what i personally think is irrelevant if rs say it’s an accomplishment and there are so few accomplishments it belongs in the lead o3000 talk 1538 6 november 2017 utc manafort indictment in leadedit as for usertataral’s insertion into the lead “subsequently the special counsel indicted trumps former campaign manager paul manafort for conspiracy against the united states” i disagree with that because the behavior for which manafort was indicted had nothing to do with trump nor anything to do with his campaign or his administration it’s mainly a way for mueller to pressure manafort into cooperation andor spilling beans andor turning on trump none of which has happened yet anythingyouwant talk 1336 4 november 2017 utc it would be better to start a new section for discussion of the wording related to the special counsel investigation because it isnt related to the issue raised here which if any trump appointees who should be mentioned by name in the lead section but i do think the material about manafort is warranted the focus of the special counsels investigation is potential links between russia and trumps campaignpossible russian interference in the electionrelated matters so the indictment of manafort is clearly seen in that context and not as something completely unrelated to trump his campaign and the election also manafort wasnt merely someone who worked on the campaign but was its head which underlines the importance of the indictment in the context of this article rs seem to agree that this is so far the most notable result of the special counsels investigation and that it is highly significant not only for manafort but also for trumps presidency the appointment of the special counsel has already been mentioned in the lead for a long time so i consider this a mere update on how the investigation is proceeding tataral talk 1648 4 november 2017 utc i’ve inserted a header so the manafort indictment is now a separate section at this talk page per your suggestion a “mere update on how the investigation is proceeding” doesn’t need to be in this lead but is fine for the lead in the investigation article anythingyouwant talk 1702 4 november 2017 utc ive reverted to the status quo until this is decided considering muellers investigation is hardly even talked about in the body see section i created below i dont think a mere update is enough to belong in the lead galobtter talk 1712 4 november 2017 utc i would also assess that manaforts indictment on prior activities is offtopic and wpundue for the lead section of trumps biography — jfg talk 1843 4 november 2017 utc mueller investigationedit the justice department appointed comeys predecessor robert mueller as special counsel to investigate russias interference in the presidential election potential links between russia and trump campaign associates and any related matters this sentence on muellers investigation is quite long and prominent yet this is hardly even mentioned in the body muellers name isnt even mentioned elsewhere reckon this should be shortened to the justice department appointed a special counsel to investigate russias interference in the presidential election potential links between russia and trump campaign associates and any related matters and some more information on the investigation added to the dismissal of comey section since this is one of the most important matters related to his administration galobtter talk 1709 4 november 2017 utc i gave a shot at rephrasing the sentence in the lead2 not mentioning mueller by name but linking to the dedicated article about his investigation its still a bit long for the lead though — jfg talk 1858 4 november 2017 utc the article needs more inputed in the article we should mention him by name per wpweightcasprings talk 2259 4 november 2017 utc called for vs askededit mandruss regarding your comment that called for connotes speaking to them through the media in the third person is that not the case here thanks for educating me to this subtlety in the event the phrase refers to a keynote speech that trump gave to 50 leaders of muslim countries worldwide as they had been invited to riyadh for the arab islamic american summit so he was addressing them directly not through the media not sure whether it makes a difference about which verb to use — jfg talk 2255 4 november 2017 utc it makes all the difference i have selfreverted thanks for educating me ―mandruss ☎ 2258 4 november 2017 utc is it really necessary to stick to the official portraitedit there are enough threads about the picture already consensus is clear powerenwiki π ν 2054 5 november 2017 utc the following discussion is closed please do not modify it subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page no further edits should be made to this discussion the old one seemed way better to me he looks lunatic hey just saying with that goofy grin portrait 2511785 talk 1734 5 november 2017 utc its convention to use the free official portrait as the infobox image nomoreheroes talk 2025 5 november 2017 utc if he’s grinning people say the grin is goofy if he’s frowning people say he should be grinning it’s useful to have a standard answer like we just use the official portrait otherwise we’ll still be debating the image when barron trump or charlotte clinton mezvinsky is president o3000 talk 2051 5 november
