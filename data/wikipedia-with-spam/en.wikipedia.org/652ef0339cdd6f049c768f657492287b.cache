historyedit prior to 1975 most of the few cambodians in the united states were children of highincome families or had governmentfunded scholarships sent abroad to attend school there was no history of immigration from cambodia into the united states after the fall of phnom penh to the communist khmer rouge in 1975 a few cambodians managed to escape but it was only after the régime was overthrown in 1979 did large waves of cambodians began immigrating to the us as refugees between 1975 and 1994 nearly 158000 cambodians were admitted about 149000 of them entered the country as refugees and 6000 entered as immigrants and 2500 as humanitarian and public interest parolees2 to encourage rapid cultural assimilation and to spread the economic impact the us government settled the refugees in various towns and cities throughout the country however once established enough to be able to communicate and travel many cambodians began migrating to certain places that the climate was more like home they knew friends and relatives had been sent or there were rumored to be familiar jobs or higher government benefits consequently large communities of cambodians took root in cities such as long beach fresno and stockton in californiaprovidence rhode island cleveland ohio as well as lynn and lowell in massachusetts and seattle and portland in the pacific northwest since 1994 cambodians admitted into the united states have entered the country as immigrants and not as refugees but the number per year is small most of the increase in the ethnic cambodian population in the can be attributed to americanborn children of cambodian immigrants or of people of cambodian descent the 2010 census counted 276667 persons of cambodian descent in the united states up from 206052 in 2000 of them 231616 84 are allcambodian and 45051 partcambodian3 demographicsedit the states with the highest concentration of cambodian american residents are rhode island 05 5176 massachusetts 04 25387

cambodian american population such as khmer american identity and moral education in a diasporic community by nancy j smithhefner the book is an anthropological study of khmer refugee families largely from the perspective of the parental generation residing in metropolitan boston and eastern massachusetts this book was one of the early books among the few circulating that talks about this diasporic community it exhibits some understanding of both traditional khmer culture and contemporary american society but it is not a historical study of khmer americans a more recent book is buddha is hiding written by aiwha ong an ethnographic study that tells the story of cambodian americans and their experiences of american citizenship the study primarily investigated khmer refugees in oakland and the san francisco bay area the experiences portrayed in the book exemplify what most cambodian refugees face when dealing with american institutions such as health care systems welfare law police force church and school the book reveals through extensive ethnographic dialogues how cambodian refugees interpret and negotiate american culture often at the expense of their own theravada buddhist cultural upbringing survivors cambodian refugees in the united states written by sucheng chan is a multidisciplinary study of cambodian americans drawing on interviews with community leaders government officials and staff members in community agencies as well as average cambodian americans to capture perspectives from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds museumsedit two museums in the us are devoted to the story of cambodians in america the cambodian cultural museum and killing fields memorial in seattle and the cambodian american heritage museum and killing fields memorial in chicago both founded in 2004the seattle museum was founded by dara duong a survivor of the cambodian genocide12 issuesedit lack of educationedit according to the 2000 census cambodian american populations had a lower level of education compared to other populations in the united states with 534 of cambodian americans over the age of 25 not possessing a high school diploma compared to 196 of all americans13 povertyedit in 2000 cambodian american families reported a median household income of 3615213 a 2008 nyu study reported that 293 of the cambodian american community lived under the poverty line14 that was higher than the american average of people living below the poverty line which in 2011 was recorded as 16 of all americans15 in 2014 it was reported that cambodia town long beach california the only officiallyrecognized ethnic enclave of cambodian americans had a poverty rate of 32416 that was a little over twice the average of america society as a whole which was 16 according to a 2011 study by the government15 in 2014 a factfinder census with americans per capita income being divided by ethnic groups cambodian americans were revealed to have a per capita income of only 20182 below the american average of 2582517 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act which was signed into law by president bill clinton in 1996 resulted in many legal immigrants losing the federal aid that they had been receiving from the social security administration that especially affected cambodian immigrants and other southeast asians who were the largest per capita race or ethnic group receiving public assistance in the united states under the indochina migration and refugee assistance act of 1975 many southeast asian refugees were placed on federal welfare rolls that was intended as a temporary measure until they integrated but by 1996 they had been stripped of their refugee status however nearly 80 percent of californias southeast asian population was living in poverty andor welfaredependent that made the law have a large impact on cambodian americans and other citizens of southeast asian descent that is a contributing factor to the high poverty rates of cambodian americans since the first major wave of cambodian refugees emigrated to the united states in 197518 assimilationedit cambodians faced many difficulties upon settling in the united states such as having few transferable job skills speak no english and having experienced trauma as refugees the factors greatly impacted overall household income after resettlement many refugees arrived without formal education since the educated and professional classes were targeted during the genocide that contributed to the difficulty in learning to speak english and in assimilating to the american educational system19 another common phenomenon experienced by some cambodian american refugees is a lack of familiarity with the history of their homeland that is prevalent among refugees who were young children when they emigrated to the us and are now adults because of their age they are not able to remember or understand the history of cambodia that led to their familys migration cambodian history is only rarely taught in american public schools which contributes to that unfamiliarity which is worsened by the resistance of older refugees to discuss the horrors that they witnessed in cambodia20 poor mental healthedit it was estimated in 1990 five years after most arrived to the us21 nearly 81 of cambodians in america met the criteria for major affective disorderwhich encompasses depression and generalized anxiety accounting for the largest subgroup of southeast asians afflicted by mental health problems at the time22 physical healthedit one study conducted among cambodian americans residing in long beach california found that 130 of the adult respondents were current cigarette smokers when the study was broken down by gender 244 of smokers included in the study were male and 54 were women the prevalence of smoking was found to be higher in cambodian american males than in other males residing in california additionally smoking rates are estimated to be higher among cambodian americans than among other asian american groups with the prevalence of cigarette smoking among the aggregate asian population in the us around 96 with men and women combined23 deportationedit main article deportation of cambodians from the united states notable peopleedit main article list of cambodian americans see alsoedit cambodia portal asian
