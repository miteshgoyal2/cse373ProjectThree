seattle or the battle in seattle1 were a series of protests surrounding the wto ministerial conference of 1999 when members of the world trade organization wto convened at the washington state convention and trade center in seattle washington on november 30 1999 the conference was to be the launch of a new millennial round of trade negotiations the negotiations were quickly overshadowed by massive and controversial street protests outside the hotels and the washington state convention and trade center the protests were nicknamed n30 akin to j18 and similar mobilizations the large scale of the demonstrations estimated at no less than 40000 protesters dwarfed any previous demonstration in the united states against a world meeting of any of the organizations generally associated with economic globalization such as the wto the international monetary fund or the world bank2 contents 1 organizations and planning 11 corporations targeted 12 leadup months 2 n30 21 december 1 3 media response 4 aftermath 5 see also 6 references 7 further reading 71 archives 8 external links organizations and planningedit planning for the actions began months in advance and included local national and international organizations among the most notable participants were national and international nongovernmental organizations ngos such as global exchange3 especially those concerned with labor issues the environment and consumer protection labor unions including the aflcio student groups religionbased groups jubilee 2000 and anarchists some of whom formed a black bloc4 the coalition was loose with some opponent groups focused on opposition to wto policies especially those related to free trade with others motivated by prolabor anticapitalist or environmental agendas many of the ngos represented at the protests came with credentials to participate in the official meetings while also planning various educational and press events the aflcio with cooperation from its member unions organized a large permitted rally and march from seattle center to downtown the turtles protestors in sea turtle costumes however others were more interested in taking direct action including both civil disobedience and acts of vandalism and property destruction to disrupt the meeting several groups were loosely organized together under the direct action network dan with a plan to disrupt the meetings by blocking streets and intersections downtown to prevent delegates from reaching the convention center where the meeting was to be held the black bloc was not affiliated with dan but was responding to the original call for autonomous resistance actions on november 30 issued by peoples global action5 of the different coalitions that aligned in protest were the teamsters and turtles a bluegreen alliance consisting of the teamsters trade unions and environmentalists678 corporations targetededit certain activists including locals and an additional group of anarchists from eugene oregon9 where they had gathered that summer for a music festival10 advocated more confrontational tactics and conducted vandalism of corporate properties in downtown seattle in a subsequent communique they listed the particular corporations targeted which they considered to have committed corporate crime leadup monthsedit on july 12 the financial times reported that the latest united nations human development report advocated principles of performance for multinationals on labour standards fair trade and environmental protection needed to counter the negative effects of globalisation on the poorest nations the report itself argued an essential aspect of global governance is responsibility to people—to equity to justice to enlarging the choices of all11 on july 16 helene cooper of the wall street journal warned of an impending massive mobilization against globalization being planned for the endofyear seattle wto conference12 next day the london independent newspaper savaged the wto and appeared to side with the organizers of the rapidly developing storm of protest the way it has used its powers is leading to a growing suspicion that its initials should really stand for world take over in a series of rulings it has struck down measures to help the worlds poor protect the environment and safeguard health in the interests of private—usually american—companies the wto seems to be on a crusade to increase private profit at the expense of all other considerations including the wellbeing and quality of life of the mass of the worlds people says ronnie hall trade campaigner at friends of the earth international it seems to have a relentless drive to extend its power13 on november 16 two weeks before the conference president bill clinton issued executive order 13141—environmental review of trade agreements14 which committed the united states to a policy of assessment and consideration of the environmental impacts of trade agreements and stated trade agreements should contribute to the broader goal of sustainable development activists staged a spoof of seattles daily paper the postintelligencer on wednesday november 24 inserting thousands of hoax editions of a fourpage frontpage wraparound into piles of newspapers awaiting distribution to hundreds of street boxes and retail outlets the spoof frontpage stories were boeing to move overseas to indonesia and clinton pledges help for poorest nations15 the byline on the boeing story attributed it to joe hill a union organizer who had been executed by firing squad in utah in 1915 on the same day the international centre for trade and sustainable development reported developing countries have remained steadfast in their demand that developed countries honour uruguay round commitments before moving forward full force with new trade negotiations specifically developing countries are concerned over developed countries’ compliance with agreements on market access for textiles their use of antidumping measures against developing countries’ exports and overimplementation of the wto agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips16 this ominously foreshadowed the impending conflict of the northsouth divide which was to result in the collapse of the forthcoming wto talks previous mass protests against apec summits in vancouver canada and manila the philippines also provided information about globalization policies free trade and the situation in developing countries that likely encouraged further protests to confront international economic forums in 1997 the apec canada meeting was held at the university of british columbia ubc campus on november 24 and 25 in vancouver protesters on the campus and in downtown vancouver were treated with some repressive measures by the royal canadian mounted police while they were experiencing splits among themselves on questions of tactics and the limits of civil disobedience that mass response of a few thousand included leaders of protests previously held in manila where apec had held a summit in 1996 when 10s of thousands of labor peasant and social justice groups had marched to oppose free trade ubc may have welcomed the filming of battle in seattle on its grounds in the light of this past submitted by a witness who participated in the vancouver antiapec actions and the seattle antiwto actions and referred to wikipedias pages on apec canada 1997 and apec philippines 1996 n30edit seattle police on union street during the protests on the morning of tuesday november 30 1999 the dans plan was put into effect several hundred activists arrived in the deserted streets near the convention center and began to take control of key intersections over the next few hours a number of marchers began to converge on the area from different directions these included a student march from the north a march of citizens of the developing world who marched in from the south and beginning around 0900 militant anarchists in a formation known as a black bloc marching down pike street from 6th avenue blockading the streets with newspaper boxes and smashing windows17 some demonstrators held rallies others held teachins and at least one group staged an earlymorning street party meanwhile a number of protesters still controlled the intersections using lockdown formations the control of the intersections plus the sheer numbers of protesters in the area prevented delegates from getting from their hotels to the convention center it also had the effect of cutting the police forces in two the police who had formed a cordon around the convention center were cut off from the rest of the city the police outside of the area eventually tried to break through the protesters lines in the south that morning the king county sheriffs office and seattle police department fired pepper spray tear gas canisters and stun grenades18 at protesters at several intersections in an attempt to reopen the blocked streets and allow as many wto delegates as possible through the blockade19 at 6th avenue and union street the crowd threw objects back at the police20 by late morning the black bloc had swelled to 200 people and smashed dozens of shops and police cars this seems to have set off a chain reaction of sorts with previously nonviolent protesters throwing bottles at police and joining in the vandalism shortly before noon17 some protesters tried to physically obstruct the activities of the black bloc however seattle police led by chief norm stamper did not react immediately protest organizers convinced seattle police during the protestpermit process that peaceful organizers would quell these kinds of activities the police were eventually overwhelmed by the mass of protesters downtown including many who had chained themselves together and were blocking intersections meanwhile the latemorning labororganized rally and march drew tens of thousands though the intended march route had them turning back before they reached the convention center some ignored the marshals and joined what had become a chaotic scene downtown national guardsmen marching to their next assignment at noon the opening ceremony at the convention center was officially cancelled17 it took police much of the afternoon and evening to clear the streets seattle mayor paul schell declared a state of emergency imposed a curfew and a 50block noprotest zone december 1edit overnight the governor gary locke called in two battalions of national guardsmen other law enforcement agencies sent support and before daylight on wednesday troops and officers lined the perimeter of the noprotest zone police surrounded and arrested several groups of wouldbe protesters and more than one bystander beginning at 2100 a major clash took place on broadway in the vicinity of denny way involving rocks bottles and police concussion grenades it did not involve a black bloc but appears to have included local residents although it is known that many local residents were treated as protesters even being teargassed despite having no part in the protests police called in from other cities mistook the typically crowded streets of capitol hill as groups of protesters2122 more than 500 people were jailed on wednesday throughout the day police used tear gas to disperse crowds downtown although a permitted demonstration organized by the steelworkers union was held along the waterfront23 media responseedit the new york times printed an erroneous article that stated that protesters at the 1999 wto convention in seattle threw molotov cocktails at police24 two days later the new york times printed a correction saying that the protest was mostly peaceful and no protesters were accused of throwing objects at delegates or the police but the original error persisted in later accounts in the mainstream media25 the seattle city council also dispelled these rumors with its own investigation findings the level of panic among police is evident from radio communication and from their inflated crowd estimates which exceed the numbers shown on news videotapes arc investigators found the rumors of molotov cocktails and sale of flammables from a supermarket had no basis in fact but rumors were important in contributing to the police sense of being besieged and in considerable danger26 an article in the magazine the nation disputed that molotov cocktails have ever been thrown at an antiglobalization protest within the us27 video shot by anarchists at seattle does show some protesters throwing debris at police2829 though media coverage of the battle in seattle condemned the violence of many protesters the nature of this violence has justified its use to some people specifically the violence employed was symbolic violence that is “acts directed toward property not people”30 though many still denounced the violent tactics used by protesters of the 1999 wto meeting in seattle this violence clearly resulted in increased media coverage of the event the wto meeting had an increase in evening news airtime from 10 minutes and 40 seconds on the first day of the meeting to 17 minutes on the first day of violence30 in addition wto coverage was the lead or second story on cnn abc cbs and nbc after violence was reported31 two days after the start of violence the meeting remained the top story on three of the four networks30 though these numbers alone are telling the media coverage of subsequent demonstrations that did not include violence by protesters shows even more the effect of violence on coverage for example the world bankinternational monetary fund wbimf meetings in the spring showed a “coverage pattern that was almost the reverse of that in seattle” and that “suggests the crucial role of violence in garnering time on the public screen30 in an even more striking example of the effects of violence on media coverage the 2001 wto meeting in doha qatar included no reports of violence30 as a result “there was absolutely no tv evening news coverage by the four major networks30 this coverage did not center exclusively on the violence instead details of the protesters’ message and antiglobalization campaign were included along with the discussions of symbolic violence taking place30 deluca believes the violence served as a dense surface that opened viewers’ and readers’ minds to a whole new way of thinking about globalization and corporations’ operations30 that is not only was this violence contained within the familiar setting of television and not only did it meet the criteria of being dramatic and emotional enough to warrant air time but it also shattered preconceived notions of globalization and the practices of corporations that drive so much of americas economy30 aftermathedit to many in north american anarchist and radical circles the seattle wto riots protests and demonstrations were viewed as a success32 prior to the battle of seattle almost no mention was made of antiglobalization in the us media while the protests were seen as having forced the media to report on why anybody would oppose the wto33 similar tactics on the part of both protesters and police were repeated at subsequent meetings of the wto imfworld bank free trade area of the americas and other international organizations as well as the democratic and republican national conventions in the us previous mass demonstrations had taken place in australia in december 1997 in which newly formed grassroots organizations blockaded melbourne perth sydney and darwin city centers34 the seattle protests were by far the largest actions to have taken place in the united states controversy over the citys response to the protests resulted in the resignation of the police chief of seattle norm stamper35 and arguably played a role in schells loss to greg nickels in the 2001 mayoral primary election3637 the massive size of the protest added 3 million to the citys estimated meeting budget of 6 million partly due to city cleanup and police overtime bills in addition the damage to commercial businesses from vandalism and lost sales has been estimated at 20 million38 on january 16 2004 the city of seattle settled with 157 individuals arrested outside of the noprotest zone during the wto events agreeing to pay them a total of 25000039 on january 30 2007 a federal jury found that the city had violated protesters fourth amendment constitutional rights by arresting them without probable cause or evidence4041 see alsoedit
