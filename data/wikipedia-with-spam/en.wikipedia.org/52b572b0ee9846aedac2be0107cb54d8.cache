candidates about abortion in those debates in which he participated many republican leaders saw this as unnecessary and divisive36 keyes was particularly critical of clinton during his campaign saying

critical of pat buchanan once saying during an interview on the talk from the heart program with al kresta simulcast on kjsl st louis and wmuz detroit that buchanan had a black heart keyess entry into the republican race after buchanan had secured victories in new hampshire and louisiana led many to believe that keyes was a stalking horse for neoconservative elements in the republican party since buchanan had been a wellknown ardent foe of abortion and had suffered political fallout for bringing abortion and cultural war to the center of the public policy debate later during the primaries keyes was briefly detained by atlanta police when he tried to force his way into a debate to which he had been invited and then uninvited he was never formally arrested and was eventually picked up 20

for the us senate after the republican nominee jack ryan withdrew due to a sex scandal and other potential draftees most notably former illinois governor jim edgar and former chicago bears coach mike ditka declined to run the washington post called keyes a carpetbagger44 since he had never lived in illinois4546 when asked to answer charges of carpetbagging in the context of his earlier criticism of hillary clinton he called her campaign pure and planned selfish ambition but stated that in his case he felt a moral obligation to run after being asked to by the illinois republican party you are doing what you believe to be required by your respect for gods will and i think that thats what im doing in illinois47 keyes who opposes abortion in all cases except as an inadvertent result of efforts to save the mothers life48 said in a september 7 2004 news conference that jesus christ would not vote for obama49 because of votes that obama—then a member of the illinois senate judiciary committee and a lecturer in constitutional law at the university of chicago law school—cast in 2001 against a package of three antiabortion bills that obama argued were too broad and unconstitutional the legislation which provided that a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person50 passed the republicancontrolled illinois senate but failed to pass out of the democraticcontrolled illinois house judiciary committee51 after the election keyes declined to congratulate obama explaining that his refusal to congratulate obama was not anything personal but was meant to make a statement against extending false congratulations to the triumph of what we have declared to be across the line of reasonable propriety he said that obamas position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line im supposed to make a call that represents the congratulations toward the triumph of that which i believe ultimately stands for  a culture evil enough to destroy the very soul and heart of my country i cannot do this and i will not make a false gesture keyes said52 keyes was also criticized for his views on homosexuality in an interview with michelangelo signorile a gay radio host keyes defined homosexuality as centering in the pursuit of pleasure literally selfish hedonism when signorile asked if mary cheney vice president dick cheneys lesbian daughter fit the description and was therefore a selfish hedonist keyes replied of course she is that goes by definition53 media sources picked up on the exchange reporting that keyes had trashed attacked and lashed out at mary cheney and had called her a sinner—provoking condemnation of keyes by lgbt republicans and several gop leaders5455 keyes noted that it was an interviewer not he who brought up mary cheneys name in the above incident and he told reporters you have tried to personalize the discussion of an issue that i did not personalize the people asking me the question did so and if thats inappropriate blame the media do not blame me565758 during the campaign keyes outlined an alternative to reparations for slavery his specific suggestion was that for a period of one or two generations africanamericans who were descended from slaves would be exempt from the federal income tax though not from the fica tax that supports social security59 keyes said the experiment would become a demonstration project for what i believe needs to be done for the whole country which is to get rid of the income tax60 he also called for the repeal of the 17th amendment in order to require

call for radio america from arlington virginia the show became simulcast on cables national empowerment television in 1997102 keyes also launched various webbased organizations—notably renew america and the declaration foundation both headquartered in washington dc keyes has served on the board of advisors for the catholic league a nonprofit catholic advocacy group headed by william a donohue in 1997 he was quoted as calling in that capacity the abc television show nothing sacred propaganda dressed up as entertainment the way the nazis used to make movies the entertainment elites belief that there are no moral absolutes deeply contradicts the religious view of christianity103 in 2002 he hosted a live television commentary show alan keyes is making sense on the msnbc cable news channel104 the network canceled the show in july citing poor ratings the cancellation triggered a currently ongoing boycott led by jewish education website mesoraorg whose reach numbers more than 72000 email subscribers105 the show was unsympathetic to supporters of the alaqsa intifadah—whom keyes frequently debated on the program—and supported the israeli crackdown on palestinians the show also featured critical discussion of homosexuality and of priests accused in the catholic church sex abuse scandals the last episode was broadcast on june 27 2002 as a result of keyess strong advocacy of israel on his msnbc show in july 2002 the state of israel awarded him a special honor in appreciation of his journalistic endeavors and his integrity in reporting and flew him in to meet prime minister ariel sharon106 in august 2003 keyes came out in defense of alabama chief justice roy moore citing both the us constitution and the alabama constitution as sanctioning moores and alabamas authority to publicly display the ten commandments in the states judicial building in defiance of a court order from us district judge myron thompson107108 although the monument was ultimately removed by state authorities the issue impelled keyes to spend the next year advocating his understanding of the constitutions protection of the right of states to display monuments that reflect the religious sentiments of the people in their states as a result he published an essay describing his rationale titled on the establishment of religion what the constitution really says109 in early 2005 keyes sought to intervene in the terri schiavo case arguing that schiavos life was protected by the florida constitution and that governor jeb bush had final authority to determine the outcome of the case under state provisions he attempted to meet with bush to discuss the provisions of florida law that authorized the governor to order schiavos feeding tubes reinserted—something bush claimed he wished to do but for which he said he lacked authority—but the governor declined to meet with keyes keyes subsequently wrote an essay directed openly at governor bush titled judicial review and executive responsibility110 days after schiavos feeding tube had been removed in november 2006 keyes criticized massachusetts governor mitt romney for instituting gay marriage entirely on his own—according to keyes—with no requirement or authority to do so under massachusetts law keyes said romneys actions which he suggested were due to a complete misunderstanding of his role as governor and of the limitations of the judicial branch of government were not necessitated by a ruling of the massachusetts supreme judicial court in november 2003 that directed the state legislature to institute samesex marriage the massachusetts supreme judicial court had ruled that the state law banning samesex marriage was not constitutional111 the court gave the massachusetts legislature 180 days to modify the law after it failed to do so gov mitt romney ordered town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses on may 17 2004 in compliance with the court ruling112 commenting on the issue keyes asked rhetorically since the legislature has not acted on the subject you might be wondering how it is that homosexuals are being married in massachusetts its because mitt romney who is telling people hes an opponent of samesex marriage forced the justices of the peace and others to perform samesex marriage all on his own with no authorization or requirement from the court tells you how twisted our politicians have become113 keyes olavo de carvalho author of a dozen books on philosophical and political matters and alejandro peña esclusa president of unoamerica met on 3 march 2009 in washington dc for an informal and friendly talk114 in july 2010 olavo de carvalho denounced a plot against alejandro peña esclusa who was arrested on terrorismrelated charges115 according to the website of the

release keyes criticized the 2015 papal encyclical laudato si stating that its demands amount to global penal colony under the totalitarian control of a government with unprecedented global powers in the same article keyes likened the encyclicals author pope francis to marx stalin or mao zedong126 127 during the time of the 2016 presidential election keyes emerged as a strong critic of donald trump he criticized many conservative christians for supporting a candidate whose life could be used to illustrate the deceitfully seductive quality of sin summarized in the phrase the glamour of
