mesh networking from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search illustration of a partial mesh network a fully mesh network is where each node is connected to every other node in the network a mesh network is a local network topology in which the infrastructure nodes ie bridges switches and other infrastructure devices connect directly dynamically and nonhierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data fromto clients mesh networks dynamically selforganize and selfconfigure which can reduce installation overhead the ability to selfconfigure enables dynamic distribution of workloads particularly in the event that a few nodes should fail this in turn contributes to faulttolerance and reduced maintenance costs mesh topology may be contrasted with conventional startree local network topologies in which the bridgesswitches are directly linked to only a small subset of other bridgesswitches and the links between these infrastructure neighbours are hierarchical while starandtree topologies are very well established highly standardized and vendorneutral vendors of mesh network devices have not yet all agreed on common standards and interoperability between devices from different vendors is not yet assured contents 1 basic principles 2 wired mesh 3 wireless mesh 31 development history 32 examples 4 see also 5 references 6 external links basic principlesedit mesh networks can relay messages using either a flooding technique or a routing technique with routing the message is propagated along a path by hopping from node to node until it reaches its destination to ensure that all its paths are available the network must allow for continuous connections and must reconfigure itself around broken paths using selfhealing algorithms such as shortest path bridging selfhealing allows a routingbased network to operate when a node breaks down or when a connection becomes unreliable as a result the network is typically quite reliable as there is often more than one path between a source and a destination in the network although mostly used in wireless situations this concept can also apply to wired networks and to software interaction a mesh network whose nodes are all connected to each other is a fully connected network fully connected wired networks have the advantages of security and reliability problems in a cable affect only the two nodes attached to it however in such networks the number of cables and therefore the cost goes up rapidly as the number of nodes increases wired meshedit shortest path bridging allows ethernet switches to be connected in a mesh topology and it allows for all paths to be active12345 wireless meshedit development historyedit wireless mesh radio networks were originally developed for military applications such that every node could dynamically serve as a router for every other node in that way even in the event of a failure of some nodes the remaining nodes could continue to communicate with each other and if necessary to serve as uplinks for the other nodes early wireless mesh network nodes had a single halfduplex radio that at any one instant could either transmit or receive but not both at the same time this was accompanied by the development of shared mesh networks this was subsequently superseded by more complex radio hardware that could receive packets from an upstream node and transmit packets to a downstream node simultaneously on a different frequency or a different cdma channel this allowed the development of switched mesh networks as the size cost and power requirements of radios declined further nodes could be costeffectively equipped with multiple radios this in turn permitted each radio to handle a different function for instance one radio for client access and another for backhaul services work in this field has been aided by the use of game theory methods to analyze strategies for the allocation of resources and routing of packets678 examplesedit packet radio networks or aloha networks was first used in hawaii to connect the islands given the bulk radios and low data rate the network is less useful than it was envisioned to be in 19981999 a field implementation of a campus wide wireless network using 80211 wavelan 24 ghz wireless interface on several laptops was successfully completed9 several real applications mobility and data transmissions were made10 mesh network was useful for the military market because of its radio capability and not all military missions have frequently moving nodes the dod jtrs radio program which was started in 1997 for example are wireless mesh networks srw the pentagon launched the jtrs program in 1997 with an ambitious to use software to control radio functions such as frequency bandwidth modulation and security previously baked into the hardware this approach in theory would allow the dod to build a family of radios with a common software core capable of handling functions that were previously split among separate hardwarebased radios—vhf voice radios for infantry units uhf voice radios for airtoair and groundtoair communications longrange hf radios for ships and ground troops and a wideband radio capable of transmitting data at megabit speeds across a battlefield however jtrs program was shut down11 in 2012 by us army because the radios done by boeing has a 75 failure rate google home google wifi and google onhub all support wifi mesh networking12 in rural catalonia guifinet was developed in 2004 as a response to the lack of broadband internet where commercial internet providers werent providing a connection or a very poor one nowadays with more than 30000 nodes it is only halfway a fully connected network but following a peer to peer agreement it remained an open free and neutral network with extensive redundancy in 2004 trw inc engineers from carson california successfully tested a multinode mesh wireless network using 80211abg radios on several high speed laptops running linux with new features such as route precedence and preemption capability adding different priorities to traffic service class during packet scheduling and routing and quality of service13 their work concluded that data rate can be greatly enhanced using mimo technology at the radio front end to provide multiple spatial paths zigbee digital radios are incorporated into some consumer appliances including batterypowered appliances zigbee radios spontaneously organize a mesh network using specific routing algorithms transmission and reception are synchronized this means the radios can be off much of the time and thus conserve power zigbee is for low power low bandwidth application scenarios thread is a consumer wireless networking protocol built on open standards and ipv66lowpan protocols threads features include a secure and reliable mesh network with no single point of failure simple connectivity and low power thread networks are easy to set up and secure to use with bankingclass encryption to close security holes that exist in other wireless protocols in 2014 google incs nest labs announced a working group with the companies samsung arm holdings freescale silicon labs big ass fans and the lock company yale to promote thread in early 2007 the usbased firm meraki launched a mini wireless mesh router14 the 80211 radio within the meraki mini has been optimized for longdistance communication providing coverage over 250 metres in contrast to multiradio long range mesh networks with tree based topologies and their advantages in on routing the maraki had only one radio which it used for both client access as well as backhaul traffic15 the naval postgraduate school monterey ca demonstrated such wireless mesh networks for border security16 in a pilot system aerial cameras kept aloft by balloons relayed real time high resolution video to ground personnel via a mesh network spawar a division of the us navy is prototyping and testing a scalable secure disruption tolerant mesh network 17 to protect strategic military assets both stationary and mobile machine control applications running on the mesh nodes take over when internet connectivity is lost use cases include internet of things eg smart drone swarms an mit media lab project has developed the xo1 laptop or olpc one laptop per child which is intended for disadvantaged schools in developing nations and uses mesh networking based on the ieee 80211s standard to create a robust and inexpensive infrastructure18 the instantaneous connections made by the laptops are claimed by the project to reduce the need for an external infrastructure such as the internet to reach all areas because a connected node could share the connection with nodes nearby a similar concept has also been implemented by greenpacket with its application called sonbuddy19 in cambridge uk on 3 june 2006 mesh networking was used at the “strawberry fair” to run mobile live television radio and internet services to an estimated 80000 people20 broadbandhamnet a mesh networking project used in amateur radio is a highspeed selfdiscovering selfconfiguring faulttolerant wireless computer network with very low power consumption and a focus on emergency communication21 the champaignurbana community wireless network cuwin project is developing mesh networking software based on open source implementations of the hazysighted link state routing protocol and expected transmission count metric additionally the wireless networking group22 in the university of illinois at urbanachampaign are developing a multichannel multiradio wireless mesh testbed called netx as a proof of concept implementation of some of the multichannel protocols being developed in that group the implementations are based on an architecture that allows some of the radios to switch channels to maintain network connectivity and includes protocols for channel allocation and routing23 fabfi is an opensource cityscale wireless mesh networking system originally developed in 2009 in jalalabad afghanistan to provide highspeed internet to parts of the city and designed for high performance across multiple hops it is an inexpensive framework for sharing wireless internet from a central provider across a town or city a second larger implementation followed a year later near nairobi kenya with a freemium pay model to support network growth both projects were undertaken by the fablab users of the respective cities smesh is an 80211 multihop wireless mesh network developed by the distributed system and networks lab at johns hopkins university24 a fast handoff scheme allows mobile clients to roam in the network without interruption in connectivity a feature suitable for realtime applications such as voip many mesh networks operate across multiple radio bands for example firetide and wave relay mesh networks have the option to communicate node to node on 52 ghz or 58 ghz but communicate node to client on 24 ghz 80211 this is accomplished using softwaredefined radio sdr the solarmesh project examined the potential of powering 80211based mesh networks using solar power and rechargeable batteries25 legacy 80211 access points were found to be inadequate due to the requirement that they be continuously powered26 the ieee 80211s standardization efforts are considering power save options but solarpowered applications might involve single radio nodes where relaylink power saving will be inapplicable the wing project27 sponsored by the italian ministry of university and research and led by createnet and technion developed a set of novel algorithms and protocols for enabling wireless mesh networks as the standard access architecture for next generation internet particular focus has been given to interference and traffic aware channel assignment multiradiomultiinterface support and opportunistic scheduling and traffic aggregation in highly volatile environments wiback wireless backhaul technology has been developed by the fraunhofer institute for open communication systems fokus in berlin powered by solar cells and designed to support all existing wireless technologies networks are due to be rolled out to several countries in subsaharan africa in summer 201228 recent standards for wired communications have also incorporated concepts from mesh networking an example is itut ghn a standard that specifies a highspeed up to 1 gbits local area network using existing home wiring power lines phone lines and coaxial cables in noisy environments such as power lines where signals can be heavily attenuated and corrupted by noise its common that mutual visibility between devices in a network is not complete in those situations one of the nodes has to act as a relay and forward messages between those nodes that cannot communicate directly effectively creating a relaying network in ghn relaying is performed at the data link layer see alsoedit information technology portal category of mesh networking technologies bluetooth mesh networking wireless mesh network optical mesh
