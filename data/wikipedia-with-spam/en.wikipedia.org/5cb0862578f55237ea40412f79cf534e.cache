external links planningedit panoramic view of the alaskayukonpacific exposition sanborn map of the ayp grounds this extremely detailed map was created for insurance purposes the fair was evolved from an idea of godfrey chealanders chealander then grand secretary of the arctic brotherhood was involved in the alaska territory exhibit at the 1905 lewis and clark exposition in portland oregon originally he pitched william sheffield of the alaska club and james a wood city editor of the seattle times on the idea of a permanent exhibit in seattle about alaska this merged with woods desire for an exposition to rival portlands they soon gained the backing of times publisher alden j blethen—remarkably for the time without gaining the opposition of the rival seattle postintelligencer1 edmond s meany proposed that the exposition be held on the then largely forested campus of the university of washington which in 1905 had exactly three buildings and little deliberate landscaping at the time this was considered rather far from the center of town but meany eventually sold the others involved on the idea that the forested campus could itself be an attraction for outoftown visitors and that the trolley ride from downtown would not be an obstacle to attendance of course he was also highly aware of what the landscaping and structures could do for the campus2 the state legislature endorsed the fair with the proviso that it would produce at least four permanent buildings and that any state monetary contribution would be focused mainly on those buildings king county the county in which seattle is located stepped up with us300000 for a forestry exhibit—the largest log cabin ever built—and 78000 for other exhibits because the original klondike gold strikes had been in canada the concept soon evolved to an alaskayukon exposition later at the behest of the seattle chamber of commerce the pacific theme was also added to emphasize the oriental trade3 the exposition became known as the ayp for short4 although the fair almost certainly could have been ready for 1907 it was postponed so as not to conflict with the jamestown exposition this turned out to be good fortune for seattle because 1907 proved to be a bad year for the economy if the exposition had been held that year it almost certainly would have been a financial failure rather than the success it was in 19095 design and constructionedit manufactures building under construction the olmsted brothers of brookline massachusetts were selected to plan the exposition the firm was already involved in planning parks and parkways for the city of seattle john c olmsted visited seattle in october 1906 and saw the dominant form of mount rainier toward the southeast he selected the mountain as the focus of the primary axis of the exposition this axis later became the rainier vista of the university of washington campus the principal landscape architect for the fair was the olmsted firms james frederick dawson his design centered on a long pool with a series of short waterfalls along rainier vista6 john galen howards firm howard and galloway based in san francisco was chosen as supervising architects for the exposition buildings they designed several buildings and supervised construction of those designed by other architects the fairgrounds were entirely ready for the june 1 1909 opening7 exhibitsedit the only foreign countries to erect entire buildings at the fair were japan and canada but their presence was enough to validate the pacific theme along with the us territory of hawaii and the philippines recently ceded to the us by spain other foreign countries were represented on a smaller scale the very popular king county exhibit included a scale model of the coal mine at nearby newcastle washington and dioramas of several seattle scenes the originals of which were only a trolley ride away the womans building emphasized the role of women in pioneering the american west and in current charity work the pay streak was seattles answer to chicagos midway and featured games of chance and amusements there was also a reenactment of the american civil war naval battle of hampton roads the battle of monitor and merrimack8 the forestry building the hoohoo house and bastion which became the uw faculty lounge until torn down and replaced midcentury display of southern california fruits opening ceremonyedit the gates opened at 830 am on june 1 and crowds entered immediately at 930 am attendees watched performances by military bands from the army and the navy many sat in the fairs amphitheater awaiting a signal scheduled to be given in washington dc at 3pm east coast time 12 noon in seattle in the east room of the white house president taft sent the signal he opened the exposition by touching a gold telegraph key studded with gold nuggets taken from the first mine opened in the klondike region9 the telegraphic spark that taft sent was received by telegraphers at the fairgrounds as soon as it arrived a gong was struck five times a large american flag was unfurled and there was a twentyone gun salute while other demonstrations of pageantry announced the official opening of the fair10 attendanceedit baby eating heinz apple butter and smiling from an h j heinz promotional pamphlet originally labelled pleased with the goods opening day june 1 was declared a city holiday and 80000 people attended11 attendance was even higher—117013—on seattle day12 other big draws were days dedicated to various ethnic groups fraternal organizations and us states13 by the time the fair closed on october 16 over 3700000 had visited publicityedit the fair had its own publicity department and it used newspapers and magazines to promote the upcoming exhibition well in advance in early 1908 seattle newspapers reported that the publicity department was already showing positive results and the fair was earning many favorable mentions in publications all over the united states14 the publicists stressed that this exhibition would be far better organized than 1907s jamestown exposition and would feature impressive entertainment but what many newspapers found interesting was the assertion that this next worlds fair would not require any financial assistance or subsidies from the us government the only request made by the fairs directors was that the united states erect buildings and exhibits like any other country15 throughout 1908 as each new exhibit was built and the fair gradually began to take shape publicity about the fairs progress was sent out and frequently printed nearly verbatim from the press releases for example the tampa fl tribune printed a story about how the fair would have motor boat races the article noted that the pavilion for the event was being built on one of the prettiest spots on the expositions shoreline further the article praised puget sound for being an area perfect for motor boating enthusiasts and concluded by saying the climate is such that motor boating can be enjoyed all the year round16 by early 1909 the focus turned to who was going to attend as many local newspapers in distant locations wrote articles about residents of their state who planned to make the trip out to seattle also helpful was the fact that several major newspaper conventions were scheduled for the west coast and the editors were said to be very interested in visiting the fair17 the fairs organizers were also able to benefit from advertisements placed in newspapers by the railroads which encouraged people to travel by rail to seattle one such ad for the great northern railway promoted the train as the best way to enjoy a scenic trip an attractive route over the rockies and through the cascades before finally arriving at what was sure to be the worlds most beautiful fair18 legaciesedit architecture hall 2008 the primary physical legacy of the alaska–yukon–pacific exposition is the planning framework from the fair which continues to shape the university of washington campus the rainier vista and drumheller fountain the focus of the ayp are today the central focus of the science quadrangle of the universitys overall plan although most of the expositions buildings were designed as temporary structures intended to last only for the duration of the fair some were more permanent the fine arts palace was designed by howard and galloway as a chemistry building it was used during the ayp for the exhibit of art after the exposition was over chemistry lab tables and other furnishings were moved in and it became the universitys primary facility for teaching chemistry the building was named bagley hall after daniel bagley and retained that name until 1937 when a new chemistry building named bagley hall opened the older building then became the home of architecture and physiology the building survives today albeit with extensive renovation and restoration and is known as architecture hall the ayp womens building also survives during the fair it housed exhibits related to women today the building is named cunningham hall after imogen cunningham one of only a few buildings on the university of washington campus named for women during the exposition itself the building was clad in stucco today it is faced in wood siding the building now houses various educational and other programs related to women j e chilberg president of the alaskayukonpacific exposition other buildings from the ayp survived for a time but were subsequently demolished as the university grew the forestry building was demolished midcentury after the natural logs of the structure proved difficult to maintain and few alternative uses for the structure were found it stood on the site of the current husky union building hub the original meany hall the ayp auditorium hall was damaged by an earthquake in 1965 and subsequently demolished another example is the hoohoohouse designed by architect ellsworth storey a clubhouse with reception spaces constructed for the hoohoos a lumbermens fraternity after the fair this building served as the faculty club until it was replaced in 195860 by the current faculty club another legacy of the fair was the enhanced status of exposition president j e chilberg although a respected banker chilberg had never really been one of the citys elite he was drafted into his position with the fair simply as a man who was known to be good at getting things done but without consideration by the citys elite that they had just made an outsider into something tantamount to royalty for the duration of a social season suddenly any party at their first hill home became a major event in the social calendar he and his wife found themselves dining with a close relative of the emperor of japan and hosting a french ambassador19 the statue william henry seward originally erected for the fair now stands in volunteer park william boeing founder of boeing stated that it was during the alaska–yukon–pacific exposition when he saw a manned flying machine for the first time and became fascinated with aircraft controversyedit human exhibitsedit a baby in an incubator displayed as part of the pay streak a monthold orphaned boy named ernest was raffled away as a prize although a winning ticket was drawn nobody claimed the prize the ultimate destiny of the child was still being investigated in 200920 other human exhibits included displays presenting igorot people from the philippines as dogeating primitive people the alaskan siberians — eskimos and a chinese village depicting opium dens and recounting the recent boxer rebellion21 premature babies were also displayed in french physician alexandre lions incubators decades before such systems were commonplace in hospitals this display was not unique to the alaska–yukon–pacific exposition babies had been displayed in incubators since the 1896 berlin exposition given the robustness of the infants seen in photographs there is some question as to whether these infants actually required extra care or if they were simply used for profit particular to this exhibit was a baby incubator cafe which is seen in some photos although historians are unsure if this was an actual cafe or rather a place to view babies feeding at the time there was little in the way of protest from either fairgoers or physicians in fact there was already a seasonal incubator exhibit at luna park in west seattle the infant electrobator concession the babies were mentioned by name in the newspaper during their stay at the exposition and their medical state followed throughout a specific point of interest was the range in ethnicity of the infants no deaths were experienced amongst the babies at the exhibit22 anniversaryedit the year 2009 was the centennial of the alaska–yukon–pacific exposition the city and university held various activities to celebrate this anniversary a documentary was produced by john forsen called aypseattles forgotten worlds fair for pbs available online23 on july 4 2009 a group of 12 cyclists set off from santa rosa california on a 1000 mile bike ride to seattle washington to
