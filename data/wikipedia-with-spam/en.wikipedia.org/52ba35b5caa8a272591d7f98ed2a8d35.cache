listing 6 personnel 7 charts 71 weekly 72 yearend 73 yearend charts 8 certifications 9 notes 10 references production and musicedit teddy riley came up with the songs title while michael recorded the piece for his dangerous album in 1991—it failed to make the final track listing teddy was reportedly upset that jackson did not call him to vacuum clean this old master upon realizing it would be included on blood on the dance floor history in the mix riley wanted to update the musical composition before it appeared on the remix album1 instruments played in the song include a guitar and piano the latter of which has an f2eb5 range in scientific pitch notation jacksons vocal range on the track is c3bb5 and aspects of the song are performed in the key f minor genres that have been attributed to the song are dance2 funk2 and new jack swing3 jackson incorporates many of the vocal traits associated with his work such as hiccups and gasps42356 neil strauss of the new york times suggests that the predatory woman in the title track susie is a metaphor for aids7 however in an interview with adrian grant jackson denied that the song was about aids receptionedit the dallas morning news described blood on the dance floor as an angry tale of a backstabbing woman and michael saunders of the boston globe described it as a middling dancefunk cut28 anthony violenti of the buffalo news said of the single it is laced with teddy rileys new jack swing sound and a pounding techno beat whereas the cincinnati post characterized the song as a lackluster first release  dated playedout dance track but gave the album an overall favorable review39 jim farber of new york daily news noted of the vocals and musical style jackson coughs up a series of strangulated mutters and munchkin hiccups in lieu of a vocal while its chilly fauxindustrial music proves as appealing as a migraine6 william ruhlman of allmusic observed blood on the dance floor is an uptempo jackson song in the increasingly hysterical tradition of billie jean and smooth criminal with jackson huffing puffing and yelping through some nonsense about a stabbing  over a fairly generic electronic dance track he was not complimentary of the bsides that accompanied it5 stephen thomas erlewine also of allmusic had a negative reaction to the record he described blood on the dance floor as a bleak reworking of jam and scream10 music commentator nelson george compared the song to material from dangerous notably the critically acclaimed tracks jam and dangerous he described it as a pile driving song that explodes from radio speakers11 a longtime commentator on jacksons public life j randy taraborrelli gave a retrospective analysis of the album in the biography the magic the madness taraborrelli thought that blood on the dance floor was one of jacksons best songs a song that us fans dont even know exists12 in 2005 j t griffith of allmusic believed that in hindsight blood on the dance floor was actually a good song he explained it is a secondrate mixture of beat it and thriller but jacksons missteps are better than most pop music out there this track showcases all the artists trademarks the ooohing the grunts and funky basslines it is hard to hear blood on the dance floor and not want to moonwalk or dance like a ghoul13 promotionedit jackson and azur in the music video for blood on the dance floor blood on the dance floor was the only track from blood on the dance floor history in the mix to appear on the set list of the history world tour14 the music video for blood on the dance floor was directed by jackson and vincent paterson it premiered on top of the pops in the uk on march 28 1997 several weeks ahead of its release as a single1 the video opens with a thrown switchblade impaling a spray painted image the impaled image is that of a blood dripping love heart with susie me scrawled across it jackson and a group of dancers then enter a salsa dance hall and he begins to dance with a woman susie while shaking a piece of percussion the singer then appears seated while the woman dances seductively above him on a table top after the 1st verse and chorus there is an a cappella moment in which jackson breathes to the drums and the bass then the strings then spins drops down and claps then he main song starts with the 2nd verse throughout the video jackson shows a sexual attraction towards the dancing woman—played by sybil azur jackson caresses her ankle calf knee and thigh and at one stage looks up her dress the woman is then seen opening a flick knife as the pair engage in a final courtship dance the video closes in the same manner it began with the switchblade impaling the spray painted image the music video won the brazilian tvz video award best international music video of the year1115 interviewed on her experience during the video one of the dancers carmit bachar of the pussycat dolls noted i was called in by vincent paterson for blood on the dance floor it was to have a latin feel some sort of mambo i arrived wearing a little salsa dress fish nets heels and my hair was up in a kind of bun with a flower i was camera ready i showed up with the whole outfit its not that producers cant see what they like or the potential in somebody but what i do helps them to see their vision more16 a refugee camp mix of blood on the dance floor appeared on jacksons video collection history on film volume ii and michael jacksons vision the original song would later appear on the number ones dvd which contained previously unreleased scenes1 furthermore paterson recorded an unreleased alternate version of the music video shot with an 8 mm camera writer david noh described it as grainy overexposed and sexy as shit according to paterson michael loved it but sony hated it and refused to release it17 the new york times described the united states promotional effort for the blood on the dance floor history in the mix campaign as subdued creating hardly a sound and perplexing to many people in the industry jacksons label epic records refuted allegations they were not promoting the album sufficiently saying we are completely behind the album  michael is certainly one of our superstars and is treated as such  we just went into this one with our global hats on the new york times acknowledged that promotion was stronger internationally where jackson had more commercial force and popularity18 chart performanceedit the song became a top ten hit in almost every european union state blood on the dance floor peaked at number one in the uk spain and new zealand charting for 11 weeks in the latter two nations in the uk it sold 85000 copies in its first week enough to take the number one spot from i believe i can fly by friend and collaborator r kelly the song was jacksons seventh uk chart topper as a solo artist although it fell to number eight in its second week of release the european country where blood on the dance floor had the most longevity was switzerland where it spent 18 weeks in the chart by contrast the song appeared in the italian chart for only one week11119 the single peaked at number 42 on the us billboard hot 10011 this relatively lower peak position has been attributed to the lack of us promotion and—according to j randy taraborrelli and allmusic writer william ruhlman—the ongoing us public interest in the singers private life over his music2012 blood on the dance floor was the 20th and last of jacksons reissued singles from the visionary campaign issued in june 2006 it charted at number 19 in
