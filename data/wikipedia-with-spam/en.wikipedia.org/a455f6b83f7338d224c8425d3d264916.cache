incorporating objects and wildlife such as magic wands magic plants potions spells flying broomsticks centaurs and other magical creatures the deathly hallows and the philosophers stone beside others invented by rowling while the fantasy land of narnia is an alternate universe and the lord of the rings middleearth a mythic past the wizarding world of harry potter exists in parallel within the real world and contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life with the action mostly set in scotland hogwarts the west country devon london and surrey in southeast england14 the world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets ancient pubs lonely country manors and secluded castles invisible to the muggle population10 early years when the first novel of the series harry potter and the philosophers stone published in america and other countries as harry potter and the sorcerers stone opens it is apparent that some significant event has taken place in the wizarding world – an event so very remarkable even muggles nonmagical people notice signs of it the full background to this event and harry potters past is revealed gradually through the series after the introductory chapter the book leaps forward to a time shortly before harry potters eleventh birthday and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed despite harrys aunt and uncles desperate prevention of harry gleaning about his powers15 their efforts are in vain harry meets a halfgiant rubeus hagrid who is also his first contact with the wizarding world hagrid reveals himself to be the keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts as well as some of harrys history15 harry learns that as a baby he witnessed his parents murder by the powerobsessed dark wizard lord voldemort who subsequently attempted to kill him as well15 instead the unexpected happened harry survived with only a lightningshaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack and voldemort disappeared soon afterwards gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse as its inadvertent saviour from voldemorts reign of terror harry has become a living legend in the wizarding world however at the orders of the venerable and wellknown wizard albus dumbledore the orphaned harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant muggle relatives the dursleys who have kept him safe but treated him poorly including confining him to a cupboard without meals and torturing him like he is their servant hagrid then officially invites harry to attend hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry a famous magic school in scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years from age eleven to seventeen with hagrids help harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at hogwarts as harry begins to explore the magical world the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends ron weasley a funloving member of an ancient large happy but poor wizarding family and hermione granger a gifted bright and hardworking witch of nonmagical parentage1516 harry also encounters the schools potions master severus snape who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him the rich brat draco malfoy whom he quickly makes enemies with and the defence against the dark arts teacher quirinus quirrell who later turns out to be allied with lord voldemort he also discovers a talent of flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his houses quidditch team a sport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks the first book concludes with harrys second confrontation with lord voldemort who in his quest to regain a body yearns to gain the power of the philosophers stone a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold15 the series continues with harry potter and the chamber of secrets describing harrys second year at hogwarts he and his friends investigate a 50yearold mystery that appears uncannily related to recent sinister events at the school rons younger sister ginny weasley enrolls in her first year at hogwarts and finds an old notebook in her belongings which turns out to be an alumnuss diary tom marvolo riddle later revealed to be voldemorts younger self who is bent on ridding the school of mudbloods a derogatory term describing wizards and witches of nonmagical parentage the memory of tom riddle resides inside of the diary and when ginny begins to confide in the diary voldemort is able to possess her through the diary ginny acts on voldemorts orders and unconsciously opens the chamber of secrets unleashing an ancient monster later revealed to be a basilisk which begins attacking students at hogwarts it kills those who make direct eye contact with it and petrifies those who look at it indirectly the book also introduces a new defence against the dark arts teacher gilderoy lockhart a highly cheerful selfconceited wizard with a pretentious facade later turning out to be a fraud harry discovers that prejudice exists in the wizarding world through delving into the schools history and learns that voldemorts reign of terror was often directed at wizards and witches who were descended from muggles harry also learns about the innate ability of his to speak the snake language parseltongue is rare and often associated with the dark arts when hermione is attacked and petrified harry and ron finally piece together the puzzles and unlock the chamber of secrets with harry destroying the diary for good and saving ginny and also destroying a part of voldemorts soul the end of the book reveals lucius malfoy dracos father and rival of ron and ginnys father to be the culprit who slipped the book into ginnys belongings and introduced the diary into hogwarts the third novel harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban follows harry in his third year of magical education it is the only book in the series which does not feature lord voldemort in any form instead harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by sirius black his fathers best friend and according to the wizarding world an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of harrys parents as harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the school he reaches out to remus lupin a defence against the dark arts

lupin and black were best friends of his father and that black was framed by their fourth friend peter pettigrew who had been hiding rons pet rat scabbers17 in this book a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised – in every book there is a new defence against the dark arts teacher none of whom lasts more than one school year voldemort returns the elephant house was one of the cafés in edinburgh where rowling wrote the first part of harry potter during harrys fourth year of school detailed in harry potter and the goblet of fire harry is unwillingly entered as a participant in the triwizard tournament a dangerous yet exciting contest where three champions one from each participating school must compete with each other in three tasks in order to win the triwizard cup this year

from him18 harry is guided through the tournament by their new defence against the dark arts professor alastor madeye moody who turns out to be an impostor – one of voldemorts supporters named barty crouch jr in disguise the point at which the mystery is unravelled marks the series shift from foreboding and uncertainty into open conflict voldemorts plan to have crouch use the tournament to bring

harry is the most prominent voice in the wizarding world attempting to warn of voldemorts return the ministry appoints dolores umbridge as the high inquisitor of hogwarts and the new defence against the dark arts teacher she transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic19 with ron and hermiones suggestion

wizards through those lessons harry begins to develop a crush on the popular and attractive cho chang juggling schoolwork umbridges incessant and persistent efforts to land him in trouble and the defensive lessons harry begins to lose sleep as he constantly receives disturbing dreams about a dark corridor in the ministry of magic followed by a burning desire an important prophecy concerning

has expanded the harry potter universe with several short books produced for various charities2526 in 2001 she released fantastic beasts and where to find them a purported hogwarts textbook and quidditch through the ages a book harry reads for fun proceeds from the sale of these two books benefited the charity comic relief27 in 2007 rowling composed seven handwritten copies of the tales of beedle the bard a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel one of which was auctioned to raise money for the childrens high level group a fund for mentally disabled children in poor countries the book was published internationally on 4 december 20082829 rowling also wrote an 800word prequel in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller waterstones30 all three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels in 2016 she released three new ebooks hogwarts an incomplete and unreliable guide short stories from hogwarts of power politics and pesky poltergeists and short stories from hogwarts of heroism hardship and dangerous hobbies31 pottermore website in 2011 rowling launched a new website announcing an upcoming project called pottermore32 pottermore opened to the general public on 14 april 201233 pottermore allows users to be sorted be chosen by their wand and play various minigames the main purpose of the website was to allow the user to journey though the story with access to content not revealed by jk rowling previously with over 18000 words of additional content34 in september 2015 the website was completely overhauled and most of the features were removed the site has been redesigned and it mainly focuses on the information already available rather than exploration35 structure and genre the harry potter novels are mainly directed at a young adult audience as opposed to an audience of middle grade readers children or adults the novels fall within the genre of fantasy literature and qualify as a type of fantasy called urban fantasy contemporary fantasy or low fantasy they are mainly dramas and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout though they do contain some notable instances of tragicomedy and black humour in many respects they are also examples of the bildungsroman or coming of age novel36 and contain elements of mystery adventure horror thriller and romance the books are also in the words of stephen king shrewd mystery tales37 and each book is constructed in the manner of a sherlock holmesstyle mystery adventure the stories are told from a third person limited point of view with very few exceptions such as the opening chapters of philosophers stone goblet of fire and deathly hallows and the first two chapters of halfblood prince the series can be considered part of the british childrens boarding school genre which includes rudyard kiplings stalky co enid blytons malory towers st clares and the naughtiest girl series and frank richardss billy bunter novels the harry potter books are predominantly set in hogwarts a fictional british boarding school for wizards where the curriculum includes the use of magic38 in this sense they are in a direct line of descent from thomas hughess tom browns school days and other victorian and edwardian novels of british public school life though they are as many note more contemporary grittier darker and more mature than the typical boarding school novel addressing serious themes of death love loss prejudice comingofage and the loss of innocence in a 1990s british setting3940 each of the seven books is set over the course of one school year harry struggles with the problems he encounters and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules if students are caught breaking rules they are often disciplined by hogwarts professors the stories reach their climax in the summer term near or just after final exams when events escalate far beyond inschool squabbles and struggles and harry must confront either voldemort or one of his followers the death eaters with the stakes a matter of life and death – a point underlined as the series progresses by characters being killed in each of the final four books4142 in the aftermath he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor albus dumbledore the only exception to this schoolcentred setting is the final novel harry potter and the deathly hallows in which harry and his friends spend most of their time away from hogwarts and only return there to face voldemort at the dénouement41 themes according to rowling a major theme in the series is death my books are largely about death they open with the death of harrys parents there is voldemorts obsession with conquering death and his quest for immortality at any price the goal of anyone with magic i so understand why voldemort wants to conquer death were all frightened of it7 academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books some more complex than others and some including political subtexts themes such as normality oppression survival and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series43 similarly the theme of making ones way through adolescence and going over ones most harrowing ordeals – and thus coming to terms with them has also been considered44 rowling has stated that the books comprise a prolonged argument for tolerance a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry and that they also pass on a message to question authority and not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth45 while the books could be said to comprise many other themes such as powerabuse of power violence and hatred love loss prejudice and free choice they are as rowling states deeply entrenched in the whole plot the writer prefers to let themes grow organically rather than sitting down and consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers8 along the same lines is the everpresent theme of adolescence in whose depiction rowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters sexualities and not leaving harry as she put it stuck in a state of permanent prepubescence rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction of the ways in which death and violence affects youth and humanity as a whole46 rowling said that to her the moral significance of the tales seems blindingly obvious the key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy because that … is how tyranny is started with people being apathetic and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble47 origins main article harry potter influences and analogues in 1990 rowling was on a crowded train from manchester to london when the idea for harry suddenly fell into her head rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying48 i had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but i had never been so excited about an idea before i simply sat and thought for four delayed train hours and all the details bubbled up in my brain and this scrawny blackhaired bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me rowling completed harry potter and the philosophers stone in 1995 and the manuscript was sent off to several prospective agents49 the second agent she tried christopher little offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to bloomsbury publishing history the novelist j k rowling the logo used in british australian and canadian editions before 2010 which uses the typeface cochin bold50 after eight other publishers had rejected philosophers stone bloomsbury offered rowling a £2500 advance for its publication5152 despite rowlings statement that she did not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the harry potter books the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven53 on the eve of publishing rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more genderneutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group fearing that they would not be interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman she elected to use j k rowling joanne kathleen rowling using her grandmothers name as her second name because she has no middle name5254 harry potter and the philosophers stone was published by bloomsbury the publisher of all harry potter books in the united kingdom on 26 june 199755 it was released in the united states on 1 september 1998 by scholastic – the american publisher of the books – as harry potter and the sorcerers stone56 after rowling had received us105000 for the american rights – a record amount for a

literary critic and cultural commentator71 for reasons of secrecy translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in english leading to a lag of several months before the

book that its english language edition became the first englishlanguage book ever to top the bestseller list in france72 the united states editions were adapted into american english to make them more

showing harry boarding the hogwarts express and a title in the font cochin bold81 the first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic illustrating scenes from the books these covers were created by first cliff wright and then jason cockroft82 due to the appeal of the books among an adult audience bloomsbury commissioned a second line of editions in an adult style these initially used blackandwhite photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books including a very american hogwarts express without depicting people but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of slytherins locket on the cover of the final book international and later editions have been created by a range of designers including mary grandpré for us audiences and mika launis in finland8384 for a later american release kazu kibuishi created covers in a somewhat animeinfluenced style8586 achievements platform 9¾ sign on london kings

release of harry potter and the goblet of fire by 24 june 2000 rowlings novels had been on the list for 79 straight weeks the first three novels were each on the hardcover bestseller list100 on 12 april 2007 barnes noble declared that deathly hallows had broken its preorder record with more than 500000 copies preordered through its site101 for the release of goblet of fire 9000 fedex trucks

copies of prince were sold in the us within the first 24 hours of its release in the united kingdom more than two million copies were sold on the first day104 the initial us print run for deathly hallows was 12 million copies and more than a million were preordered through amazon and barnes noble105 awards honours and recognition the harry potter series has been recognised by a host of awards since the initial publication of philosophers stone including four whitaker platinum book awards all of which were awarded in 2001106 three nestlé smarties book prizes 1997–1999107 two scottish arts council book awards 1999 and 2001108 the inaugural whitbread childrens book of the year award 1999109 the whsmith book of the year 2006110 among others in 2000 harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was nominated for a hugo award for best novel and in 2001 harry potter and the goblet of fire won said award111 honours include a commendation for the carnegie medal 1997112 a short listing for the guardian childrens award 1998 and numerous listings on the notable books editors choices and best books lists of the american library association the new york times chicago public library and publishers weekly113 in 2002 british sociologist andrew blake named harry potter among the icons of british popular culture along with the likes of james bond and sherlock holmes114 in 2003 four of the books were named in the top 24 of the bbcs the big read survey of the best loved novels in the uk115 a 2004 study found that books in the series were commonly read aloud in elementary schools in san diego county california116 based on a 2007 online poll the us national education association listed the series in its teachers top 100 books for children117 three of the books placed among the top 100 chapter books of all time or childrens novels in a 2012 survey published by school library journal sorcerers stone ranked number three prisoner of azkaban 12th and goblet of fire 98th118 in 2012 the opening ceremony of the 2012 summer olympics in london featured a 100foot tall rendition of lord voldemort in a segment designed to show off the uks cultural icons119 reception literary criticism early in its history harry potter received positive reviews on publication the first book harry potter and the philosophers stone attracted attention from the scottish newspapers such as the scotsman which said it had all the makings of a classic120 and the glasgow herald which called it magic stuff120 soon the english newspapers joined in with more than one comparing it to roald dahls work the mail on sunday rated it as the most imaginative debut since roald dahl120 a view echoed by the sunday times comparisons to dahl are this time justified120 while the guardian called it a richly textured novel given liftoff by an inventive wit120 by the time of the release of the fifth book harry potter and the order of the phoenix the books began to receive strong criticism from a number of literary scholars yale professor literary scholar and critic harold bloom raised criticisms of the books literary merits saying rowlings mind is so governed by clichés and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing121 a s byatt authored a new york times oped article calling rowlings universe a secondary secondary world made up of intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of childrens literature  written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to tv cartoons and the exaggerated more exciting not threatening mirrorworlds of soaps reality tv and celebrity gossip122 michael rosen a novelist and poet advocated the books were not suited for children who would be unable to grasp the complex themes rosen also stated that j k rowling is more of an adult writer123 the critic anthony holden wrote in the observer on his experience of judging harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban for the 1999 whitbread awards his overall view of the series was negative – the potter saga was essentially patronising conservative highly derivative dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone britain and he speaks of a pedestrian ungrammatical prose style124 ursula k le guin said i have no great opinion of it when so many adult critics were carrying on about the incredible originality of the first harry potter book i read it to find out what the fuss was about and remained somewhat puzzled it seemed a lively kids fantasy crossed with a school novel good fare for its age group but stylistically ordinary imaginatively derivative and ethically rather meanspirited125 by contrast author fay weldon while admitting that the series is not what the poets hoped for nevertheless goes on to say but this is not poetry it is readable saleable everyday useful prose126 the literary critic a n wilson praised the harry potter series in the times stating there are not many writers who have jks dickensian ability to make us turn the pages to weep – openly with tears splashing – and a few pages later to laugh at invariably good jokes  we have lived through a decade in which we have followed the publication of the liveliest funniest scariest and most moving childrens stories ever written127 charles taylor of saloncom who is primarily a movie critic128 took issue with byatts criticisms in particular while he conceded that she may have a valid cultural point – a teeny one – about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art129 he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious literary merit and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers taylor stressed the progressively darker tone of the books shown by the murder of a classmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and social isolation each causes taylor also argued that philosophers stone said to be the most lighthearted of the seven published books disrupts the childhood reassurances that byatt claims spur the series success the book opens with news of a double murder for example129 stephen king called the series a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable and declared rowlings punning oneeyebrowcocked sense of humor to be remarkable however he wrote that despite the story being a good one he is a little tired of discovering harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle the formulaic beginning of all seven books37 king has also joked that rowlings never met an adverb she did not like he does however predict that harry potter will indeed stand times test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept i think harry will take his place with alice huck frodo and dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade but for the ages130 sameer rahim of the daily telegraph disagreed saying it depresses me to see 16 and 17 yearolds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as oliver twist or a house for mr biswas what that says about the adults who are fanatical fans i’m not sure – but i suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump comfortable infantilising society and the popularity of potter131 there is ongoing discussion regarding the extent to which the series was inspired by tolkiens lord of the rings books132 social impact although time magazine named rowling as a runnerup for its 2007 person of the year award noting the social moral and political inspiration she has given her fandom133 cultural comments on the series have been mixed washington post book critic ron charles opined in july 2007 that the large numbers of adults reading the potter series but few other books may represent a bad case of cultural infantilism and that the straightforward good vs evil theme of the series is childish he also argued through no fault of rowlings the cultural and marketing hysteria marked by the publication of the later books trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum a massmedia experience that no other novel can possibly provide134 librarian nancy knapp pointed out the books potential to improve literacy by motivating children to read much more than they otherwise would135 the sevenbook series has a word count of 1083594 us edition agreeing about the motivating effects diane penrod also praised the books blending of simple entertainment with the qualities of highbrow literary fiction but expressed concern about the distracting effect of the prolific merchandising that accompanies the book launches136 however the assumption that harry potter books have increased literacy among young people is largely a folk legend137 research by the national endowment for the arts nea has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the harry potter publishing phenomenon nor has the broader downward trend in reading among americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the harry potter books137138 the research also found that children who read harry potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy and mystery genres137 nea chairman dana gioia said the series got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably complex series of books the trouble is that one harry potter novel every few years is not enough to reverse the decline in reading139 jennifer conn used snapes and quidditch coach madam hoochs teaching methods as examples of what to avoid and what to emulate in clinical teaching140 and joyce fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical firstyear sociology class sociological concepts including culture society and socialisation stratification and social inequality social institutions and social theory141 jenny sawyer wrote in christian science monitor on 25 july 2007 that the books represent a disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and western society in that stories moral center sic have all but vanished from much of todays pop culture  after 10 years 4195 pages and over 375 million copies j k rowlings towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great childrens literature the heros moral journey harry potter sawyer argues neither faces a moral struggle nor undergoes any ethical growth and is thus no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white142 in contrast emily griesinger described harrys first passage through to platform 9¾ as an application of faith and hope and his encounter with the sorting hat as the first of many in which harry is shaped by the choices he makes she also noted the deeper magic by which the selfsacrifice of harrys mother protects the boy throughout the series and which the powerhungry voldemort fails to understand143 in an 8 november 2002 slate article chris suellentrop likened potter to a trustfund kid whose success at school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him noting that in rowlings fiction magical ability potential is something you are born to not something you can achieve suellentrop wrote that dumbledores maxim that it is our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities is hypocritical as the school that dumbledore runs values native gifts above all else144 in a 12 august 2007 new york times review of deathly hallows however christopher hitchens praised rowling for unmooring her english school story from literary precedents bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery arguing that she had instead created a world of youthful democracy and diversity145 in 2010 coinciding with the release of the film harry potter and the deathly hallows part 1 a series of articles were written about private harry potter of the british army146 this reallife harry potter was killed in the arab revolt near hebron in 1939 his grave located in the british cemetery in ramla israel began to receive curious visitors leading the ramla municipality to list it on their website147 the daily mail interviewed siblings of harry potter who stated we couldnt believe people visit his grave but apparently they come from miles around to have their photo taken next to it148 in 2016 an article written by diana c mutz compares the politics of harry potter to the 2016 donald trump presidential campaign she states that 3 themes throughout the books are widely predominant 1 the value of tolerance and respect for difference 2 opposition to violence and punitiveness and 3 the dangers of authoritarianism she suggests that these themes are also present in the presidential election and it may play a significant role in how americans have responded to the campaign149 controversies main articles legal disputes over the harry potter series religious debates over the harry potter series politics of harry potter and tanya grotter the books have been the subject of a number of legal proceedings stemming from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements the popularity and high market value of the series has led rowling her publishers and film distributor warner bros to take legal measures to protect their copyright which have included banning the sale of harry potter imitations targeting the owners of websites over the harry potter domain name and suing author nancy stouffer to counter her accusations that rowling had plagiarised her work150151152 various religious conservatives have claimed that the books promote witchcraft and religions such as wicca and are therefore unsuitable for children153154 while a number of critics have criticised the books for promoting various political agendas155156 the books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds from 1997 to 1998 harry potter and the philosophers stone won almost all the uk awards judged by children but none of the childrens book awards judged by adults157 and sandra beckett suggested the reason was intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children158 in 1999 the winner of the whitbread book of the year award childrens division was entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award and one judge threatened to resign if harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was declared the overall winner it finished second very close behind the winner of the poetry prize seamus heaneys translation of the anglosaxon epic beowulf158 in 2000 shortly before the publication of harry potter and the goblet of fire the previous three harry potter books topped the new york times fiction bestseller list and a third of the entries were childrens books the newspaper created a new childrens section covering childrens books including both fiction and nonfiction and initially counting only hardback sales the move was supported by publishers and booksellers100 in 2004 the new york times further split the childrens list which was still dominated by harry potter books into sections for series and individual books and removed the harry potter books from the section for individual books159 the split in 2000 attracted condemnation praise and some comments that presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move160 time suggested that on the same principle billboard should have created a separate moptops list in 1964 when the beatles held the top five places in its list and nielsen should have created a separate gameshow list when who wants to be a millionaire dominated the ratings161 adaptations films main article harry potter film series the locomotive that features as the hogwarts express in the film series in 1998 rowling sold the film rights of the first four harry potter books to warner bros for a reported £1 million 1982900162163 rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly british nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of irish actors such as the late richard harris as dumbledore and for casting of french and eastern european actors in harry potter and the goblet of fire where characters from the book are specified as such164 after many directors including steven spielberg terry gilliam jonathan demme and alan parker were considered chris columbus was appointed on 28 march 2000 as the director for harry potter and the philosophers stone titled harry potter and the sorcerers stone in the united states with warner bros citing his work on other family films such as home alone and mrs doubtfire and proven experience with directing children as influences for their decision165 after extensive casting filming began in october 2000 at leavesden film studios and in london itself with production ending in july 2001166167 philosophers stone was released on 14 november 2001 just three days after the films release production for harry potter and the chamber of secrets also directed by columbus began filming was completed in summer 2002 with the film being released on 15 november 2002168 daniel radcliffe portrayed harry potter doing so for all succeeding films in the franchise columbus declined to direct harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban only acting as producer mexican director alfonso cuarón took over the job and after shooting in 2003 the film was released on 4 june 2004 due to the fourth film beginning its production before the thirds release mike newell was chosen as the director for harry potter and the goblet of fire released on 18 november 2005169 newell became the first british director of the series with television director david yates following suit after he was chosen to helm harry potter and the order of the phoenix production began in january 2006 and the film was released the following year in july 2007170 after executives were really delighted with his work on the film yates was selected to direct harry potter and the halfblood prince which was released on 15 july 2009171172173174 gringotts wizarding bank as seen in the film series in march 2008 warner bros president and coo alan f horn

philosophers stone and serving as producer on the twopart deathly hallows alongside david heyman and david barron177 the harry potter films have been toprank box office hits with all eight releases on the list of highestgrossing films worldwide philosophers stone was the highestgrossing harry potter film up until the release of the final instalment of the series deathly hallows while prisoner of azkaban grossed the least178 as well as being a financial success the film series has also been a success among film critics179180 opinions of the films are generally divided among fans with one group preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films and another group preferring the more stylised characterdriven approach of the later films181 rowling has been constantly supportive of all the films and evaluated deathly hallows as her favourite one in the series182183184185 she wrote on her website of the changes in the booktofilm transition it is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long obviously films have restrictions novels do not have constraints of time and budget i can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my readers imaginations186 at the 64th british academy film awards in february 2011 rowling was joined by producers david heyman and david barron along with directors david yates alfonso cuarón and mike newell in collecting the michael balcon award for outstanding british contribution to cinema on behalf of all the films in the series actors rupert grint
