ended on january 27 2010 with the episode now what in february 2010 it was reported that the four brothers are reportedly in negotiations to film episodes for a second season to the reality series contents 1 production 2 reception 3 episodes 4 references 5 external links productionedit the original intention behind the creation of the series—initially titled the jackson family—was that it would be a oneoff hourlong special aired by the cable network ae the show was to center around the jacksons previously known as the jackson 5 and their planning of a new album and tour in celebration of the bands fortieth year in the music industry the initial filming of the brothers began in january 2009 but did not involve lead singer michael jackson it was finished days before the entertainers death in june 2009 which subsequently influenced the shows production company point 7 entertainment to shoot more footage and air it as a television series robert sharenow a senior worker for ae stated in july 2009 that the original show was commissioned as a special but that the company thought of all of their specials as backdoor pilots123 speculation on whether michael jacksons children would appear in the show surfaced shortly after his death the new footage was to showcase the jackson family coping with the loss of michael1 executive producer jodi gomes of point 7 entertainment noted that those involved with the series wanted a television show that was very genuine she added that the jackson siblings were not shy about talking about their brother they just want to find it a way to do it honestly2 gomes concluded that they had done a great job opening up about losing a brother4 debate arose in the media as to whether michael jacksons three children prince paris and blanket were to appear in the series the magazine us weekly commented that the trio would be featured in some capacity in the series despite some members of the jackson family being opposed to the idea michaels elder sister rebbie—who along with la toya and janet were not involved with the production—supposedly felt that he would spin in his grave if he knew his kids would be on this show34 for the majority of their early lives michael had attempted to keep his children out of the spotlight by using hats masks veils and other disguises5 jacksons mother katherine the legal guardian of the three denounced the rumours that her grandchildren would be starring in the show56 ae network also issued a statement proclaiming that the three youngsters would not be appearing in the series at that particular time but that appearances in the future were a possibility4 aes series will chronicle the unscripted real lives of principally four jackson brothers — jackie jermaine tito and marlon — as they go about their lives following the death of their brother michael filming is taking place right now as production moves forward it is entirely possible that the brothers paths will intersect with other members of the jackson family who may or may not be included in the finished series however we cannot at this point definitively know who else may make an appearance in the series45 receptionedit criticism of the series began before it had even premiered lisa de moraes of the washington post expressed her opinion that people would have watched the original show before michael jacksons death when it was a lame see the nonmichael jackson brothers go on tour special de moraes claimed that such individuals were the type to have celebrity news website tmzcom as their homepage during her report of the preview of the show de moraes followed up on jermaine jacksons ponderings on how to pull off a successful reunion with his brothers1 a scene from the jacksons a family dynasty in which jermaine jackson cries was described as being a high point in a review of the show in the spokesmanreview frazier moore condemned the jacksons a family dynasty as being stagey selfconscious and most of all selfserving on the part of its participants in an article for the spokesmanreview he stated that some people may enjoy the program and highlighted a moment in which jermaine jackson cries as being a high point for him moore added that the emotional scene featuring jermaine and his three brothers seemed to have been carefully arranged so that they would get maximum visual effect7 in an entertainment weekly review of the series first episode ken tucker revealed that he felt that the jackson brothers in serving as executive producers had created a very stagemanaged and controlled reality television show he felt that such actions on the part of the siblings made other moments in the show more interesting tucker concluded that with the absence of michael and younger brother randy the show served to only show viewers what an uphill battle the other brothers face in trying to stay in the public eye he rated the episode c8 writing for the new york times mike hale conveyed his thoughts on the first episode he suggested that it would be easy to view the series as an exploitation of michael jackson by his family in order for them to gain money from the late entertainers legacy he countered that such opinions were not reflected in the content of the show which he felt showed the jackson siblings egos and childlike need for affirmation as a larger motivator like tucker hale expressed that the show suffered due to there being no michael jackson he explained that while the other brothers had led fascinating lives they were not fascinating individuals hale finished his review by stating that the jackson 4 had talent and charm but that those positive qualities are outweighed by selfabsorption and arrested development9 mary mcnamara of the los angeles times also spoke negatively of the show in the daily californian publication she voiced her cynicism over the jackson siblings motivation behind the production of the series and why they had wanted to star in it mcnamara offered the opinion that perhaps the four took part in the show to attain some of the attention and following that their younger brother michael had during his lifetime she also stated like those before her that the lack of michael jackson was a loss to the show and concluded that if it were not for the singer being dead the series would have most likely never have aired10 reviewing the first episodes of the series for san jose mercury news journalist chuck barney acknowledged the obvious voyeuristic intrigue that came with the series following michael jacksons death while the run of programs was billed as offering unprecedented access into the lives of the surviving siblings barney warned that the series was overhyped and that it sounds more interesting than it is in actuality he commented that some parts of the show were ridiculous while pointing towards the theme of brotherly pettiness which ran through the majority of the two previews he was provided with barney concluded that while some moments in the show were poignant the most engaging sections of the episodes were the clips that showed the jackson 5 at the height of their fame when you mentally juxtapose those images against scenes of four bickering middleaged guys it becomes apparent that there are times when its much more fun to live in the past11 critical comments also came from alan pergament who was writing for the buffalo news the journalist stated that the series opened with two excruciating hourlong episodes and scoffed that viewers would need a magnifying glass to find something interesting here labeling jermaine jackson the diva of the group pergament insisted that there was much contrived controversy in the show and that the first two hours had a lifeless goingthroughthemotions quality despite his view that jermaine and tito added a little personality to the shows awarding the show one star out of four pergament concluded that the shows were an unnecessary dull creation that cashes in on the family name without providing the thing that michael was best known for — entertainment12 journalist randee dawn also expressed cynicism regarding why the brothers would want to participate in a reality television show so soon after their younger siblings death dawn noted however that the jackson family were in her opinion not like most folks they are sui generis an entity unto itself the writer asserted that spontaneity was lacking in the show due to the four brothers wearing sunglasses and joking around overall dawn felt that the episodes reflected the image of a highconcept press kit but acknowledged that the siblings were dedicated to the project13 episodesedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable
