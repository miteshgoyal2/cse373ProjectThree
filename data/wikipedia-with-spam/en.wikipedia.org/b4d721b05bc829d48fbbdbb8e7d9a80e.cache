april 26 2006 it was announced that denverbased medianews group would buy the mercury news5 however on june 12 2006 federal regulators from the us department of justice asked for more time to review the purchase citing possible antitrust concerns over medianews ownership of other newspapers in the region although approval by regulators and completion of medianews acquisition was announced on august 2 2006 a lawsuit claiming antitrust violations by medianews and the hearst corporation had also been filed in july 20066 the suit which sought to undo the purchase of both the mercury news and the contra costa times was scheduled to go to trial on april 30 2007 while extending until that date a preliminary injunction which prevented collaboration of local distribution and national advertising sales by the two media conglomerates us district judge susan illston on december 19 2006 expressed doubt over the legality of the purchase7 on april 25 2007 days before the trial was scheduled to begin the parties reached a settlement in which medianews preserved its acquisitions8 in september 2014 the mercury news moved to downtown san jose leaving its purposebuilt headquarters
