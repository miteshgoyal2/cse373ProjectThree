drives corporate underwriting state and local governments educational institutions and the federally funded corporation for public broadcasting cpb in 2009 member stations derived 6 of their revenue from federal state and local government funding 10 of their revenue from cpb grants and 14 of their revenue from universities2236 while npr does not receive any direct federal funding it does receive a small number of competitive grants from cpb and federal agencies like the department of education and the department of commerce this funding amounts to approximately 2 of nprs overall revenues22 during the 1970s and early 1980s the majority of npr funding came from the federal government steps were taken during the 1980s to completely wean npr from government support but the 1983 funding crisis forced the network to make immediate changes according to cpb in 2009 113 of the aggregate revenues of all public radio broadcasting stations were funded from federal sources principally through cpb37 in 2012 109 of the revenues for public radio came from federal sources38 in 2011 npr announced the rollout of their own online advertising network which allows member stations to run

commercialsedit in contrast with commercial broadcasting nprs radio broadcasts do not carry traditional commercials but has advertising in the form of brief statements from major sponsors which may include corporate slogans descriptions of products and services contact information such as website addresses and telephone numbers42 these statements are called underwriting spots and unlike commercials are governed by specific fcc restrictions in addition to truth in advertising laws they cannot advocate a product or promote the goods and services of forprofit entities43 these restrictions apply only to radio broadcasts and not nprs other digital platforms when questioned on the subject of how corporate underwriting revenues and foundation grants were holding up during the recession in a speech broadcast on cspan before the national press club on march 2 2009 then president and ceo vivian schiller stated underwriting is down its down for everybody this is the area that is most down for us in sponsorship underwriting advertising call it whatever you want just like it is for all of media44 hosts of the npr program planet money stated the audience is indeed a product

of minnesota public radio these programs were distributed by public radio international prior to apms founding democracy now the flagship news program of the pacifica radio network provides a feed to npr stations and other pacifica programs can occasionally be heard on these stations as well controversiesedit main article npr controversies over the course of nprs history controversies have arisen over several incidents and topics allegations of ideological biasedit npr has been accused of displaying both liberal bias as alleged in work such as a ucla and university of missouri study of morning edition and conservative bias including criticism of alleged reliance on conservative thinktanks67 npr has also been accused of bias related to specific topics including support of the 2003 invasion of iraq and coverage of israel the npr ombudsman has described how nprs coverage of the israelpalestinian conflict has been simultaneously criticized as biased by both sides68 ut austin journalism professor and author robert jensen has criticized npr as taking a prowar stance during coverage of iraq war protests69 in 2002 and 2003 surveys and followup focus groups conducted by the tarrance group and lake snell perry associates have indicated that the majority of the us adult population does not believe that the news and information programming on public broadcasting is biased the plurality of americans indicate that there is no apparent bias one way or the other while approximately twointen detect a liberal bias and approximately oneinten detect a conservative bias70 euphemismsedit in a controversial act npr banned in 2009 the use of the word torture in the context of the bush administrations use of enhanced interrogation techniques71 nprs ombudswoman alicia shepards defense of the policy was that calling waterboarding torture is tantamount to taking sides72 but berkeley professor of linguistics geoffrey nunberg pointed out that virtually all media around the world other than what he called the spineless us media call these techniques torture7374 in an article which criticized npr and other us media for their use of euphemisms for torture glenn greenwald discussed what he called the enabling corruption of american journalism this active media complicity in concealing that our government created a systematic torture regime by refusing ever to say so is one of the principal reasons it was allowed to happen for so long the steadfast ongoing refusal of our leading media institutions to refer to what the bush administration did as torture – even in the face of more than 100 detainee deaths the use of that term by a leading bush official to describe what was done at guantanamo and the fact that media outlets frequently use the word torture to describe exactly the same methods when used by other countries – reveals much about how the modern journalist thinks75 sexual harassmentedit in october 2017 sexual harassment charges were leveled against michael oreskes senior vice president of news and editorial director since 2015 some of the accusations dated back to when he was washington dc bureau chief for the new york times during the 1990s while others involved his conduct at npr76 after a report on the times accusations was published in the washington post npr put oreskes on administrative leave and the following day his resignation was requested777879 cnns brian stelter reported that npr staffers were dissatisfied with the handling of oreskes were demanding an external investigation and that oreskes poisoned the newsroom atmosphere by abusing his position to meet young women80 live from death row commentariesedit in 1994 npr arranged to air on all things considered a series of threeminute commentaries by mumia abujamal a journalist convicted in a controversial trial of murdering a philadelphia police officer they cancelled airing them after the fraternal order of police and members of the us congress objected81 juan williams commentsedit on october 20 2010 npr terminated senior news analyst juan williamss independent contract82 over a series of incidents culminating in remarks he made on the fox news channel regarding muslims ronald schiller commentsedit in march 2011 conservative political activist and provocateur james okeefe sent partners simon templar a pen name and shaughn adeleye83 to secretly record their discussion with ronald schiller nprs outgoing senior vice president for fundraising and an associate in which schiller made remarks viewed as disparaging of the current republican party especially the tea party and controversial comments regarding palestine and funding for npr npr disavowed schillers comments ceo vivian schiller who is not related to ronald later resigned over the fallout from the comments and the previous firing of juan williams84 july 4th tweets of the declaration of independenceedit starting from july 4 1988 npr has broadcast an annual reading of the united states declaration of independence over the radio85 in addition it has recently begun using twitter as a medium for reading the document as well on july 4 2017 the yearly tweets were met with considerable opposition some online supporters of donald trump mistakenly believing the words of the declaration referring to george iii of the united kingdom to be directed towards the president the tweets have been accused of being propagandistic86 condoning of violence87 and calling of revolution8889 many of the responses to nprs tweets have since been retracted see alsoedit
