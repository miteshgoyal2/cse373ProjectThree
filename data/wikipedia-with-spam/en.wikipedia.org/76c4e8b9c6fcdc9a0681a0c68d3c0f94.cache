autoimmune disease in which the bodys immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body1 symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe1 common symptoms include painful and swollen joints fever chest pain hair loss mouth ulcers swollen lymph nodes feeling tired and a red rash which is most commonly on the face1 often there are periods of illness called flares and periods of remission during which there are few symptoms1 the cause of sle is not clear1 it is thought to involve genetics together with environmental factors4 among identical twins if one is affected there is a 24 chance the other one will be as well1 female sex hormones sunlight smoking vitamin d deficiency and certain infections are also believed to increase the risk4 the mechanism involves an immune response by autoantibodies against a persons own tissues1 these are most commonly antinuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation1 diagnosis can be difficult and is based on a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests1 there are a number of other kinds of lupus erythematosus including discoid lupus erythematosus neonatal lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus1 there is no cure for sle1 treatments may include nsaids corticosteroids immunosuppressants hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate1 alternative medicine has not been shown to affect the disease1 life expectancy is lower among people with sle5 sle significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease with this being the most common cause of death4 with modern treatment about 80 of those affected survive more than 15 years3 women with lupus have pregnancies that are higher risk but are mostly successful1 rate of sle varies between countries from 20 to 70 per 1000002 women of childbearing age are affected about nine times more often than men4 while it most commonly begins between the ages of 15 and 45 a wide range of ages can be affected12 those of african caribbean and chinese descent are at higher risk than white people42 rates of disease in the developing world are unclear6 lupus is latin for wolf the disease was sonamed in the 13th century as the rash was thought

symptoms of sle8 sle is one of several diseases known as the great imitator because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses9 sle is a classical item in differential diagnosis10 because sle symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably diagnosis can thus be elusive with some people having unexplained symptoms of sle for years common initial and chronic complaints include fever malaise joint pains muscle pains and fatigue because these symptoms are so often seen in association with other diseases these signs and symptoms are not part of the diagnostic criteria for sle when occurring in conjunction with other signs and symptoms see below however they are considered suggestive11 while sle can occur in both males and females it is found far more often in women and the symptoms associated with each sex are different5 females tend to have a greater number of relapses a low white blood cell count more arthritis raynauds phenomenon and psychiatric symptoms males tend to have more seizures kidney disease serositis inflammation of tissues lining the lungs and heart skin problems and peripheral neuropathy12 skin as many as 70 of people with lupus have some skin symptoms the three main categories of lesions are chronic cutaneous discoid lupus subacute cutaneous lupus and acute cutaneous lupus people with discoid lupus may exhibit thick red scaly patches on the skin similarly subacute cutaneous lupus manifests as red scaly patches of skin but with distinct edges acute cutaneous lupus manifests as a rash some have the classic malar rash or butterfly rash associated with the disease13 this rash occurs in 30 to 60 of people with sle14 hair loss mouth and nasal ulcers and lesions on the skin are other possible manifestations15 muscles and bones the most commonly sought medical attention is for joint pain with the small joints of the hand and wrist usually affected although all joints are at risk more than 90 percent of those affected will experience joint andor muscle pain at some time during the course of their illness16 unlike rheumatoid arthritis lupus arthritis is less disabling and usually does not cause severe destruction of the joints fewer than ten percent of people with lupus arthritis will develop deformities of the hands and feet16 people with sle are at particular risk of developing osteoarticular tuberculosis17 a possible association between rheumatoid arthritis and sle has been suggested18 and sle may be associated with an increased risk of bone fractures in relatively young women19 blood anemia is common in children with sle20 and develops in about 50 of cases21 low platelet and white blood cell counts may be due to the disease or a side effect of pharmacological treatment people with sle may have an association with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome22 a thrombotic disorder wherein autoantibodies to phospholipids are present in their serum abnormalities associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome include a paradoxical prolonged partial thromboplastin time which usually occurs in hemorrhagic disorders and a positive test for antiphospholipid antibodies the combination of such findings have earned the term lupus anticoagulantpositive another autoantibody finding in sle is the anticardiolipin antibody which can cause a false positive test for syphiliscitation needed heart sle may cause pericarditis inflammation of the outer lining surrounding the heart myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle andor endocarditis inflammation of the inner lining of the heart the endocarditis of sle is noninfectious and is also called libman–sacks endocarditis it involves either the mitral valve or the tricuspid valve atherosclerosis also occurs more often and advances more rapidly than in the general population2324 lungs inflammation of the pleurae known as pleurisy can rarely give rise to shrinking lung syndrome25 sle can cause pleuritic pain and also give rise to shrinking lung syndrome involving a reduced lung volume26 other associated lung conditions include pneumonitis chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease pulmonary hypertension pulmonary emboli and pulmonary hemorrhage kidneys painless passage of blood or protein in the urine may often be the only presenting sign of kidney involvement acute or chronic renal impairment may develop with lupus nephritis leading to acute or endstage kidney failure because of early recognition and management of sle endstage renal failure occurs in less than 52728 of cases except in the black population where the risk is many times higher the histological hallmark of sle is membranous glomerulonephritis with wire loop abnormalities29 this finding is due to immune complex deposition along the glomerular basement membrane leading to a typical granular appearance in immunofluorescence testing neuropsychiatric further information neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus neuropsychiatric syndromes can result when sle affects the central or peripheral nervous system the american college of rheumatology defines 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus30 the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric syndromes concurrent with sle now termed as npsle31 is one of the most difficult challenges in medicine because it can involve so many different patterns of symptoms some of which may be mistaken for signs of infectious disease or stroke32 a common neurological disorder people with sle have is headache33 although the existence of a specific lupus headache and the optimal approach to headache in sle cases remains controversial34 other common neuropsychiatric manifestations of sle include cognitive dysfunction mood disorder cerebrovascular disease33 seizures polyneuropathy33 anxiety disorder psychosis depression and in some extreme cases personality disorders35 steroid psychosis can also occur as a result of treating the disease31 it can rarely present with intracranial hypertension syndrome characterized by an elevated intracranial pressure papilledema and headache with occasional abducens nerve paresis absence of a spaceoccupying lesion or ventricular enlargement and normal cerebrospinal fluid chemical and hematological constituents36 more rare manifestations are acute confusional state guillain–barré syndrome aseptic meningitis autonomic disorder demyelinating syndrome mononeuropathy which might manifest as mononeuritis multiplex movement disorder more specifically chorea myasthenia gravis myelopathy cranial neuropathy and plexopathy neurological disorders contribute to a significant percentage of morbidity and mortality in people with lupus37 as a result the neural side of lupus is being studied in hopes of reducing morbidity and mortality rates30 one aspect of this disease is severe damage to the epithelial cells of the blood–brain barrier in certain regions depression affects up to 60 of women with sle38 reproductive further information systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy sle causes an increased rate of fetal death in utero and spontaneous abortion miscarriage the overall livebirth rate in people with sle has been estimated to be 7239 pregnancy outcome appears to be worse in people with sle whose disease flares up during pregnancy40 neonatal lupus is the occurrence of sle symptoms in an infant born from a mother with sle most commonly presenting with a rash resembling discoid lupus erythematosus and sometimes with systemic abnormalities such as heart block or enlargement of the liver and spleen41 neonatal lupus is usually benign and selflimited41 systemic fatigue in sle is probably multifactorial and has been related to not only disease activity or complications such as anemia or hypothyroidism but also to pain depression poor sleep quality poor physical fitness and lack of social support4243 causes sle is presumably caused by a genetic susceptibility coupled with an environmental trigger which results in defects in the immune system one of the factors associated with sle is vitamin d deficiency44 genetics the first mechanism may arise genetically research indicates sle may have a genetic link sle does run in families but no single causal gene has been identified instead multiple genes appear to influence a persons chance of developing lupus when triggered by environmental factors hla class i class ii and class iii genes are associated with sle but only classes i and ii contribute independently to increased risk of sle45 other genes which contain risk variants for sle are irf5 ptpn22 stat446 cdkn1a47 itgam blk46 tnfsf4 and bank148 some of the susceptibility genes may be population specific46 while the genetics of sle are not very well understood there is growing evidence for the involvement of specific genes in this complex autoimmune disease part of the complexity of this disease is due to the effects of both environment and genetics factors that may contribute to its development49 further compounding our understanding of the etiology of the disease is the involvement of several organ systems50 genetic studies of the rates of disease in families supports the genetic basis of this disease with a heritability of 6651 identical monozygotic twins were found to share susceptibility to the disease at 35 rate compared to fraternal dizygotic twins and other full siblings who only showed a 2–5 concordance in shared inheritance51 genomewide association studies gwas revealed regions of linkage that were found on most chromosomes52 these studies are useful in identifying the genes that may be responsible for complex diseases such as sle candidate gene loci implicated with sle include multiple alleles from the hla region fcgamma receptor and complement component system50 however association does not prove that a specific form of a gene is responsible for the disease as there may be other polymorphisms in the region that have a greater association effect50 however because the biological role of most genes are not completely understood it can be difficult to attribute phenotypic traits to certain genetic polymorphisms since sle is associated with so many genetic regions it is likely an oligogenic trait meaning that there are several genes that control susceptibility to the disease50 further complicating our understanding is the association of certain linkages with various ethnic groups50 sle is regarded as a prototype disease due to the significant overlap in its symptoms with other autoimmune diseases49 this means that it is an important area of continued research and study that is utilizing diverse techniques such as gwas microarrays and murine studies50 further genetic studies of multiple ethnic groups and the creation of disease models incorporating environmental influences will help to increase and refine the understanding of specific genes linkages as well as the mechanisms underlying the disease51 drug reactions druginduced lupus erythematosus is a generally reversible condition that usually occurs in people being treated for a longterm illness druginduced lupus mimics sle however symptoms of druginduced lupus generally disappear once the medication that triggered the episode is stopped more than 38 medications can cause this condition the most common of which are procainamide isoniazid hydralazine quinidine and phenytoin10 nonsystemic forms of lupus discoid cutaneous lupus is limited to skin symptoms and is diagnosed by biopsy of rash on the face neck scalp or arms approximately 5 of people with dle progress to sle53 pathophysiology one manifestation of sle is abnormalities in apoptosis a type of programmed cell death in which aging or damaged cells are neatly disposed of as a part of normal growth or functioning in sle the bodys immune system produces antibodies against itself particularly against proteins in the cell nucleus sle is triggered by environmental factors that are unknown the immune system must balance between being sensitive enough to protect against infection and become sensitized to attack the bodys own proteins autoimmunity during an immune reaction to a foreign stimulus such as bacteria virus or allergen immune cells that would normally be deactivated due to their affinity for selftissues can be abnormally activated by signaling sequences of antigenpresenting cells thus triggers may include viruses bacteria allergens ige and other hypersensitivity and can be aggravated by environmental stimulants such as ultraviolet light and certain drug reactions these stimuli begin a reaction that leads to destruction of other cells in the body and exposure of their dna histones and other proteins particularly parts of the cell nucleus the bodys sensitized blymphocyte cells will now produce antibodies against these nuclearrelated proteins these antibodies clump into antibodyprotein complexes which stick to surfaces and damage blood vessels in critical areas of the body such as the glomeruli of the kidney these antibody attacks are the cause of sle researchers are now identifying the individual genes the proteins they produce and their role in the immune system each protein is a link on the autoimmune chain and researchers are trying to find drugs to break each of those links105455 sle is a chronic inflammatory disease believed to be a type iii hypersensitivity response with potential type ii involvement56 reticulate and stellate acral pigmentation should be considered a possible manifestation of sle and high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies or a consequence of therapy57 people with sle have intense polyclonal bcell activation with a population shift towards immature b cells memory b cells with increased cd27igd—are less susceptible to immunosuppression cd27igd memory b cells are associated with increased disease activity and renal lupus t cells which regulate bcell responses and infiltrate target tissues have defects in signaling adhesion costimulation gene transcription and alternative splicing the cytokines blymphocyte stimulator blys interleukin 6 interleukin 17 interleukin 18 type i interferons and tumor necrosis factor α tnfα are involved in the inflammatory process and are potential therapeutic targets45859 in the complement system low c3 levels are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus 60 cell death signaling apoptosis is increased in monocytes and keratinocytes expression of fas by b cells and t cells is increased there are correlations between the apoptotic rates of lymphocytes and disease activity necrosis is increased in t lymphocytes tingible body macrophages tbms – large phagocytic cells in the germinal centers of secondary lymph nodes – express cd68 protein these cells normally engulf b cells that have undergone apoptosis after somatic hypermutation in some people with sle significantly fewer tbms can be found and these cells rarely contain material from apoptotic b cells also uningested apoptotic nuclei can be found outside of tbms this material may present a threat to the tolerization of b cells and t cells dendritic cells in the germinal center may endocytose such antigenic material and present it to t cells activating them also apoptotic chromatin and nuclei may attach to the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells and make this material available for activating other b cells that may have randomly acquired selfspecificity through somatic hypermutation61 necrosis a proinflammatory form of cell death is increased in t lymphocytes due to mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress and depletion of atp62 clearance deficiency clearance deficiency impaired clearance of dying cells is a potential pathway for the development of this systemic autoimmune disease this includes deficient phagocytic activity and scant serum components in addition to increased apoptosis sle is associated with defects in apoptotic clearance and the damaging effects caused by apoptotic debris early apoptotic cells express “eatme” signals of cellsurface proteins such as phosphatidylserine that prompt immune cells to engulf them apoptotic cells also express “findme” signals to attract macrophages and dendritic cells when apoptotic material is not removed correctly by phagocytes they are captured instead by antigenpresenting cells which leads to development of antinuclear antibodies4 monocytes isolated from whole blood of people with sle show reduced expression of cd44 surface molecules involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells most of the monocytes and tingible body macrophages tbms which are found in the germinal centres of lymph nodes even show a definitely different morphology they are smaller or scarce and die earlier serum components like complement factors crp and some glycoproteins are furthermore decisively important for an efficiently operating phagocytosis with sle these components are often missing diminished or inefficient recent research has found an association between certain people with lupus especially those with lupus nephritis and an impairment in degrading neutrophil extracellular traps nets these were due to dnase1 inhibiting factors or net protecting factors in peoples serum rather than abnormalities in the dnase1 itself63 dnase1 mutations in lupus have so far only been found in some japanese cohorts64 the clearance of early apoptotic cells is an important function in multicellular organisms it leads to a progression of the apoptosis process and finally to secondary necrosis of the cells if this ability is disturbed necrotic cells release nuclear fragments as potential autoantigens as well as internal danger signals inducing maturation of dendritic cells dcs since they have lost their membranes integrity increased appearance of apoptotic cells also stimulates inefficient clearance that leads to maturation of dcs and also to the presentation of intracellular antigens of late apoptotic or secondary necrotic cells via mhc molecules autoimmunity possibly results by the extended exposure to nuclear and intracellular autoantigens derived from late apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells b and t cell tolerance for apoptotic cells is abrogated and the lymphocytes get activated by these autoantigens inflammation and the production of autoantibodies by plasma cells is initiated a clearance deficiency in the skin for apoptotic cells has also been observed in people with cutaneous lupus erythematosus cle65 germinal centres germinal centers in healthy conditions apoptotic lymphocytes are removed in germinal centers gc by specialized phagocytes the tingible body macrophages tbm which is why no free apoptotic and potential autoantigenic material can be seen in some people with sle accumulation of apoptotic debris can be observed in gc because of an ineffective clearance of apoptotic cells in close proximity to tbm follicular dendritic cells fdc are localised in gc which attach antigen material to their surface and in contrast to bone marrowderived dc neither take it up nor present it via mhc molecules autoreactive b cells can accidentally emerge during somatic hypermutation and migrate into the germinal center light zone autoreactive b cells maturated coincidentally normally do not receive survival signals by antigen planted on follicular dendritic cells and perish by apoptosis in the case of clearance deficiency apoptotic nuclear debris accumulates in the light zone of gc and gets attached to fdc this serves as a germinal centre survival signal for autoreactive bcells after migration into the mantle zone autoreactive b cells require further survival signals from autoreactive helper t cells which promote the maturation of autoantibodyproducing plasma cells and b memory cells in the presence of autoreactive t cells a chronic autoimmune disease may be the consequence antinrnp autoimmunity antinrnp autoantibodies to nrnp a and nrnp c initially targeted restricted prolinerich motifs antibody binding subsequently spread to other epitopes the similarity and crossreactivity between the initial targets of nrnp and sm autoantibodies identifies a likely commonality in cause and a focal point for intermolecular epitope spreading66 others elevated expression of hmgb1 was found in the sera of people and mice with systemic lupus erythematosus high mobility group box 1 hmgb1 is a nuclear protein participating in chromatin architecture and transcriptional regulation recently there is increasing evidence hmgb1 contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases due to its inflammatory and immune stimulating properties67 diagnosis micrograph showing vacuolar interface dermatitis as may be seen in sle he stain micrograph of a section of human skin prepared for direct immunofluorescence using an antiigg antibody the skin is from a person with systemic lupus erythematosus and shows igg deposits at two different places the first is a bandlike deposit along the epidermal basement membrane lupus band test is positive the second is within the nuclei of the epidermal cells antinuclear antibodies are present laboratory tests antinuclear antibody ana testing and antiextractable nuclear antigen antiena form the mainstay of serologic testing for sle several techniques are used to detect anas clinically the most widely used method is indirect immunofluorescence if the pattern of fluorescence suggests the type of antibody present in the peoples serum direct immunofluorescence can detect deposits of immunoglobulins and complement proteins in the peoples skin when skin not exposed to the sun is tested a positive direct if the socalled lupus band test is an evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus68 ana screening yields positive results in many connective tissue disorders and other autoimmune diseases and may occur in normal individuals subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include antismith and antidouble stranded dna dsdna antibodies which are linked to sle and antihistone antibodies which are linked to druginduced lupus antidsdna antibodies are highly specific for sle they are present in 70 of cases whereas they appear in only 05 of people without sle10 the antidsdna antibody titers also tend to reflect disease activity although not in all cases10 other ana that may occur in people with sle are antiu1 rnp which also appears in systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease ssa or antiro and ssb or antila both of which are more common in sjögrens syndrome ssa and ssb confer a specific risk for heart conduction block in neonatal lupus69 other tests routinely performed in suspected sle are complement system levels low levels suggest consumption by the immune system electrolytes and kidney function disturbed if the kidney is involved liver enzymes and complete blood count the lupus erythematosus le cell test was commonly used for diagnosis but it is no longer used because the le cells are only found in 50–75 of sle cases and they are also found in some people with rheumatoid arthritis scleroderma and drug sensitivities because of this the le cell test is now performed only rarely and is mostly of historical significance70 diagnostic criteria some physicians make a diagnosis on the basis of the american college of rheumatology acr classification criteria the criteria however were established mainly for use in scientific research including use in randomized controlled trials which require higher confidence levels so many people with sle may not pass the full criteria criteria the american college of rheumatology acr established eleven criteria in 198271 which were revised in 199772 as a classificatory instrument to operationalise the definition of sle in clinical trials they were not intended to be used to diagnose individuals and do not do well in that capacity for the purpose of identifying people for clinical studies a person has sle if any 4 out of 11 symptoms are present simultaneously or serially on two separate occasions malar rash rash on cheeks sensitivity 57 specificity 9673 discoid rash red scaly patches on skin that cause scarring sensitivity 18 specificity 9973 serositis pleurisy inflammation of the membrane around the lungs or pericarditis inflammation of the membrane around the heart sensitivity 56 specificity 86 pleural is more sensitive cardiac is more specific73 oral ulcers includes oral or nasopharyngeal ulcers sensitivity 27 specificity 9673 arthritis nonerosive arthritis of two or more peripheral joints with tenderness swelling or effusion sensitivity 86 specificity 3773 photosensitivity exposure to ultraviolet light causes rash or other symptoms of sle flareups sensitivity 43 specificity 9673 blood—hematologic disorder—hemolytic anemia low red blood cell count leukopenia white blood cell count4000µl lymphopenia 1500µl or low platelet count 100000µl in the absence of offending drug sensitivity 59 specificity 8973 hypocomplementemia is also seen due to either consumption of c374 and c4 by immune complexinduced inflammation or to congenitally complement deficiency which may predispose to sle renal disorder more than 05 g per day protein in urine or cellular casts seen in urine under a microscope sensitivity

test for syphilis sensitivity 85 specificity 9373 presence of antiss dna in 70 of cases though also positive with rheumatic disease and healthy persons75 neurologic disorder seizures or psychosis sensitivity 20 specificity 9873 other than the acr criteria people with lupus may also have76 fever over 100 °f 377 °c extreme fatigue hair loss fingers turning white andor blue when cold raynauds phenomenon criteria for individual diagnosis some people especially those with antiphospholipid syndrome may have sle without four of the above criteria and also sle may present with features other than those listed in the criteria777879 recursive partitioning has been used to identify more parsimonious criteria73 this analysis presented two diagnostic classification trees simplest classification tree sle is diagnosed if a person has an immunologic disorder antidna antibody antismith antibody false positive syphilis test or le cells or malar rash it has sensitivity 92 and specificity 92 full classification tree uses 6 criteria it has sensitivity 97 and specificity 95 other alternative criteria have been suggested eg the st thomas hospital alternative criteria in 199880 treatment the treatment of sle involves preventing flares and reducing their severity and duration when they occur treatment can include corticosteroids and antimalarial drugs certain types of lupus nephritis such as diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis require intermittent cytotoxic drugs these drugs include cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate hydroxychloroquine was approved by the fda for lupus in 195581 some drugs approved for other diseases are used for sle offlabel in november 2010 an fda advisory panel recommended approving belimumab benlysta as a treatment for the pain and flareups common in lupus the drug was approved by the fda in march 20118283 medications due to the variety of symptoms and organ system involvement with sle its severity in an individual must be assessed in order to successfully treat sle mild or remittent disease may sometimes be safely left untreated if required nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and antimalarials may be used medications such as prednisone mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus have been used in the past diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs dmards are used preventively to reduce the incidence of flares the progress of the disease and the need for steroid use when flares occur they are treated with corticosteroids dmards commonly in use are antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and immunosuppressants eg methotrexate and azathioprine hydroxychloroquine is an fdaapproved antimalarial used for constitutional cutaneous and articular manifestations hydroxychloroquine has relatively few side effects and there is evidence that it improves survival among people who have sle81 cyclophosphamide is used for severe glomerulonephritis or other organdamaging complications mycophenolic acid is also used for treatment of lupus nephritis but it is not fdaapproved for this indication and fda is investigating reports that it may be associated with birth defects when used by pregnant women84 immunosuppressive drugs in more severe cases medications that modulate the immune system primarily corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are used to control the disease and prevent recurrence of symptoms known as flares depending on the dosage people who require steroids may develop cushings syndrome symptoms of which may include obesity puffy round face diabetes mellitus increased appetite difficulty sleeping and osteoporosis these may subside if and when the large initial dosage is reduced but longterm use of even low doses can cause elevated blood pressure and cataracts numerous new immunosuppressive drugs are being actively tested for sle rather than suppressing the immune system nonspecifically as corticosteroids do they target the responses of individual types of immune cells some of these drugs are already fdaapproved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis81 analgesia since a large percentage of people with sle have varying amounts of chronic pain stronger prescription analgesics painkillers may be used if overthecounter drugs mainly nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs do not provide effective relief potent nsaids such as indomethacin and diclofenac are relatively contraindicated for people with sle because they increase the risk of kidney failure and heart failure81 pain is typically treated with opioids varying in potency based on the severity of symptoms when opioids are used for prolonged periods drug tolerance chemical dependency and addiction may occur opiate addiction is not typically a concern since the condition is not likely to ever completely disappear thus lifelong treatment with opioids is fairly common for chronic pain symptoms accompanied by periodic titration that is typical of any longterm opioid regimen intravenous immunoglobulins ivigs intravenous immunoglobulins may be used to control sle with organ involvement or vasculitis it is believed that they reduce antibody production or promote the clearance of immune complexes from the body even though their mechanism of action is not well understood85 unlike immunosuppressives and corticosteroids ivigs do not suppress the immune system so there is less risk of serious infections with these drugs86 lifestyle changes avoiding sunlight in sle is critical since sunlight is known to exacerbate skin manifestations of the disease avoiding activities which induce fatigue is also important since those with sle fatigue easily and it can debilitating these two problems can lead to people becoming housebound for long periods of time drugs unrelated to sle should be prescribed only when known not to exacerbate the disease occupational exposure to silica pesticides and mercury can also worsen the disease58 kidney transplantation kidney transplants are the treatment of choice for endstage kidney disease which is one of the complications of lupus nephritis but the recurrence of the full disease is common in up to 30 of people87 antiphospholipid syndrome approximately 20 of people with sle have clinically significant levels of antiphospholipid antibodies which are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome88 antiphospholipid syndrome is also related to the onset of neural lupus symptoms in the brain in this form of the disease the cause is very different from lupus thromboses blood clots or sticky blood form in blood vessels which prove to be fatal if they move within the blood stream77 if the thromboses migrate to the brain they can potentially cause a stroke by blocking the blood supply to the brain if this disorder is suspected in people brain scans are usually required for early detection these scans can show localized areas of the brain where blood supply has not been adequate the treatment plan for these people requires anticoagulation often lowdose aspirin is prescribed for this purpose although for cases involving thrombosis anticoagulants such as warfarin are used89 management of pregnancy further information systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy while most infants born to mothers who have sle are healthy pregnant mothers with sle should remain under medical care until delivery neonatal lupus is rare but identification of mothers at highest risk for complications allows for prompt treatment before or after birth in addition sle can flare up during pregnancy and proper treatment can maintain the health of the mother longer women pregnant and known to have antiro ssa or antila antibodies ssb often have echocardiograms during the 16th and 30th weeks of pregnancy to monitor the health of the heart and surrounding vasculature90 contraception and other reliable forms of pregnancy prevention is routinely advised for women with sle since getting pregnant during active disease was found to be harmful lupus nephritis was the most common manifestation prognosis no cure is available for sle but there are many treatments for the disease1 in the 1950s most people diagnosed with sle lived fewer than five years today over 90 now survive for more than ten years and many live relatively symptomfree 80–90 can expect to live a normal lifespan91 prognosis is typically worse for men and children than for women however if symptoms are present after age 60 the disease tends to run a more benign course early mortality within 5 years is due to organ failure or overwhelming infections both of which can be altered by early diagnosis and treatment the mortality risk is fivefold when compared to the normal population in the late stages which can be attributed to cardiovascular disease from accelerated atherosclerosis the leading cause of death for people with sle81 to reduce the potential for cardiovascular issues high blood pressure and high cholesterol should be prevented or treated aggressively steroids should be used at the lowest dose for the shortest possible period and other drugs that can reduce symptoms should be used whenever possible81 high serum creatinine hypertension nephrotic syndrome anemia and low blood albumin are poor prognostic factors92 ana screening is the most sensitive test for evaluation whereas antism antismith is the most specific the dsdna doublestranded dna antibody is also fairly specific and often fluctuates with disease activity as such the dsdna titre is sometimes useful to monitor disease flares or response to treatment93 epidemiology the global rates of sle are approximately 20–70 per 100000 people in females the rate is highest between 45 and 64 years of age the lowest overall rate exists in iceland and japan the highest rates exist in the us and france however there is no sufficient evidence to conclude that sle is less common in some countries compared to others since there is significant environmental variability in these countries for example different countries receive different levels of sunlight and exposure to uv rays affects dermatological symptoms of sle certain studies hypothesize that a genetic connection exists between race and lupus which affects disease prevalence if this is true the racial composition of countries affects disease and will cause the incidence in a country to change as the racial makeup changes in order to understand if this is true countries with largely homogenous and racially stable populations should be studied to better understand incidence2 rates of disease in the developing world are unclear6 the rate of sle varies between countries ethnicity and sex and changes over time94 in the united states one estimate of the rate of sle is 53 per 10000094 other estimates range from 322000 to over 1 million95 in northern europe the rate is about 40 per 100000 people96 sle occurs more frequently and with greater severity among those of noneuropean descent95 that rate has been found to be as high as 159 per 100000 among those of afrocaribbean descent94 childhoodonset systemic lupus erythematosus generally presents between the ages of 3 and 15 and is four times more common in girls97 while the onset and persistence of sle can show disparities between genders socioeconomic status also plays a major role women with sle and of lower socioeconomic status have been shown to have higher depression scores higher body mass index and more restricted access to medical care than women of higher socioeconomic statuses with the illness people with sle had more selfreported anxiety and depression scores if they were from a lower socioeconomic status98 ethnicity there are assertions that race affects the rate of sle however a 2010 review of studies which correlate race and sle identified several sources of systematic and methodological error indicating that the connection between race and sle may be spurious99 for example studies show that social support is a modulating factor which buffers against slerelated damage and maintains physiological functionality99 studies have not been conducted to determine whether people of different racial backgrounds receive differing levels of social support99 if there is a difference this could act as a confounding variable in studies correlating race and sle another caveat to note when examining studies about sle is that symptoms are often selfreported this process introduces additional sources of methodological error studies have shown that selfreported data is affected by more than just the patients experience with the disease social support the level of helplessness and abnormal illnessrelated behaviors also factor into a selfassessment additionally other factors like the degree of social support that a person receives socioeconomic status health insurance and access to care can contribute to an individual’s disease progression99100 racial differences in lupus progression have not been found in studies that control for the socioeconomic status ses of participants99101 studies that control for the ses of its participants have found that nonwhite people have more abrupt disease onset compared to white people and that their disease progresses more quickly nonwhite patients often report more hematological serosal neurological and renal symptoms however the severity of symptoms and mortality are both similar in white and nonwhite patients studies that report different rates of disease progression in latestage sle are most likely reflecting differences in socioeconomic status and the corresponding access to care99 the people who receive medical care have often accrued less diseaserelated damage and are less likely to be below the poverty line101 additional studies have found that education marital status occupation and income create a social context which contributes to disease progression99 sex sle like many autoimmune diseases affects females more frequently than males at a rate of about 9 to 1594 the x chromosome carries immunological related genes which can mutate and contribute to the onset of sle the y chromosome has no identified mutations associated with autoimmune disease102 hormonal mechanisms could explain the increased incidence of sle in females the onset of sle could be attributed to the elevated hydroxylation of estrogen and the abnormally decreased levels of androgens in females in addition differences in gnrh signalling have also shown to contribute to the onset of sle while females are more likely to relapse than males the intensity of these relapses is the same for both sexes103 in addition to hormonal mechanisms specific genetic influences found on the x chromosome may also contribute to the development of sle studies indicate that the x chromosome can determine the levels of sex hormones a study has shown an association between klinefelter syndrome and sle xxy males with sle have an abnormal x–y translocation resulting in the partial triplication of the par1 gene region104 changing rate of disease the rate of sle in the united states increased from 10 in 1955 to 76 in 1974 whether the increase is due to better diagnosis or to increasing frequency of the disease is unknown94 history a historical drawing of lupus erythematosus the history of sle can be divided into three periods classical neoclassical and modern in each period research and documentation advanced the understanding and diagnosis of sle leading to its classification as an autoimmune disease in 1851 and to the various diagnostic options and treatments now available to people with sle the advances made by medical science in the diagnosis and treatment of sle have dramatically improved the life expectancy of a person diagnosed with sle105 etymology there are several explanations ventured for the term lupus erythematosus lupus is latin for wolf106 and erythro is derived from ερυθρός greek for red all explanations originate with the reddish butterflyshaped malar rash that the disease classically exhibits across the nose and cheeks in various accounts some doctors thought the rash resembled the pattern of fur on a wolfs face more likely is that it is derived from the similarity in distribution to lupus vulgaris or chronic facial tuberculosis where the lesions are ragged and punched out and are said to resemble the bite of a wolf another account claims that the term lupus did not come from latin directly but from the term for a french style of mask that women reportedly wore to conceal the rash on their faces the mask is called a loup french for wolfcitation needed classical period the classical period began when the disease was first recognized in the middle ages the term lupus is attributed to 12thcentury italian physician rogerius frugard who used it to describe ulcerating sores on the legs of people107 no formal treatment for the disease existed and the resources available to physicians to help people were limited108 neoclassical period the neoclassical period began in 1851 when the skin disease which is now known as discoid lupus was documented by the french physician pierre cazenave cazenave termed the illness lupus and added the word erythematosus to distinguish this disease from other illnesses that affected the skin except they were infectious109 cazenave observed the disease in several people and made very detailed notes to assist others in its diagnosis he was one of the first to document that lupus affected adults from adolescence into the early thirties and that the facial rash is its most distinguishing feature110 research and documentation of the disease continued in the neoclassical period with the work of ferdinand von hebra and his soninlaw moritz kaposi they documented the physical effects of lupus as well as some insights into the possibility that the disease caused internal trauma von hebra observed that lupus symptoms could last many years and that the disease could go dormant after years of aggressive activity and then reappear with symptoms following the same general pattern these observations led hebra to term lupus a chronic disease in 1872111 kaposi observed that lupus assumed two forms the skin lesions now known as discoid lupus and a more aggravated form that affected not only the skin but also caused fever arthritis and other systemic disorders in people112 the latter also presented a rash confined to the face appearing on the cheeks and across the bridge of the nose he called this the butterfly rash kaposi also observed those patients who developed the butterfly rash or malar rash often were afflicted with another disease such as tuberculosis anemia or chlorisis which often caused death110 kaposi was one of the first people to recognize what is now termed systemic lupus erythematosus in his documentation of the remitting and relapsing nature of the disease and the relationship of skin and systemic manifestations during disease activity113 the 19th centurys research into lupus continued with the work of sir william osler who in 1895 published the first of his three papers about the internal complications of erythema exudativum multiforme not all the patient cases in his paper had sle but oslers work expanded the knowledge of systemic diseases and documented extensive and critical visceral complications for several diseases including lupus110 noting that many people with lupus had a disease that not only affected the skin but many other organs in the body as well osler added the word systemic to the term lupus erythematosus to distinguish this type of disease from discoid lupus erythematosus114 oslers second paper noted that reoccurrence is a special feature of the disease and that attacks can be sustained for months or even years further study of the disease led to a third paper published in 1903 documenting afflictions such as arthritis pneumonia the inability to form coherent ideas delirium and central nervous system damage as all affecting patients diagnosed with sle110 modern period the modern period beginning in 1920 saw major developments in research into the cause and treatment of discoid and systemic lupus research conducted in the 1920s and 1930s led to the first detailed pathologic descriptions of lupus and demonstrated how the disease affected the kidney heart and lung tissue115 a major breakthrough was made in 1948 with the discovery of the le cell the lupus erythematosus cell—a misnomer as it occurs with other diseases as well discovered by a team of researchers at the mayo clinic they discovered that the white blood cells contained the nucleus of another cell that was pushing against the whites cell proper nucleus116 noting that the invading nucleus was coated with antibody that allowed it to be ingested by a phagocytic or scavenger cell they named the antibody that causes one cell to ingest another the le factor and the two nuclei cell result in the le cell117 the le cell it was determined was a part of an antinuclear antibody ana reaction the body produces antibodies against its own tissue this discovery led to one of the first definitive tests for lupus since le cells are found in approximately 60 of all people diagnosed with lupus118 the le cell test is rarely performed as a definitive lupus test today as le cells do not always occur in people with sle and can occur in individuals with other autoimmune diseases their presence can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis but no longer indicates a definitive sle diagnosis the discovery of the le cell led to further research and this resulted in more definitive tests for lupus building on the knowledge that those with sle had autoantibodies that would attach themselves to the nuclei of normal cells causing the immune system to send white blood cells to fight off these invaders a test was developed to look for the antinuclear antibody ana rather than the le cell specifically this ana test was easier to perform and led not only to a definitive diagnosis of lupus but also many other related diseases this discovery led to the development of what are now known as autoimmune diseases119 to ensure that the person has lupus and not another autoimmune disease the american college of rheumatology acr established a list of clinical and immunologic criteria that in any combination point to sle the criteria include symptoms that the person can identify eg pain and things that a physician can detect in a physical examination and through laboratory test results the list was originally compiled in 1971 initially revised in 1982 and further revised and improved in 2009120 medical historians have theorized that people with porphyria a disease that shares many symptoms with sle generated folklore stories of vampires and werewolves due to the photosensitivity scarring hair growth and porphyrin brownishred stained teeth in severe recessive forms of porphyria or combinations of the disorder known as dual homozygous or compound heterozygous porphyrias121 useful medication for the disease was first found in 1894 when quinine was first reported as an effective therapy four years later the use of salicylates in conjunction with quinine was noted to be of still greater benefit this was the best available treatment until the middle of the twentieth century when hench discovered the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of sle121 research a study called bliss76 tested the drug belimumab a fully human monoclonal antibaff or antiblys antibody83 baff stimulates and extends the life of b lymphocytes which produce antibodies against foreign and self cells122 it was approved by the fda in march 201182 see also canine discoid lupus erythematosus in dogs references a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v handout on health systemic lupus erythematosus wwwniamsnihgov
