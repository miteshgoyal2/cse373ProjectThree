song as a perfect album opener and rated it 553 allmusic editor stephen t e wrote that theres a lot to be said for professional craftsmanship at its peak and he called this song blistering plus highlight on album4 alan light praised the song jam the albums opener addresses jacksons uneasy relationship to the world and reveals a canny selfawareness that carries the strongest message on dangerous jam features a dense swirling riley track propelled by horn samples and a subtle scratch effect and includes a fleet rap by riley favorite heavy d though it initially sounds like a simple funky dance vehicle jacksons voice bites into each phrase with a desperation that urges us to look deeper he is singing as false prophets cry of doom and exhorts us to live each day like its the last the chorus declares that the miseries of the world aint too much stuff to stop us from jamming to jackson who insists that he comes truly alive only onstage the ability to jam is the sole means to find peace within myself and this hope rings more sincere than the childlike wishes found in the ballads5 music videoedit the music video for jam takes place within an abandoned indoor basketball court where michael jackson teaches basketball legend michael jordan how to dance and in return jordan teaches jackson how to play basketball special effects have jackson throwing a basketball through a window and scoring in the hoop in the opposite room as well as jackson scoring by tossing the ball behind him and kicking the ball into the hoop with his heel the extended versions of the video include jackson teaching jordan how to do the physically complicated moonwalk dance technique the rap group kris kross and naughty by nature make a cameo appearance as does heavy d who performs a rap during the bridge the video was included on dangerous – the short films and michael jacksons vision the music video was directed by david kellogg and premiered on fox on june 19 1992 at 930 pm est6 live performancesedit jackson performed jam as the opening number throughout his dangerous world tour he also performed it at the royal brunei concert in 1996 which turned out to be the last live
