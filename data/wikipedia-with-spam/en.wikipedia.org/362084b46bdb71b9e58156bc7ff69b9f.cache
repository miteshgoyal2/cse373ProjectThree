compositionedit beat it was composed by michael jackson for his thriller album producer quincy jones had wanted to include a rock and roll song in the vein of the knacks my sharona though jackson reportedly had never previously shown an interest in the genre56 jackson later said of beat it i wanted to write a song the type of song that i would buy if i were to buy a rock song that is how i approached it and i wanted the children to really enjoy it—the school children as well as the college students7 jermaine jackson has suggested the inspiration of beat it and its video came from the jackson family experiencing gang activity in gary indiana from our front window we witnessed about three bad rumbles between rival gangs8 upon hearing the first recorded vocals jones stated that it was exactly what he was looking for5 the song begins with seven distinct synthesizer notes played on the synclavier digital synthesizer with tom bahler credited for the synclavier performance on the song the intro is taken note for note from a demo lp released the year before called the incredible sounds of synclavier ii first published in 1981 by denny jaeger creative services inc and sold by new england digital makers of the synclavier9 eddie van halen lead guitarist of hard rock band van halen was asked to add a guitar solo610 when initially contacted by jones van halen thought he was receiving a prank call11 having established that the call was genuine van halen borrowed an amplifier from guitarist allan holdsworth12 and recorded his guitar solo free of any charge i did it as a favor the musician later said i was a complete fool according to the rest of the band our manager and everyone else i was not used i knew what i was doing – i dont do something unless i want to do it13 van halen recorded his contribution following jones and jackson arriving at the guitarists house with a skeleton version of the song fellow guitarist steve lukather recalled initially we rocked it out as eddie had played a good solo—but quincy thought it was too tough so i had to reduce the distorted guitar sound and that is what was released13 the song was among the last four completed for thriller the others were human nature pyt pretty young thing and the lady in my life13 right before van halens guitar solo begins a noise is heard that sounds like somebody knocking at a door it is reported that the knock was a person walking into eddies recording studio another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar14 the engineers were shocked during the recording of van halens solo to discover that the sound of his guitar had caused the monitor speaker in the control room to catch fire causing one to exclaim this must be really good15 the lyrics of beat it have been described as a sad commentary on human nature16 the line dont be a macho man is said to express jacksons dislike of violence whilst also referring to the childhood abuse he faced at the hands of his father joseph17 the song is played in the key of e ♭ minor at a moderately fast tempo of 138–139 beats per minute181920 in the song jacksons vocal range is b3 to d518 drums on the song were played by toto cofounder jeff porcaro21 a remix of 2 bad is featured on blood on the dance floor history in the mix containing a sample of beat it as well as a rap by john forté and guitar solo by wyclef jean22 release and receptionedit the uncredited guitarist who whipped out the fluttering squealing solo on this ode to macho cowardice was eddie van halen the aerodynamic metal flight pumped crossover fuel that would boost the success of thriller — a gimmick jackson would flog later with spots from slash and carlos santana without the van halen precedent there might have been no collaboration of rundmc and aerosmith on the 1986 raprock version of walk this way —greg burk south coast today23 beat it was released on february 14 1983 following the successful chart performances of the girl is mine and billie jean frank dileo the vice president of epic records convinced jackson to release beat it while billie jean was heading towards no 1 dileo who would later become the singers manager predicted that both singles would remain in the top 10 at the same time13 billie jean remained atop the billboard hot 100 for seven weeks before being toppled by come on eileen which stayed at no 1 for a single week before jackson reclaimed the position with beat it1324 billie jean and beat it occupied top 5 positions at the same time a feat matched by very few artists the single remained at the top of the hot 100 for a total of three weeks13 the song also charted at no 1 on the us rb singles chart and no 14 on the billboard top tracks chart in the us25 billboard ranked it at the no 5 song for 198326 beat it also claimed the top spot in spain and the netherlands reached no 3 in the uk and the top 20 in austria norway italy sweden and switzerland25 in a rolling stone review christopher connelly describes beat it as the best song on thriller adding that it aint no disco aor track he notes of the nifty dance song jacksons voice soars all over the melody eddie van halen checks in with a blistering guitar solo you could build a convention center on the backbeat27 allmusics stephen thomas erlewine states that the song is both tough and scared28 robert christgau claimed that the song has eddie van halen wielding his might in the service of antimacho29 slant magazine observed that the song was an uncharacteristic dalliance with the rock idiom30 the track also won praise from jackson biographer j randy taraborrelli who stated that the song was rambunctious6 beat it has been recognized with several awards at the 1984 grammy awards the

on los angeles skid row—mainly on locations on east 5th street38—around march 9 1983 to add authenticity to the production but also to foster peace between them jackson had the idea to cast members of

was choreographed by michael peters who also performed alongside vincent paterson as one of the two lead dancers despite some sources claiming otherwise jackson was involved in creating some parts of the choreography39 jackson asked giraldi at the time already an established commercial director but who had never directed a music video44 to come up with a concept for the beat it video because he really liked a commercial giraldi had directed for wlstv in chicago about a married couple of two elderly blind people who instead of running from a rundown neighborhood all the other white people had fled from chose to stay and throw a block party for all the young children in the area contrary to popular belief the concept of the video was not based on the broadway musical west side story in

and festivals such as the carling weekend in leeds120121 bassist pete wentz who has claimed to have an obsession with jackson stated that prior to recording the song he would only watch moonwalker122 it was also announced that john mayer was to add the guitar solo previously played by eddie van halen123 the bands lead singerguitarist patrick stump stated that the band had not planned to cover the song basically i just started playing the riff in soundcheck one day and then we all started playing it and then we started playing it live and then we figured wed record it and put it out with our live dvd124 bassist pete wentz added that the band had not originally intended for the song to be released as a single either124 beat it seemed like a song that would be cool and that we could do our own take on he said122 having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song wentz eventually called john mayer to add the guitar solo we were trying to think about who is a contemporary guitar guy whos going to go down as a legend wentz later noted124 upon its digital release as a single in april 2008 fall out boys cover of beat it became a mainstay on itunes top 10 chart125 the song peaked at no 8 in canada becoming another top 10 hit in the region it also charted at no 13 in australia no 14 in new zealand no 75 in austria and no 98 in the netherlands126 music videoedit the music video for fall out boys beat it was directed by shane drake and was made in homage to jackson i think when youre doing a michael jackson cover theres this expectation that youre going to do one of his videos verbatim stump said what we decided to do was kind of inspired by michael jackson and the mythology of him there are specific images that are reference points for us but at any given point its not any of his videos its kind of all of his videos all at once but on a fall out boy budget so its not quite as fancy127 the costumes for the video were similar to the originals my costume is this take on one of the guys from michael jacksons original beat it video like the guy who plays the rival dancer wentz said during the filming of the video127 the music video featured numerous cameos including a karate classdance session being taught by tony hale donald faison and joel david moore dressed up like michael jackson127 the short film later received a mtv video music award nomination for best rock
