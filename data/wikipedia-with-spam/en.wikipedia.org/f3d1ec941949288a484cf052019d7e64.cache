decision of the washington supreme court in 1965 contents 1 history 2 geography 3 demographics 4 government 5 references historyedit the king county government entered into an agreement with the dincov family in 1954 to operate a gravel mine on their east redmond property1 the dincovs neighbors in opposition to the gravel mine proposed to form an incorporated town in order to halt operations2 a special election was held on august 14 1956 and 108 residents voted in favor of incorporating east redmond as a fourthclass town while 67 opposed34 the towns government passed an ordinance that prohibited the countys gravel mine operations leading king county to seek a restraining order against the town5 east redmond officials threatened to arrest county employees violating the ordinance6 and the requested temporary restraining order was denied by a superior court judge7 the county was eventually denied an injunction that removed the town from interfering with the mine due to expired and lapsed permits8 in february 1957 the king county board of commissioners received a petition signed by snoqualmie valley residents asking for the disincorporation of east redmond the petition concerned the maintenance of novelty hill road which ran through east redmond towards the snoqualmie valley which would be too expensive for east redmond to maintain the petition also alleged that the town had created a speed trap on the road9 another petition was presented to the town council that month signed by 125 of its 375 residents hoping to trigger a disincorporation election10 the election was called off after a ruling by a superior court judge after the discovery of signatures that did not match voter registrations as well as withdrawn signatures which reduced the number of petitioners to below the majority of registered of voters11 residents of the novelty hill road area unsuccessfully attempted to secede from east redmond through a special election in may 1957 the seattle times reported that some residents had voted in favor of staying in east redmond in order to be eligible to vote for disincorporation at a later date12 a petition to disincorporate a majority of the town was certified in june and the county scheduled a vote on the matter in october13 east redmond voted 164 to 24 to disincorporate threefourths of the town leaving only 50 residents and 087 square miles 23 km214 the town annexed 350 acres 140 ha 055 sq mi the following month including the dincov gravel mine to extend the citys boundaries to lake sammamish15 in march 1962 king county prosecutor charles o carroll filed a court action on the request of a superior court judge and 42 east redmond residents that challenged the validity of east redmonds fourthclass status16 two years later on march 10 1964 the superior court ruled that the incorporation was invalid for several reasons the incorporated town was 45 square miles 12 km2 but state law limited fourthclass towns to a size of one square mile 26 km2 the town did not meet the minimum population of 300 required for the status and the incorporation vote had taken place outside of the proposed town in neighboring redmond17 east redmonds government then conducting a regular election17 appealed to the state supreme court who heard the case in early 1965 the state supreme court affirmed the superior courts decision on july 1 1965 declaring that the town was illegally incorporated and thus invalid1819 east redmond became the second town in king county history to be disincorporated following ravensdale in the 1920s20 the area remains unincorporated as part of the union hillnovelty hill censusdesignated place21 geographyedit at the time of its incorporation east redmond had a total size of 45 square miles 12 km2 it was three times larger than the neighboring town of redmond22 by the end of 1957 the town shrunk to just over one square mile 26 km2 due to residents voting to disincorporate15 demographicsedit the 1960 census counted a population of 203 people in east redmond23 at the time of its disincorporation the population of east redmond had declined to 1852425 an unofficial population count by the washington secretary of state in 1956 estimated that the town had 516 residents26 but after the 1957 disincorporation vote the towns population was reduced to 225 by 195827 the town was the smallest incorporated
