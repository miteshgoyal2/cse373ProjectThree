known as the home stadium of the seattle seahawks of the national football league nfl the seattle mariners of major league baseball mlb and the seattle supersonics of the national basketball association nba the stadium served as both the home outdoor and indoor4 venue for the seattle sounders of the north american soccer league nasl and hosted numerous amateur sporting events concerts and other events the kingdome measured 660 feet wide from its inside walls5 the idea of constructing a covered stadium for a major league football andor baseball team was first proposed to seattle officials in 1959 voters rejected separate measures to approve public funding for such a stadium in 1960 and 1966 but the outcome was different in 1968 king county voters approved the issue of us40 million in municipal bonds to construct the stadium construction began in 1972 and the stadium opened in 1976 as the home stadium of the sounders and seahawks the mariners moved in the following year and the supersonics moved in the next year only to move back to the seattle center coliseum in 1985 the stadium hosted several major sports events including the soccer bowl in august 1976 the pro bowl in january 1977 the major league baseball allstar game in july 1979 the nba allstar game in 1987 and the ncaa final four in 1984 1989 and 1995 during the 1990s the seahawks and mariners respective ownership groups began to question the suitability of the kingdome as a venue for each team threatening to relocate unless new publicly funded stadiums were built at issue was the fact that neither team saw their shared tenancy as profitable as well as the integrity of the stadiums roof as highlighted by the collapse of ceiling tiles onto the seating area before a scheduled mariners game as a result public funding packages for new purposebuilt stadiums for the mariners and seahawks were approved in 1995 and 1997 respectively the mariners moved to safeco field midway through the 1999 season and the seahawks temporarily moved to husky stadium after the 1999 season the kingdome was demolished by implosion on march 26 2000 the seahawks new stadium seahawks stadium now known as centurylink

restaurateur david l cohn wrote a letter to the seattle city council suggesting the city needed a covered stadium for a major professional sports franchise7 a domed stadium was thought to be a must due to seattles frequent rain at the time the city had husky stadium and sicks stadium for collegiate football and minor league baseball respectively but both were deemed inadequate for a major league team7 in 1960 the city council placed a 15 million bond issue measure on the ballot to fund construction of a stadium but voters rejected it due to doubt the stadium could be built within that budget and lack of a guarantee the city would have a team to play in the stadium7 by 1966 the national football league and the american league were both considering granting the city an expansion franchise and as a result the king county council placed another bond issue measure on the ballot which was also rejected by voters7 in 1967 the american league granted seattle an expansion franchise that would be known as the seattle pilots the league clearly stated sicks stadium was not adequate as a majorleague stadium and stipulated that as a condition of being awarded the franchise bonds had to be issued to fund construction of a domed stadium that had to be completed by 1970 additionally the capacity at sicks stadium had to be expanded from 11000 to 30000 by opening day 1969 when the team was scheduled to begin playing the pilots were supposed to begin play in 1971 along with the kansas city royals however when senator stuart symington of missouri got wind of those plans he demanded both teams begin play in 1969 the american league had birthed the royals and pilots as a result of the kansas city athletics moving to oakland and symington would not accept the prospect of kansas city waiting three years for baseballs return in february 1968 as part of the forward thrust group of bond propositions king county voters approved the issue of 40 million in bonds to fund construction of the king county multipurpose domed stadium7 that year a committee considered over 100 sites throughout seattle and king county for the stadium and unanimously decided the best site would be on the grounds of seattle center site of the 1962 worlds fair community members decried the idea claiming the committee was influenced by special interest groups8 the kingdome pictured behind uss leahy dlg16 in 1982 the pilots began play as planned in 1969 but sicks stadium proved to be a problematic venue for fans media and visiting players alike and it soon became apparent that it was inadequate even for temporary use the pilots only drew 677000 fans that season not nearly enough to break even and a petition by stadium opponents brought the sicks stadium project to a halt the pilots ownership group ran out of money by the end of the season and with the stadium plans in limbo the team was forced to declare bankruptcy despite efforts by seattlearea businessmen to buy the team as well as an attempt to keep the team in seattle through the court system the pilots were sold to milwaukee businessman bud selig who relocated the team to wisconsin and renamed it the milwaukee brewers a week before the start of the 1970 season the push to build the domed stadium continued despite the lack of a major league sports team to occupy it in may 1970 voters rejected the proposal to build the stadium at seattle center89 from 1970 to 1972 the commission studied the feasibility and economic impact of building the stadium on king street adjacent to pioneer square and the international district—a site that ranked at the bottom when the commission originally narrowed the field of possible sites in 19688 this drew sharp opposition primarily from the international district community which feared the impact of the stadium on neighborhood businesses located east of the site the king street site was approved 8–1 by the county council in late 197110 and the groundbreaking ceremony in 1972 was held on november 211 several protesters attended the ceremony disrupted the speakers and at one point threw mud balls at them811 on december 5 1974 the nfl awarded seattle an expansion franchise to occupy the new stadium12 the team was later named the seattle seahawks7 construction lasted another two years and the stadium held an opening ceremony on march 27 19768 it hosted its

tacoma dome in 1983 1984 and 1985 enticed the kingdome to move the rivalry game for the totem pole trophy to seattle it was played in the kingdome for two years – 1986 and 1987 while it was relatively successful for small college football organizers realized that they would never get the 50000 needed to fill the kingdome and the game returned to tacoma high schooledit the stadium also hosted the

departments played a yearly game named the bacon bowl to raise money for charity it has since moved to centurylink field baseballedit shortly after the pilots departure for milwaukee the city of seattle king county and the state of washington sued the american league claiming a breach of contract the league agreed to grant seattle another franchise in exchange for dropping the lawsuit and the team that would later be known as the seattle mariners was born the mariners held their first game at the kingdome in 1977 against the california angels on april 6 the kingdome was somewhat problematic as a baseball venue foul territory was quite large and seating areas were set back far from the playing field with seats in the upper deck as far as 617 feet 188 m from home plate24 part of the problem was that the kingdome was not a multipurpose stadium in the truest sense instead it was built as a football stadium that could convert into a baseball stadium for instance most fans in the outfield seats on the 300 level were unable to see parts of right and center field these areas were not part of the football playing field the inside of the kingdome during a mariners game ca 1996 for most of the mariners first 18 years their poor play they did not have a winning season until 1991 combined with the kingdomes design led to poor attendance some writers and fans called it the tomb because of its gray concrete and lack of noise and puget puke24 after their inaugural home opener the mariners didnt have another sellout until 1990 at one point the mariners covered seats in the upper decks in right and rightcenter with a tarp in order to make the stadium feel less empty additionally the kingdomes acoustics created problems for stadium announcers who had to deal with significant echo issues25 however when the teams fortunes began to change in the mid–1990s and they began drawing large crowds especially in the postseason the noise created an electric atmosphere and gave the home team a distinct advantage similar to the effect on football games despite its cavernous interior the kingdomes field dimensions were relatively small it had a reputation as a hitters park especially in the 1990s when ken griffey jr edgar martínez jay buhner alex rodriguez and other sluggers played there the large number of inplay objects—speakers roof support wires and streamers—contributed to an arena baseball feel the kingdome was somewhat improved in 1982 with the addition of a 23foot 70 m wall in right field nicknamed the walla walla after walla walla washington26 featuring a new outoftown scoreboard which was in play in 1990 new owner jeff smulyan added some asymmetrical outfield dimensions the most noteworthy baseball game in the kingdomes history took place on october 8 1995 when the seattle mariners defeated the new york yankees 6–5 in 11 innings in the rubber game of the alds in front of 57411 raucous fans in the bottom of the 11th martinez doubled to left sending joey cora and griffey home with the winning runs and vaulting the mariners into the alcs for the first time in franchise history27 in 1996 a game between the mariners and the cleveland indians on may 2 in the kingdome was suspended in the home half of the seventh inning because of a minor earthquake the earthquake occurred during a pitching change as indians pitcher orel hershiser was walking off the mound following a home run by edgar martínez28 after an inspection by engineers the game was continued the next evening resulting in a win for the indians in 1989 griffey jr in his firstever plate appearance at the kingdome on april 10 hit a home run29 on june 27 1999 griffey jr hit the last home run ever at the kingdome30 basketballedit seattle

attendance record at 39457 and then again in 1980 at 40172 also since broken the kingdome regular season singlegame attendance record of 38067 was set in 199132 the supersonics hosted the 1987 nba allstar game there logistics would be a problem during the playoffs as the mariners the kingdomes primary tenants objected to letting the sonics play there in the spring therefore the sonics would only play home playoff games at the kingdome while the mariners were on the road with most of the games played at seattle center coliseum and a few games had to be played at hec edmundson pavilion at the university of washington sonics owner barry ackerley made the decision to leave the kingdome and to build a new basketball arena plans were underway to build a new arena south of the kingdome

mariners respective ownership groups saw the shared stadium arrangement as economically feasible7 after several years of threats to relocate the mariners due to poor attendance and revenue owner jeff smulyan sold the team to an ownership group led by nintendo president hiroshi yamauchi in 1992 almost immediately the new ownership group began campaigning with local and state governments to secure public funding for a new baseballonly stadium in march 1994 king county executive gary locke appointed a task force to study the need for a baseballonly stadium 1994 ceiling collapseedit the kingdomes roof had been problematic from the beginning leaks were discovered in the roof two months before the stadium opened and several attempts at repairs made the situation worse andor had to be undone43 in 1993 the county decided to strip off the outer roof coating and replace it with a special coating sandblasting failed to strip the old roof material off and the contractor changed its method to pressure washing this pressurewashing resulted in water seepage through the roof and on july 19 1994 four 26pound 12 kg waterlogged acoustic ceiling tiles fell into the seating area the tiles fell while the mariners were on the field preparing for a scheduled game against the baltimore orioles a halfhour before the gates were to open for fans to enter the stadium4344 as a result the kingdome was closed for repairs the mariners were forced to play the last 20 games of the 1994 season on the road after the players union vetoed playing the home games at cheney stadium in tacoma bc place stadium in vancouver british columbia or some neutral site as the union believed its members should only play in majorleague venues44 the extended road trip could have lasted over two months but was shortened due to the 1994–95 major league baseball strike which began on august 12 and ended up cancelling the remainder of the 1994 mlb season and delaying the start of the 1995 season44 the seahawks had to play both preseason games and the first three regularseason home games of the 1994 regular season at nearby husky stadium the kingdome held a reopening ceremony the weekend of november 4–6 1994 which culminated with the seahawks returning to the stadium for a regularseason game against the cincinnati bengals45 repairing the roof ultimately cost us51 million and two construction workers lost

yankees in the decisive 5th game of the 1995 alds on the heels of a walkoff gamewinning double hit by edgar martínez the mariners postseason run demonstrated that there was a fan base in seattle that wanted the team to stay in town and as a result the washington state legislature approved a separate funding package for a new stadium in january 1996 seahawks owner ken behring announced he was moving the team to los angeles and the team would play at anaheim stadium which had recently been vacated as a football venue when the los angeles rams moved to st louis his rationale for the decision included unfounded safety concerns surrounding the seismic stability of the kingdome behring went so far as to relocate team headquarters to anaheim california but his plans were defeated when lawyers found out that the seahawks could not break their lease on the kingdome until 2005 as a result behring tried to sell the team he found a potential buyer in microsoft cofounder paul allen who stipulated that a new publicly funded stadium had to be built as a condition of his purchase of the team allen funded a special election held on june 17 1997 that featured a measure that would
