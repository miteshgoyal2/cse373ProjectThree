after being expelled from school because of his infection5 a hemophiliac he became infected with hiv from a contaminated blood treatment and when diagnosed in 1984 was given six months to live5 though doctors said he posed no risk to other students aids was poorly understood at the time and when white tried to return to school many parents and teachers in kokomo rallied against his attendance5 a lengthy legal battle with the school system ensued and media coverage of the struggle made white into a national celebrity and spokesman for aids research and public education5 during this time white was befriended by singer michael jackson6 whites mother jeanne commented on the friendship its a really good relationship they have a good time michael jackson treats ryan white like hes not sick and ryan treats michael like hes not a celebrity6 the pop star bought the teenager a red ford mustang and invited white and his mother to spend time at his neverland ranch in santa barbara county california78 surprising his doctors white lived five years longer than initially predicted and died in april 1990 shortly before he would have completed high school5 his funeral was attended by jackson as well as english musician elton john media personality phil donahue first lady of the united states barbara bush and 1000 other mourners9 other projects took precedence for years but jackson ended up recording the song for his dangerous album in memory of white10 the prelude to the song was composed arranged and conducted by american musician marty paich10 bruce swedien who had worked extensively on jacksons thriller was drafted to record and mix the ballad10 the music engineer also served as the coproducer for gone too soon with jackson producing the song10 prior to the production

sentinel compared his tenor to that featured on a broadway ballad1819 edna gundersen of usa today reviewing the songs on dangerous offered the opinion that jacksons heartfelt delivery redeemed the

live performance of gone too soon at presidentelect bill clintons inauguration celebration an american reunion the 52nd presidential inaugural gala the pop star dedicated his performance to white and used the occasion to plead with the incoming president for funding toward aidsrelated research2728 thank you mister presidentelect for inviting me to your inauguration gala i would like to take a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal it concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us his name is ryan white he was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the aids virus when he was eleven he died shortly after turning eighteen the very time most young people are beginning to explore lifes wonderful possibilities my friend ryan was a very bright very brave and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease over the years ive shared many silly happy and painful moments with ryan and i was with him at the end of his brief but eventful journey ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to aids i miss him deeply and constantly he is gone but i want his life to have meaning beyond his passing it is my hope presidentelect clinton that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend and ended so many promising lives before
