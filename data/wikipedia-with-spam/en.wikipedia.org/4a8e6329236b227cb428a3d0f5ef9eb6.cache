hispanic and latino refer to an ethnicity people of this group may be of any race hispanic people may share some commonalities in their language culture history and heritage according to the smithsonian institution the term latino includes peoples with portuguese roots such as brazilians as well as those of spanishlanguage origin3435 in the united states many hispanics and latinos are of both european and native american ancestry mestizo others are wholly or predominately of european ancestry or wholly or predominantly of amerindian ancestry many hispanics and latinos from the caribbean as well as other regions of latin america where african slavery was widespread may be of subsaharan african descent as well3436 the difference between the terms hispanic and latino is confusing to some the us census bureau equates the two terms and defines them as referring to anyone from spain and the spanishspeaking countries of the americas the term latino has developed a number of definitions one definition of latino is a latin male in the united states37 this is the oldest and the original definition used in the united states first used in 194637 this definition encompasses spanish speakers from both europe and the americas under this definition immigrants from spain and immigrants from latin america are both latino this definition is consistent with the 21stcentury usage by the us census bureau and omb as the two agencies use both terms hispanic and latino interchangeably a later definition of latino is as a condensed form of the term latinoamericano the spanish word for latinamerican or someone who comes from latin america under this definition a mexican american or puerto rican for example is both a hispanic and a latino a brazilian american is also a latino by this definition which includes those of portuguesespeaking origin from latin america an immigrant from spain however would be classified as hispanic but not latino by this definition383940414243 san miguel chapel built in 1610 in santa fe is the oldest church structure in the us while the us census bureaus definition of hispanic is limited to spain and spanishspeaking latin america other government agencies have slightly different definitions of the term the us department of transportation defines hispanic as persons of mexican puerto rican cuban dominican central or south american or other spanish or portuguese culture or origin regardless of race44 this definition has been adopted by the small business administration as well as by many federal state and municipal agencies unlike the census bureaus definition this clearly includes people with origins in portuguesespeaking countries preference of use between the terms among hispanics and latinos in the united states often depends on where users of the respective terms reside those in the eastern united states tend to prefer the term hispanic whereas those in the west tend to prefer latino15 both terms refer to ethnicity as a person of latino or hispanic origin can be of any race1645 in spanish latina is used for persons of feminine gender latino is used for those of masculine gender or by default for example a group of mixed or unknown gender would be referred to as latinos in the 21st century the neologisms latinx and latin46 were coined as a genderneutral alternative to this traditional usage47 the x functions as a variable encompassing those who identify as male female or nonbinary the symbol is seen as containing both the masculine o and feminine a thus serving a

their united states diaspora differs by history and geography mexicans represent the bulk of the us hispaniclatino population and most mexican americans that migrate to the united states are of native

racial diversity hispanics form an ethnicity sharing a language spanish and cultural heritage rather than a race the phenomenon of biracial people who are predominantly of european descent identifying

ancestry say they are white above that threshold people tended to describe themselves as africanamerican72 youthedit as of 2014 one third or 179 million of the hispanic population was younger than 18 and a quarter 146 million were millennials this makes them more than half of the hispanic population within the united states73 identity postmigrationedit as latino migrants become the norm in the united states the effects of this migration on the identity of these migrants and their kin becomes most evident in the younger generations crossing the borders changes the identities of both the youth and their families often one must pay special attention to the role expressive culture plays as both entertainment and as a site in which identity is played out empowered and reformed because it is sometimes in opposition to dominant norms and practices and sometimes in conjunction with them74 the exchange of their culture of origin with american culture creates a dichotomy within the values that the youth find important therefore changing what it means to be latino in the global sphere transnationalismedit karla camila cabello estrabao was born in cojimar habana del este cuba to sinuhe estrabao and alejandro cabello for most of her early life she and her family moved back and forth between havana and mexico city mexico her fathers native country before relocating to miami florida at age the term agringados is a term for immigrants who have gone to america and allowed themselves to be americanized thus losing their latino identity this is the identity struggle youth and families face because they are forced to choose how much american culture they can adopt without having their latino peers looking down on them for being “too american” another way in which identity is compromised is shown through youth families who bring their young children into the us allow them to be more exposed and vulnerable to adopting american identity this becomes a problem for the parents because they struggle to understand their children and how to teach them having grown up in their original country along with feeling that they are neither from the country of their ethnic background nor the united states a new identity within the united states is formed called latinidad this is especially seen in cosmopolitan social settings like new york city chicago houston los angeles and san francisco underway is the intermeshing of different latino subpopulations has laid the foundations for the emergence and ongoing evolution of a strong sense of latinidad which establishes a sense of cultural affinity and identity deeply rooted in what many latinos perceive to be a shared historical spiritual aesthetic and linguistic heritage and a growing sense of cultural affinity and solidarity in the social context of the united states74 this unites latinos as one creating cultural kin with other latino ethnicities gender rolesedit one of the many ways that migration to the united states changes identity for latino youth is the way that they carry their gendered identities traditionally in latino households it would be common to find women and young girls to be homebodies or una muchacha de la casa because this means she abides by the cultural norms and respectability chastity and family honor valued by the community75 however when latina women come to the united states or are for there they tend to adapt to the social norms of this new country when they do this their social location changes as they become more independent and able to live without the financial support of their families or partners these women are then viewed as being de la calle which is to be transgressive and sexually promiscuous when latino families are in the united states they deal with young womens failure to adhere to these culturally prescribed norms of proper gendered behavior in a variety of ways including sending them to live in puerto rico with family members regardless of whether or not they are sexually active76 along with the increase in independence amongst these young women the concept of vergüenza in many of the dynamics between gender relations begins to diminish to have vergüenza is to assert male dominance in all spheres especially in his relationship with his feminine partner it is enforced through shaming males into fitting a macho archetype in order to establish respect dominance and in turn manliness in their social worlds while there are many latina women in the homeland as well as older latina women in the united states who often reinforce this dynamic by not wanting a man who is a sinvergüenza one without shame the latinx youth are taking sinvergüenza and wearing it with honor often being in the middle of these two worlds makes for the youth to meditate between the two cultures and their ambivalence toward feeling a lack of vergüenza77 resulting in a group of youth who celebrate being sinvergüenza while still acknowledging the concept of vergüenza within a part of their culture sexualityedit antonio banderas an american actor he has starred in many films with the catholic church remaining a large influence on the latino culture the subject of promiscuity and sexuality is often considered taboo it is taught in many latino cultures that best way to remain pure of sin and not become pregnant is to remain celibate and heterosexual all are to be straight and women are to be virgins and must carry herself like a madonna in order to receive respect and have the familys honor remain sofía vergara a colombian actress and model however despite being told that they should essentially suppress any natural feeling of sexual curiosity through the globalization of encouraging sexual liberation many young latina women take their sexuality into their own hands and do not listen to the madonna ideal despite the this oppressive nature women are neither passive nor onedimensional individuals who automatically adapt to these culturally and socially defined moral prescriptions shaping their sex lives in some way but instead sophisticated multidimensional and active social agents who react to these prescriptions in multiform and complicated ways78 latino youth are also taking control of their sexuality through migration globalization and tourism in places like acapulco cancun vallarta mazatlan and veracruz all cities in mexico these cities are becoming popularized by gay youth both mexican and american and have become somewhat of a safe haven for homosexual people as well as those whom have been labeled gay not for their sexual preferences but because of the way that theyre gender is perceived by others due to the persecution for presenting as homosexual that is faced in mexico along with the difficulty to immigrate north of the border many queer mexican men and women migrating to urban areas within mexico has proved to be a better alternative79 the creation of this ambiente is due to the not only globalization of queerness but as well as the way harsh immigration laws in the united states makes these cities one of their only options notable contributionsedit hispanic and latino americans have

considerable impact on the k12 system in 201112 latinaos comprised 24 of all enrollments in the united states including 52 and 51 of enrollment in california and texas respectively132 further research shows the latino population will continue to grow in the united states implicating that more latinos will populate us schools the state of latinao education shows some promise first hispanic students attending prek or kindergarten were more likely to attend fullday programs132 second latinos in elementary education were the second largest group represented in gifted and talented programs132 third hispanics average naep math and reading scores have consistently increased over the last 10 years132 finally latinaos were more likely than other groups including whites to go to college132 however their academic achievement in early childhood elementary and secondary education lag behind other groups132 for instance their average math and reading naep scores were lower than every other group except african americans and have the highest dropout rate of any group 13 despite decreasing from 24132 to explain these disparities some scholars have suggested there is a latino education crisis due to failed school and social policies133 to this end scholars have further offered several potential reasons including language barriers poverty and immigrantnativity status resulting in latinos not performing well academically134135 english language learnersedit hispanics have revived the use of spanish in the united states originally brought to north america during the spanish colonial period in the 16th century today there are almost 40 million spanish speakers in the united states spanish is also the most popular language taught in the united states136137 currently 80 of hispanic students in the us are english language learners138 in 20089 53 million students were classified as english language learners ells in prek to 12th grade139 this is a result of many students entering the education system at different ages although the majority of ells are not foreign born139 in order to provide english instruction for latino students there have been a multitude of english language programs however the great majority of these programs are english immersion which arguably undermines the students’ culture and knowledge of their primary language135 as such there continues to be great debate within schools as to which program can address these language disparities povertyedit poverty affects many underrepresented students as racialethnic minorities tend to stay isolated within pockets of lowincome communities this results in several inequalities such as school offerings teacher quality curriculum counseling and all manner of things that both keep students engaged in school and prepare them to graduate140 in the case of latinos the poverty rate for hispanic children in 2004 was 286 percent138 moreover with this lack of resources schools reproduce these inequalities for generations to come in order to assuage poverty many hispanic families can turn to social and community services as resources immigration statusedit immigrants have not always had access to compulsory education in the united states however due to the landmark supreme court plyler v doe in 1982 immigrants are allowed access to k12 education this significantly impacted all immigrant groups including latinaos however their academic achievement is dependent upon several factors including but not limited to time of arrival and schooling in country of origin141 moreover latinos immigrationnativity status plays a major role regarding their academic achievement for instance first and second generation latinos outperform their later generational counterparts142 additionally their aspirations appear to decrease as well143 this has major implications on their postsecondary futures hispanic or latino higher educationedit university of texas at el paso is the

judaism buddhism174 and 6 have no religious preference with only 037 claiming to be either atheist or agnostic the results of this study suggest that hispanicslatinos are not only a highly religious but also a highly christian constituency it also suggests that hispaniclatino protestants are a more sizable minority than is sometimes realized catholic affiliation is much higher among firstgeneration than it is among second or thirdgeneration hispanic or latino immigrants who exhibit a fairly high rate of defection to protestantism175 also hispanics and latinos in the bible belt which is mostly located in the south are more likely to shift to protestantism than those in other regions as it is all around them protestant denominations that have attracted hispaniclatino converts are pentecostalism176177 southern baptist178 and the episcopal church179180 according to andrew greeley as many as 600000 american latinos leave catholicism for protestant churches every year181

mexican food has become part of the mainstream american market just as italian food did so decades before latino food particularly mexican food has influenced american cuisine and eating habits mexican cuisine has become so mainstream in american culture that many no longer see it as an ethnic food across the us tortillas and salsa are arguably becoming as common as hamburger buns and ketchup tortilla chips have surpassed potato chips in annual sales and plantain chips popular in caribbean cuisines have continued to increase sales184 tropical fruit such as mango guava and passion fruit maracuyá have become more popular and are now common flavors in desserts candies and food dishes in the us due to the large mexicanamerican population in the southwestern united states and its proximity to mexico mexican food there is believed to be some of the best in the us cubans brought cuban cuisine to miami and today cortaditos pastelitos de guayaba and empanadas are common midday

15th birthday common amongst hispanic families hispanic and latino culture places a strong value on family and is commonly taught to hispanic children as one of the most important values in life statistically hispanic families tend to have larger and closer knit families than the american average hispanic families tend to prefer to live near other family members this may mean that three or sometimes four generations may be living in the same household or near each other although four generations is uncommon in the us the role of grandparents is believed to be very important in the upbringing of children187 hispanics tend to be very grouporiented and an emphasis is placed on the wellbeing of the family above the individual the extended family plays an important part of many hispanic families and frequent social family gatherings are common traditional rites of passages particularly roman catholic sacraments such as baptisms birthdays first holy communions quinceañeras confirmations graduations and weddings are all popular moments of family gatherings and celebrations in hispanic families188189 education is another important priority for hispanic families education is seen as the key towards continued upward mobility in the us among hispanic families a 2010 study by the associated press showed that hispanics place a higher emphasis on education than the average american hispanics expect their children to graduate university190191 latin american youth today stay at home with their parents longer than before this is due to more years spent studying and the difficulty of finding a paid job that meets their aspirations192 intermarriageedit hispanic americans like immigrant groups before them are outmarrying at high rates outmarriages comprised 174 of all existing hispanic marriages in 2008193 the rate was higher for newlyweds which excludes immigrants who are already married among all newlyweds in 2010 257 of all hispanics married a nonhispanic this compares to outmarriage rates of 94 of whites 171 of blacks and 277 of asians the rate was larger for nativeborn hispanics with 362 of nativeborn hispanics both men and women outmarrying compared to 142 of foreignborn hispanics194 the difference is attributed to recent immigrants tending to marry within their immediate immigrant community due to commonality of language proximity familial connections and familiarity193 in 2008 81 of hispanics who married out married nonhispanic whites 9 married nonhispanic blacks 5 nonhispanic asians and the remainder married nonhispanic multiracial partners193 of the 275500 new intermarried pairings in 2010 433 were whitehispanic compared to whiteasian at 144 whiteblack at 119 and other combinations at 304 other combinations consists of pairings between different minority groups multiracial people and american indians194 unlike those for marriage to blacks and asians intermarriage rates of hispanics to whites do not vary by gender the combined median earnings of whitehispanic couples are lower than those of whitewhite couples but higher than those of hispanichispanic couples 23 of hispanic men who married white women have a college degree compared to only 10 of hispanic men who married a hispanic woman 33 of hispanic women who married a white husband are collegeeducated compared to 13 of hispanic women who married a hispanic man194 attitudes among nonhispanics toward intermarriage with hispanics are mostly favorable with 81 of whites 76 of asians and 73 of blacks being fine with a member of their family marrying a hispanic and an additional 13 of whites 19 of asians and 16 of blacks being bothered but accepting of the marriage only 2 of whites 4 of asians and 5 of blacks would not accept a marriage of their family member to a hispanic193 hispanic attitudes toward intermarriage with nonhispanics are likewise favorable with 71 being fine with marriages to whites and 81 being fine with marriages to blacks a further 22 admitted to being bothered but accepting of a marriage of a family member to a white and 16 admitted to being bothered but accepting of a marriage of a family member to a black only 3 of hispanics objected outright marriage of a family member to a nonhispanic black and 3 to a nonhispanic white193 unlike intermarriage with other racial groups intermarriage with nonhispanic blacks varies by nationality of origin puerto ricans and dominicans have by far the highest rates of intermarriage with blacks of all major hispanic national groups190195196197198199200201202203 cubans have

hispanics and latinos differ on their political views depending on their location and background the majority 57209 either identify as or support the democrats and 23 identify as republicans209 this 34point gap as of december 2007 was an increase from the gap of 21 points 16 months earlier cuban americans and colombian americans tend to favor conservative political ideologies and support the republicans mexican americans puerto ricans and dominican americans tend to favor liberal views and support the democrats however because the latter groups are far more numerous—as again mexican americans alone are 64 of hispanics and latinos—the democratic party is considered to be in a far stronger position with the ethnic group overall election resultsedit the presidency of george w bush had a significant influence on the political leanings of hispanics and latinos as he attracted new supporters as a former governor of texas bush regarded this growing community as a potential source of growth for the conservative movement and the republican partycitation needed he made some gains for the republicans among the group elections of 19962006edit president bill clinton and his hispanic appointees in 1998 in the 1996 presidential election 72 of hispanics and latinos backed president bill clinton in 2000 the democratic total fell to 62 and went down again in 2004 with democrat john kerry winning hispanics 58–40 against bush210 hispanics in the west especially in california were much stronger for the democratic party than in texas and florida california latinos voted 63–32 for kerry in 2004 and both arizona and new mexico latinos by a smaller 56–43 margin texas latinos were split nearly evenly favoring kerry 50–49 over their favorite son candidate and florida latinos who are mostly cuban american backed bush by a 54–45 margin in the 2006 midterm election however due to the unpopularity of the iraq war the heated debate concerning illegal hispanic immigration and republicanrelated congressional scandals hispanics and latinos went as strongly democratic as they have since the clinton years exit polls showed the group voting for democrats by a lopsided 69–30 margin with florida latinos for the first time split evenly the runoff election in texas 23rd congressional district was seen as a bellwether of latino politics democrat ciro rodriguezs unexpected and unexpectedly decisive defeat of republican incumbent henry bonilla was seen as proof of a leftward lurch among latino voters majoritylatino counties overwhelmingly backed rodriguez and majority

the 2008 presidential elections democratic primary hispanics and latinos participated in larger numbers than before with hillary clinton receiving most of the groups support213 pundits discussed whether a large percentage of hispanics and latinos would vote for an africanamerican candidate in this case barack obama clintons opponent214 hispanicslatinos voted 2 to 1 for mrs clinton even among the younger demographic in other groups younger voters went overwhelmingly for obama215 among hispanics 28 said race was involved in their decision as opposed to 13 for nonhispanic whites215 obama defeated clinton in the matchup between obama and republican candidate john mccain for the presidency hispanics and latinos supported obama with 59 to mccains 29 in the gallup tracking poll as of june 30 2008216 this surprised some analysts since a higher than expected percentage of latinos and hispanics favored obama over mccain who had been a leader of the comprehensive immigration reform effort217 however mccain had retreated during the republican primary saying that he would not support the bill if it came up again some analysts believed that this shift damaged his standing among hispanics and latinos218 obama took advantage of the situation by running ads in spanish to appeal to this ethnic group in which he mentioned mccains aboutface219 in the general election 67 of hispanics and latinos voted for obama220 and 31 voted for mccain221 with a relatively stronger turnout than in previous elections in states such as colorado new mexico nevada and virginia helping obama carry those formerly republican states obama won 70 of noncuban hispanics and 35 of the traditionally republican cuban americans who have a strong presence in florida the changing state demographics in which the noncuban hispanic community is increasing in number also contributed to his carrying floridas latinos with 57 of the vote220222 hispanics and latinos also offset republican gains in traditional red states for example obama carried 63 of texas latinos when the overall vote of the state was for mccain by 55223 although during 2008 the economy and employment were top concerns for hispanics and latinos immigration was never far from their minds almost 90 of latino voters rated immigration as somewhat important or very important in a poll taken after the election224 there is abundant evidence that the heated republican opposition to the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2007 has done significant damage to the partys appeal to hispanics and latinos in the years to come especially in the swing states such as florida nevada and new mexico224 in a gallup poll of 4604 registered hispanic voters taken in the final days of june 2008 only 18 of participants identified as republicans216 some political organizations associated with hispanic and latino americans are league of united latin american citizens lulac the national council of la raza nclr the united farm workers the cuban american national foundation and the national institute for latino policy 2012 electionedit hispanic and latinos voted even more heavily for democrats in the 2012 election with the democratic incumbent barack obama receiving 71 and the republican challenger mitt romney receiving about 27 of the vote225226 hispanic voteedit united states has a population of 50 million of hispanic and latino americans of them 27 million are citizens eligible to vote 13 of total eligible voters therefore hispanics have a very important effect on presidential elections since the vote difference between two main parties is usually around 4227228229230 cultural issuesedit hispanophobiaedit main articles hispanophobia and antimexican sentiment hispanophobia has existed in various degrees throughout us history based largely on ethnicity race culture anticatholicism economic and social conditions in latin america and use of the spanish language231232233234 in 2006 time magazine reported that the number of hate groups in the united states increased by 33 percent since 2000 primarily due to antiillegal immigrant and antimexican sentiment235 according to federal bureau of investigation statistics the number of antilatino hate crimes increased by 35 percent since 2003 albeit from a low level in california the state with the largest latino population the number of hate crimes against latinos almost doubled236 for the year 2009 the fbi reported that 483 of the 6604 hate crimes committed in the united states were antihispanic comprising 73 of all hate crimes this compares to 346 of hate crimes being antiblack 179 being antihomosexual 141 being antijewish and 83 being antiwhite237 relations with other minority groupsedit as a result of the rapid growth of the hispanic population there has been some tension with other minority populations238 especially the african american population as hispanics have increasingly moved into once exclusively black areas239240241242243244245246247248249250 there has also been increasing cooperation between minority groups to work together to attain political influence251252253254255 a 2007 ucla study reported that 51 of blacks felt that hispanics were taking jobs and political power from them and 44 of hispanics said they feared africanamericans identifying them african americans with high crime rates that said large majorities of hispanics credited american blacks and the civil rights movement with making life easier for them in the us256257 a pew research center poll from 2006 showed that blacks overwhelmingly felt that hispanic immigrants were hard working 78 and had strong family values 81 but also that they believed that immigrants took jobs from americans 34 with a significant minority of blacks 22 believing that they had directly lost a job to an immigrant and 34 of blacks wanting immigration to be curtailed the report also surveyed three cities chicago with its wellestablished latino community washington dc with a lessestablished but quickly growing hispanic community and raleighdurham with a very new but rapidly growing hispanic community the results showed that a significant proportion of blacks in those cities wanted immigration to be curtailed chicago 46 raleighdurham 57 and washington dc 48258 per a 2008 university of california berkeley law school research brief a recurring theme to black hispanic tensions is the growth in contingent flexible or contractor labor which is increasingly replacing long term steady employment for jobs on the lowerrung of the pay scale which had been disproportionately filled by blacks the transition to this employment arrangement corresponds directly with the growth in the latino immigrant population the perception is that this new labor arrangement has driven down wages removed benefits and rendered temporary jobs that once were stable but also benefiting consumers who receive lowercost services while passing the costs of labor healthcare and indirectly education onto the community at large259 a 2008 gallup poll indicated that 60 of hispanics and 67 of blacks believe that good relations exist between us blacks and hispanics260 while only 29 of blacks 36 of hispanics and 43 of whites say black–hispanic relations are bad260 in 2009 in los angeles county latinos committed 77 of the hate crimes against black
