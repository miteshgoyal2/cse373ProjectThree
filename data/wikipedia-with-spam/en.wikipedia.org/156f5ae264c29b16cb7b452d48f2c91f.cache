tells me that it is protected hike395 0521 3 jun 2004 utc note about which cities to includeedit major cities must have 100000 residents okay minor cities must have more than 10000 okay we dont need finley washington in there and no matter if you think puyallup washington is a major city if were going to have divisions they cant just be based on personal opinion right matt yeager ♫ talk 0554 22 february 2006 utc sounds reasonable but 10000 might be setting the bar too low for minor cities list of cities in washington by population gives the top 30 which cuts out at just under 30000 a more complete list might give a better idea of how minor a city we ought to include — jeff talk 0617 22 february 2006 utc federal way smaller city tricities city vs regionedit kent has a larger city population than federal way but kent is listed as a smaller city whereas federal way as a major one the federal way article mentions that if the surrounding unincorporated area were included federal ways population would be 110000 however federal way borders kent and the even smaller city of auburn why would these unincorproated areas be included in federal ways total population and not in those of kent and auburn elevating their status on this template kent is claimed to be the largest city in south king county 1 and furthermore everett is listed as one of the smaller cities but it is perceived to be much more major than federal way federal ways perceived standing regardless of its actual numbers is at the same level as kent and renton i have moved federal way to the list of smaller cities westonmr 1702 26 february 2006 utc you two are wrong federal way is the 7th largest city in washington kent is the 8th federal way should be put up as a larger city since there are seven slots and federal way is the 7th largest city and tricities isnt actually a city itself its a region that consists of several smaller independent cities including kenniwick pasco and richland you really should look up what a twin city is although it is commonly looked at as a whole they are actually separate but due to being close to each other they grow into each other but the reality is that they can be demographically economically and politically independent this is because they are still separate cities even if they have been twinned its called tricities because the identity of these cities have been blurred due to the close proximity and intertwined nature thats why its called tricities instead of tricity so federal way should be considered a larger city and the tricities should be taken off as a city because it isnt actually a real city its a region and we already have it listed as a region quirkyandsuch talk 1044 3 february 2008 utc youre right the tricities is technically a metropolitan area but we dont have a line for metro areas on this template given the categories we have to work with the tricities is more of a city than it is a region in terms of its economic social and cultural importance in washington its considered a city although legally it is not it should be on the list of major cities northwesterner1 talk 0533 15 february 2008 utc each city kenniwick pasco and richland in this regionarea is already represented as a smaller city already it wouldnt make sense to represent them all as individual cities and then to also represent them together as a big city esp when they are not an individual city by letting these individual cities remain as three small cities it gives them representation and a resource for people interested in looking them up all the while giving the tricities region representation as a region without contradicting what these three small cities actually are and being considered a city by common public misconception rather than legal status wouldnt be encyclopedic quirkyandsuch talk 1342 19 february 2008 utc no we actually tend to classify things by what they are considered to be by the general public not by legal status for an example just off the top of my head take the artist elton john youll find that that is where the wikipedia article about him is located not at sir elton john not at sir elton hercules john or even just plain elton hercules john not even at reginald kenneth dwight his given name why at elton john thats the publics conception of his name is it accurate does it matter not when it comes to classification as a way of letting people find things easily lets take that back to the tricities say that someones thinking gee whiz i just read this lovely article on tacoma washington what else is there in the state that tricities region maybe ill go look it up surely it will be located in the template alongside other major metropolitan areas and cities like spokane and vancouver it wont suffice to have just richland pasco and kennewick down below the tricities are a region which isnt even neatly encapsulated by the three cities as the article itself will tell you put simply by slightly expanding our definition of cities we can make the template a whole lot neater we could just as well change the title of that section to major cities and metropolitan regions but why bother if id thought there would be some disagreement over an area like the tricities fitting in the cities section id have rewritten the template years ago matt yeager ♫ talk 0630 6 march 2008 utc agree i agree with matt yeager the tricities is culturally defined as the fourthlargest city in washington and including it as such provides the greatest service to wikipedia readers northwesterner1 talk 0640 6 march 2008 utc i have posted at wikipedia talkwikiproject washington asking other editors to weigh in here northwesterner1 talk 2332 6 march 2008 utc for reference i looked at a few other state templates to see how comparable regions are recorded all direct comparables seem to classify them as a region such as illinois has the quad cities minnesota has the twin cities metropolitan area however i also found several state templates that use a metro area category which contains regions that would be comparable some of the states with that additional category are arkansas mississippi ohio pennsylvania and oregon after looking through those i would support removing tricities from the largest city section and instead insert it in either the region section or if enough consensus exists then to create a new metro area section and include it in that barek talk • contribs 2354 6 march 2008 utc id support adding a new metro area section which would include at least the tricities and the seattle metropolitan area travisl talk 1640 25 march 2008 utc this may be a good solution but the problem is that we currently dont have good articles to use without duplicating existing city articles in the template i see three options none of them ideal if we simply add a metro area section then it would probably have to be seattle metro portland vancouver spokane tricities but the portland and spokane articles are about the cities themselves there is no metro area article for those two places we could create articles to fill those holes but unless somebody really invested some work into those articles they would be meager and then we would end up having a template that links to stubs not good we could delete the larger cities row and replace it with metro areas in that case it would read seattletacomabellevueeverett portlandvancouver spokane tricities that seems pretty clunky to me we could simplify it to seattletacoma portlandvancouver spokane tricities and move bellevue and everett to the smaller cities list that might be best i guess but we may have complaints from bellevueeverett fans northwesterner1 talk 1657 26 march 2008 utc actually i have a simple solution move the tricities to the region section and add federal way to the larger city section check the list of regions of the united states and youll find the tricities already listed as a region under washington we already have a section that it belongs in and already does qualify for there is no need to start reforming this template and other users must think the tricities fit since it was already listed as a region a long time ago we are making this whole thing too complicated so tricities go in the region section and federal way goes into the larger city section does this work for everyone quirkyandsuch talk 0505 30 march 2008 utc first im opposed to tricities as a region as stated above i think it is culturally considered more a city than a region and it doesnt match at all with the other regions in the washington template second i dont understand why federal way is tied in with the tricities issue if we move tricities why do we have to add federal way to the larger cities listnorthwesterner1 talk 0538 30 march 2008 utc i have no problem with this change it matches how other states handle compable situations as i said above all direct comparables seem to classify them as a region such as illinois has the quad cities minnesota has the twin cities metropolitan area i see no real need to treat the tricities different than how other states handle comparable regions barek talk • contribs 1723 30 march 2008 utc the tricities are a region i dont think this is debatable facts are facts the individual cities that make up this region are already represented as individual cities and this region should be represented as a region i dont see how several cities that are known as being very close and connected is any different from the san juan islands or the many other cases of twin cities known as regions barek and i have both presented factual evidence supporting the changes and all youve presented is that it is culturally seen as a city and that you dont like it this is a weak argument and based off of the publics misconception and you cant even prove that this cultural preference of sorts is even strong enough to make this a viable point im from washington and ive never considered the tricities a city because ive always been geographically aware your argument supports presenting an article in its popular form based off of a misconception instead of its factual reality as a region this does not enhance an encyclopedia i dont mean to be rude but i do feel like youre wasting time on this issue based on a preference instead of factual evidence as an editor youre expected to be objective 1 this area has already been listed as a region by other users in the list of regions of the united states which demonstrates that other users have logically come to the conclusion that this is indeed a region 2 other states consider similar areas to be regions 3 other states that dont consider similar areas to be regions consider them metropolitan areas not cities 4 this area is not legally considered a city and does not meet the qualifications as a city including but not limited to governmental powers and legal entity i disagree with matt yeager and support the tricities being moved to the region section quirkyandsuch talk 0126 31 march 2008 utc every other article listed in the regions section of the washington template is a feature of physical geography the puget sound article is not about the puget sound metropolitan area but about the arm of the pacific ocean known as puget sound the san juan islands article is not about the cities of the san juan islands but about the rocks they sit on meanwhile tricities washington is an article about the combined politicalculturaleconomic entity known as the tricities it is an article about industry infrastructure population statistics tv stations etc as such it resembles other articles about cities or metropolitan areas not articles about features of physical geography my goal is to make the template useful for a reader trying to learn about washington state look at the list of articles in regions cascade range columbia gorge kitsap peninsula tricities just doesnt fit i have listened to you and barek and travis1 and i support the tricities being included as a metropolitan area in fact i was trying to move us in that direction when you came along trying to shut off conversation you are being rude but ill let that go if youre willing to also be productive northwesterner1 talk 0358 31 march 2008 utc sorry about that i dont mean to be rude i just got frustrated because i just can‘t stand the idea of keeping things as they are it just doesn’t make sense to me we could create a metro area and include seattle metro portland vancouver spokane tricities like you had said we could probably just put up the metro are names for portland and spokane and have them autodirect to the existing articles for these cities because they already have all the information we need about the metro status and i dont see any reason to create separate articles esp since the existing ones would already have so much information no need to cannibalize them i checked out the articles they seem perfectly setup for this quirkyandsuch talk 0247 1 april 2008 utc this seems like a workable solution to me until someone creates a separate metro article we would have spokane on the template twice unfortunately but that seems okay northwesterner1 talk 0253 1 april 2008 utc the awkward thing with the metro section is that there are only the two articles tricities seattle metro area that deal with metro areasregions i really dont think we should invent a spokane metro area article it probably could be written but not easily or one for portland which only barely has to do with wa at all and putting seattles sidebyside with the tc one with nothing else there would look pretty weird i dunno matt yeager ♫ talk 0601 2 april 2008 utc quick addon to that just to make sure were all clear on everything i think we all agree that tricities washington should be in there somewhere and that they really arent so much a city as a metropolitan region well more bluntly they really arent a city at all we can talk about a compromise if we start from those basic points so if anyone objects speak now matt yeager ♫ talk 0605 2 april 2008 utc arbitrary break for toc purposesedit thanks matt if we can all agree to those basic points here are the options we have on the table if im missing any please add them here 1 rename the larger cities row to larger cities and metro areas otherwise the template stays the same 2 move the tricities from larger cities to regions otherwise the template stays the same compare templateminnesota 3 add a metro areas row in addition to the larger cities row compare templateohio a metro areas seattle metro tricities larger cities seattle tacoma spokane vancouver bellevue everett b metro areas seattle metro portlandvancouver spokane tricities larger cities seattle tacoma spokane vancouver bellevue everett 4 delete the larger cities row and replace it with metro areas compare templateoregon a metro areas seattletacomabellevueeverett vancouver spokane tricities b metro areas seattletacoma vancouver spokane tricities bellevue and everett moved to smaller cities which could be renamed cities or something else strong support 4a 4b or 1 willing to support 3a 3b oppose 2 northwesterner1 talk 1016 2 april 2008 utc support 1 perhaps adding seattle metro area which keeping seattle itself im waiting to see some arguments in favor of the others before i commit myself to anything else good job moving on this northwesterner1 matt yeager ♫ talk 0253 3 april 2008 utc strong support 1 oppose 24 washington state really doesnt have the same type of regions as other areas in the country the only place thats really known by its region more than city is tricities most people even in the seattle metro area refer to the individual cities far more often than the region and then you have to define whats included in the seattle metro area sure kentauburnfw fit thisbut does everyone agree that bellevue is included how about issaquah marysville for purposes of clarity and cleanliness i think that 1 is really the best solution it lets tricities be discoverable but doesnt require significant restructuring just to fit some concept of a template rather than for actual usable reasons snarky boy talk 1706 3 april 2008 utc support 1 2 or 3 oppose 4 also oppose option 0leave it asis i find that option 4 has the least clean fit for washington either 1 2 or 3 can work with little to no difficulty in fitting those solutions into the structures that exist for washington articles barek talk • contribs 1725 3 april 2008 utc done for now i implemented option 1 for now which seems to have broad support not closing the conversation though so continue to weigh in northwesterner1 talk 2148 3 april 2008 utc support 2 3 4 oppose 1 4 i feel that option 1 just brings us back to the same place tricities being put in with other cities the name is confusing and might lead people into thinking its a city instead of a metro area which is confusing option 3a is basically this but making a distinction between metro and large cities one that would be helpful to users without being confusing i think that might be a good choice esp since option 1 doesnt differentiate between city or metro area which is one of the problems that started everything quirkyandsuch talk 0545 4 april 2008 utc us state templatesedit wikipediawikiproject us statesstate templates lists and displays all 50 us state and additional other templates it potentially can be used for ideas and standardization mrd9 0726 19 march 2006 utc watch for major city of bellinghamedit watch in the years to come bellingham will be a major city in 3 years currently 73000 population 3 years will be 100000  iain 0307 10 may 2006 utc standardization of state templatesedit there is currently an ongoing discussion regarding standardization of state templates primarily regarding layout and styling at wikipedia talkwikiproject us statesstate templates an effort was made earlier this year to standardize canadian province templates which mostly succeeded lovelac7 and i have already begun standardizing all state templates if you have any concerns they should be directed toward the discussion page for state template standardization thanks — webdinger blah sz 2307 27 august 2006 utc i just converted this and all state and territory template to use the standard templateus state navigation box feel free to discuss and edit the master template all you like i only converted them to that standard ill leave it to others to discuss and decide what that standard should be the purpose of the standardization was to make wikipedia more encyclopedic and to make it much easier to add new features to all of the templates at the same time for example adding the viewtalkedit tag could easily be done to all of them via the master template i just dont really know how to make it look good it is also to reduce maintainence time by having to only maintain the style of 1 master template rather than 56 individual state and territory templates capitalr 0514 5 march 2007 utc 10000 as a minimumedit okay im thinking 10000 was definitely too small a limit for cities and im the one who set it this templates getting uglified by having just so many cities in there i never dreamed we had so many cities over 10000 people we may have to set it at 30000 or something i dont know does anyone care matt yeager ♫ talk 0113 4 september 2006 utc whatever limit is chosen should also be noted in the template otherwise it makes people think that every city is listed the template should also link to the list of cities etc notmyhandle 0404 14 december 2006 utc could the limit be tolerant of status such as county seats seeing battle ground here but not being able to list port orchard is a little annoying since po is the county seat for kitsap but within the city limits has 8000 people maybe define smaller cities as all cities 30000 population or that are county seats thus politically important if not important by size i do think the list looks cluttered asis though snarky boy 2132 1 february 2007 utc sounds right i added port orchard county seats certainly deserve a spot matt yeager ♫ talk 0404 20 february 2008 utc larger citiesedit i added vancouver washington to the larger cities section as of 2000 it is the 4th largest city in the state larger than bellevue or everett and speaking of do we really want to include more than the 4 or 5 largest cities perhaps five is sufficient vantucky talk 0441 18 august 2007 utc i think that the six cities are ok for the larger cities section as all of the cities have a current population of over 100000 people none of them need to be removed and we definitely do not need any more hdt83 chat 0515 18 august 2007 utc there are only 4 cities as is three are metro areas this doesnt help people find large cities easily and finding information easily is the whole point in creating categories elmerbront talk 1042 16 january 2009 utc i think five cities is enough spokane valley washington is larger than federal way washington fwiw so ive swapped them around to make it accurate —locke cole • t • c 1101 16 january 2009 utc federal way is much larger than the current stats show here are more current ones httpwwwcityoffederalwaycompageaspxid706 i think it should be included its pretty large elmerbront talk 0136 20 february 2009 utc spokane valley is still larger by a couple hundred —locke cole • t • c 2009 20 february 2009 utc i know its larger but what im saying is that there are many large cities we should include a few maybe three more to be complete how can federal way be considered a small city when its only a couple hundred less than one of the large cities i feel the large city group isnt complete elmerbront talk 0442 22 february 2009 utc criterion of 100000 was enunciated in 2006 ive added kent and retained yakima washington yakima passes the 100000 threshold when you include two unincorporated suburbs as explained at yakima washingtonyakima region brianhe talk 0514 19 october 2012 utc likewise added wenatchee – east wenatchee metropolitan area as it is now over pop 110000 brianhe talk 0529 19 october 2012 utc template body coloredit ive reverted the color change to a less obnoxious shade of green any opinions on the two versions the version that i restored uses color code  b4ddb4  here while the other version contained color code  70ff95  here barek talk • contribs 2158 16 february 2009 utc idk i think a greener shade of green would fit the state better but thats just my opinion matt yeager ♫ talk 0024 17 february 2009 utc on the two monitors ive looked at the 70ff95 color has a slight fluorescent look and a bit too much blue in it although i can see where the earthier original color may appear too brown to some people maybe whats needed is a third alternative barek talk • contribs 0058 17 february 2009 utc its always seems greener on the other side of the color spectrum haha but yeah the brighter one is too bright maybe a third option would be nice if not go with the first elmerbront talk 0243 20 february 2009 utc is there a particular reason why this template is green i understand the general idea here is to try to match the state flag or something but we arent using the same color wouldnt it be better to just go with the default used by navbox to avoid having a rainbow at the bottom of the page when this navbox is next to another one and per wpaccessibility please let me know if there is a strong reason to have it a particular color i noticed this was attempted recently but was reverted so i thought i would be proactive and start a thread here to avoid an edit war thanks plastikspork ―œtalk 2137 19 december 2010 utc many of us like it as green nyttend talk 2232 14 may 2011 utc wikiproject washingtonedit this template has been added to the wikipediawikiproject washington by me using awb because it is in categorywashington us state templates if you believe this to be an error just revert my addition or you can ask me at my talk page or the wikiproject washington talk page and check that this template is not in or remove it from the washington us state templates category gold man60 talk alternative approach to citiesedit theres been more than one discussion about which cities should be included in this template generally the approach has been to set a cutoff on absolute population ie ≥ 10000 or 30000 etc i suggest instead that the important limitation here is the desired size of the template thus we should cutoff on relative population to maintain a consistentlysized template even through population changes ie link the top 25 most populous in the state it would look like this also keep the metro areas dont keep certain county seats the links to every county get close enough thoughts —mrwojo talk 2354 8 december 2012 utc done —mrwojo talk 2131 16 december 2012 utc somehow despite the discussion on this talk page omak has made it onto this list despite its population of 8466 people is there any justification for this — brianhe talk 1920 5 june 2013 utc deleted omak per earlier consensus — brianhe talk 0057 8 july 2013 utc remove legislative and congressional districtsedit they have their own templates now washington legislative districts and uscongdiststatewa so theres no need to also include them in this very large template as this is widely used i wanted to ask for objections to the removal here on the talk page for a few days before going ahead with it if noone has objected within a week i encourage anyone coming across this to execute the removal jessew the juggling janitor 0609 12 march 2015 utc support removal i mostly edit oregon stuff but ill voice my opinion that overly large templates make my brain melt down ie tldr so any pruning would be welcome valfontis talk 0627 12 march 2015 utc given that it has now been
