the national league nl and american league al with 15 teams in each league the nl and al were formed as separate legal entities in 1876 and 1901 respectively after cooperating but remaining legally separate entities beginning in 1903 the leagues merged into a single organization led by the commissioner of baseball in 20006 the organization also oversees minor league baseball which comprises about 240 teams affiliated with the major league clubs with the world baseball softball confederation mlb manages the international world baseball classic tournament baseballs first professional team was founded in cincinnati in 1869 30 years after abner doubleday supposedly invented the game of baseball the first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another the period before 1920 in baseball was known as the deadball era players rarely hit home runs during this time baseball survived a conspiracy to fix the 1919 world series which came to be known as the black sox scandal the sport rose in popularity in the 1920s and survived potential downturns during the great depression and world war ii shortly after the war baseballs color barrier was broken by jackie robinson the 1950s and 1960s were a time of expansion for the al and nl then new stadiums and artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s home runs dominated the game during the 1990s and media reports began to discuss the use of anabolic steroids among major league players in the mid2000s in 2006 an investigation produced the mitchell report which implicated many players in the use of performanceenhancing substances including at least one player from each team today mlb is composed of 30 teams 29 in the united states and one in canada teams play 162 games each season and five teams in each league advance to a fourround postseason tournament that culminates in the world series a bestofseven championship series between the two league champions that dates to 1903 baseball broadcasts are aired on television radio and the internet throughout north america and in several other

structureedit mlb is governed by the major league baseball constitution this document has undergone several incarnations since its creation in 18768 under the direction of the commissioner of baseball mlb hires and maintains the sports umpiring crews and negotiates marketing labor and television contracts mlb maintains a unique controlling relationship over the sport including most aspects of minor league baseball this is due in large part to the 1922 us supreme court ruling in federal baseball club v national league which held that baseball is not interstate commerce and therefore not subject to federal antitrust law this ruling has been weakened only slightly in subsequent years9 the weakened ruling granted more stability to the owners of teams and has resulted in values increasing at doubledigit rates910 there were several challenges to mlbs primacy in the sport between the 1870s and the federal league in 1916 the last attempt at a new major league was the aborted continental league in 19609 the chief executive of mlb is the commissioner rob manfred the chief operating officer is tony petitti there are five other executives president business and media chief communications officer chief legal officer chief financial officer and chief baseball officer 11 12 the multimedia branch of mlb which is based in manhattan is mlb advanced media this branch oversees mlbcom and each of the 30 teams websites its charter states that mlb advanced media holds editorial independence from the league but it is under the same ownership group and revenuesharing plan mlb productions is a similarly structured wing of the league focusing on video and traditional broadcast media mlb also owns 67 percent of mlb network with the other 33 percent split between several cable operators and satellite provider directv13 it operates out of studios in secaucus new jersey and also has editorial independence from the league14 league organizationedit in 1920 the weak national commission which had been created to manage relationships between the two leagues was replaced with the much more powerful commissioner of baseball who had the power to make decisions for all of professional baseball unilaterally15 for 60 years the american and national leagues fielded eight teams apiece in the 1960s mlb expansion added eight teams including the first nonus team the montreal expos two teams the seattle mariners and the toronto blue jays were also added in the 1970s from 1969 through 1993 each league consisted of an east and west division a third division the central division was added in each league in 1994 through 1996 the two leagues met on the field only during the world series and the allstar game regularseason interleague play was introduced in 199716 in march 1995 two new franchises—the arizona diamondbacks and tampa bay devil rays now known simply as the tampa bay rays—were awarded by mlb to begin play in 1998 this addition brought the total number of franchises to 30 in early 1997 mlb decided to assign one new team to each league tampa bay joined the al and arizona joined the nl the original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league 15 per league with 5 in each division in order for every team to be able to play daily this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the entire season however it was unclear at the time if interleague play would continue after the 1998 season as it had to be approved by the players union for this and other reasons it was decided that both leagues should continue to have an even number of teams one existing club would have to switch leagues the milwaukee brewers agreed in november 1997 to move from the al to the nl thereby making the nl a 16team league17 later when the houston astros changed ownership prior to the 2013 season the team moved from the nl central to the al west1819 resulting in both leagues having three divisions of five teams each and allowing all teams to have a more balanced schedule18 interleague play is now held throughout the season18 in 2000 the al and nl were dissolved as legal entities and mlb became a single overall league de jure similar to the national football league nfl national basketball association nba and national hockey league nhl—albeit with two components called leagues instead of conferences the same rules and regulations are used in both leagues with one exception the al operates under the designated hitter rule while the nl does not20 this difference in rules between leagues is unique to mlb the other sports leagues of

franchise see respective team articles for more information historyedit main article history of baseball in the united states foundingedit in the 1860s aidedhow by the civil war new yorkstyle baseball expanded into a national game and spawned baseballs first governing body the national association of base ball players the nabbp existed as an amateur league for 12 years by 1867 more than 400 clubs were members most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern us for professional baseballs founding year mlb uses the year 1869—when the first professional team the cincinnati red stockings was established51 a schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers after the founding of the cincinnati club the nabbp split into an amateur organization and a professional organization the national association of professional base ball players often known as the national association na was formed in 187152 its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years53 the modern chicago cubs and atlanta braves franchises trace their histories back to the national association of professional base ball players in the 1870s54 in 1876 the national league of professional base ball clubs later known as the national league or nl was established after the na proved ineffective the league placed its emphasis on clubs rather than on players clubs could now enforce player contracts preventing players from jumping to higherpaying clubs clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship which happened frequently under the na a concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games which was leaving the validity of results in doubt the first game in the nl—on saturday april 22 1876 at the jefferson street grounds philadelphia—is often pointed to as the beginning of mlb255 national league baltimore orioles 1896 the early years of the nl were tumultuous with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated reserve clause which restricted the free movement of players between clubs competitor leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly the most successful was the american association 1882–1891 sometimes called the beer and whiskey league for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators for several years the nl and american association champions met in a postseason championship series—the first attempt at a world series the two leagues merged in 1892 as a single 12team nl but the nl dropped four teams after the 1899 season this led to the formation of the american league in 1901 under al president ban johnson and the resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contractbreaking and legal disputes the war between the al and nl caused shock waves throughout the baseball world at a meeting at the leland hotel in chicago in 1901 the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence a new national association was formed to oversee these minor leagues56 while the na continues to this day known as minor league baseball at the time ban johnson saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might expand in other territories and threaten his leagues dominance after 1902 the nl al and na signed a new national agreement which tied independent contracts to the reserveclause contracts the agreement also set up a formal classification system for minor leagues the forerunner of todays system that was refined by branch rickey57 several other early defunct baseball leagues are officially considered major leagues and their statistics and records are included with those of the two current major leagues these include the aa the union association 188458 the players league 189059 and the federal league 1914–19156061 both the ua and aa are considered major leagues by many baseball researcherswho because of the perceived high caliber of play and the number of star players featured some researchers including nate silver dispute the majorleague status of the ua by pointing out that franchises came and went and that the st louis club was deliberately stacked the st louis club was owned by the leagues president and it was the only club that was close to majorleague caliber62 deadball eraedit main article deadball era cy young 1911 baseball card the period between 1900 and 1919 is commonly referred to as the deadball era games of this era tended to be low scoring and were often dominated by pitchers such as walter johnson cy young christy mathewson mordecai brown and grover cleveland alexander the term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself the baseball used american rather than the modern australian wool yarn and was not wound as tightly affecting the distance that it would travel63 more significantly balls were kept in play until they were mangled soft and sometimes lopsided during this era a baseball cost three dollars equal to 4144 today in inflationadjusted us dollars and owners were reluctant to purchase new balls fans were expected to throw back fouls and rare home runs baseballs also became stained with tobacco juice grass and mud and sometimes the juice of licorice which some players would chew for the purpose of discoloring the ball64 also pitchers could manipulate the ball through the use of the spitball in 1921 use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a grandfather clause additionally many ballparks had large dimensions such as the west side grounds of the chicago cubs which was 560 feet 170 m to the center field fence and the huntington avenue grounds of the boston red sox which was 635 feet 194 m to the center field fence thus home runs were rare and small ball tactics such as singles bunts stolen bases and the hitandrun play dominated the strategies of the time65 hitting methods like the baltimore chop were used to increase the number of infield singles66 on a successful baltimore chop the batter hits the ball forcefully into the ground causing it to bounce so high that the batter reaches first base before the ball can be fielded and thrown to the first baseman67 the adoption of the foul strike rule in the early twentieth century quickly sent baseball from a highscoring game to one where scoring runs became a struggle prior to the institution of this rule foul balls were not counted as strikes a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him this gave an enormous advantage to the batter in 1901 the nl adopted the foul strike rule and the al followed suit in 190368 after the 1919 world series between the chicago white sox and cincinnati reds baseball was rocked by allegations of a game fixing scheme known as the black sox scandal eight players—joe jackson eddie cicotte claude lefty williams george buck weaver arnold chick gandil fred mcmullin charles swede risberg and oscar happy felsch—intentionally lost the world series in exchange for a ring worth 100000 106470588 in 2016 dollars69 despite being acquitted all were permanently banned from major league baseball70 rise in popularityedit baseballs popularity increased in the 1920s and 1930s the 1920 season was notable for the death of ray chapman of the cleveland indians chapman who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later became the only mlb player to die of an onfield injury a tragedy which led directly to both leagues requiring the placing into play new white baseballs whenever a ball became scuffed or dirty helping bring the deadball era to an end the following year the new york yankees made their first world series appearance71 by the end of the 1930s the team had appeared in 11 world series winning eight of them72 yankees slugger babe ruth had set the single season home run record in 1927 hitting 60 home runs a few years earlier ruth had set the same record with 29 home runs73 affected by the difficulties of the great depression baseballs popularity had begun a downward turn in the early 1930s by 1932 only two mlb teams turned a profit attendance had fallen due at least in part to a 10 federal amusement tax added to baseball ticket prices baseball owners cut their rosters from 25 men to 23 men and even the best players took pay cuts team executives were innovative in their attempts to survive creating night games broadcasting games live by radio and rolling out promotions such as free admission for women throughout the period of the great depression no mlb teams moved or folded74 world war ii eraedit the onset of world war ii created a significant shortage of professional baseball players as more than 500 men left mlb teams to serve in the military many of them played on service baseball teams that entertained military personnel in the us or in the pacific mlb teams of this time largely consisted of young men older players and those with a military classification of 4f indicating mental physical or moral unsuitability for service men like pete gray a onearmed outfielder got the chance to advance to the major leagues however mlb rosters did not include any black players through the end of the war75 black players many of whom served in the war were still restricted to playing negro league baseball76 wartime blackout restrictions designed to keep outdoor lighting at low levels caused another problem for baseball these rules limited traveling and night games to the point that the 1942 season nearly had to be canceled76 on january 14 1942 mlb commissioner kenesaw mountain landis wrote a letter to us president franklin d roosevelt and pleaded for the continuation of baseball during the war in hopes for a start of a new major league season president roosevelt responded i honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going there will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours and harder than ever before and that means that they ought to have a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than before77 with the approval of president roosevelt spring training began in 1942 with few repercussions the war interrupted the careers of stars including stan musial bob feller ted williams and joe dimaggio but baseball clubs continued to field their teams78 breaking the color barrieredit main article baseball color line branch rickey president and general manager of the brooklyn dodgers began making efforts to introduce a black baseball player to the previously allwhite professional baseball leagues in the mid1940s he selected jackie robinson from a list of promising negro league players after obtaining a commitment from robinson to turn the other cheek to any racial antagonism directed at him rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for 600 a month in what was later referred to as the noble experiment robinson was the first black baseball player in the international league since the 1880s joining the dodgers farm club the montreal royals for the 1946 season79 the following year the dodgers called robinson up to the major leagues on april 15 1947 robinson made his major league debut at ebbets field before a crowd of 26623 spectators including more than 14000 black patrons black baseball fans began flocking to see the dodgers when they came to town abandoning the negro league teams that they had followed exclusively robinsons promotion met a generally positive although mixed reception among newspaper writers and white major league players manager leo durocher informed his team i do not care if the guy is yellow or black or if he has stripes like a fuckin zebra im the manager of this team and i say he plays whats more i say he can make us all rich and if any of you cannot use the money i will see that you are all traded80 after a strike threat by some players nl president ford frick and baseball commissioner happy chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended robinson received significant encouragement from several major league players including dodgers teammate pee wee reese who said you can hate a man for many reasons color is not one of them81 that year robinson won the inaugural major league baseball rookie of the year award separate nl and al rookie of the year honors were not awarded until 194982 less than three months later larry doby became the first africanamerican to break the color barrier in the american league with the cleveland indians83 the next year a number of other black players entered the major leagues satchel paige was signed by the indians and the dodgers added star catcher roy campanella and don newcombe who was later the first winner of the cy young award for his outstanding pitching84 ban on womenedit main article women in baseball major league baseball banned the signing of women to contracts in 1952 but that ban was lifted in 199285 as of 2017 there have been no female professional players in the mlb expanding west south and northedit main article major league baseball relocation of 1950s–1960s dodger stadium in 2007 from 1903 to 1953 the two major leagues consisted of two eightteam leagues the 16 teams were located in ten cities all in the northeastern and midwestern united states new york city had three teams and boston chicago philadelphia and st louis each had two teams st louis was the southernmost and westernmost city with a major league team the longest possible road trip from boston to st louis took about 24 hours by railroad in 1953 the nls boston braves became the milwaukee braves in 1954 the st louis browns became the baltimore orioles in 1955 the philadelphia athletics became the kansas city athletics baseball experts consider the brooklynlos angeles dodgers boss walter omalley to be perhaps the most influential owner of baseballs early expansion era86 before the 1958 major league baseball season he moved the brooklyn dodgers to los angeles87 when omalley moved the dodgers from brooklyn he appeared on the cover of time88 omalley was also influential in persuading the rival new york giants to move west to become the san francisco giants the giants were already suffering from slumping attendance records at their aging ballpark the polo grounds had the dodgers moved out west alone the st louis cardinals—1600 mi 2575 km away8990—would have been the closest nl team the joint move made west coast road trips economical for visiting teams91 omalley invited san francisco mayor george christopher to new york to meet with giants owner horace stoneham91 stoneham was considering moving the giants to minnesota92 but he was convinced to join omalley on the west coast at the end of 1957 the meetings between stoneham christopher and omalley occurred against the wishes of ford frick the commissioner of baseball93 the dual moves were successful for both franchises—and for mlb87 the dodgers set a singlegame mlb attendance record in their first home appearance with 78672 fans91 in 1961 the first washington senators franchise moved to minneapolis–st paul to become the minnesota twins two new teams were added to the american league at the same time the los angeles angels who soon moved from downtown la to nearby anaheim and a new washington senators franchise the nl added the houston astros and the new york mets in 1962 the astros known as the colt 45s during their first three seasons became the first southern major league franchise since the louisville colonels folded in 1899 and the first franchise to be located along the gulf coast the mets established a reputation for futility by going 40–120 during their first season of play in the nations media capital—and by playing only a little better in subsequent campaigns—but in their eighth season 1969 the mets became the first of the 1960s expansion teams to play in the postseason culminating in a world series title over the heavily favored baltimore orioles in 1966 the major leagues moved to the deep south when the braves moved to atlanta in 1968 the kansas city athletics moved west to become the oakland athletics in 1969 the american and national leagues both added two expansion franchises the american league added the seattle pilots who became the milwaukee brewers after one disastrous season in seattle and the kansas city royals the nl added the first canadian franchise the montreal expos as well as the san diego padres in 1972 the second washington senators moved to the dallas–fort worth metroplex to become the texas rangers in 1977 baseball expanded again adding a second canadian team the toronto blue jays as well as the seattle mariners subsequently no new teams were added until the 1990s and no teams moved until 2005 in 1993 the nl added the florida marlins in the miami area and the colorado rockies in denver in 1998 the brewers switched leagues by joining the national league and two new teams were added the nls arizona diamondbacks in phoenix and the american leagues tampa bay devil rays in st petersburg florida after the 2001 season the team owners voted in favor of contraction several mlb teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about contraction but the montreal expos and the minnesota twins were the two teams that came closest to folding under the plan plans for mlb contraction were halted when the twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that required the team to play its 2002 home games at their stadium mlb owners agreed to hold off on reducing the leagues size until at least 200694 the montreal expos became the first franchise in over three decades to move when they became the washington nationals in 2005 this move left canada with just one team but it also returned baseball to the united states capital city after a 33year absence this franchise shift like many previous ones involved baseballs return to a city which had been previously abandoned not counting the shortlived federal league montreal is the only city granted an mlb franchise since 1901 that does not currently host a team pitching dominance and rule changesedit graph showing by year the average number of runs per mlb game by the late 1960s the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers in 1968—later nicknamed the year of the pitcher95—boston red sox player carl yastrzemski won the american league batting title with an average of just 301 the lowest in the history of major league baseball96 detroit tigers pitcher denny mclain won 31 games making him the only pitcher to win 30 games in a season since dizzy dean in 193497 st louis cardinals starting pitcher bob gibson achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an era of just 11298 following these pitching performances in december 1968 the mlb playing rules committee voted to reduce the strike zone from knees to shoulders to top of knees to armpits and lower the pitchers mound from 15 to 10 inches beginning in the 1969 season99 in 1973 the american league which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the national league sought to increase scoring even further by initiating the designated hitter dh rule100 new stadiums and artificial surfacesedit throughout the 1960s and 1970s as baseball expanded nfl football had been surging in popularity making it economical for many of these cities to build multipurpose stadiums instead of singlepurpose baseball fields because of climate and economic issues many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from artificial turf as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football101 this often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more foul territory than older stadiums these characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball putting a higher premium on speed and defense over homerun hitting power since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs teams began to be built around pitching—particularly their bullpens—and speed on the basepaths artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker and bounced higher so it became easier to hit ground balls in the hole between the corner and middle infielders starting pitchers were no longer expected to throw complete games it was enough for a starter to go 6–7 innings and turn the game over to the teams closer a position which grew in importance over these decades as stolen bases increased home run totals dropped after willie mays hit 52 home runs in 1965 only one player george foster reached that mark until the 1990s power ageedit routinely in the late 1990s and early 2000s baseball players hit 40 or 50 home runs in a season a feat that was considered rare even in the 1980s it has since become apparent that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using steroids and other performanceenhancing drugs uniformsedit main articles major league baseball uniforms and baseball uniform a baseball team and its uniforms in the 1870s note that the team is integrated in contrast to 20th century mlb which was segregated until 1947 a baseball uniform is a type of uniform worn by baseball players and by some nonplaying personnel such as field managers and coaches it is worn to indicate the persons role in the game and—through the use of logos colors and numbers—to identify the teams and their players managers and coaches102 traditionally home uniforms display the team name on the front while away uniforms display the teams home location in modern times however exceptions to this pattern have become common with teams using their team name on both uniforms103 most teams also have one or more alternate uniforms usually consisting of the primary or secondary team color on the vest instead of the usual white or gray103 in the past few decades throwback uniforms have become popular104 the new york knickerbockers were the first baseball team to use uniforms taking the field on april 4 1849 in pants made of blue wool white flannel shirts jerseys and straw hats105106107 caps and other types of headgear have been a part of baseball uniforms from the beginning108109 baseball teams often wore fullbrimmed straw hats or no cap at all since there was no official rule regarding headgear110 under the 1882 uniform rules players on the same team wore uniforms of different colors and patterns that indicated which position they played111 in the late 1880s the detroit wolverines and washington nationals of the national league and the brooklyn bridegrooms of the american association were the first to wear striped uniforms112 by the end of the 19th century teams began the practice of having two different uniforms one for when they played at home in their own baseball stadium and a different one for when they played away on the road at the other teams ballpark103 it became common to wear white pants with a white color vest at home and gray pants with a gray or solid dark colored vest when away103 by 1900 both home and away uniforms were standard across the major leagues113 season structureedit main article major league baseball schedule spring trainingedit main article spring training a grapefruit league game at the former los angeles dodgers camp in vero beach florida spring training is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the regular season spring training allows new players to audition for roster and position spots and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play the teams are divided into the cactus league114 and the grapefruit league115 spring training has always attracted fan attention drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play and spring training usually coincides with spring break for many college students autograph seekers also find greater access to players during spring training spring training typically lasts almost two months starting in mid february and running until just before the season opening day traditionally the first week of april as pitchers benefit from a longer training period pitchers and catchers begin spring training several days before the rest of the team116 regular seasonedit the current mlb regular season consisting of 162 games per team typically begins on the first sunday in april and ends on the first sunday in october each teams schedule is typically organized into threegame series with occasional two or fourgame series117 postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc onegame or fivegame series a teams series are organized into homestands and road trips that group multiple series together teams generally play games five to seven days per week commonly having monday or thursday as an off day frequently games are scheduled at night sunday games are generally played during the afternoon allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior to a monday night game in addition teams will play day games frequently on opening day holidays and getaway days each team plays 19 games against each of its four divisional opponents it plays one home series and one away series amounting to six or seven games against the 10 other teams in its league a team also plays one of the divisions in the other league rotating each year with two opponents in a threegame home series two in a threegame away series and one with four games split between home and away furthermore each team has an interleague natural rival in many cases its counterpart in the same metro area with which it plays two home games and two away games each year with an odd number of teams in each league 15 it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague play for most days in the season except when two or more teams have a day off each team plays 20 interleague games throughout the season usually with just one interleague game per day but for one weekend in late may all teams will participate in an interleague series use of the dh rule is determined by the home teams league rules before 2013 interleague play was structured differently there would be one weekend in midmay and another period consisting typically of the last twothirds of june in which all teams played interleague games save for two nl teams each day and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates before 2013 seasonlong interleague play was not necessary because each league had an even number of teams in 2013 the houston astros moved to the american league so that each league would have 15 teams118 over the course of a season teams compete for one of the five playoff berths in their league they can win one of these berths by either winning their division or by capturing a wild card spot119 after the conclusion of the 162game season an additional tiebreaking game or games may be needed to determine postseason participation120

point of the season the major league baseball allstar game is held during a fourday break from the regularseason schedule the allstar game features a team of players from the american league al—led by the manager of the previous al world series team—and a team of players from the national league nl similarly managed in an exhibition game from 1959 to 1962 two games were held each season one was held in july and one was held in august the designatedhitter rule was used in the allstar game for the first time in 1989 following games used a dh when the game was played in an al ballpark since 2010 the dh rule has been in effect regardless of venue121 the first official allstar game was held as part of the 1933 worlds fair in chicago illinois and was the idea of arch ward then sports editor for the chicago tribune122 initially intended to be a onetime event its great success resulted in making the game an annual one wards contribution was recognized by major league baseball in 1962 with the creation of the arch ward trophy given to the allstar games most valuable player each year123 in 1970 it was renamed the commissioners trophy until 1985 when the name change was reversed in 2002 it was renamed the ted williams most valuable player award beginning in 1947 the eight position players in each teams starting lineup have been voted into the game by fans124 the fan voting was discontinued after a 1957 ballotboxstuffing scandal in cincinnati seven of the eight slots originally went to reds players two of whom were subsequently removed from the lineup to make room for willie mays and hank aaron fan voting was reinstated in 1970 and has continued ever since including internet voting in recent years the 2002 contest in milwaukee controversially ended in an 11inning tie when both managers ran out of pitchers in response starting in 2003 the league which wins the allstar game received homefield advantage in the world series the league champion hosted the first two games at its own ballpark as well as the last two if necessary the national league did not win an allstar game and thus gain homefield advantage until 2010 it was able to overcome this disadvantage and win in three of the seven world series from 2003 to 2009125126 this was discontinued after the 2016 season mlb allstars from both leagues have worn their team uniforms at the game with one exception in the 1933 allstar game the national league allstar team members wore special gray uniforms with national league written in navy blue letters across the front of the jersey127128 postseasonedit main article

former senate majority leader george mitchell was appointed by selig on march 30 2006142 to investigate the use of performanceenhancing drugs in mlb the appointment was made after several influential

selig said i havent seen the report yet but im proud i did it144145 the report said that after mandatory random testing began in 2004 hgh treatment for athletic enhancement became popular among players as hgh is not detectable in tests it pointed out that hgh is likely a placebo with no performanceenhancing effects146 the report included substance use allegations against at least one player from each mlb team147 according to espn some people questioned whether mitchells director role with the boston red sox created a conflict of interest especially because no prime sox players were in the report148 the report named several prominent yankees who were parts of world series clubs there is a longrunning and fierce yankees–red sox rivalry former us prosecutor john m dowd brought up mitchells conflict of interest149 but he later said that the former senator had done a good job150 mitchell acknowledged that his tight relationship with major league baseball left him open to
