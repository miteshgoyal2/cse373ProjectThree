tiscali aol talktalk plusnet o2 and orange since most broadband connections in the uk are provided by adsl and the quality of individual phone lines varies according to distance from exchange41 most landline broadband services are marketed as being the maximum speed that the individuals phone line will support up to 8mb as a result actual speeds obtained vary greatly but are always constrained by the individual phone line – the quality of which is out of the control of the broadband provider cable broadband has no such speed variability caused by connection quality as the network is fully owned and controlled by the cable company providing the broadband – any slowdowns are wholly as a result of traffic shaping or local capacity being oversold or oversubscribed for this reason the

acting virgin ceo neil berkett sparked controversy when he told television a magazine published by the royal television society this net neutrality thing is a load of bollocks according to the journalist he claimed that any video content provider that refused to pay virgin media a premium for faster access would have to get stuck in bus lanes having their content delivered to end users at much slower speeds than that of paying content providers94 there has been widespread criticism of this policy expressed on the internet large internet communities are requesting that virgin customers end their subscription and initiate a mass boycott95 according to virgin media the comments in the article were taken out of context and misinterpreted96 a statement released by the company states with virgin media rolling out a 50mb service later this year we are uniquely equipped to cope with the demand for new bandwidthhungry services we strongly support the principle that the internet should remain a space that is open to all and we have not called for content providers to pay for distribution however we recognise that as more customers turn to the web for content different providers will have different needs and priorities and in the long term its legitimate to question how this demand will be managed we welcome an informed debate on this issue crackdown on illegal filesharing of copyrighted materialedit on 2 april 2008 the daily telegraph reported that virgin media would be beginning a trial to take action against subscribers who are illegally downloading copyrighted material from internet peertopeer p2p services information of offenders would be provided by the british phonographic industry and then virgin media and the bpi sends a warning letter to the customer9798 virgin media and the bpi denied reports of any agreement or pilot scheme and said they were only in talks on the matter99 however at least one person claimed to have received a letter threatening disconnection100 although the uk government backed plans to ban p2p users from the internet it may soon be overturned by strong condemnation from the european parliament on the grounds of privacy issues and the importance of internet access101 in july 2008 the bbc reported that 800 virgin media customers who the bpi claim are sharing copyrighted files were sent warning letters in envelopes marked if you dont read this your broadband connection could be disconnected at least one recipient of the letter denied any wrongdoing by any authorised user of his broadband connection102 on 26 november 2009 it was revealed that virgin media would trial deep packet inspection technology to measure the level of illegal file sharing on its network103 the cview system provided by detica will look at traffic and identify the peertopeer packets it will then peer inside those packets and try to determine what is licensed and what is unlicensed based on data provided by the record industry the trial – which has no scheduled end date – will cover about 40 of virgin medias network but those involved will not be informed virgin media emphasised that it is seeking to measure the overall level of illegal file sharing not to keep records on individual customers data on the level of copyright infringement will be aggregated and anonymised on 22 january 2010 the european commission confirmed that although it had not discussed the matter with virgin media it would closely monitor the trial104 privacy international announced that it would press a criminal complaint with the metropolitan police because it argued that under the privacy and electronic communications ec directive regulations pecr and the regulation of investigatory powers act ripa as well as the european eprivacy directive interception and processing of communications requires either explicit informed consent from all parties or a warrant on 3 may 2012 it was reported that virgin media had become the first isp in the uk to implement a web filter to block access to the pirate bay in compliance with a uk high court order in april105 although there continues to be a great number of mirrors proxies or vpns so this has proved unsuccessful106 data pimpingedit in early 2008 it was announced that the isp arm of virgin media had entered into a contract along with bt and talktalk with the former spyware company phorm responsible under their 121media guise for the apropos rootkit107108 to intercept and analyse their users clickstream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of phorms oix advertising service109110 the practice which has become known as data pimping came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interested parties who believe that the interception of data is illegal under uk law ripa111112 at a more fundamental level many have argued that the isps and phorm have no right to sell a commodity a users data to which they have no claim of ownership though phorm initially claimed virgin media had signed an exclusive contract and were committed to implementing phorms webwise tracking system virgin media have since distanced themselves from this and now state that they have only signed a preliminary contract with phorm to better understand the tracking technology and are under no obligation to implement it113 reports on the guardian website in may 2008 suggested virgin media may be further distancing themselves from the controversial system114 wikipedia censorshipedit main article internet watch foundation and wikipedia in december 2008 virgin media was one of several isps in the uk to attempt to censor its users access to the wikipedia article about the 1976 album virgin killer by stadium rock band scorpions115 the
