dedicated dancing the dream with love to his mother katherine and has an introduction written by his longtime friend elizabeth taylor12 the volume consists of 46 pieces of poetry and essays the subjects jackson writes about are primarily children animals and the environment for example one specific poem titled look again baby seal promotes environmentalism as jackson imagines anthropomorphic seals who brood about the fate of being killed by hunters another poem so the elephants march presents elephants that refuse to be killed in order for ivory pieces to be made from their tusks a third piece mother earth describes a struggle to cope with the discovery of an oilcovered seagull feather to stress the theme of environmentalism and the necessity for action jackson writes in the essay weve been treating mother earth the way some people treat a rental apartment just trash it and move on1 jackson also writes about the degree to which the 1990 death of aids sufferer ryan white affected him in a poem titled after the youth and as he presents in the poem jackson believes the teenage boy suffered through general ignorance of the disease13 the poem mother was written for his mother katherine whom jackson loved deeply4 in one stanza jackson writes no matter where i go from hereyoure in my heart mother dear4 the poem had previously been published by his mother in her 1990 autobiography my family and was not the only material in dancing the dream to have appeared elsewhere the poems dancing the dream titled as the dance and planet earth were included in the sleeve notes for jacksons 1991 dangerous album and in its 2001 special edition rerelease furthermore the lyrics to the songs will you be there and heal the world—also from the 1991 album—were included in dancing the dream4 a spoken version of the poem planet earth was featured on the 2009 posthumous album this is it dancing the dream includes approximately 100 photographs although the volume was promoted to include previously unreleased photographs of jackson some of the photographs had been previously published such as those that were published in the 1985 jackson calendar and others that had been published in magazines such as ebony and people furthermore the volume included photographs converted from stills of jacksons music videos black or white 1991 and remember the time 1992 in addition to images of his 1991 performance at mtvs tenth anniversary celebration1 jackson commissioned artwork for dancing the dream from nate giorgio and david nordahl whom jackson met in the 1980s and subsequently developed a professional relationship5 publication historyedit dancing the dream was first published on june 18 1992 by doubleday6 it followed jacksons 1988 autobiography moonwalk which was also published by the american company prior to publication dancing the dream was hailed by the publishers as being a book that would take us deep into jacksons heart and soul as well as an inspirational and passionate volume of unparalleled humanity789 in his only interview to promote dancing the dream jackson described the book as being just a verbal expression of what i usually express through my music and my dance10 after his death on june 25 2009 the british company transworld reissued the book the following month on july 27 200911 firstprinting numbers for dancing the dream were not issued by doubleday a representative for the firm marly rusoff however revealed in march 1993 that the company shipped 133000 copies of the book and took around 80000 returns and 3000 reorders thus the project was close to 60 down in total sales rusoff stated that the commercial performance of dancing the dream was low because an anticipated jackson tour of the united states never occurred he commented the reviews—and there were some—were rather discouraging he did do a europe tour and the british edition did quite well this kind of book depends on celebrity visibility12 suzanne mantell of publishers weekly listed jacksons book as one among several that were published with great hype and hope and fell far short of the publishers expectations using the rule of thumb that hardcover returns in the 20 to 30 range are acceptable in the 30 to 50 range very high and 50 or more a disaster most of the books listed performed poorly even if they somehow managed to recoup their costs and even make an impact on the bottom line12 mantell felt that dancing the dream did not create the important buzz that gives a book a life and saves it from cultural oblivion jackson may draw an audience of 65 million when he appears on oprah but the consensus among booksellers is that bookbuyers dont care and that this one was a dog12 during a simulchat in 1995 michael jackson stated i wrote a book called dancing the dream it was more autobiographical than moonwalk which i did with mrs onassis it wasnt full of gossip and scandal and all that trash that people write so i dont think people paid much attention to it but it came from my heart it was essays thoughts and things that ive thought about while on tour 13 poemsedit dancing the dream planet earth magical child part 1 wings
