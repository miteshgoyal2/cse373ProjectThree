other english speaking countries salvadorian and salvadorean in their respectable spelling and pronunciation can be seen in most restaurant and other el salvador related signs in the us and else where

march rally photograph by lorie shaull the first salvadorians that came to the united states before the war began arrived mostly to san francisco where they worked as shipyard employees in the early twentieth century4 these were mostly working class salvadorans as salvadorans from the middle and upper classes came to the us for education or residence in the early 1900s usually in the east coast salvadorans that came during this period were mostly economic migrants as el salvador was affected by economic turmoil during the great depression and slow growth after world war ii ended in the 1960s and early 1970s most of the immigrants were women and found work being housekeepers or in childcare5 documented salvadorans in the united states 193019706 years of salvadorans entering the us 19311940 673 19411950 5132 19511960 5895 19611970 14992 while salvadoran migration to the us remained low throughout the first several decades in the 20th century it spiked on the onset of the salvadoran civil war where many fled to the united states seeking sanctuary from the devastation that plagued the country many salvadoran refugees came to the city of los angeles where today holds the largest population of salvadorans in the country a large population of salvadorans also arrived in washington dc where by 1989 an estimated 150000 salvadorans reside in the nation’s capital7 it is important to note that many salvadorans came undocumented and applied for asylum andor work permits in order to legalize their situation this massive migration to the us was a result of the political violence as much as it was the deteriorating economic conditions in el salvador8 young men escaping the country from being drafted to the military or the guerilla made the majority of these immigrantsrefugees in comparison to their rural working class and often illegal counterparts migrating to los angeles washington dc and houston wealthy salvadorans also found refuge in the us migrating to coral gables and key biscayne in miami9 they numbered over 1000 individuals and many of them are temporary exiles who planned to go back after the war ends by the end of 1989 more than 250000 salvadorans migrated to the us unofficially there were 1 million salvadorans that came to the us many of them illegally10 documented salvadorans in the united states 197120006 years of salvadorans entering the us 19711980 34436 19811990 213539 19912000 215798 half or more of the refugees—between 500000 and one million—immigrated to the united states which was home to less than 10000 salvadorans before 196011 el salvadors exiled population is already changing life at home through its influence and its dollars and will undoubtedly play an important role in its future history salvadoran american immigration has changed the face of foreign affairs in the united states the flood of refugees from a ussupported government forced a national rethinking of foreign policy priorities this in turn transformed the nature of american support for the salvadoran government and may have helped to end the war in el salvador salvadoran americans are at the center of an ongoing national debate about us responsibility toward the worlds refugees and the future of immigration in general exodus immigration 1980sedit the exodus of salvadorans was a result of both economic and political problems the largest immigration wave occurred as a result of the salvadoran civil war in the 1980s in which 2030 of el salvadors population emigrated about 50 percent or up to 500000 of those who escaped the country headed to the us which was already home to over 10000 salvadorans making salvadorans americans the thirdlargest hispanic and latino american group after the mexican american majority and cubans when not including stateside puerto ricans salvadorans however are predicted to replace cubans as the largest population by the next census the number of salvadoran immigrants in the united states continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of family reunification and new arrivals fleeing a series of natural disasters that hit el salvador including earthquakes and hurricanes gang warfare which made el salvador one of the dangerous countries in the world also contributed to the surge of immigrants seeking asylum in the late part of the 2000s and the first four years in the 2010 decade12 by 2008 there were about 11 million salvadoran immigrants in the united states salvadorans are the countrys fifth largest immigrant group after mexican filipino indian and chinese foreign born the immigrant population from this tiny central american country is now nearly as large as the immigrant population from much larger china as reference chinas total population is 200 times larger and its territory is about 500 times larger than el salvadors 13 languageedit linguistic variations of classic central american spanish like most countries of the isthmus salvadoran spanish uses voseo in the us salvadorans speak both english and spanish but their use varies recent immigrants and older generations tend to speak spanish exclusively while the newer generations descendants of immigrants learn spanish as a first language only to become fluent in english when they start school according to the american community survey of 2004 52 percent of salvadorans only speak english at home the lowest compared to other immigrant populations the percentage of “nonenglish at home english spoken “very well” is at 362 the third lowest after the guatemalans and the hondurans salvadorans speak spanish in a medieval voseo speech form equivalent to thou making them the largest voseo spanish speakers in the united states salvadoran spanish is one of the largest types of spanish spoken in the united states in washington dc salvadoran spanish is the largest type of spanish spoken and it’s the only city in the us where salvadoran spanish is the first types of spanish spoken while in los angeles salvadoran spanish is the second type of spanish spoken salvadoran voseo spanish and salvadoran slang called salvadoran caliche is a source of identity and virility to salvadoran american youth it also creates a kinship with other central american groups especially hondurans salvadoran spanish holds many native american indigenous dialects from the lenca and pipil language that have survived in salvadoran spanish in the study voseo to tuteo accommodation among two salvadoran communities in the united states by travis doug sorenson sorenson compared two salvadoran communities houston and washington dc on the way they maintain the use of voseo in the us where the tuteo form is most widely spoken14 his research found that while salvadorans are the majority of the hispanic population in washington dc they use the voseo form as much as their counterparts in houston a city with a large mexican population that used the tuteo form instead the hypothesis that salvadorans participants in washington would significantly retain more voseo than their compatriots in houston was wrong14 religious affiliationedit the emblematic and iconic image of jesus christ standing on top of terra as seen in the monumento al divino salvador del mundo is the most important symbol for salvadorans who are mostly of christian religions jesus who is el salvadorthe savior is the patron of el salvador country which is named after the messiah himself reflecting the country itself most salvadorans are christian traditionally salvadorans are roman catholics but since the civil war there is a huge increase of evangelicals or other protestant denominations in the country1516 some salvadoran americans converted to mormonism or jehovah witness younger generations of salvadoran americans are less likely to practice religion than their parents during the civil war some members of el salvadors small but vibrant jewish community immigrated to the united states17 mostly settling in the miami area

alexandria and arlington in virginia is now referred to as chirilagua due to the many salvadorans living there from that particular town23 salvadorans are the largest immigrant population in washington dc metropolitan area24 there is also a large number in texas esp in houston austin dallas and fort worth texas increasingly new orleans after hurricane katrina in 2005 and in other

within the large salvadoran population38 asylum laws prohibit many salvadorans from renewing their ties to their home culture most asylum seekers cannot visit el salvador even for a loved ones funeral without losing their legal status in the united states thus many the us salvadorans are torn between embracing the culture of the united states and maintaining their salvadoran identities

people from their home country or even their hometown3940 many older immigrants have spent more than ten years in the united states without learning any english although they immigrated largely out of fear rather than a desire for a new life salvadorans in the united states especially the younger generations are gradually becoming anglicized the usborn children of salvadoran refugees or immigrants are becoming more aware of their salvadoran roots even at the behest of their salvadoran born parents41 this is especially true during the 2009 salvadoran presidential elections where the leftist party fmln had its best chance to win for the first time these salvadoran americans raised and taught in the us understand the problems in el salvador is facing and become more proactive on ways to address these issue while conditions have improved in el salvador few refugees have returned home the united states—once a place of refuge—has become a new home for salvadoran immigrants42 to reflect

united states has not yet formed a distinct stereotype of ussalvadorans though because most of the concerns and affairs of salvadorans in the us media point out and focuses generally in the uss proxy war showdown and involvement in the salvadoran civil war legacy salvadorans have settled in neighborhoods already populated by other latin americans and outsiders generally have only a vague sense of the various latino nationalities in those neighborhoods ussalvadorans have sometimes had tense relations with their neighbors in the cities where they are concentrated salvadoran gangs have fought

in legislation regarding their immigration status in the debate leading to the passage of temporary protected status for salvadoran refugees and the extensions of that status salvadoran organizations lobbied politicians and brought their cases of persecution to the press at first refugee organizations were run by americans and salvadorans often appeared in public only with bandannas over their faces gradually salvadorans and other central americans began to take charge of the refugee organizations and assume a higher public profile salvadoran americans have also contributed significantly to labor union activity many refugees fought for the right to organize under repressive conditions in el salvador and they brought dedication even militancy to american unions in a 1990 los angeles

huge loyan fanbase in the united states where salvadoran americans never fail to fill stadiums in us cities to support them most salvadoran americans are not active in or outspoken about salvadoran politics those us organizations most actively involved in salvadoran politics such as the committee in solidarity with the people of el salvador cispes have attracted little participation by salvadoran americans themselves the immigrants own organizations have focused not on politics at home but on relief and jobs in immigrant communities throughout the united states this relative indifference to home politics may be surprising given the political passions that have long raged in el salvador but the majority of salvadoran americans seem interested in putting the hatred of the past behind them while the most ideologically committed of the salvadoran refugees settled in panama nicaragua costa rica australia or canada those who settled in the united states focused on survival and building a community refugees who fled the government and refugees who fled the guerrillas have a lot in common many will not even discuss their political beliefs lest it disrupt the fragile solidarity of the refugee community furthermore many salvadorans on the left became active in politics because of the desperate poverty and class war in el salvador when they arrived in the united states where it seemed for the first time possible to escape poverty through hard work their political commitment sometimes melted away salvadorans outside el salvador are not permitted to cast absentee ballots in that countrys elections the majority of the refugee community is thought to favor the left and the absence of their votes is believed to have helped the rightwing party arena win the salvadoran presidency in 1989 and 199458 the relative lack of political influence among salvadoran americans is not necessarily permanent salvadoran immigrants are densely concentrated in a few cities and they have a strong infrastructure in refugee organizations as more salvadorans become us citizens the immigrant community will probably play a larger role in local and regional politics and given their economic contribution they will almost certainly come to exert more influence in el salvador el salvador and united states relationsedit main article el salvador–united states relations us

plan that will steer the partnership moving forward the recent 2009 elections resulted in the election of the leftist farabundo martí national liberation front fmln party over the arena party that had been in power since 1992 arena supporters argued that the victory of fmln would result in retaliation from the united states and lead to political reforms similar to those in hugo chávez’s venezuela despite the us official neutral position an obama visit to el salvador symbolized its acceptance of the new government and show to other latin american countries that it will maintain strong ties despite the change of regime the shift from arena to fmln does symbolize the growing disenchantment of the salvadoran population with washington foreign policy despite this shift el salvador has not decided to become more selfreliant the economic development it experienced by following the washington consensus was worth the cost of economic reforms because it was able to access the american market and compete in the global market therefore the obama visit validated the stability within el salvador in the transition from arena to fmln and showed other countries in the region the benefits of following the washington consensus obama’s visit was in order to strengthen america’s position in central america and show that countries that follow liberalization reforms enjoy stronger ties with the united states el salvador’s accommodation on economic and militia demand also meant that the united states would provide more benefits to salvadorans living within the united states salvadorans have been eligible to receive tps temporary protection status since 2001 approximately 2 million salvadorans live in the united states making it the sixth largest ethnic group in the united states such a large number of salvadorans means that they have the capacity to send money back to el salvador which would make a very large contribution to its economy remittances from the united states make el salvador more dependent on the united states support for salvadorans living there thus it is imperative that el salvador maintains strong political ties with the american government because of its dependence on remittances remittances account for twenty percent of el salvador’s gross domestic product gdp which makes the economic ties with the united states even more important salvadorans who reside in the united states benefit as well from el salvador’s accommodation as exemplified by the american government’s consistent extension of the tps el salvador has lobbied successfully for those extensions because of the strong ties that have been forged united statesel salvador relations have been a reciprocal relationship in which el salvador has gained much more than if it were to have chosen a resistance strategy thus president obama’s choice to stop in el salvador exemplifies to the salvadoran community in the united states that they have nothing to fear with the change of political parties the special relationship developed between the united states and el salvador in the past 20 years has differentiated el salvador from its neighboring central american countries despite the high level of violence el salvador has transformed itself into a stable democracy and a success story in economic development ussalvadoran relations remain close and strong us policy towards the country promotes the strengthening of el salvadors democratic institutions rule of law judicial reform and civilian police national reconciliation and reconstruction and economic opportunity and growth el salvador has been a committed member of the coalition of nations fighting against terrorism and has sent 10 rotations of troops to iraq to support operation iraqi freedom on
