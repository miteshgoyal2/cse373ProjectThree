content seek consensus on the talk page before making the change open the discussion under a subhead that uses the word era briefly state why the style is inappropriate for the article in question a personal or categorical preference for one era style over the other is not justification for making a change bce and ce or bc and ad are written in upper case unspaced without a period full point and

unit in a parenthetical note or a footnote and link the first occurrence of each unit but not give a conversion every time it occurs converted quantity values should use a level of precision similar to that of the source quantity value so the moon is 380000 kilometres 240000 mi from earth not 236121 mi small numbers may need to be converted to a range where rounding would cause a significant

recommendations when using these prefixes in wikipedia articles following the si standard a lowercase k should be used for kilo whenever it means 1000 in computing contexts whereas a capital k should be used instead to indicate the binary prefix for 1024 according to jedec if under the exceptions detailed further below the article otherwise uses iec prefixes for binary units use ki instead do not assume that the binary or decimal meaning of prefixes will be obvious to everyone explicitly specify the meaning of k and k as well as the primary meaning of m g t etc in an article bdprefix is a convenient helper consistency within each article is desirable but the need for consistency may be balanced with other considerations the definition most relevant to the article should be chosen as primary for that article eg specify a binary definition in an article on ram decimal definition in an article on hard drives bit rates and a binary definition for windows file sizes despite files usually being stored on hard drives where consistency is not possible specify wherever there is a deviation from the primary definition disambiguation should be shown in bytes or bits with clear indication of whether in binary or decimal base there is no preference in the way to indicate the number of bytes and bits but the notation style should be consistent within an article acceptable examples include   •  a 64 mb 64 × 10242byte video card and a 100 gb 100 × 10003byte hard drive   •  a 64 mb 64 × 220byte video card and a 100 gb 100 × 109byte hard drive   •  a 64 mb 67108864byte video card and a 100 gb 100000000000byte hard drive avoid inconsistent combinations such as a 64 mb 67108864byte video card and a 100 gb 100 × 10003byte hard drive footnotes such as those seen in power macintosh 5500 may be used for disambiguation unless explicitly stated otherwise one byte is eight bits see byte § history the iec prefixes kibi symbol ki mebi mi gibi gi etc are generally not to be used except16 when the majority of cited sources on the article topic use iec prefixes in a direct quote using the iec prefixes when explicitly discussing the iec prefixes or in articles in which both types of prefix are used with neither clearly primary or in which converting all quantities to one or the other type would be misleading or lose necessary precision or declaring the actual meaning of a unit on each use would be impractical currencies and monetary valuesedit shortcuts wp wp£ wp€ moscurrency wpcurrency redirects here for the wikiproject focusing on articles about currencies see wikipediawikiproject numismatics see also wikipediawikiproject numismaticsstyle § article titles choice of currency in countryspecific articles such as economy of australia use the

quarters and one penny total six dollars one cent exception where otherwise required as at the start of a sentence or in such forms as australian dollar to pluralize euro use the standard english plurals ten euros and fifty cents not the invariant plurals used for european union legislation and banknotes ten euro and fifty cent for the adjectival form use a hyphenated singular a twoeuro pen and a tencent coin link the first occurrence of lesserknown currencies mongolian tögrögs currency symbols in general the first mention of a particular currency should use its full unambiguous signifier eg a52 with subsequent references using just the appropriate symbol eg 88 unless this would be unclear exceptions in an article referring to multiple currencies represented by the same symbol eg the dollars of the us canada australia new zealand and other countries – see currency symbols § dollar variants use the full signifier eg us a each time except possibly where a particular context makes this both unnecessary and undesirable in articles entirely on eu uk andor usrelated topics all occurrences may be shortened €26 £22 or 34 unless this would be unclear the pound sterling is represented by the £ symbol with one horizontal bar the doublebarred ₤ symbol is ambiguous as it has also been used for the italian lira and other currencies for nonbritish currencies that use pounds or a pound symbol eg the irish pound ir£ use the symbol conventionally preferred for that currency if there is no common english abbreviation or symbol follow the iso 4217 standard see also list of circulating currencies formatting a period full stop is used as the decimal point – never a comma 657 not 657 for the grouping of digits eg £1234567 see § grouping of digits above do not place a currency symbol after the accompanying numeric figures eg 123 123£ 123€ unless that is the normal convention for that symbol when writing in english smaller british coins include 1p 2p and 5p denominations never use forms such as us123 or 123 us currency abbreviations that come before the numeric value are unspaced if they consist of a nonalphabetic symbol only or end in a symbol £123   €123 but spaced if alphabetic r 75 ranges should be expressed giving the currency signifier just once 250–300 not 250–300 million and billion should be spelled out on first use and optionally abbreviated m or bn both unspaced thereafter she received £70 million and her son £10m the schools share was 250–300 million and the charitys 400–450m in general a currency symbol should be accompanied by a numeric amount eg not he converted his us to a but he converted his us dollars to australian dollars or he exchanged the us100 note for australian dollars exceptions may occur in tables and infoboxes where space is limited eg currencies accepted for deposit us sfr gb£ € it may be appropriate to wikilink such uses or add an explanatory note conversions conversions of lessfamiliar currencies may be provided in terms of more familiar currencies – such as the us dollar euro or pound sterling – using an appropriate rate which is often not the current exchange rate conversions should be in parentheses after the original currency rounding to avoid false precision two significant digits is usually sufficient as most exchange rates fluctuate significantly with at least the year given as a rough point of conversion rate reference eg since 2001 the grant has been 10000000 swedish kronor 14m €10m or £800k as of august 2009update not 1390570 €971673 or £848646 for obsolete currencies provide an equivalent formatted as a conversion if possible in the modern replacement currency eg decimal pounds for historical predecimal poundsandshillings or a usdollar
