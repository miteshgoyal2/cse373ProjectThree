monitor is a newspaper that covers international and united states current events the paper includes a daily religious feature on the home forum page but states the publication is not a platform for evangelizing2 in 2008 the monitor discontinued its daily print version to focus on webbased publishing replacing its daily print edition with a weekly news magazine with an international focus3 mark sappenfield became the editor in march of 20174 contents 1 concept and inception 2 later developments 3 notable reporting 4 modernization 5 radio and television 51 monitor channel programs 6 references 7 further reading 8 external links concept and inceptionedit despite its name the monitor does not claim to be a religiousthemed paper and says it does not promote the doctrine of its patron church however at its founder eddys request a daily religious article has appeared in every issue of the monitor eddy also required the inclusion of christian science in the papers name over initial opposition by some of her advisors who thought the religious reference might repel a secular audience2 the monitors inception was in part a response by eddy to the journalism of her day which relentlessly covered the sensations and scandals surrounding her new religion with varying degrees of accuracy in addition joseph pulitzers new york world was consistently critical of eddy and this along with a derogatory article in mcclures furthered eddys decision to found her own media outlet2 eddy also saw a vital need to counteract the fear often spread by media reporting looking over the newspapers of the day one naturally reflects that it is dangerous to live so loaded with disease seems the very air these descriptions carry fears to many minds to be depicted in some future time upon the body a periodical of our own will counteract to some extent this public nuisance for through our paper at the price at which we shall issue it we shall be able to reach many homes with healing purifying thought5 eddy declared that the monitors mission should be to injure no man but to bless all mankind2 later developmentsedit the monitor was for several decades published in broadsheet form but in 1975 switched to tabloid format the papers overall circulation has ranged widely from a peak of over 223000 in 1970 to just under 56000 shortly before the suspension of the daily print edition in 20096 partially in response to declining circulation and the struggle to earn a profit the churchs directors and the manager of the christian science publishing society were purportedly forced to plan cutbacks and closures later denied which led in 1989 to the mass protest resignations by its chief editor kay fanning an asne president and former editor of the anchorage daily news managing editor david anable associate editor david winder and several other newsroom staff these developments also presaged administrative moves to scale back the print newspaper in favor of expansions into radio a magazine shortwave broadcasting and television expenses however rapidly outpaced revenues contradicting predictions by church directors on the brink of bankruptcy the board was forced to close the broadcast programs in 1992 the paper has been known for avoiding sensationalism producing a distinctive brand of nonhysterical journalism78 in 1997 the washington report on middle east affairs a publication critical of united states policy in the middle east praised the monitor for its objective and informative coverage of islam and the middle east9 notable reportingedit monitor staff have been the recipients of seven pulitzer prizes the most recent in 2002 1950 pulitzer prize for international reporting edmund stevens for his series of 43 articles written over a threeyear residence in

after being provided documents by a former iraqi general several news organizations including the monitor reported that george galloway was accused by a us senate committee led by norm coleman of personally profiting from corruption within the united nations oilforfood program the monitor investigated the matter concluding that the documents were almost certainly forgeries and in response to a lawsuit by galloway apologized in court17 in 2006 jill carroll a freelance reporter for the monitor was kidnapped in baghdad and released safely after 82 days although carroll was initially a freelancer the paper worked tirelessly for her release even hiring her as a staff writer shortly after her abduction to ensure that she had financial benefits according to bergenheim18 beginning in august 2006 the monitor published an account19 of carrolls kidnapping and subsequent release with firstperson reporting from carroll and others involved modernizationedit the print edition continued to struggle for readership and in 2004 faced a renewed mandate from the church to earn a profit subsequently the monitor began relying more on the internet as an integral part of its business model the monitor was one of the first newspapers to put its text online in 1996 and was also one of the first to launch a pdf edition in 2001 it was also an early pioneer of rss feeds20 in 2005 richard bergenheim a christian science practitioner was named the new editor shortly before his death in 2008 bergenheim was replaced by a veteran boston globe editor and former monitor reporter john yemma21 in october 2008 citing net losses of us189 million per year versus us125 million in annual revenue the monitor announced that it would cease printing daily and instead print weekly editions starting in april 200922 the last daily print edition was published on march 27 2009 the monitor continues to offer daily news online on its website and via email23 yemma stated that the move to go digital was made because they recognized that the monitors reach would be greater online than in print he has also stated that in the next five years the monitor would work to increase their online readership fivefold from 5 million pageviews to 25 million24 as the paper has turned its attention to online storytelling it has been breaking ground with multimedia projects like little bill clinton a narrative serial following a year in the life of a young refugee the weekly magazine follows on from the monitors london edition also a weekly launched in 1960 and the weekly world edition which replaced the london edition in 197425 radio and televisionedit monitoradio was a radio service produced by the church of christ scientist between 1984 and 1997 it featured several onehour news broadcasts a day as
