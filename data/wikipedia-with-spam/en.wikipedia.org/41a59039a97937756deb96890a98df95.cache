artist celine dion is one of the biggest international stars in music history selling more than 220 million albums worldwide1 adult contemporary music ac is a north american term used to describe a form of radioplayed popular music ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music2 to predominantly balladheavy music of the present day with varying degrees of easy listening pop soul rhythm and blues quiet storm and rock influence345 adult contemporary is rather a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of poprock music6 adult contemporary tends to have lush soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated it is usually melodic enough to get a listeners attention and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music like most of pop music its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse–chorus structure7 the format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments though bass guitar is usually used such as acoustic guitars pianos saxophones and sometimes an orchestral set the electric guitars are normally faint and highpitched however recent adult contemporary music may usually feature synthesizers and other electronics such as drum machines8 an ac radio station may play mainstream music but it excludes hip hop dance tracks hard rock and some forms of teen pop as these are less popular among adults the target demographic ac radio often targets the 25–44 age group9 the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s a common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past this deemphasis on new songs slows the progression of the ac chart10 over the years ac has spawned subgenres including hot ac soft ac also known as lite ac urban ac rhythmic ac and christian ac a softer type of contemporary christian music some stations play only hot ac soft ac or only one of the variety of subgenres therefore it is not usually considered a specific genre of music it is merely an assemblage of selected tracks from musicians of many different genres contents 1 history 11 1960s early roots easy listening and soft rock 12 1970s soft rock forms as a radio

johnny mathis concentrated on romantic readings of jazz and pop standards for the adult contemporary audience of the 1960s and 1970s11 adult contemporary traces its roots to the 1960s easy listening format which adopted a 7080 instrumental 2030 vocal mix a few offered 90 instrumentals and a handful were entirely instrumental the easy listening format as it was first known was born of a desire by some radio stations in the late 1950s and early 1960s to continue playing current hit songs but distinguish themselves from being branded as rock and roll stations billboard first published the easy listening chart july 17 1961 with 20 songs the first number one was boll weevil song by brook benton the chart described itself as not too far out in either direction12 initially the vocalists consisted of artists such as frank sinatra doris day johnny mathis connie francis nat king cole perry como and others the custom recordings were usually instrumental versions of current or recent rock and roll or pop hit songs a move intended to give the stations more mass appeal without selling out some stations would also occasionally play earlier big bandera recordings from the 1940s and early 1950s13 after 1965 differences between the hot 100 chart and the easy listening chart became more pronounced better reflecting what middle of the road stations were actually playing the composition of the chart changed dramatically as rock music continued to harden there was much less crossover between the hot 100 and easy listening chart than there had been in the early half of the 1960s roger miller barbra streisand and bobby vinton were among the charts most popular performers12 one big impetus for the development of the ac radio format was that when rock and roll music first became popular in the mid1950s many more conservative radio stations wanted to continue to play current hit songs while shying away from rock these middle of the road or mor stations also frequently included older prerockera adult standards and big band titles to further appeal to adult listeners who had grown up with those songs another big impetus for the evolution of the ac radio format was the popularity of easy listening or beautiful music stations stations with music specifically designed to be purely ambient whereas most easy listening music was instrumental created by relatively unknown artists and rarely purchased especially as singles although jackie gleasons beautiful music albums sold well in the 1950s ac was an attempt to create a similar lite format by choosing certain tracks both hit singles and album cuts of popular artists in terms of record sales and career longevity barry manilow is one of the most successful adult contemporary singers ever and the most bestselling of the 1970s14 1970s soft rock forms as a radio formatedit see also soft rock and list of soft rock artists and songs hard rock had been established as a mainstream genre by 1965 from the end of the 1960s it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock6 with both emerging as major radio formats in the us15 soft rock was often derived from folk rock using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies major artists included barbra streisand carole king cat stevens james taylor16 and bread1718 the hot 100 and easy listening charts became more similar again toward the end of the 1960s and into the early and mid1970s when the texture of much of the music played on top 40 radio once more began to soften the adult contemporary format began evolving into the sound that later defined it with rockoriented acts as chicago the eagles and elton john becoming associated with the format12 soft rock reached its commercial peak in the midtolate 1970s with acts such as toto england dan john ford coley air supply seals and crofts dan fogelberg america and the reformed fleetwood mac whose rumours 1977 was the bestselling album of the decade19 by 1977 some radio stations notably new yorks wtfm and nbcowned wyny had switched to an allsoft rock format20 by the 1980s tastes had changed and radio formats reflected this change including musical artists such as journey2122 walter sabo and his team at nbc brought in major personalities from the am band to the fm band taking the format from a background to a foreground listening experience the addition of major radio stars such as dan daniel steve obrien dick summers don bleu and tom parker made it possible to fully monetize the format and provide the foundation for financial success enjoyed to this day radio stations played top 40 hits regardless of genre although most were in the same genre until the mid1970s when different forms of popular music started to target different demographic groups such as disco vs hard rock this evolved into specialized radio stations that played specific genres of music and generally followed the evolution of artists in those genres by the early 1970s softer songs by the carpenters anne murray john denver barry manilow and even streisand began to be played more often on top 40 radio and others were added to the mix on many ac stations also some of these stations even played softer songs by elvis presley linda ronstadt elton john rod stewart billy joel and other rockbased artists much of the music recorded by singersongwriters such as diana ross james taylor carly simon carole king and janis ian got as much if not more airplay on this format than on top 40 stations easy listening radio also began including songs by artists who had begun in other genres such as rock and roll or rb in addition several early disco songs did well on the adult contemporary format 1980s adult contemporary succeeds as radio formatedit careless whisper stayed at the 1 spot in the adult contemporary chart for 18 weeks23 the song was george michaels first solo single24 on april 7 1979 the easy listening chart officially became known as adult contemporary12 and those two words have remained consistent in the name of the chart ever since adult contemporary music became one of the most popular radio formats of the 1980s the growth of ac was a natural result of the generation that first listened to the more specialized music of the midlate 1970s growing older and not being interested in the heavy metal and raphiphop music that a new generation helped to play a significant role in the top 40 charts by the end of the decade mainstream ac itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years traditional ac artists such as barbra streisand the carpenters dionne warwick barry manilow john denver and olivia newtonjohn found it harder to have major top 40 hits as the 1980s wore on and due to the influence of mtv artists who were staples of the contemporary hit radio format such as richard marx michael jackson bonnie tyler george michael phil collins and laura branigan began crossing over to the ac charts with greater frequency collins has been described by allmusic as one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the 80s and beyond25 however with the combination of mtv and ac radio adult contemporary appeared harder to define as a genre with established softrock artists of the past still charting pop hits and receiving airplay alongside mainstream radio fare from newer artists at the time the amount of crossover between the ac chart and the hot 100 has varied based on how much the passing pop music trends of the times appealed to adult listeners not many disco or new wave songs were particularly successful on the ac chart during the late 1970s and early 1980s and much of the hiphop and harder rock music featured on chr formats later in the decade would have been unacceptable on ac radio although danceoriented electronic pop and balladoriented rock dominated the 1980s soft rock songs still enjoyed a mild success thanks to sheena easton amy grant26 lionel richie christopher cross dan hill leo sayer billy ocean27 julio iglesias bertie higgins and tommy page28 no song spent more than six weeks at 1 on this chart during the 1980s with nine songs accomplishing that feat two of these were by lionel richie you are in 1983 and hello in 1984 which also reached 1 on the hot 100 in 1989 linda ronstadt released cry like a rainstorm howl like the wind described by critics as the first true adult contemporary album of the decade featuring american soul singer aaron neville on several of the twelve tracks the album was certified triple platinum in the united states alone and became a major success throughout the globe the grammy awardwinning singles dont know much and all my life were both longrunning 1 adult contemporary hits several additional singles from the disc made the ac top 10 as well the album won over many critics in the need to define ac and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of ac music into mainstream day to day radio play 1990s subgenre formationsradio crossoversedit latin artist marc anthonys selftitled englishlanguage album released in 1999 had singles that crossed over to the ac charts29 the early 1990s marked the softening of urban rb at the same time alternative rock emerged and traditional pop saw a significant resurgence this in part led to a widening of the market not only allowing to cater to more niche markets but it also became customary for artists to make acfriendly singles unlike the majority of 1980s mainstream singers the 1990s mainstream poprb singers such as all4one30 boyz ii men rob thomas christina aguilera31 backstreet boys and savage garden31 generally crossed over to the ac charts latin pop artists such as lynda thomas32 ricky martin marc anthony selena enrique iglesias and luis miguel also enjoyed success in the ac charts in addition to celine dion who has had significant success on this chart other artists with multiple number ones on the ac chart in the 1990s include mariah carey phil collins michael bolton whitney houston and shania twain newer female singersongwriters such as sarah mclachlan natalie merchant jewel melissa etheridge and sheryl crow also broke through on the ac chart during this time33 in 1996 billboard created a new chart called adult top 40 which reflects programming on radio stations that exists somewhere between adult contemporary music and pop music although they are sometimes mistaken for each other the adult contemporary chart and the adult top 40 chart are separate charts and songs reaching one chart might not reach the other in addition hot ac is another subgenre of radio programming that is distinct from the hot adult contemporary tracks chart as it exists today despite the apparent similarity in name in response to the pressure on hot ac a new kind of ac format cropped up among american radio recently the urban adult contemporary format a term coined by barry mayo usually attracts a large number of african americans and sometimes caucasian listeners through playing a great deal of rb without any form of rapping gospel music classic soul and dance music including disco another format rhythmic ac in addition to playing all the popular hot and soft ac music past and present places a heavy emphasis on disco as well as 1980s and 1990s dance hits such as those by amber cc music factory and black box and includes dance remixes of pop songs such as the soul solution mix of toni braxtons unbreak my heart in its early years of existence the smooth jazz format was considered to be a form of ac although it was mainly instrumental and related a stronger resemblance to the soft acstyled music for many years george benson kenny g and dave koz had all had crossover hits that were played on both smooth jazz and soft ac stations 2000–present mainstream music goes acedit a number of michael bublés singles and albums topped the ac charts in the 2000s and 2010s34 a notable pattern that developed during the 2000s and 2010s has been for certain pop songs to have lengthy runs on ac charts even after the songs have fallen off the hot 100 adrian moreira senior vice president for adult music for rca music group said weve seen a fairly tidal shift in what ac will play rather than emphasizing older songs adult contemporary was playing many of the same songs as top 40 and adult top 40 but only after the hits had become established12 an article on mtvs website by corey moss describes this trend in other words ac stations are where pop songs go to die a very long death or to optimists to get a second life35 with the mixture of radio friendly ac tunes with some rock and pop fare also landing on the pop charts mainstream songs won over many critics in the need to define ac and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of ac music into mainstream day to day radio play an example of a 2000s ac song is josh grobans single you raise me up part of the reason why more and more hot ac stations are forced to change is that less and less new music fits their bill most new rock is too alternative for mainstream radio and most new pop is now influenced heavily by dancepop and electronic dance music36 a popular trend in this era was remixing dance music hits into adult contemporary ballads especially in the us for example the candlelight mix versions of heaven by dj sammy listen to your heart by dht and everytime we touch by cascada adult contemporary has long characterized itself as familyfriendly but edited versions of perfect by pnk and forget you by cee lo green showed up in the format in 201112 while most artists became established in other formats before moving to adult contemporary michael bublé and josh groban started out as ac artists12 throughout this decade artists such as nick lachey james blunt john mayer bruno mars jason mraz kelly clarkson adele clay aiken and susan boyle have become successful thanks to a ballad heavy sound much as some hot ac and modern rock artists have crossed over into each other such as songs from coldplay 197537 so too has soft ac crossed with country music in this decade country musicians such as faith hill shania twain leann rimes and carrie underwood have had success on both charts since the mid2000s the mainstreaming of bands like wilco and feist have pushed indie rock into the adult contemporary conversation38 in the early 2010s indie musicians like imagine dragons mumford sons of monsters and men the lumineers and ed sheeran also had indie songs that crossed over to the adult contemporary charts39 the consolidation of the hot ac format contrasted with the neardemise of most other ac formats beginning with the 20052007 economic downturn and eventual recession most stations went for the more chartbased chr along with the top 40 urban and even latino formats diminishing physical record sales also proved a major blow to the ac genre and there are concerns that the portable people meter a device being used to determine radio listenership may be incompatible with ac songs and may not accurately pick up that a person is listening to an ac station because of the pitches and frequencies used in the style40 the soft ac format has reinvented in the late 2000searly 2010s as a result of its declining relevance adopting a more upmarket middleoftheroad approach with a selection of oldies usually from the 1960s70s onwards primarily rock jazz rb and pop music newer songs are more often but not limited to easy listening fare this amount varying depending on the age of the stations target demographic adult contemporary formatsedit soft adult contemporaryedit see also soft rock and list of soft rock artists and songs termed the acoustic equivalent to prozac41 soft adult contemporary a more adultoriented version of ac was born in the late 1970s and grew in the early 1980s weeifm in boston was the first station to use the term soft rock with ad slogans such as fleetwood mac without the yack and joni without the baloney the vast majority of music played on soft ac stations is mellow more acoustic and primarily solo vocalists other popular names for the format include warm sunny bee or b and particularly in canada ez rock the format can be seen as a more contemporary successor to and combination of the middle of the road mor beautiful music easy listening and soft rock formats many stations in the soft ac format capitalize on its appeal to office workers many of them females aged 25–54 a key advertiser demographic and brand themselves as stations everyone at work can agree on kost originated that phrase as a primary tagline and other soft ac stations have followed suit a large portion of music played on this format are either considered oldies or recurrent42 it often deals with modern romantic and sexual relationships and sometimes other adult themes such as work raising children and family in a thoughtful and complex way3 soft ac which has never minded keeping songs in high rotation literally for years in some cases does not appear necessarily to be facing similar pressures to expand its format soft ac includes a larger amount of older music especially classic rb soul and 1960s and 1970s music than hot ac the soft ac format may soon be facing the demographic pressures that the jazz and big band formats faced in the 1960s and 1970s and that the oldies format has faced more recently with the result that one may hear soft ac less on overtheair radio and more on satellite radio systems in coming years much of the music and artists that were traditionally played on soft ac stations have been relegated to the adult standards format which is itself disappearing because of aging demographics some soft ac stations have found a niche by incorporating more oldies into their playlists and are more open to playing softer songs that fit the traditional definition of ac artists contributing to this format include mainly soft rockpop singers such as andy williams johnny mathis barbra streisand nana mouskouri celine dion julio iglesias frank sinatra barry manilow engelbert humperdinck aaron neville and marc anthony hot adult contemporaryedit see also adult top 40 and adult album alternative hot adult contemporary radio stations play a variety of classic hits and contemporary mainstream music aimed at an adult audience some hot ac stations concentrate slightly more on pop music and alternative rock to target the generation z audience though they exclude the more youthoriented teen pop urban and rhythmic dance tracks this format often includes dancepop such as upbeat songs by madonna cher43 gloria estefan and kylie minogue44 power pops mainly by boybands such as backstreet boys45 and westlife and adultoriented soft rock music that are balladdriven typically by the eagles46 sting47 toto48 and the moody blues49 generally hot ac radio stations target their music output towards the 1854 age group and a demographic audience of both men and women50 modern adult contemporaryedit modern adult contemporary can be a variation of hot ac and includes modern rock titles in its presentation in 1997 mike marino of kmxb in las vegas described the format as reaching an audience that has outgrown the edgier hiphop or alternative music but hasnt gotten old and sappy enough for the soft acs51 the formats artists included alanis morissette counting crows gin blossoms bon jovi train no doubt the script52 the cranberries53 lifehouse54 sarah mclachlan sara bareilles john mayer joon wolfsberg jewel and ingrid michaelson unlike modern rock which went after 1834 men this format appealed to women urban and rhythmic adult contemporaryedit urban ac is a form of ac music geared towards adult africanamerican audiences and therefore the artists that are played on these stations are most often black such as desree whose album i aint movin was massively popular among both african american audience as well as the wider national audience the urban ac stations resemble soft ac rather than hot ac they play predominantly rb and soul music with little hiphop this is reflected in many of the urban ac radio stations taglines such as todays rb and classic soul the best variety of rb hits and oldies and cityregions rb leader urban acs core artists include luther vandross trey songz patti labelle toni braxton whitney houston aretha franklin frank ocean craig david and mariah carey a more elaborate form of urban ac is the rhythmic oldies format which focuses primarily on old school rb and soul hits from the 1960s to the 1990s including motown and disco hits the format includes soul or disco artists such as abba the village people the jackson 5 donna summer tina charles gloria gaynor and the bee gees rhythmic oldies stations still exist today but target africanamericans as opposed to a mass audience a format called quiet storm is often included in urban adult contemporary and is often played during the evening and late night hours blending the urban ac and soft ac styles of music the music that is played is strictly ballads and slow jams mostly but not limited to black and latino artists popular artists in the quiet storm format are teena marie freddie jackson regina belle johnny gill lalah hathaway vanessa l williams toni braxton and en vogue among others anita baker sade regina belle and luther vandross are other examples of artists who appeal to mainstream ac urban ac and smooth jazz listeners some soft ac and urban ac stations like to play smooth jazz on the weekends in recent years the smooth jazz format has been renamed to smooth ac as an attempt to lure younger listeners adult contemporary rbedit adult contemporary rb may be played on both soft ac stations and urban ac it is a form of neo soul rb that places emphasis on songcraft and sophistication as the use of drum machines synthesizers and sequencers dominates rbrooted music adult contemporary rb tends to take most of its cues from the more refined strains of 1970s soul such as smooth soul philly soul and quiet storm classic songwriting touches and organicleaning

adult contemporaryedit see also smooth jazz radio smooth adult contemporary was evolved from smooth jazz stations in order to attract more younger listeners particularly in the important 2554 age demographic without completely alienating jazz fans smooth ac stations played more of the vocalists popular on smooth jazz stations such as luther vandross sade robin thicke anita baker and basia while incorporating more mainstream and urban ac material from artists such as celine dion mary j blige and maroon 5 and limiting instrumentals to two or three cuts an hour and usually restricting airplay of instrumentals to artists such as kenny g dave koz and chuck mangione who had crossover pop success in markets where they existed smooth ac stations were meant to fill a void for soft music created by the mainstream adult contemporary formats overall move toward more uptempo adult top40 musical fare one of the first highprofile stations to adopt the smooth ac approach was pioneering smoothjazz station ktwv in los angeles the wave under new program director jhani kaye ktwvs transition was successful in improving the stations 2554 ratings other stations followed suit including the late wlfmlp in chicago wxjz in gainesville florida kifm in san diego and wnwv in cleveland which relaunched under its former 1073 the wave identity as a smooth ac on january 4 2012 however the smooth ac format for the most part did not succeed wlfm wxjz and kifm have switched to other formats wnwv has evolved back into smooth jazz and ktwv has continued to progressively downplay while not entirely eliminating instrumental music in its shift to a smooth rb urban ac format the smooth ac format is now virtually extinct on commercial radio with one exception being kjzy in the santa rosa california market which continues as a hybrid of smooth jazz and adult standards contemporary christian musicedit contemporary christian music ccm has several subgenres one being christian ac radio records for

particularly soft ac stations to play primarily or exclusively christmas music during the christmas season in november and december while these tend mostly to be contemporary seasonal recordings by the same few artists featured under the normal format most stations will also air some vintage holiday tunes from older pop mor and adult standards artists – such as nat king cole bing crosby dean martin the carpenters percy faith johnny mathis and andy williams – many of whom would never be played on these stations during the rest of the year these christmas music marathons typically start during the week before thanksgiving day and end after christmas day or sometimes extending to new years day afterwards the stations usually resume their normal music fare several stations begin the holiday format much earlier at the beginning of november the roots of this tradition can be traced back to the beautiful music and easy listening stations of the 1960s and 1970s syndicated radio shows
