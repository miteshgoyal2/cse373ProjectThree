formal methods from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in computer science specifically software engineering and hardware engineering formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based techniques for the specification development and verification of software and hardware systems1 the use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that as in other engineering disciplines performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design2 formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals in particular logic calculi formal languages automata theory discrete event dynamic system and program semantics but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification3 contents 1 taxonomy 11 lightweight formal methods 2 uses 21 specification 22 development 23 verification 231 humandirected proof 232 automated proof 3 applications 4 in software development 5 formal methods and notations 51 specification languages 52 model checkers 6 see also 7 references 8 further reading 9 external links taxonomyedit formal methods can be used at a number of levels level 0 formal specification may be undertaken and then a program developed from this informally this has been dubbed formal methods lite this may be the most costeffective option in many cases level 1 formal development and formal verification may be used to produce a program in a more formal manner for example proofs of properties or refinement from the specification to a program may be undertaken this may be most appropriate in highintegrity systems involving safety or security level 2 theorem provers may be used to undertake fully formal machinechecked proofs this can be very expensive and is only practically worthwhile if the cost of mistakes is extremely high eg in critical parts of microprocessor design further information on this is expanded below as with programming language semantics styles of formal methods may be roughly classified as follows denotational semantics in which the meaning of a system is expressed in the mathematical theory of domains proponents of such methods rely on the wellunderstood nature of domains to give meaning to the system critics point out that not every system may be intuitively or naturally viewed as a function operational semantics in which the meaning of a system is expressed as a sequence of actions of a presumably simpler computational model proponents of such methods point to the simplicity of their models as a means to expressive clarity critics counter that the problem of semantics has just been delayed who defines the semantics of the simpler model axiomatic semantics in which the meaning of the system is expressed in terms of preconditions and postconditions which are true before and after the system performs a task respectively proponents note the connection to classical logic critics note that such semantics never really describe what a system does merely what is true before and afterwards lightweight formal methodsedit some practitioners believe that the formal methods community has overemphasized full formalization of a specification or design45 they contend that the expressiveness of the languages involved as well as the complexity of the systems being modelled make full formalization a difficult and expensive task as an alternative various lightweight formal methods which emphasize partial specification and focused application have been proposed examples of this lightweight approach to formal methods include the alloy object modelling notation6 denneys synthesis of some aspects of the z notation with use case driven development7 and the csk vdm tools8 usesedit formal methods can be applied at various points through the development process specificationedit formal methods may be used to give a description of the system to be developed at whatever levels of detail desired this formal description can be used to guide further development activities see following sections additionally it can be used to verify that the requirements for the system being developed have been completely and accurately specified the need for formal specification systems has been noted for years in the algol 58 report9 john backus presented a formal notation for describing programming language syntax later named backus normal form then renamed backus–naur form bnf10 backus also wrote that a formal description of the meaning of syntactically valid algol programs wasnt completed in time for inclusion in the report therefore the formal treatment of the semantics of legal programs will be included in a subsequent paper it never appeared developmentedit once a formal specification has been produced the specification may be used as a guide while the concrete system is developed during the design process ie realized typically in software but also potentially in hardware for example if the formal specification is in an operational semantics the observed behavior of the concrete system can be compared with the behavior of the specification which itself should be executable or simulateable additionally the operational commands of the specification may be amenable to direct translation into executable code if the formal specification is in an axiomatic semantics the preconditions and postconditions of the specification may become assertions in the executable code verificationedit once a formal specification has been developed the specification may be used as the basis for proving properties of the specification and hopefully by inference the developed system humandirected proofedit sometimes the motivation for proving the correctness of a system is not the obvious need for reassurance of the correctness of the system but a desire to understand the system better consequently some proofs of correctness are produced in the style of mathematical proof handwritten or typeset using natural language using a level of informality common to such proofs a good proof is one which is readable and understandable by other human readers critics of such approaches point out that the ambiguity inherent in natural language allows errors to be undetected in such proofs often subtle errors can be present in the lowlevel details typically overlooked by such proofs additionally the work involved in producing such a good proof requires a high level of mathematical sophistication and expertise automated proofedit in contrast there is increasing interest in producing proofs of correctness of such systems by automated means automated techniques fall into three general categories automated theorem proving in which a system attempts to produce a formal proof from scratch given a description of the system a set of logical axioms and a set of inference rules model checking in which a system verifies certain properties by means of an exhaustive search of all possible states that a system could enter during its execution abstract interpretation in which a system verifies an overapproximation of a behavioural property of the program using a fixpoint computation over a possibly complete lattice representing it some automated theorem provers require guidance as to which properties are interesting enough to pursue while others work without human intervention model checkers can quickly get bogged down in checking millions of uninteresting states if not given a sufficiently abstract model proponents of such systems argue that the results have greater mathematical certainty than humanproduced proofs since all the tedious details have been algorithmically verified the training required to use such systems is also less than that required to produce good mathematical proofs by hand making the techniques accessible to a wider variety of practitioners critics note that some of those systems are like oracles they make a pronouncement of truth yet give no explanation of that truth there is also the problem of verifying the verifier if the program which aids in the verification is itself unproven there may be reason to doubt the soundness of the produced results some modern model checking tools produce a proof log detailing each step in their proof making it possible to perform given suitable tools independent verification the main feature of the abstract interpretation approach is that it provides a sound analysis ie no false negatives are returned moreover it is efficiently scalable by tuning the abstract domain representing the property to be analyzed and by applying widening operators11 to get fast convergence applicationsedit formal methods are applied in different areas of hardware and software including routers ethernet switches routing protocols and security applications there are several examples in which they have been used to verify the functionality of the hardware and software used in dcsclarification needed ibm used acl2 a theorem prover in amd x86 processor development processcitation needed intel uses such methods to verify its hardware and firmware permanent software programmed into a readonly memorycitation needed dansk datamatik center used formal methods in the 1980s to develop a compiler system for the ada programming language that went on to become a longlived commercial product1213 there are several other projects of nasa in which formal methods are applied such as next generation air transportation systemcitation needed unmanned aircraft system integration in national airspace system14 and airborne coordinated conflict resolution and detection accord15 bmethod with atelierb16 is used to develop safety automatisms for the various subways installed throughout the world by alstom and siemens and also for common criteria certification and the development of system models by atmel and stmicroelectronics formal verification has been frequently used in hardware by most of the wellknown hardware vendors such as ibm intel and amd there are many areas of hardware where intel have used fms to verify the working of the products such as parameterized verification of cache coherent protocol17 intel core i7 processor execution engine validation 18 using theorem proving bdd’s and symbolic evaluation optimization for intel ia64 architecture using hol light theorem prover19 and verification of high performance dualport gigabit ethernet controller with a support for pci express protocol and intel advance management technology using cadence20 similarly ibm has used formal methods in the verification of power gates21 registers22 and functional verification of the ibm power7 microprocessor23 in software developmentedit in software development formal methods are mathematical approaches to solving software and hardware problems at the requirements specification and design levels formal methods are most likely to be applied to safetycritical or securitycritical software and systems such as avionics software software safety assurance standards such as do178b do178c and common criteria demand formal methods at the highest levels of categorization for sequential software examples of formal methods include the bmethod the specification languages used in automated theorem proving raise and the z notation in functional programming propertybased testing has allowed the mathematical specification and testing if not exhaustive testing of the expected behaviour of individual functions the object constraint language and specializations such as java modeling language has allowed objectoriented systems to be formally specified if not necessarily formally verified for concurrent software and systems petri nets process algebra and finite state machines which are based on automata theory see also virtual finite state machine or event driven finite state machine allow executable software specification and can be used to build up and validate application behavior another approach to formal methods in software development is to write a specification in some form of logic—usually a variation of firstorder logic fol—and then to directly execute the logic as though it were a program the owl language based on description logic dl is an example there is also work on mapping some version of english or another natural language automatically to and from logic and executing the logic directly examples are attempto controlled english and internet business logic which do not seek to control the vocabulary or syntax a feature of systems that support bidirectional englishlogic mapping and direct execution of the logic is that they can be made to explain their results in english at the business or scientific levelcitation needed formal methods and notationsedit this section is in a list format that may be better presented using prose
