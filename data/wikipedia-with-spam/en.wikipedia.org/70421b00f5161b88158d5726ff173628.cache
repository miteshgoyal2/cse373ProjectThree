american medical association clintons party suffered a strong rebuke in the 1994 elections and republicans took control of both houses of congress for the first time since the 1950s the republican revolution as the 1994 elections came to be known empowered congressional republicans led by speaker of the house newt gingrich to propose several conservative policies while clinton vetoed many of

appointed two supreme court justices ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer clintons second term saw the first federal budget surpluses since the 1960s but this was partially overshadowed by his

all charges by the senate in 1997 clinton signed into law a bill creating the state childrens health insurance program which was to help provide health care coverage for millions of children in 1999

and produced the first federal budget surpluses since 1969 for fiscal years 1998 1999 2000 and 20012 leading to a decrease in the public debt though the gross federal debt continued to increase345

parties he also signed the reversal of the glasssteagall act an act which was designed to prevent financial institutions from getting too big to fail7 he also signed the commodity futures modernization act which legalized overthecounter derivatives8 socially the administration began with efforts by clinton to allow gays and lesbians to serve in the military which culminated in a compromise known as dont ask dont tell allowing at a statutory level gays and lesbians to serve in the military if they did not disclose their sexual orientation the policy remained in effect until it was repealed in 2010 clinton became the first president to appoint open gays to his administration issued executive orders ending the ban on security clearance for lgbt workers9 and banning any job discrimination based on sexual orientation in civilian public sector employment10 he unsuccessfully lobbied for the private sector employment nondiscrimination act and dramatically increased federal funding for hivaids preventionresearchtreatment however clinton also signed the defense of marriage act while it came to his desk with a vetoproof majority clintons failure to veto doma was considered by many to be a blow to the lgbt rights movement11 various measures were also introduced to improve the effectiveness of the social safety net including an increase in the number of child care places a significant expansion of the eitc program and the introduction of new programs such as schip and a child tax credit12 the 1993 family and medical leave act the first law that clinton signed ensured parents could take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or a sick relative without risking their job over the next eight years more than 35 million workers took advantage of the protections of this law that same year the earned income tax credit was expanded to give a larger benefit to working families and allow childless workers to benefit as well in 1996 congress passed a 20 increase in the minimum wage which boosted earnings for nearly 10 million americans as part of the clinton administration’s welfare reforms over 200000 people on welfare received housing vouchers to help them move closer to jobs while a welfaretowork tax credit encouraged businesses to hire longterm welfare recipients1314 in addition communities received federal support to design

bill clinton first inauguration of bill clinton january 20 1993 audio only version problems playing these files see media help 1993 saw the start of americas first democratic presidency in 12 years30 in his first address to the nation on february 15 1993 clinton announced his intention to raise taxes to cap the budget deficit31 on february 17 1993 in a nationally televised address to a joint session of congress clinton unveiled his economic plan the plan focused on deficit reduction rather than a middle class tax cut which had been high on his campaign agenda32 clinton was pressured by his advisers including future treasury secretary robert rubin to raise taxes on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates33 in august 1993 clinton signed the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 which passed congress without a single republican vote it mandated deficit reduction34 and raised taxes on the wealthiest 12 of taxpayers while cutting taxes on 15 million lowincome families and making tax cuts available to 90 of small businesses35 clintons economic plan also included a major expansion of the existing earned income tax credit aimed at workingclass families just above the poverty line which helped ensure that it made sense for them to work rather than seek welfare john f harris argues that this would prove to be one of the most important and tangible progressive achievements of the clinton years36 clinton takes the oath of office during his 1993 presidential inauguration on january 20 1993 the transition period and the first few weeks of the administration in the white house were full of difficulties and drama37 in particular finding someone for the highprofile united states attorney general position proved problematic clinton had vowed to assemble an administration that looked like america and it was widely assumed that one of the major cabinet posts would go to a woman38 clinton soon decided that he would appoint a female attorney general something womens political action groups were also requesting39 many administration officials reported later that clinton initially considered nominating the first lady hillary clinton herself a prominent attorney but antinepotism laws stemming from robert f kennedys service in his brothers administration prohibited this4041 clinton chose littleknown corporate lawyer zoë baird for the slot but in what became known as the nannygate matter it was revealed that she had hired a peruvian couple both illegal immigrants to work in her home the possibility of the attorney general having employed illegal immigrants provoked common resentment among a large group of people who flooded the united states congress and radio programs42 baird withdrew her nomination and clinton next chose kimba wood who was quickly forced to withdraw due to somewhat similar problems this led to over a thousand presidential appointment positions being subjected to heightened scrutiny for household help hiring practices and a consequent significant slowdown in getting new administration positions filled43 janet reno a florida states attorney was nominated for attorney general a few weeks later and she won confirmation on march 11 199344 clintons attempt to fulfill his campaign promise of allowing openly gay men and lesbians serving in the armed forces was the subject of criticism45 his handling of the issue garnered criticism from both the left for being too tentative in promoting gay rights and the right for being too insensitive to military life after much debate congress implemented the dont ask dont tell policy stating that homosexual men and women may serve in the military as long as their sexuality is kept secret by 1999 clinton said what he would like to do is focus on making the policy we announced back in 1993 work the way its intended to because its out of whack now and i dont think any serious person could say its not46 some gay rights advocates criticized clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise simply to get votes and contributions4748 these advocates felt clinton should have integrated the military by executive order using president trumans desegregation of the armed forces as an example however some believed clinton had faced unfair blame and that congress deserved the criticism in fact on january 27 a small delegation had visited the white house and told clinton that if he tried forcing a change by executive order congress would pass a bill with a vetoproof majority rewriting the existing policy into law49 clintons defenders argued this could make it harder to integrate the military in the future critics however said the focus should have been society instead of the military claiming the militarys goal was to defend the nation rather than become a social petri dish50 nannygate gays in the military the dropping of a promised middleclass tax cut the world trade center bombing and other issues all contributed to a difficult introduction of the clinton presidency4451 clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began until the later presidency of donald trump525354 his presidential honeymoon period was thus extremely brief51 clinton nonetheless was able to pass major legislation in 1993 including the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 clinton supported the north american free trade agreement a free trade agreement with canada and mexico negotiated by president bush but supported by many members of the democratic leadership council despite opposition from antitrade republicans protectionist democrats and supporters of ross perot the bill passed both houses of congress and came into force in 1994 clinton also signed the brady bill which imposed a fiveday waiting period on handgun purchases55 and the family and medical leave act of 1993 which required large employers to allow their employees to take unpaid leave because of pregnancy or serious medical conditions in 1994 clinton signed the violent crime control and law enforcement act a major crime bill that included an assault weapons ban an expanded federal death penalty the violence against women act and several other provisions unfortunately the increased spending and punitive focus of the bill caused a large increase in prison populations the clinton family arrives at the white house in 1993 perhaps the most prominent item on clintons firstterm legislative agenda was passage of a health care reform plan a task force headed by first lady hillary clinton proposed the plan which aimed to achieve universal coverage via a national healthcare plan though initially well received in political circles it was ultimately doomed by wellorganized opposition from conservativescitation needed the american medical association and the health insurance industry despite his party holding a majority in the house and senate the effort to create a national healthcare system ultimately died under heavy public pressure it was the first major legislative defeat of clintons administration clinton and vice president gore talk while walking

federal agencies to fully utilize information technology to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public60 on march 9 1996 clinton and gore participated in netday96 spending the day at ygnacio valley high school as part of the drive to connect california public schools to the internet in a speech given at yvh clinton stated that he was excited to see that his challenge the previous september to californians to connect at least 20 of your schools to the information superhighway by the end of this school year was met clinton also described this event as part of a time of absolutely astonishing transformation a moment of great possibility all of you know that the information and technology explosion will offer to you and to the young people of the future more opportunities and challenges than any generation of americans has ever seen61 the 1994 elections proved disastrous for the democrats republicans campaigning on their contract with america took control of both houses of congress for the first time since the 1950s due to the large republican gains the 1994 election is sometimes known as the republican revolution congress passed conservative legislation such as the telecommunications act of 1996 which allowed for greater media crossownership the personal responsibility and work opportunity act which reduced welfare spending and the defense of marriage act which banned the recognition of samesex marriages however clinton also vetoed several republican initiatives and a showdown over federal spending levels over the 1996 united states federal budget led to two government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996 the shutdown ended after clinton successfully portrayed the republicans led by newt gingrich as extreme and unreasonable62 in the 1996 presidential election a few months later clinton was reelected receiving 492 of the popular vote over republican bob dole 407 of the popular vote and reform candidate ross perot 84 of the popular vote becoming the first democrat to serve two full presidential terms since franklin roosevelt the republicans lost a few seats in the house and gained a few in the senate but retained control of both

relationship with a young white house intern monica lewinsky clinton initially denied the affair while testifying in the paula jones sexual harassment lawsuit the opposing lawyers asked the president about it during his deposition he stated i have never had sexual relations with monica lewinsky ive never had an affair with her four days later he also said there is not a sexual relationship an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship64 clinton then appeared on national television on january 26 and stated listen to me im going to say this again i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky however after it was revealed that investigators had obtained a semenstained dress as well as testimony from lewinsky clinton changed tactics and admitted that an improper relationship with lewinsky had taken place indeed i did have a relationship with miss lewinsky that was not appropriate in fact it was wrong it constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which i am solely and completely responsible faced with overwhelming evidence he apologized to the nation agreed to pay a 25000 court fine settled his sexual harassment lawsuit with paula jones for 850000 and was temporarily disbarred for a period of five years from practicing law in arkansas and before the us supreme court he was not tried for

international legal fight for where the boy should stay eventually the administration via janet reno had gonzález returned to cuba clinton issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on january 20 20016667 most of the controversy surrounded marc rich and allegations that hillary clintons brother hugh rodham accepted payments in return for influencing the presidents decisionmaking regarding the pardons68 some of clintons pardons remain a point of controversy69 while the administration saw the expansion of the federal death penalty which clinton supported and the end of his tenure he became the first president since john f kennedy who had commuted the military death sentence of seaman jimmie henderson70 to issue a presidential commutation of a death sentence when he commuted the sentence of david ronald chandler to life imprisonment without parole71 and ordered a review of a possibly racial disparity in the application of the federal death penalty clinton remained popular with the public throughout his two terms as president ending his presidential career with a 65 approval rating the highest endofterm approval rating of any president since dwight d eisenhower with ronald reagans approval rating at 64 in 1989 clinton and reagans approval ratings are within margin of error72 in addition to his political skills clinton also benefited from a boom of the us economy under clinton the united states had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969 in the 1998 federal budget the budgets for 1999 2000 and 2001 also had surpluses2 as a result of this the public debt decreased though the gross federal debt continued to increase345 foreign policyedit main article foreign policy of the bill clinton administration the administration took office less than two years after the fall of the soviet union and the administrations foreign policy addressed conflicts in somalia rwanda haiti and the balkans in september 1994 clinton announced his plan to invade haiti if it refused to restore jeanbertrand aristide to the presidency of haiti operation uphold democracy authorized by united nations security council resolution 940 successfully restored jeanbertrand aristide to power as president of haiti73 in 1995 clinton organized an international aid package to rescue mexico from the mexican peso crisis the clinton administration took a particularly active role in the balkans and he initiated natoled air campaigns during the bosnian war and the kosovo war after initial successes following the election of yitzhak rabin in israel and the signing of the oslo accords in 1993 the middle east peace process deteriorated over time breaking down completely with the start of the second intifada and the election of ariel sharon the clinton presidency also saw the passage and signing of the iraq liberation act of 1998 which was a bipartisan measure expressing support for regime change in iraq on three separate occasions in 1996 1998 and 2000 the administration unsuccessfully attempted to capture or assassinate osama bin laden who was eventually killed by us special operations forces in 2011 in 2000 clinton signed a bill granting permanent normal trade relations to china and american imports from china massively increased in the subsequent years74 the economyedit see also 1990s united states boom budget deficit in billions of dollars 19712001 there were budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001 waterfall chart shows cause of change from deficit in 1994 to surplus in 2001 measured as a  gdp income tax revenues rose as a  gdp following higher taxes for high income earners while defense spending and interest fell relative to gdp clintons presidency included a great period of economic growth in americas history david greenberg a professor of history and media studies at rutgers university opined that the clinton years were unquestionably a time of progress especially on the economy clintons 1992 slogan putting people first and his stress on the economy stupid pitched an optimistic if still gritty populism at a middle class that had suffered under ronald reagan and george hw bush by the end of the clinton presidency the numbers were uniformly impressive besides the recordhigh surpluses and the recordlow poverty rates the economy could boast the longest economic expansion in history the lowest unemployment since the early 1970s and the lowest poverty rates for single mothers black americans and the aged75 in proposing a plan to cut the deficit clinton submitted a budget that would cut the deficit by 500 billion over five years by reducing 255 billion of spending and raising taxes on the wealthiest 12 of americans76 it also imposed a new energy tax on all americans and subjected about a quarter of those receiving social security payments to higher taxes on their benefits77 republican congressional leaders launched an aggressive opposition against the bill claiming that the tax increase would only make matters worse republicans were united in this opposition and every republican in both houses of congress voted against the proposal in fact it took vice president gores tiebreaking vote in the senate to pass the bill78 after extensive lobbying by the clinton administration the house narrowly voted in favor of the bill by a vote of 218 to 21679 the budget package expanded the earned income tax credit eitc as relief to lowincome families it reduced the amount they paid in federal income and federal insurance contributions act tax fica providing 21 billion in relief for 15 million lowincome families improved economic conditions and policies served to encourage investors in the bond market leading to a decline in longterm interest rates clintons final four budgets were balanced budgets with surpluses beginning with the 1997 budget the surplus money was used to pay down the public debt by 452 billion though the gross federal debt continued to increase3 however the claimed surplus was only recorded against public debt which was calculated with the exclusion of intragovernmental holdings this meant that the administration was able to record loans deducted from the social security trust fund as revenue on budget reports which accounted for the bulk of the surplus money calculating both the intragovernmental holdings from the public debt the lowest deficit was 179 billion in effect the alleged surplus was supposedly a mere accounting fiction808182838485 the total national debt gross federal debt rose every year of the clinton administration from 43 trillion to 56 trillion and from 54 trillion to 56 trillion over the years where the surplus was claimed86 the economy continued to grow and in february 2000 it broke the record for the longest uninterrupted economic expansion in us history8788 however it has been argued that the strong economic growth of the late1990s was caused by wrong allocations and malinvestments of the nasdaq bubble and dotcom bubble both of which came to an end in late2001 through mid200289 after republicans won control of congress in 1994 clinton vehemently fought their proposed tax cuts believing that they favored the wealthy and would weaken economic growth in august 1997 however clinton and congressional republicans were finally able to reach a compromise on a bill that reduced capital gain and estate taxes and gave taxpayers a credit of 500 per child and tax credits for college tuition and expenses the bill also called for a new individual retirement account ira called the roth ira to allow people to invest taxed income for retirement without having to pay taxes upon withdrawal additionally the law raised the national minimum for cigarette taxes the next year congress approved clintons proposal to make college more affordable by expanding federal student financial aid through pell grants and lowering interest rates on student loans clinton also battled congress nearly every session on the federal budget in an attempt to secure spending on education government entitlements the environment and americorps—the national service program that was passed by the democratic congress in the early days of the clinton administration the two sides however could not find a compromise and the budget battle came to a stalemate in 1995 over proposed cuts in medicare medicaid education and the environment after clinton vetoed numerous republican spending bills republicans in congress twice refused to pass temporary spending authorizations forcing the federal government to partially shut down because agencies had no budget on which to operate90 in april 1996 clinton and congress finally agreed on a budget that provided money for government agencies until the end of the fiscal year in october the budget included some of the spending cuts that the republicans supported decreasing the cost of cultural labor and housing programs but also preserved many programs that clinton wanted including educational and environmental ones the clinton presidency claims responsibility for the following average economic growth of 40 per year compared to average growth of 28 during the previous years the economy grew for 116 consecutive months the most in history91 creation of more than 225 million jobs the most jobs ever created under a single administration and more than were created in the previous 12 years of the total new jobs 207 million or 92 were in the private sector92 economic gains spurred an increase in family incomes for all americans since 1993 real median family income increased by 6338 from 42612 in 1993 to 48950 in 1999 in 1999 dollars93 overall unemployment dropped to the lowest level in more than 30 years down from 69 in 1993 to just 40 in january 2001 the unemployment rate was below 5 for 40 consecutive months unemployment for african americans fell from 142 in 1992 to 73 in 2000 the lowest rate on record unemployment for hispanics fell from 118 in october 1992 to 50 in 2000 also the lowest rate on record92 inflation dropped to its lowest rate since the kennedy administration averaging 25 and fell from 47 during the previous administration94 the homeownership rate reached 677 near the end of the clinton administration the highest rate on record in contrast the homeownership rate fell from 656 in the first quarter of 1981 to 637 in the first quarter of 199395 the poverty rate also declined from 151 in 1993 to 118 in 1999 the largest sixyear drop in poverty in nearly 30 years this left 7 million fewer people in poverty than there were in 199396 the surplus in fiscal year 2000 was 237 billion—the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever95 clinton worked with the republicanled congress to enact welfare reform as a result welfare rolls dropped dramatically and were the lowest since 1969 between january 1993 and september 1999 the number of welfare recipients dropped by 75 million a 53 decline to 66 million in comparison between 1981 and 1992 a span of 11 years the number of welfare recipients increased by 25 million a 22 increase to 136 million people97 tradeedit studies done by kate

one of his goals as president to pass trade legislation that lowered the barriers to trade with other nations he broke with many of his supporters including labor unions and those in his own party to support freetrade legislation99 opponents argued that lowering tariffs and relaxing rules on imports would cost american jobs because people would buy cheaper products from other countries clinton countered that free trade would help america because it would allow the us to boost its exports and grow the economy clinton also believed that free trade could help move foreign nations to economic and political reform the threenation nafta was signed by president george h w bush during december 1992 pending its ratification by the legislatures of the three countries clinton did not alter the original agreement but complemented it with the north american agreement on environmental cooperation and the north american agreement on labor cooperation making nafta the first green trade treaty and the first trade treaty concerned with each countrys labor laws albeit with very weak sanctions100 nafta provided for gradually reduced tariffs and the creation of a freetrading bloc of north american countries–the united states canada and mexico opponents of nafta led by ross perot claimed it would force american companies to move their workforces to mexico where they could produce goods with cheaper labor and ship them back to the united states at lower prices clinton however argued that nafta would increase us exports and create new jobs clinton while signing the nafta bill stated …nafta means jobs american jobs and goodpaying american jobs if i didnt believethat i wouldnt support this agreement”101 he convinced many democrats to join most republicans in supporting trade agreement and in 1993 the congress passed the treaty102 clinton also held meetings with leaders of pacific rim nations to discuss lowering trade barriers in november 1993 he hosted a meeting of the asiapacific economic cooperation apec in seattle washington which was attended by the leaders of 12 pacific rim nations in 1994 clinton arranged an agreement in indonesia with pacific rim nations to gradually remove trade barriers and open their markets officials in the clinton administration also participated in the final round of trade negotiations sponsored by the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt an international trade organization the negotiations had been ongoing since 1986 in a rare move clinton convened congress to ratify the trade agreement in the winter of 1994 during which the treaty was approved as part of the gatt agreement a new international trade body the world trade organization wto replaced gatt in 1995 the new wto had stronger authority to enforce trade agreements and covered a wider range of trade than did gatt clinton faced his first defeat on trade legislation during his second term in november 1997 the republicancontrolled congress delayed voting on a bill to restore a presidential trade authority that had expired in 1994 the bill would have given the president the authority to negotiate trade agreements which the congress was not authorized to modify–known as fasttrack negotiating because it streamlines the treaty process clinton was unable to generate sufficient support for the legislation even among the democratic party clinton faced yet another trade setback in december 1999 when the wto met in seattle for a new round of trade negotiations clinton hoped that new agreements on issues such as agriculture and intellectual property could be proposed at the meeting but the talks fell through antiwto protesters in the streets of seattle disrupted the meetings103 and the international delegates attending the meetings were unable to compromise mainly because delegates from smaller poorer countries resisted clintons efforts to discuss labor and environmental standards104 that same year clinton signed a landmark trade agreement with the peoples republic of china the agreement the result of more than a decade of negotiations would lower many trade barriers between the two countries making it easier to export us products such as automobiles banking services and motion pictures however the agreement could only take effect if china was accepted into the wto and was granted permanent normal trade relations status by the us congress under the pact the united states would support chinas membership in the wto many democrats as well as republicans were reluctant to grant permanent status to china because they were concerned about human rights in the country and the impact of chinese imports on us industries and jobs congress however voted in 2000 to grant permanent normal trade relations with china several economic studies have since been released that indicate the increase in trade resulting lowered american prices and increased the us gdp by 07 throughout the following decade105 the clinton administration negotiated a total of about 300 trade agreements with other countries106 clintons last treasury secretary lawrence summers stated that the lowered tariffs that resulted from clintons trade policies which reduced prices to consumers and kept inflation low were technically the largest tax cut in the history of the world107 2000 electionedit main article united states presidential election 2000
