mormon after the republican presidential candidate and a major influence on evangelical christians beck has emerged as an unlikely theological bridge between the first mormon presidential nominee and a critical electorate evangelicals according to a preelection article in the new york times along with personal campaign appearances in ohio and iowa beck unusually directly addressed doctrinal issues between mormons and evangelical christians—wherein the latter often consider the former a cult rather than christian—on his radio show in september 2012 during the onehour show in early september he asked his audience “does mitt romney’s mormonism make him too scary or weird to be elected president of the united states” the article concluded by addressing the fear of making mormonism mainstream as a reason beck could be acceptable to evangelicals and romney not be quoting john c green the author of the faith factor how religion influences american elections there’s a difference between a public figure like glenn beck and someone who could be the president of the united states many evangelicals believe this country was founded by christian leaders it’s important that the person in the

the truck driver being accused of murder beck said 17 are in the hospital nine are dead and i have to tell you the truck driver should get the death penalty i really believe we need to send a very strong message to people who are acting as coyotes you get the death penalty man if you are caught and you are transporting people like cattle and anyone dies death penalty this is horrible can you imagine how hot that truck was 100degree temperatures this sanctuary city thing is a lure and brings lots of money into people who will do this kind of thing with an empty semi so which is it going to be are we going to incentivize those people which will lead to more death and destruction or are we going to say we have a border take it seriously personally for the driver of this truck who knew and allowed these people to die texas death penalty should be coming his way i hope hes got a hanging judge 117 although opposed to illegal immigration beck announced in june and july 2014 that his

according to beck the progressive ideas of men such as john dewey herbert croly and walter lippmann influenced the presidencies of theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson eventually becoming the foundation for president franklin d roosevelts new deal126 beck has said that such progressivism infects both main political parties and threatens to destroy america as it was originally conceived126 in becks book common sense he argues that progressivism has less to do with the parties and more to do with individuals who seek to redefine reshape and rebuild america into a country where individual liberties and personal property mean nothing if they conflict with the plans and goals of the state126 a collection of progressives whom beck has referred to as crime inc comprise what beck contends

exchange generation investment management enterprise community partners petrobras center for american progress and the seiu to fulfill their progressive agenda129133 in his quest to root out these progressives beck has compared himself to israeli nazi hunters vowing on his radio show that to the day i die i am going to be a progressivehunter im going to find these people that have done this to our country and expose them i dont care if theyre in nursing homes36 beck compared al gore to the nazis while equating the campaign against global warming to the nazi campaign against the jews134 progressive historian sean wilentz has denounced what he describes as becks progressivethemed conspiracy theories and gross historical inaccuracies countering that beck is merely echoing the decadesold rightwing extremism of the john birch society135 according to wilentz becks version of history places him in a long line of figures who have challenged mainstream political historians and presented an inaccurate opposing view as the truth stating glenn beck is trying to give viewers a version of american history that is supposedly hidden supposedly all we historians—left right and center—have been doing for the past 100 years is to keep true american history from you and that true american history is what glenn beck is teaching its a version of history that is beyond skewed but of course thats what beck expects us to say he lives in a kind of alice in wonderland world where if people who actually know the history say what hes teaching is junk he says thats because youre trying to hide the truth135 conservative david frum the former speechwriter for president george w bush has also alleged becks propensity for negationism remarking that beck offers a story about the american past for people who are feeling right now very angry and alienated it is different enough from the usual story in that he makes them feel like theyve got access to secret knowledge36 influences political and historical the old american mindset that richard hofstadter famously called the paranoid style—the sense that masons or the railroads or the pope or the guys in black helicopters are in league to destroy the country—is aflame again fanned from both right and left no one has a better feeling for this mood and no one exploits it as well as beck he is the hottest thing in the politicalrant racket left or right – david von drehle time magazine 200994 an author with ideological influence on beck is w cleon skousen 1913–2006 a prolific conservative political writer american constitutionalist and faith based political theorist136137 as an anticommunist supporter of the john birch society138 and a limitedgovernment activist139 skousen who was mormon wrote on a wide range of subjects the sixday war mormon eschatology new world order conspiracies even parenting139 skousen believed that american political social and economic elites were working with communists to foist a world government on the united states126 beck praised skousens words of wisdom as divinely inspired referencing skousens the naked communist140 and especially the 5000 year leap originally published in 1981139 which beck said in 2007 had changed his life139 according to skousens nephew mark skousen leap reflects skousens passion for the united states constitution which he felt was inspired by god and the reason behind americas success as a nation141 the book is recommended by beck as required reading to understand the current american political landscape and become a september twelfth person139 beck authored a foreword for the 2008 edition of leap and becks onair recommendations in 2009 propelled the book to number one in the government category on amazon for several months139 in 2010 matthew continetti of the conservative weekly standard criticized becks conspiratorial bent terming him a skousenite126 additionally alexander zaitchik author of the 2010 book common nonsense glenn beck and the triumph of ignorance which features an entire chapter on the ghost of cleon skousen142 refers to skousen as becks favorite author and biggest influence while noting that he authored four of the 10 books on becks 912 project requiredreading list143 in his discussion of beck and skousen continetti said that one of skousens works draws on carroll quigleys tragedy and hope 1966 which argues that the history of the 20th century is the product of secret societies in conflict126 noting that in becks novel the overton window which beck describes as faction fiction based on fact one of his characters states carroll quigley laid open the plan in tragedy and hope the only hope to avoid the tragedy of war was to bind together the economies of the world to foster global stability and peace126 glenn becks viewpoint about early 20th century progressivism is greatly influenced by ronald j pestritto who holds a phd in government from claremont graduate university and currently teaches at hillsdale college144 r j pestritto has been so influential in this respect that the glennbeckcom web portals page for american progressivism 145 not only uses pestrittos teachings but links directly to one of his books professor pestritto wrote an article on the wall street journal detailing glenn beck progressives and me146 as noted on the new york times when glenn was on his fox news show professor pestritto was a regular guest147148149 princeton university historian sean wilentz says that alongside skousen robert w welch jr founder of the john birch society is a key ideological foundation of becks worldview150 according to wilentz beck has brought neobirchite ideas to an audience beyond any that welch or skousen might have dreamed of150 other books that beck regularly cites on his programs are amity shlaess the forgotten man jonah goldbergs liberal fascism larry schweikart and michael allens a patriots history of the united states and burton w folsom jrs new deal or raw deal126 beck has also urged his listeners to read the coming insurrection a book by a french marxist group126 discussing what they see as the imminent collapse of capitalist culture151 and the creature from jekyll island which argues that aspects of the us federal reserve system assault economic civil liberties by conspiracy theorist g edward griffin152 on june 4 2010 beck endorsed elizabeth dillings 1936 work the red network a whos who and handbook of radicalism for patriots remarking this is a book the red network this came in from 1936 people – joseph mccarthy was absolutely right this is who were the communists in america153 beck was criticized by an array of people including menachem z rosensaft and joe conason who stated that dilling was an outspoken antisemite and a nazi sympathizer154155156 religious beck during his religiouslythemed speech at the restoring honor rally on august 28 2010 beck has credited god for saving him from drug and alcohol abuse professional obscurity and friendlessness157 in 2006 beck performed a short inspirational monologue in salt lake city utah158 detailing how he was transformed by the healing power of jesus christ which was released as a cd two years later by deseret book a publishing company owned by the lds church entitled an unlikely mormon the conversion story of glenn beck159 writer joanna brooks contends that beck developed his amalgamation of anticommunism and connectthedots conspiracy theorizing only after his entry into the deeply insular world of mormon thought and culture136 brooks theorizes that becks calls to fasting and prayer are rooted in mormon collective fasts to address spiritual challenges while becks overt sentimentality and penchant for weeping represent the hallmark of a distinctly mormon mode of masculinity where appropriatelytimed displays of tender emotion are displays of power and spirituality136 philip barlow the arrington chair of mormon history and culture at utah state university has said that becks belief that the us constitution was an inspired document his calls for limited government and not exiling god from the public sphere have considerable sympathy in mormonism160 beck has acknowledged that mormon doctrine is different from traditional christianity but he said that this was what attracted him to it stating that for me some of the things in traditional doctrine just doesnt work161 public reception to his admirers glenn beck has been a voice crying in the wilderness a prophet who warns us that we have been wandering in darkness too long to detractors he is a clown and a buffoon at best a dangerous demagogue at worst –  lee harris the weekly standard 2010162 in 2009 becks show was one of the highest rated news commentary programs on cable tv163164165166 for a barbara walters abc special beck was selected as one of americas top 10 most fascinating people of 2009167 in 2010 beck was selected for times top 100 most influential people under the leaders category168 beck has referred to himself as an entertainer169 a commentator rather than a reporter170 and a rodeo clown169 he has said that he identifies with howard beale a character portrayed by peter finch in the film network when he came out of the rain and he was like none of this makes any sense i am that guy171 beck at the time 100 gala 2010 time magazine described beck as the new populist superstar of fox news saying it is easier to see a set of attitudes rather than a specific ideology noting his criticism of wall street yet defending bonuses to aig as well as denouncing conspiracy theories about the federal emergency management agency fema but warning against indoctrination of children by the americorps program172 paul krugman173 and mark potok174 on the other hand have been among those asserting that beck helps spread hate by covering issues that stir up extremists what seems to unite becks disparate themes time argued is a sense of siege172 an earlier cover story in time described beck as a gifted storyteller with a knack for stitching seemingly unrelated data points into possible conspiracies proclaiming that he has emerged as a virtuoso on the strings of conservative discontent by mining the timeless theme of the corrupt them thwarting a virtuous us94 becks shows have been described as a mix of moral lessons outrage and an apocalyptic view of the future capturing the feelings of an alienated class of americans169 one of becks fox news channel colleagues shepard smith has jokingly called becks studio the fear chamber with beck countering that he preferred the term doom room94 republican south carolina us senator lindsey graham criticized beck as a cynic whose show was antithetical to american values at the atlantics 2009 first draft of history conference remarking only in america can you make that much money crying175 the progressive watchdog group fairness and accuracy in reportings fair activism director peter hart argues that beck redbaits political adversaries and promotes a paranoid view of progressive politics176 howard kurtz of the washington post has remarked that love him or hate him beck is a talented often funny broadcaster a recovering alcoholic with an unabashedly emotional style61 beck was honored by liberty university during their 2010 commencement exercises with an honorary doctoral degree during his keynote address to the students he stated as a man who was never able to go to college—im the first in my family that went i went for one semester i couldnt afford more than that—i am humbly honored177 in june 2011 beck announced he was to be the honored with the zionist organization of americas 2011 defender of israel award178 laura miller writes in saloncom that beck is a contemporary example of the paranoid style in american politics described by historian richard hofstader the paranoid style in american politics reads like a playbook for the career of glenn beck right down to the paranoids quality of pedantry and heroic strivings for evidence embodied in becks chalkboard and piles of books but beck lacks an archenemy commensurate with his stratospheric ambitions which makes him appear even more absurd to outsiders179 beck has acknowledged accusations of being a conspiracy theorist stating on his show that there is a concentrated effort now to label me a conspiracy theorist180 particularly as a consequence of becks restoring honor rally in 2010 the fact that beck is mormon caused concern amongst some politically sympathetic christian evangelicals on theological grounds181182183184 tom tradup vice president at salem radio network which serves more than 2000 christianthemed stations expressed this sentiment after the rally stating politically everyone is with it but theologically when he says the country should turn back to god the question is which god157 subsequently a september 2010 survey conducted by the public religion research institute prri and religion news service rns found that of those americans who hold a favorable opinion of beck only 45 believe he is the right person to lead a religious movement with that number further declining to 37 when people are informed he is mormon185186 daniel cox director of research for prri summed up this position by stating the disparity between glenn becks favorability ratings and how people feel about him as a religious leader suggests that people are more drawn to him for political reasons than religious ones many of becks strongest supporters such as republicans and white evangelicals perceive real differences between their own faith and becks mormon faith and this may become a liability in his efforts to lead as a religious figure185 pete peterson of pepperdines davenport institute said that becks speech at the rally belonged to an american tradition of calls to personal renewal peterson wrote a mormon surrounded onstage by priests pastors rabbis and imams beck gave one of the more ecumenical jeremiads in history187 evangelical pastor tony campolo said in 2010 that conservative evangelicals respond to becks framing of conservative economic principles saying that becks and ideological fellow travelers marriage between evangelicalism and patriotic nationalism is so strong that anybody who is raising questions about loyalty to the old lassezfaire capitalist system is ex post facto unpatriotic unamerican and by association nonchristian” newsweek religion reporter lisa miller after quoting campolo opined its ironic that beck a mormon would gain acceptance as a leader of a new christian coalition becks gift is to articulate gods special plan for america in such broad strokes that they trample no single creed or doctrine while they move millions with their message188 critical biographies in june 2010 investigative reporter alexander zaitchik released a critical biography titled common nonsense glenn beck and the triumph of ignorance with a title mocking becks work common sense189 in an interview about the book zaitchik theorized becks politics and his insatiable hunger for money and fame are not mutually exclusive while stating becks true religion is not patriotism mormonism or conservatism his true religion is crossplatform selfmarketing according to becks worldview theres no inherent contradiction between his sophisticated instinct for selfpromotion his propagandist rodeo clown act his selfimage as a media mogul and his professed belief system i think he actually believes that god wants him to make a ton of money and become this huge celebrity by fear mongering and generally doing whatever it takes in the media to promote rightwing causes190 in september 2010 philadelphia daily news reporter will bunch released the backlash rightwing radicals highdef hucksters and paranoid politics in the age of obama191 one of bunchs theses is that beck is nothing more than a morning zoo deejay playing a fictional character as a moneymaking stunt191 writer bob cesca in a review of bunchs book compares beck to steve martins faithhealer character in the 1992 film leap of faith before describing the derivative grab bag of other tried and tested personalities that bunch contends comprises becks persona his becks adenoidal clydie clyde voice is based on morning zoo pioneer scott shannons mr leonard character his history is borrowed from the widely debunked work of w cleon skousen his conspiracy theories are horked from alex jones and maybe jack van impe his antiobama antisocialist monologues are pure joe mccarthy his chalkboard is stolen from televangelist gene scott his solemn overprocessed radio monologue delivery is a dead ringer for eric bogosian in talk radio this is all wellworn stuff but no one has drawn it all together and sculpted it for the purpose of conning an especially susceptible audience during turbulent racial and economic times191 in october 2010 a polemical biography by dana milbank was released tears of a clown glenn beck and the tea bagging of america192 satire spoof and parody beck has been the subject of mockery and ridicule by a number of humorists in response to becks animated delivery and views he was parodied in an impersonation by jason sudeikis on saturday night live193 the daily shows jon stewart has spoofed becks 9–12 project with his own 113 project consisting of 11 principles and 3 herbs and spices194 impersonated becks chalk boardrelated presentation style for an entire show195 and quipped about beck finally a guy who says what people who arent thinking are thinking196 stephen colbert of the colbert report satirized becks war room by creating his own doom bunker197 through the character eric cartman south park parodied becks television program and his commentary style in the episode dances with smurfs198 the onion a satirical periodical and faux news site ran an onion news network video special report where it lamented that the victim in a fatal car accident was tragically not glenn beck199 meanwhile the current tv cartoon supernews ran an animated cartoon feature titled the glenn beck apocalypse where beck is confronted by jesus christ who rebukes him as the equivalent of sarah palin farting into a balloon200 political comedian and satirist bill maher has mocked becks followers as an army of diabetic mallwalkers201 while the buffalo beast named beck the most loathsome person in america in 2010 declaring its like someone found a manic doomprophesying hobo in a sandwich board shaved him shot him full of zoloft and gave him a show36 the october 30 2010 rally to restore sanity andor fear in washington hosted by comedy central personalities jon stewart and stephen colbert was conceived as a parody of becks earlier rally to restore honor202 even though stewart and colbert said that they came up with the idea of holding a rally in march203 and stewart had put down the deposit for the national mall before beck announced his rally204 public disputes barack obama beck has a history of criticizing president barack obama but that seemed to change in 2016205 in response to obamas remarks on the henry louis gates controversy beck argued that obama has repeatedly shown a deepseated hatred for white people or the white culture saying im not saying he doesnt like white people im saying he has a problem this guy is i believe a racist206 these remarks drew criticism and resulted in a boycott promulgated by color of change207 in 2009 the boycott resulted in at least 57 advertisers requesting their ads be removed from his programming to avoid associating their brands with content that could be considered offensive by potential customers208209210 he later apologized for the remarks telling fox news sunday anchor chris wallace that he has a big fat mouth and miscast as racism what is actually as he theorizes obamas belief in black theology211 in november 2012 beck attempted to auction a mason jar holding an obama figurine described as being submerged in urine in fact submerged in beer bidding reached 11000 before ebay decided to remove the auction and cancel all bids212213 in a 2016 interview with the new yorker beck said of his previous disputes with obama i did a lot of freaking out about barack obama but added obama made me a better man beck said that he regrets calling obama a racist and that there are things unique to the africanamerican experience that i cannot relate to i had to listen to them beck now supports black lives matter205 van jones in july 2009 beck began to focus what would become many episodes on his tv and radio shows on van jones special advisor for green jobs at obamas white house council on environmental quality beck called jones an avowed selfavowed radical revolutionary communist in rating becks claim as mostly false politifact said beck would have been on solid ground if he said jones used to be a communist jones has been up front about that214 beck also criticized jones for his involvement in storm a bay area radical group with marxist roots215 and his support for death row inmate mumia abujamal who had been convicted of killing a police officer beck spotlighted video of jones referring to republicans as assholes and a petition jones signed suggesting that george w bush knowingly let the september 11 attacks happen time magazine credited beck with leading conservatives attack on jones94 in a move attributed by the new york times as a response to the controversies by the white house which had not seen joness position as senior enough to warrant a full vetting and joness decision that the agenda of this president was bigger than any one individual jones resigned his position in september 2009216 jones characterized the attacks from his opponents as a vicious smear campaign and an effort to use lies and distortions to distract and divide215 acorn in 2009 beck and other conservative commentators were critical of association of community organizations for reform now acorn for various reasons including claims of voter registration fraud in the 2008 presidential election217 in september 2009 he broadcast a series of alleged undercover videos by conservative activists james okeefe and hannah giles which portrayed acorn community organizers offering inappropriate tax and other advice to people who had said they wanted to import very young girls from el salvador to work as child prostitutes218219 following the videos release the us census bureau severed ties with the group while the us house and senate voted to cut all of its federal funding94 on december 7 2009 the former massachusetts attorney general after an independent internal investigation of acorn found the videos that had been released appeared to have been edited in some cases substantially he found no evidence of criminal conduct by acorn employees but concluded that acorn had poor management practices that contributed to unprofessional actions by a number of its lowlevel employees220221222223 on march 1 2010 the district attorneys office for brooklyn determined that the videos were heavily edited224 and concluded that there was no criminal wrongdoing by the acorn staff in the videos from the brooklyn acorn office225226 on april 1 2010 an investigation by the california attorney general found the videos from los angeles san diego and san bernardino to be heavily edited227 and the investigation did not find evidence of criminal conduct on the part of acorn employees227228 on june 14 2010 the us government accountability office gao released its findings which showed that acorn evidenced no sign that it or any of its related organizations mishandled any federal money they had received229230 in march 2010 acorn announced it would be closing its offices and disbanding due to loss of funding from government and private donors231 satire website in 2009 lawyers for beck brought a case beck v eilandhall against the owner of a satirical website named glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990com with the world intellectual property organization wipo the claim that the domain name of the website is itself defamatory was described as a first in cyberlaw232 becks lawyers argued that the site infringed on his trademarked name and that the domain name should be turned over to beck233 the wipo ruled against beck but eilandhall voluntarily transferred the domain to beck anyway saying that the first amendment had been upheld and that he no longer had a use for the domain name234 jewish funds for justice in january 2011 in protest against what they saw as inappropriate references to the holocaust and to nazis by beck and by roger ailes of fox news four hundred rabbis signed an open letter published as a paid advertisement in the wall street journal the ad was paid for by jewish funds for justice jffj which had previously called for becks firing the jffj have claimed on their website that beck seems to draw his material straight from the antisemitic forgery the protocols of the elders of zion235 the letter states that beck and fox had diminished the memory and meaning of the holocaust when you use it to discredit any individual or organization you disagree with that is what fox news has done in recent weeks in response a fox news executive said to reuters that the letter was from a george sorosbacked leftwing political organization236237 reform judaism on february 22 2011 during a discussion on his radio show about the controversy surrounding his earlier comments about soros beck said reform rabbis are generally political in nature its almost like radicalized islam in a way where its less about religion than it is about politics he was quickly criticized by other conservatives rabbis and others the antidefamation league labeled becks remarks bigoted ignorance on february 24 beck apologized on air agreeing that his comments were ignorant238239 2011 norway attacks beck condemned the 2011 norway attacks240 but later received condemnation for his comparison of murdered and surviving members of the norwegian workers youth league to the hitler youth he said there was a shooting at a political camp which sounds a little like you know the hitler youth or whatever you know what i mean who does a camp for kids thats all about politics disturbing241 the statement was illreceived in norway prompting political commentator and labour party member frank aarebrot to label beck as a vulgar propagandist a swine and a fascist242 and torbjørn eriksen former press secretary to norways prime minister jens stoltenberg to describe becks comment as a new low adding that glenn becks comments are ignorant incorrect and

his business entities the blaze and mercury radio arts along with his distributor premiere radio networks alharbis defamation claim arose from becks repeated broadcasts identifying alharbi as an
