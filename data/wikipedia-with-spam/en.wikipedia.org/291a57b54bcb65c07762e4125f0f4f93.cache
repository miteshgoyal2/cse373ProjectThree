1953–65 1969–87 and the republican partys nominee for president of the united states in the 1964 election despite losing the election by a landslide goldwater is the politician most often credited for sparking the resurgence of the american conservative political movement in the 1960s he was a vocal opponent to desegregation and the civil rights act of 1964 believing it was an overreach of federal government he also had a substantial impact on the libertarian movement2 goldwater rejected the legacy of the new deal and fought through the conservative coalition against the new deal coalition he mobilized a large conservative constituency to win the hardfought republican primaries though raised an episcopalian3 he was the first candidate with ethnically jewish heritage to be nominated for president by a major american party his father was jewish45 goldwaters conservative campaign platform ultimately failed to gain the support of the electorate6 and he lost the 1964 presidential election to incumbent democrat lyndon b johnson bringing down many conservative republican officeholders as well jeff fishel says the conservative faction of the party was on the defensive as a result of the magnitude of the election losses7 goldwater returned to the senate in 1969 and specialized in defense policy bringing to the table his experience as a senior officer in the air force reserve in 1974 as an elder statesman of the party goldwater successfully urged president richard nixon to resign when evidence of a coverup in the watergate scandal became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent by the 1980s the increasing influence of the christian right on the republican party so conflicted with goldwaters views that he became a vocal opponent of the religious right on issues such as abortion gay rights and the role of religion in public life after narrowly winning reelection to the senate in 1980 he chose not to run for a sixth term in 1986 and was succeeded by fellow republican john mccain a significant accomplishment in his career was the passage of the goldwater–nichols act of 1986 which restructured the higher levels of the pentagon by placing the chain of command from the president to the secretary of defense directly to the commanders of the unified combatant commands contents 1 personal life 11 family 12 military career 13 interests 2 political

the united states air force academy and later served on the academys board of visitors the visitor center at the academy is now named in his honor as a colonel he also founded the arizona air national guard and he would desegregate it two years before the rest of the us military goldwater was instrumental in pushing the pentagon to support desegregation of the armed services20 remaining in the arizona air national guard and air force reserve after the war he eventually retired as a command pilot with the rank of major general21 by that time he had flown 165 different types of aircraft as an air force reserve major general he continued piloting aircraft to include the b52 stratofortress until late in his military career he would remind those who called him rash of the old saying that

the human history of the state he entered phoenix politics in 1949 when he was elected to the city council as part of a nonpartisan team of candidates pledged to clean up widespread prostitution and gambling the team won every mayoral and council election for the next two decades goldwater rebuilt the weak republican party and was instrumental in electing howard pyle as governor in 19502324 us senatoredit as a republican he won a seat in the us senate in 1952 when he upset veteran democrat and senate majority leader ernest mcfarland he won largely by defeating mcfarland in his native maricopa county by 12600 votes almost double the overall margin of 6725 votes as a measure of how democratic arizona had been since joining the union 40 years earlier goldwater was only the second republican ever to represent arizona in the senate he defeated mcfarland again in 1958 with a strong showing in his first reelection he was the first arizona republican to win a second term in the senate goldwaters victory was all the more remarkable since it came in a year the democrats gained 13 seats in the senate he gave up reelection for the senate in 1964 in favor of his presidential campaign during his senate career goldwater was regarded as the grand old man of the republican party and one of the nations most respected exponents of conservatism25 criticism of the eisenhower administrationedit goldwater was outspoken about the eisenhower administration calling some of the policies of the eisenhower administration too liberal for a republican president democrats delighted in pointing out that the junior senator was so headstrong that he had gone out his way to criticize the president of his own party26 there was a democratic majority in congress for most of eisenhowers career and goldwater felt that president dwight eisenhower was compromising too much with democrats in order to get legislation passed early on in his career as a senator for arizona he criticized the 718 billion dollar budget that president eisenhower sent to congress stating now however i am not so sure a 718 billion budget not only shocks me but it weakens my faith27 goldwater opposed eisenhowers pick for chief justice of the supreme court the day that eisenhower appointed governor earl warren of california as chief justice of the supreme court goldwater did not hesitate to express his misgivings28 goldwater and the eisenhower administration supported the integration of schools in the south but goldwater felt the states should choose how they wanted to integrate and should not be forced by the federal government goldwater criticized the use of federal troops he accused the eisenhower administration of violating the constitution by assuming powers reserved by the states while he agreed that under the law every state should have integrated its schools each state should integrate in its own way29 there were high ranking government officials following goldwaters critical stance on the eisenhower administration even an army general fulbrights startling revelation that military personnel were being indoctrinated with the idea that the policies of the commander in chief were treasonous dovetailed with the return to the news of the strange case of general edwin walker30 republican presidential primary 1964edit in 1964 goldwater fought and won a multicandidate race for the republican partys presidential nomination his main rival was new york governor nelson rockefeller whom he defeated by a narrow margin in the california primary eisenhower gave his support to goldwater when he told reporters i personally believe that goldwater is not an extremist as some people have made him but in any event were all republicans31 his nomination was opposed by liberal republicans who thought goldwaters demand for rollback defeat of the soviet union would foment a nuclear war he delivered a captivating acceptance speech instead he devoted more care to his acceptance speech than to any other speech in his political career and with good reason he would deliver it to the largest and most attentive audience of his life no other statement of the 1950s and 1960s including the conscience of a conservative presents more truly barry goldwaters basic beliefs and his positions on current issues32 president lyndon b johnson with senator goldwater january 16 1964 us presidential campaign 1964edit see also barry goldwater presidential campaign 1964 and united states presidential election 1964 republican primaries results by state   no primary held   john w byrnes   barry goldwater   henry cabot lodge jr   james a rhodes   nelson rockefeller   william w scranton in south dakota and florida goldwater finished second to unpledged delegates but he finished before all other candidates at the time of goldwaters presidential candidacy the republican party was split between its conservative wing based in the west and south and moderateliberal wing sometimes called rockefeller republicans based in the northeast he alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch fiscal conservatism and militant anticommunism he was viewed by many traditional republicans as being too far on the right wing of the political spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election as a result moderate republicans recruited a series of opponents including new york governor nelson rockefeller henry cabot lodge jr of massachusetts and pennsylvania governor william scranton to challenge him goldwater would defeat rockefeller in the winnertakeall california primary and secure the nomination he also had a solid backing from southern republicans a young birmingham lawyer john grenier secured commitments from 271 of 279 southern convention delegates to back goldwater grenier would serve as executive director of the national gop during the goldwater campaign the number 2 position to party chairman dean burch of arizona journalist john adams says his acceptance speech was bold reflecting his conservative views but not irrational rather than shrinking from those critics who accuse him of extremism goldwater challenged them headon in his acceptance speech at the 1964 republican convention33 in his own words i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue34 his paraphrase of cicero was included at the suggestion of harry v jaffa though the speech was primarily written by karl hess because of president johnsons popularity goldwater refrained from attacking the president directly he did not mention johnson by name at all in his convention speech ronald reagan speaks for presidential candidate goldwater in los angeles in 1964 former us senator prescott bush a moderate republican from connecticut was a friend of goldwater and supported him in the general election campaign bushs son george h w bush then running for the senate from texas against democrat ralph yarborough was also a strong goldwater supporter in both the nomination and general election campaigns future chief justice of the united states and fellow arizonan william h rehnquist also first came to the attention of national republicans through his work as a legal adviser to goldwaters presidential campaign rehnquist had begun his law practice in 1953 in the firm of denison kitchel of phoenix goldwaters national campaign manager and friend of nearly three decades35 goldwater was painted as a dangerous figure by the johnson campaign which countered goldwaters slogan in your heart you know hes right with the lines in your guts you know hes nuts and in your heart you know he might that is he might actually use nuclear weapons as opposed to using only deterrence johnson himself did not mention goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the 1964 democratic national convention goldwaters provocative advocacy of aggressive tactics to prevent the spread of communism in asia led to effective counterattacks from lyndon b johnson and his supporters who claimed that goldwaters militancy would have dire consequences possibly even nuclear war in a may 1964 speech goldwater suggested that nuclear weapons should be treated more like conventional weapons and used in vietnam specifically that they should have been used at dien bien phu in 1954 to defoliate trees36 regarding vietnam goldwater charged that johnsons policy was devoid of goal course or purpose leaving only sudden death in the jungles and the slow strangulation of freedom37 goldwaters rhetoric on nuclear war was viewed by many as quite uncompromising a view buttressed by offhand comments such as lets lob one into the mens room at the kremlin38 he also advocated that field commanders in vietnam and europe should be given the authority to use tactical nuclear weapons which he called small conventional nuclear weapons without presidential confirmation39 1964 presidential campaign bumper sticker representing the goldwater surname as au gold and h2o water goldwater countered the johnson attacks by criticizing the administration for its perceived ethical lapses and stating in a commercial that we as a nation are not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people i say it is time to put conscience back in government and by good example put it back in all walks of american life goldwater campaign commercials included statements of support by actor raymond massey40 and moderate republican senator margaret chase smith41 before the 1964 election fact magazine published by ralph ginzburg ran a special issue titled the unconscious of a conservative a special issue on the mind of barry goldwater the two main articles contended that goldwater was mentally unfit to be president the magazine supported this claim with the results of a poll of boardcertified psychiatrists fact had mailed questionnaires to 12356 psychiatrists receiving responses from 2417 of whom 1189 said goldwater was mentally incapable of holding the office of president most of the other respondents declined to diagnose goldwater because they had not clinically interviewed him but claimed that although not psychologically unfit to preside goldwater would be negligent and egregious in the role4243 after the election goldwater sued the publisher the editor and the magazine for libel in goldwater v ginzburg although the jury awarded goldwater only 100 in compensatory damages against all three defendants it went on to award him punitive damages of 25000 against ginzburg and 50000 against fact magazine inc44 according to warren boroson thenmanaging editor of fact and now a financial columnist the main biography of goldwater in the magazine was written by david barillan the israeli pianist45 political advertisingedit main article daisy advertisement a democratic campaign advertisement known as daisy showed a young girl counting daisy petals from one to ten immediately following this scene a voiceover counted down from ten to one the childs face was shown as a still photograph followed by images of nuclear explosions and mushroom clouds the campaign advertisement ended with a plea to vote for johnson implying that goldwater though not mentioned by name would provoke a nuclear war if elected the advertisement which featured only a few spoken words and relied on imagery for its emotional impact was one of the most provocative in american political campaign history and many analysts credit it as being the birth of the modern style of negative political ads on television the ad aired only once and was immediately pulled but it was then shown many times by local television stations46 ku klux klan members supporting goldwaters campaign for the presidential nomination at the 1964 republican national convention goldwater did not have ties to the ku klux klan kkk but was publicly endorsed by members of the organization4748 lyndon johnson exploited this association during the elections495051 but goldwater barred the kkk from supporting him and denounced them52 past comments came back to haunt goldwater throughout the campaign he had once called the eisenhower administration a dimestore new deal and the former president never fully forgave him eisenhower did however film a television commercial with goldwater53 eisenhower qualified his voting for goldwater in november by remarking that he had voted not specifically for goldwater but for the republican party54 in december 1961 goldwater had told a news conference that sometimes i think this country would be better off if we could just saw off the eastern seaboard and let it float out to sea that comment boomeranged on him during the campaign in the form of a johnson television commercial55 as did remarks about making social security voluntary56 and statements in tennessee about selling the tennessee valley authority a large local new deal employer57 the goldwater campaign spotlighted ronald reagan who appeared in a campaign ad58 in turn reagan gave a stirring nationally televised speech a time for choosing in support of goldwater59 the speech prompted reagan to seek the california governorship in 1966 and jumpstarted his political career conservative activist phyllis schlafly later well known for her fight against the equal rights amendment first became known for writing a progoldwater book a choice not an echo attacking the moderate republican establishment resultsedit presidential election results by state goldwater lost to president lyndon johnson by a landslide pulling down the gop which lost many seats in both houses of congress goldwater only won his home state of arizona and five states in the deep south depicted in red the southern states traditionally democratic up to that time voted republican primarily as a statement of opposition to the civil rights act which had been passed by johnson and the northern democrats as well as the majority of republicans in congress earlier that year6061 in the end goldwater received 38 of the popular vote and carried just six states arizona with 51 of the popular vote and the core states of the deep south alabama georgia louisiana mississippi and south carolina in carrying georgia by a margin of 54–45 goldwater became the first republican nominee to win the state however the overall result was the worst showing in terms of popular vote and electoral college vote for any postworld war ii republican indeed he wouldnt have even carried his own state if not for a 20000vote margin in maricopa county in all johnson won an overwhelming 486 electoral votes to goldwaters 52 goldwater with his customary bluntness remarked we would have lost even if abraham lincoln had come back and campaigned with us he maintained later in life that he would have won the election if the country had not been in a state of extended grief following the assassination of john f kennedy and that it was simply not ready for a third president in just 14 months goldwaters poor showing pulled down many supporters of the 57 republican congressmen who endorsed goldwater before the convention 20 were defeated for reelection along with many promising young republicans on the other hand the defeat of so many older politicians created openings for young conservatives to move up the ladder while the loss of moderate republicans was temporary—they were back by 1966—goldwater also permanently pulled many conservative southerners and white ethnics out of the new deal coalition62 according to steve kornacki of salon in the south goldwater broke through and won five states—the best showing in the region for a gop candidate since reconstruction in mississippi—where franklin d roosevelt had won nearly 100 percent of the vote 28 years earlier—goldwater claimed a staggering 87 percent63 it has frequently been argued that goldwaters strong performance in southern states previously regarded as democratic strongholds foreshadowed a larger shift in electoral trends in the coming decades that would make the south a republican bastion an end to the solid south—first in presidential politics and eventually at the congressional and state levels as well64 also goldwaters uncompromising promotion of freedom was the start of a continuing shift in american politics from liberalism to a conservative economic philosophy65 return to us senateedit goldwater remained popular in arizona and in the 1968 senate election he was elected this time to the seat of retiring senator carl hayden he was subsequently reelected in 1974 and 1980 the 1974 election saw goldwater easily reelected over his democratic opponent jonathan marshall the publisher of the scottsdale progress his final campaign in 1980 was close with goldwater winning in a near draw against democratic challenger bill schulz goldwater said later that the close result convinced him not to run again66 retirementedit goldwater seriously considered retirement in 1980 before deciding to run for reelection peggy goldwater reportedly hoped that her husbands senate term due to end in january 1981 would be his last goldwater decided to run planning to make the term his last in the senate goldwater faced a surprisingly tough battle for reelection he was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons most importantly because he had planned to retire in 1981 goldwater had not visited many areas of arizona outside of phoenix and tucson he was also challenged by a formidable opponent bill schulz a former republican turned democrat and a wealthy real estate developer schulz was able to infuse massive amounts of money into the campaign from his own fortune arizonas changing population also hurt goldwater the states population had soared and a huge portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when goldwater was previously elected hence many voters were less familiar with goldwaters actual beliefs and he was on the defensive for much of the campaign early returns on election night seemed to indicate that schulz would win the counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning at around daybreak goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to absentee ballots which were among the last to be counted67 goldwaters surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite reagans 61 landslide over jimmy carter in arizona republicans regained control of the senate putting goldwater in the most powerful position he ever had in the senate goldwater retired in 1987 serving as chair of the senate intelligence and armed services committees in his final term despite his reputation as a firebrand in the 1960s by the end of his career he was considered a stabilizing influence in the senate one of the most respected members of either major party though goldwater remained staunchly anticommunist and hawkish on military issues he was a key supporter of the fight for ratification of the panama canal treaty in the 1970s which would give control of the canal zone to the republic of panama his most important legislative achievement may have been the goldwater–nichols act which reorganized the us militarys seniorcommand structure policiesedit goldwater became most associated with laborunion reform and anticommunism he was an active supporter of the conservative coalition in congress his work on labor issues led to congress passing major anticorruption reforms in 1957 and an allout campaign by the aflcio to defeat his 1958 reelection bid he voted against the censure of senator joseph mccarthy in 1954 but he never actually charged any individual with being a communistsoviet agent goldwater emphasized his strong opposition to the worldwide spread of communism in his 1960 book the conscience of a conservative the book became an important reference text in conservative political circles informal press conference august 7 1974 one day before nixon announced his resignation following a meeting between goldwater senate minority leader scott house minority leader rhodes and the president to discuss the watergate scandal and impeachment process in 1964 goldwater ran a conservative campaign that emphasized states rights68 goldwaters 1964 campaign was a magnet for conservatives since he opposed interference by the federal government in state affairs although he had supported all previous federal civil rights legislation and had supported the original senate version of the bill goldwater made the decision to oppose the civil rights act of 1964 his stance was based on his view that the article ii and article vii of the act interfered with the rights of private persons to do or not to do business with whomever they chose and believed that the private employment provisions of the act would lead to racial quotas69 in the segregated city of phoenix in the 1950s he had quietly supported civil rights for blacks but would not let his name be used70 all this appealed to white southern democrats and goldwater was the first republican to win the electoral votes of all of the deep south states south carolina georgia alabama mississippi and louisiana since reconstruction60 although dwight eisenhower did carry louisiana in 1956 however goldwaters vote on the civil rights act proved devastating to his campaign everywhere outside the south besides dixie goldwater won only in arizona his home state contributing to his landslide defeat in 1964 while goldwater had been depicted by his opponents in the republican primaries as a representative of a conservative philosophy that was extreme and alien his voting records show that his positions were in harmony with those of his fellow republicans in the congress what distinguished him from his predecessors was according to hans j morgenthau his firmness of principle and determination which did not allow him to be content with mere rhetoric71 goldwater fought in 1971 to stop us funding of the united nations after the peoples republic of china was admitted to the organization he said i suggested on the floor of the senate today that we stop all funds for the united nations now what thatll do to the united nations i dont know i have a hunch it would cause them to fold up which would make me very happy at this particular point i think if this happens they can well move their headquarters to peking or moscow and get em out of this country72 political relationshipsedit goldwater was griefstricken73 by the assassination of kennedy and was greatly disappointed that his opponent in 1964 would not be kennedy but instead his vice president former senate majority leader lyndon b johnson of texas74 goldwater disliked johnson saying he used every dirty trick in the bag and richard m nixon of california whom he later called the most dishonest individual i have ever met in my life74 after goldwater again became a senator he urged nixon to resign at the height of the watergate scandal warning that fewer than ten senators would vote against conviction if nixon were impeached by the house of representatives75 the term goldwater moment has since been used to describe situations when influential members of congress disagree so strongly with a president from their own party that they openly oppose himcitation needed goldwater and the revival of american conservatismedit although goldwater was not as important in the american conservative movement as ronald reagan after 1965 he shaped and redefined the movement from the late 1950s to 1964 arizona senator john mccain who had succeeded goldwater in the senate in 1987 summed up goldwaters legacy he transformed the republican party from an eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of ronald reagan76 columnist george will remarked after the 1980 presidential election that it took 16 years to count the votes from 1964 and goldwater won77 the republican party recovered from the 1964 election debacle picking up 47 seats in the house of representatives in the 1966 midterm election further republican successes ensued including goldwaters return to the senate in 1969 in january of that year goldwater wrote an article in the national review affirming that he was not against liberals that liberals are needed as a counterweight to conservatism and that he had in mind a fine liberal like max lerner78 goldwater was a strong supporter of the environment he explained his position in 1969 i feel very definitely that the nixon administration is absolutely correct in cracking down on companies and corporations and municipalities that continue to pollute the nations air and water while i am a great believer in the free competitive enterprise system and all that it entails i am an even stronger believer in the right of our people to live in a clean and pollutionfree environment to this end it is my belief that when pollution is found it should be halted at the source even if this requires stringent government action against important segments of our national economy79 throughout the 1970s as the conservative wing under reagan gained control of the party goldwater concentrated on his senate duties especially in military affairs he played little part in the election or administration of richard nixon but he helped force nixons resignation in 197480 in 1976 he helped block rockefellers renomination as vice president when reagan challenged ford for the presidential nomination in 1976 goldwater endorsed ford looking for consensus rather than conservative idealism as one historian notes the arizonan had lost much of his zest for battle818283 in 1979 when president carter normalized relations with communist china goldwater and some other senators sued him in the supreme court

dismissed by the court as a political question later lifeedit signing autographs at the fiesta bowl parade in 1983 by the 1980s with ronald reagan as president and the growing involvement of the religious right in conservative politics goldwaters libertarian views on personal issues were revealed he believed that they were an integral part of true conservatism goldwater viewed abortion as a matter of personal choice and as such supported abortion rights84 as a passionate defender of personal liberty he saw the religious rights views as an encroachment on personal privacy and individual liberties85 in his 1980 senate reelection campaign goldwater won support from religious conservatives but in his final term voted consistently to uphold legalized abortion and in 1981 gave a speech on how he was angry about the bullying of american politicians by religious organizations and would fight them every step of the way868788 goldwater also disagreed with the reagan administration on certain aspects of foreign policy for example he opposed the decision to mine nicaraguan harbors notwithstanding his prior differences with dwight d eisenhower goldwater in a 1986 interview rated him the best of the seven presidents with whom he had worked he introduced the 1984 cable franchise policy and communications act which allowed local governments to require the transmission of public

arms sales it had just been announced that the reagan administration had sold arms to iran and i said well if i asked you what would you say he said id say its the goddamned stupidest foreign policy blunder this countrys ever made95 though aside from the iran–contra scandal goldwater thought nonetheless that reagan was a good president96 in 1988 during that years presidential campaign he

government was withholding ufo evidence he replied yes i do he added i certainly believe in aliens in space they may not look like us but i have very strong feelings that they have advanced beyond our
