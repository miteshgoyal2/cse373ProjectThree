by genetic ancestry would produce a higher number historical reasons including slavery creating a racial caste and the europeanamerican suppression of native americans often led people to identify or be classified by only one ethnicity generally that of the culture in which they were raised4 prior to the mid20th century many people hid their multiracial heritage because of racial discrimination against minorities4 while many americans may be biologically multiracial they often do not know it or do not identify so culturally any more than they maintain all the differing traditions of a variety of national ancestries4 after a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former confederacy following the reconstruction era and bans on interracial marriage in various parts of the country more people are openly forming interracial unions in addition social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to pass as white diverse immigration has brought more mixedrace people into the united states such as the large population of hispanics identifying as mestizos since the 1980s the united states has had a growing multiracial identity movement cf loving day5 because more americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethnoracial identity and thereby identify as multiracial in 2008 barack obama was elected as the first multiracial president of the united states he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as african american6 today multiracial individuals are found in every corner of the country multiracial groups in the united states include many african americans louisiana

jim crow laws miscegenation mulatto colored and interracial marriage in the united states the american people are mostly multiethnic descendants of various culturally distinct immigrant groups many of which have now developed nations some consider themselves multiracial while acknowledging race as a social construct creolization assimilation and integration have been continuing processes the civil rights movement and other social movements since the midtwentieth century worked to achieve social justice and equal enforcement of civil rights under the constitution for all ethnicities in the 2000s less than 5 of the population identified as multiracial in many instances mixed racial ancestry is so far back in an individuals family history for instance before the civil war or earlier that it does not affect more recent ethnic and cultural identification interracial relationships commonlaw marriages and marriages occurred since the earliest colonial years especially before slavery hardened as a racial caste associated with people of african descent in the british colonies virginia and other english colonies passed laws in the 17th century that gave children the social status of their mother according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem regardless of the fathers race or citizenship this overturned the principle in english common law by which a man gave his status to his children – this had enabled communities to demand that fathers support their children whether legitimate or not the change increased white mens ability to use slave women sexually as they had no responsibility for the children as master as well as father of mixedrace children born into slavery the men could use these people as servants or laborers or sell them as slaves in some cases white fathers provided for their multiracial children paying or arranging for education or apprenticeships and freeing them particularly during the two decades following the american revolution the practice of providing for the children was more common in french and spanish colonies where a class of free people of color developed who became educated and property owners many other white fathers abandoned the mixedrace children and their mothers to slavery the researcher paul heinegg found that most families of free people of color in colonial times were founded from the unions of white women whether free or indentured servants and african men slave indentured or free7 in the early years the workingclass peoples lived and worked together their children were free because of the status of the white women this was in contrast to the pattern in the postrevolutionary era in which most mixedrace children had white fathers and slave mothers7 antimiscegenation laws were passed in most states during the 18th 19th and early 20th centuries but this did not prevent white slaveholders their sons or other powerful white men from taking slave women as concubines and having multiracial children with them in california and the western us there were greater numbers of latino and asian residents these were prohibited from official relationships with whites white legislators passed laws prohibiting marriage between european and asian americans until the 1950s early united states historyedit olaudah equiano interracial relationships have had a long history in north america and the united states beginning with the intermixing of european explorers and soldiers who took native women as companions after european settlement increased traders and fur trappers often married or had unions with women of native tribes in the 17th century faced with a continuing critical labor shortage colonists primarily in the chesapeake bay colony imported africans as laborers sometimes as indentured servants and increasingly as slaves african slaves were also imported into new york and other northern ports by the dutch and later english some african slaves were freed by their masters during these early years in the colonial years while conditions were more fluid white women indentured servant or free and african men servant slave or free made unions because the women were free their mixedrace children were born free they and their descendants formed most of the families of free people of color during the colonial period in virginia the scholar paul heinegg found that eighty percent of the free people of color in north carolina in censuses from 1790–1810 could be traced to families free in virginia in colonial years8 in 1789 olaudah equiano a former slave from nigeria who was enslaved in north america published his autobiography he advocated interracial marriage between whites and blacks9 by the late eighteenth century visitors to the upper south noted the high proportion of mixedrace slaves evidence of miscegenation by white men in 1790 the first federal population census was taken in the united states enumerators were instructed to classify free residents as white or other only the heads of households were identified by name in the federal census until 1850 native americans were included among other in later censuses they were included as free people of color if they were not living on indian reservations slaves were counted separately from free persons in all the censuses until the civil war and end of slavery in later censuses people of african descent were classified by appearance as mulatto which recognized visible european ancestry in addition to african or black after the american revolutionary war the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the north and the south as slaves were freed most northern states abolished slavery sometimes like new york in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed the last slaves in new york were not freed until 1827 in connection with the second great awakening quaker and methodist preachers in the south urged slaveholders to free their slaves revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves some by deed and others by will so that from 1782 to 1810 the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the south10 19th century american civil war emancipation reconstruction and jim crowedit charley taylor holding an american flag charley was the son of alexander withers and one of witherss slaves withers sold charley to a slave dealer and he was sold again in new orleans of numerous relationships between male slaveholders overseers or masters sons and women slaves the most notable is likely that of president thomas jefferson with his slave sally hemings as noted in the 2012 collaborative smithsonianmonticello exhibit slavery at monticello the paradox of liberty jefferson then a widower took hemings as his concubine for nearly 40 years they had six children of record four hemings children survived into adulthood and he freed them all among the very few slaves he freed two were allowed to escape to the north in 1822 and two were granted freedom by his will upon his death in 1826 seveneighths white by ancestry all four of his hemings children moved to northern states as adults three of the four entered the white community and all their descendants identified as white of the descendants of madison hemings who continued to identify as black some in future generations eventually identified as white and married out while others continued to identify as african american it was socially advantageous for the hemings children to identify as white in keeping with their appearance and the majority proportion of their ancestry although born into slavery the hemings children were legally white under virginia law of the time 20th centuryedit racial discrimination continued to be enacted in new laws in the 20th century for instance the onedrop rule was enacted in virginias 1924 racial integrity law and in other southern states in part influenced by the popularity of eugenics and ideas of racial purity people buried fading memories that many whites had multiracial ancestry many families were multiracial similar laws had been proposed but not passed in the late nineteenth century in south carolina and virginia for instance after regaining political power in southern states by disenfranchising blacks white democrats passed laws to impose jim crow and racial segregation to restore white supremacy they maintained these until forced to change in the 1960s and after by enforcement of federal legislation authorizing oversight of practices to protect the constitutional rights of african americans and other minority citizens in 1967 the united states supreme court case loving v virginia ruled that antimiscegenation laws were unconstitutional11 in the twentieth century up until 1989 social service organizations typically assigned multiracial children to the racial identity of the minority parent which reflected social practices of hypodescent12 black social workers had influenced court decisions on regulations related to identity they argued that as the biracial child was socially considered black it should be classified that way in order to identify with the group and learn to deal with discrimination13 by 1990 the census bureau included more than a dozen ethnicracial categories on the census reflecting not only changing social ideas about ethnicity but the wide variety of immigrants who had come to reside in the united states due to changing historical forces and new immigration laws in the 1960s with a changing society more citizens have begun to press for acknowledging multiracial ancestry the census bureau changed its data collection by allowing people to selfidentify as more than one ethnicity some ethnic groups are concerned about the potential political and economic effects as federal assistance to historically underserved groups has depended on census data according to the census bureau as of 2002 over 75 of all african americans had multiracial ancestries14 the proportion of acknowledged multiracial children in the united states is growing interracial partnerships are on the rise as are transracial adoptions in 1990 around 14 of 18 to 19yearolds 12 of 20 to 21yearolds and 7 of 34 to 35yearolds were involved in interracial relationships joyner and kao 200515 demographicsedit further information racial and ethnic demographics of the united states multiracial people who wanted to acknowledge their full heritage won a victory of sorts in 1997 when the office of management and budget omb changed the federal regulation of racial categories to permit multiple responses this resulted in a change to the 2000 united states census which allowed participants to select more than one of the six available categories which were in brief white black or african american asian american indian or alaskan native native hawaiian or other pacific islander and other further details are given in the article race us census the omb made its directive mandatory for all government forms by 2003 in 2000 cindy rodriguez reported on reactions to the new census to many mainline civil rights groups the new census is part of a multiracial nightmare after decades of framing racial issues in stark black and white terms they fear that the multiracial movement will break down longstanding alliances weakening people of color by splintering them into new subgroups16 some multiracial individuals feel marginalized by us society for example when applying to schools or for a job or when taking standardized tests americans are sometimes asked to check boxes corresponding to race or ethnicity typically about five race choices are given with the instruction to check only one while some surveys offer an other box this choice groups together individuals of many different multiracial types ex european americansafricanamericans are grouped with asiannative american indians the 2000 us census in the writein response category had a code listing which standardizes the placement of various writein responses for automatic placement within the framework of the us censuss enumerated races whereas most responses can be distinguished as falling into one of the five enumerated races there remains some writein responses which fall into the mixture heading which cannot be racially categorized these include bi racial combination everything many mixed multi national multiple several and various17 in 1997 greg mayeda a member of the board of directors person for the hapa issues forum attended a meeting regarding the new racial classifications for the 2000 us census he was arguing against a multiracial category and for multiracial people being counted as all of their races he argued that a separate multiracial box does not allow a person who identifies as mixed race the opportunity to be counted accurately after all we are not just mixed race we are representatives of all racial groups and should be counted as such a stand alone multiracial box reveals very little about the persons background checking it18 according to james p allen and eugene turner from california state university northridge who analyzed the 2000 census most multiracial people identified as part white in addition the breakdown is as follows whitenative american and alaskan native at 7015017 whiteblack at 737492 whiteasian at 727197 and whitenative hawaiian and other pacific islander at 12562819 in 2010 16 million americans checked both black and white on their census forms a figure 134 higher than the number a decade earlier20 the number of interracial marriages and relationships and transracial and international adoptions has increased the proportion of multiracial families21 in addition more individuals may be identifying multiple ancestries as the concept is more widely accepted multiracial familiesedit a 2004 california wedding between a filipina

mixedrace children having identity problems charlotte nitary states wardle 1989 says that today parents assume one of three positions as to the identity of their interracial children some insist that their child is human above all else and that race or ethnicity is irrelevant while others choose to raise their children with the identity of the parent of color another growing group of parents is insisting that the child have the ethnic racial cultural and genetic heritage of both parents13 in her book loves revolution interracial marriage maria p p root writes women with children especially biracial children have fewer chances for remarriage than childless women and because the children of divorce tend to remain with mothers becoming incorporated into new families when their mothers remarry interracial children are more threatening markers of race and racial authenticity for families in which race matters22 in 2009 keith bardwell a justice of the peace in robert louisiana refused to officiate a wedding for an interracial couple and was summarily sued in federal court see refusal of interracial marriage in louisiana about 15 of all new marriages in the united states in 2010 were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity from one another more than double the share in 1980 6723 multiracial american identityedit given the variety of the familial and general social environments in which multiracial children are raised along with the diversity of their appearance and heritage generalizations about multiracial childrens challenges or opportunities are not very useful the social identity of children and of their parents in the same multiracial family may vary or be the same24 some multiracial children feel pressure from various sources to choose or to identify as a single racial identity others may feel pressure not to abandon one or more of their ethnicities particularly if identified with culturally some multiracial individuals attempt to claim a new category for instance the athlete tiger woods has said that he is not only african american but cablinasian as he is of caucasian african american native american and asian descent25 some children grow up without race being a significant issue in their lives being multiracial can still be problematic most constructions of race in america revolve around a peculiar institution known as the onedrop rule the onedrop conceit shapes both racism—creating an arbitrary caste—and the collective response against it to identify as multiracial is to challenge this logic and consequently to fall outside both camps26 many monoracials do view a multiracial identity as a choice that denies loyalty to the oppressed racial group we can see this issue enacted currently over the debate of the us census to include a multiracial category— some oppressed monoracial groups believe this category would decrease their numbers and benefits12 many students who called themselves halfasianblacketc came to college in search of cultural knowledge but found themselves unwelcome in groups of peers that were whole ethnicities renn 1998 she found that as a result of this exclusion many multiracial students expressed the need to create and maintain a selfidentified multiracial community on campus multiracial people may identify more with each other because they share the experience of navigating campus life as multiracial people renn 1998 than with their component ethnic groups multiracial students of different ancestries have their own experiences in common27 keanu reeves has an english

including alaska native70 of these more than 27 specifically indicated cherokee as their ethnic origin7172 many of the first families of virginia claim descent from pocahontas or some other indian princess this phenomenon has been dubbed the cherokee syndrome73 across the us numerous individuals cultivate an opportunistic ethnic identity as native american sometimes through cherokee heritage groups or indian wedding blessings74 many tribes especially those in the eastern united states are primarily made up of individuals with an unambiguous native american identity despite being predominantly of european ancestry74 point in case more than 75 of those enrolled in the cherokee nation have less than onequarter cherokee blood75 and the current principal chief of the cherokee nation bill john baker is 132 cherokee amounting to about 3 historically numerous native americans assimilated into colonial and later american society eg through adopting english and converting to christianity in many cases this process occurred through forced assimilation of children sent off to special boarding schools far from their families those who could pass for white had the advantage of white privilege74 today after generations of racial whitening through hypergamy many native americans are visually indistinguishable from white americans unlike mestizos in the united states who may in fact have little or no nonindigenous ancestry76 native americans are more likely than any other racial group to practice racial exogamy resulting in an everdeclining proportion of indigenous blood among those who claim a native american identity77 some tribes will even resort to disenrollment of tribal members unable to provide scientific proof of native ancestry usually through a certificate of degree of indian blood disenrollment has become a contentious issue in native american reservation politics7879 black and african american identityedit see also atlantic creole black

for historical reasons slavery partus sequitur ventrem oneeighth law the onedrop rule of 20thcentury legislation have frequently been classified as black historically or african american even if they have significant european american or native american ancestry as slavery became a racial caste those who were enslaved and others of any african ancestry were classified by what is termed hypodescent according to the lower status ethnic group many of majority european ancestry and appearance married white and assimilated into white society for its social and economic advantages such as generations of families identified as melungeons now generally classified as white but demonstrated genetically to be of european and subsaharan african ancestry sometimes people of mixed africanamerican and native american descent report having had elder family members withholding pertinent genealogical information80 tracing the genealogy of african americans can be a very difficult process as censuses did not identify slaves by name before the american civil war meaning that most african americans did not appear by name in those records in addition many white fathers who used slave women sexually even those in longterm relationships like thomas jeffersons with sally hemings did not acknowledge their mixedrace slave children in records so paternity was lost colonial records of french and spanish slave ships and sales and plantation records in all the former colonies often have much more information about slaves from which researchers are reconstructing slave family histories genealogists have begun to find plantation records court records land deeds and other sources to trace africanamerican families and individuals before 1870 as slaves were generally forbidden to learn to read and write black families passed along oral histories which have had great persistence similarly native americans did not generally learn to read and write english although some did in the nineteenth century80 until 1930 census enumerators used the terms free people of color and mulatto to classify people of apparent mixed race when those terms were dropped as a result of the lobbying by the southern congressional bloc the census bureau used only the binary classifications of black or white as was typical in segregated southern states in the 1980s parents of mixedrace children began to organize and lobby for the addition of a more inclusive term of racial designation that would reflect the heritage of their children when the us government proposed the addition of the category of biracial or multiracial in 1988 the response from the public was mostly negative some africanamerican organizations and africanamerican political leaders such as congresswoman diane watson and congressman augustus hawkins were particularly vocal in their rejection of the category as they feared the loss of political and economic power if african americans reduced their numbers by selfidentification81 since the 1990s and 2000s the terms mixedrace biracial and multiracial have been used more frequently in society it is still most common in the united states unlike some other countries with a history of slavery for people with visible african features to identify as or be classified solely as blacks or african americans regardless of other also obvious ancestry president barack obama is of east african and european american ancestry he identifies as african american82 a 2007 poll when obama was a presidential candidate found that americans differed in their responses as to how they classified him a majority of white and hispanics classified him as biracial but a majority of african americans classified him as black83 a 2003 study found an average of 186 ±15 european admixture in a population sample of 416 african americans from washington dc84 studies of other populations in other areas have found differing percentages of ethnicity twenty percent of african americans have more than 25 european ancestry reflecting the long history of unions between the groups the mostly african group is substantially african as 70 of african americans in this group have less than 15 european ancestry the 20 of african americans in the mostly mixed group 27 of us population have between 25 and 50 european ancestry85 the writer sherrel w stewarts assertion that most african americans have significant native american heritage86 is not supported by genetic researchers who have done extensive population mapping studies the tv series on africanamerican ancestry hosted by the scholar henry louis gates jr had genetics scholars who discussed in detail the variety of ancestries among african americans they noted there is popular belief in a high rate of native american admixture that is not supported by the data that has been collected reference is coming genetic testing of direct male and female lines evaluates only two out of an individuals lines of ancestry87 for this reason individuals on the gates show had fuller dna testing the critic troy duster writing in the chronicle of higher education thought gates series african american lives should have told people more about the limitations of genetic snp testing he says that not all ancestry may show up in the tests especially for those who claim partnative american descent8788 other experts also agree89 population testing is still being done some native american groups that have been sampled may not have shared the pattern of markers being searched for geneticists acknowledge that dna testing cannot yet distinguish among members of differing cultural native american nations there is genetic evidence for three major migrations into north america but not for more recent historic differentiation88 in addition not all native americans have been tested so scientists do not know for sure that native americans have only the genetic markers they have identified8788 oprah

the united states miscegenation onedrop rule and african american on census forms the government depends on individuals selfidentification contemporary african americans possess varying degrees of admixture with european ancestry a percentage also have various degrees of native american ancestry9697 many free african american families descended from unions between white women and african men in colonial virginia their free descendants migrated to the frontier of virginia north carolina and south carolina in the 18th and 19th centuries there were also similar free families in delaware and maryland as documented by paul heinegg98 in addition many native american women turned to african american men due to the decline in the number of native american men due to disease and warfare99 some native american women bought african slaves but unknown to european sellers the women freed the african men and married them into their respective tribes99 if an african american man had children by a native american woman their children were free because of the status of the mother99 in their attempt to ensure white supremacy decades after emancipation in the early 20th century most southern states created laws based on the onedrop rule defining as black persons with any known african ancestry this was a stricter interpretation than what had prevailed in the 19th century it ignored the many mixed families in the state and went against commonly accepted social rules of judging a person by appearance and association some courts called it the traceable amount rule anthropologists called it an example of a hypodescent rule meaning that racially mixed persons were assigned the status of the socially subordinate group prior to the onedrop rule different states had different laws regarding color more importantly social acceptance often played a bigger role in how a person was perceived and how identity was construed than any law in frontier areas there were fewer questions about origins the community looked at how people performed whether they served in the militia and voted which were the responsibilities and signs of free citizens when questions about racial identity arose because of inheritance issues for instance litigation outcomes often were based on how people were accepted by neighbors100 in virginia prior to 1920 for example a person was legally white if having seveneights or more white ancestry the onedrop rule originated in some southern united states in the late 19th century likely in response to whites attempt to maintain white supremacy and limit black political power following the democrats regaining control of state legislatures in the late 1870s101unreliable source102unreliable source the first year in which the us census dropped the mulatto category was 1920 that year enumerators were instructed to classify people in a binary way as white or black this was a result of the southerndominated congress convincing the census bureau to change its rules102 after the civil war racial segregation forced african americans to share more of a common lot in society than they might have given widely varying ancestry educational and economic levels the binary division altered the separate status of the traditionally free people of color in louisiana for instance although they maintained a strong louisiana créole culture related to french culture and language and practice of catholicism african americans began to create common cause—regardless of their multiracial admixture or social and economic stratification in 20thcentury changes during the rise of the civil rights and black power movements the africanamerican community increased its own pressure for people of any portion of african descent to be claimed by the black community to add to its power by the 1980s parents of mixedrace children and adults of mixedrace ancestry began to organize and lobby for the ability to show more than one ethnic category on census and other legal forms they refused to be put into just one category when the us government proposed the addition of the category of biracial or multiracial in 1988 the response from the general public was mostly negative some africanamerican organizations and political leaders such as senator diane watson and representative augustus hawkins were particularly vocal in their rejection of the category they feared a loss in political and economic power if african americans abandoned their one category this reaction is characterized as historical irony by reginald daniel 2002 the african american selfdesignation had been a response to the onedrop rule but then people resisted the chance to claim their multiple heritages at the bottom was a desire not to lose political power of the larger group whereas before people resisted being characterized as one group regardless of ranges of ancestry now some of their own were trying to keep them in the same group81 martin luther king jr was of irish

number of african and caribbean ethnic african immigrants have increased in the united states together with publicity about the ancestry of president barack obama whose father was from kenya some black writers have argued that new terms are needed for recent immigrants they suggest that the term africanamerican should refer strictly to the descendants of african slaves and free people of color who survived the slavery era in the united states113 they argue that grouping together all ethnic africans regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would deny the lingering effects of slavery within the american slave descendant community113 they say recent ethnic african immigrants need to recognize their own unique ancestral backgrounds113 stanley crouch wrote in a new york daily news piece obamas mother is of white us stock his father is a black kenyan in a column entitled what obama isnt black like me during the 2008 campaign the mixedrace columnist david ehrenstein who is less than half africanamerican of the la times accused white liberals of flocking to obama because he was a magic negro a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white as cultural protagonistsdrivers agenda114 ehrenstein went on to say hes there to assuage white guilt they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in american history114 reacting to media criticism of michelle obama during the 2008 presidential election charles kenzie steele jr ceo of the southern christian leadership conference said why are they attacking michelle obama and not really attacking to that degree her husband because he has no slave blood in him115 he later claimed his comment was intended to be provocative but declined to expand on the subject115 former secretary of state condoleezza rice who was famously mistaken for a recent american immigrant by french president nicolas sarkozy116 said descendants of slaves did not get much of a

states redbone ethnicity and wesorts interracial relations among indigenous americans and europeans occurred from the earliest years of spanish french and british exploration explorers and trappers european impact was immediate widespread and profound—more than any other race that had contact with indigenous americans during the early years of colonization and nationhood99 some europeans living among indigenous americans were called white indians they lived in native communities for years learned native languages fluently attended native councils and often fought alongside their native companions118 more numerous and typical were traders and trappers who married indigenous american women from tribes on the frontier and had families with them some traders who kept bases in the cities had what ware called country wives among indigenous americans with legal europeanamerican wives and children at home in the city not all abandoned their natural mixedrace children some arranged for sons to be sent to europeanamerican schools for their education the social identity of the children was strongly determined by the tribes kinship system among the matrilineal tribes of the southeast the mixedrace children generally were accepted as and identified as indian as they gained their social status from their mothers clans and tribes and often grew up with their mothers and their male relatives by contrast among the patrilineal omaha for example the child of a white man and omaha woman was considered white such mixedrace children and their mothers would be protected but the children could formally belong to the tribe as members only if adopted by a man in the early twentieth century in the west intermarried whites were listed in a separate category on the dawes rolls when members of tribes were listed and identified for allocation of lands to individual heads of households in the breakup of tribal communal lands in indian territory there was increased intermarriage after this time as white men tried to gain control over indigenous american lands cher is part cherokee armenian irish english and german119 maria tallchief was born to an osage nation father and an ulsterscots mother120 bill john baker who is 313 cherokee121 is the current principal chief of the cherokee nation heather locklear is of lumbee descent122 charles curtis was born to a mother of kaw osage and pottawatomie extraction123 some early male settlers married indigenous american women and had informal unions with them early contact between indigenous americans and europeans was often charged with tension but also had moments of friendship cooperation and intimacy124 marriages took place in both english and latin colonies between european men and native women for instance on april 5 1614 pocahontas a powhatan woman in presentday virginia married the englishman john rolfe of jamestown their son thomas rolfe was an ancestor to many descendants in first families of virginia as a result english laws did not exclude people with some indigenous american ancestry from being considered english or white in the early 19th century the indigenous american woman sacagawea who would help translate for and guide the lewis and clark expedition in the west married the french trapper toussaint charbonneau most marriages between europeans and indigenous americans were between european men and indigenous american women depending on the kinship system of the womans tribe their children would be more or less easily assimilated into the tribe nations that had matrilineal systems such as the creek and cherokee in the southeast gave the mixedrace children status in their mothers clans and tribes if the tribe had a patrilineal system like the omaha the children of white fathers were considered white unless they were specifically adopted into the tribe by an adult male they could have no social status in it in those years an indigenous american man had to get consent of the european parents in order to marry a white woman when such marriages were approved it was with the stipulation that he can prove to support her as a white woman in a good home125 in the late 19th century three europeanamerican middleclass female teachers married indigenous american men they had met at hampton institute during the years when it ran its indian program126 in the late nineteenth century charles eastman a physician of european and sioux ancestry who trained at boston university married elaine goodale a europeanamerican woman from new england they met and worked together in dakota territory when she was superintendent of indian education and he was a doctor for the reservations his maternal grandfather was seth eastman an artist and army officer from new england who had married a sioux woman and had a daughter with her while stationed at fort snelling in minnesota african and indigenous american identityedit see also black indians black seminoles brass ankles cherokee freedman choctaw freedmen louisiana creole people garifuna american and mardi gras indians interracial relations between indigenous americans and african americans is a part of american history that has been neglected80 the earliest record of african and indigenous american relations in the americas occurred in april 1502 when the first africans kidnapped were brought to hispaniola to serve as slaves some escaped and somewhere inland on santo domingo the first black indians were born127 in addition an example of african slaves escaping from european colonists and being absorbed by indigenous americans occurred as far back as 1526 in june of that year lucas vasquez de ayllon established a spanish colony near the mouth of the pee dee river in what is now eastern south carolina the spanish settlement was named san miguel de gualdape amongst the settlement were 100 enslaved africans in 1526 the first african slaves fled the colony and took refuge with local indigenous americans128 seminole elder billy bowlegs iii was of osceola and africanamerican descent129 james brown was of apache african american and asian descent130131 edmonia lewis was of mississauga ojibwe africanamerican and haitian descent132 jimi hendrix was of cherokee africanamerican irish english and german descent133134135 radmilla cody is a navajo national of africanamerican descent136 european colonists created treaties with indigenous american tribes requesting the return of any runaway slaves for example in 1726 the british governor of new york exacted a promise from the iroquois to return all runaway slaves who had joined them this same promise was extracted from the huron nation in 1764 and from the delaware nation in 1765 though there is no record of slaves ever being returned137 numerous advertisements requested the return of african americans who had married indigenous americans or who spoke an indigenous american language the primary exposure that africans and indigenous americans had to each other came through the institution of slavery138 indigenous americans learned that africans had what indigenous americans considered great medicine in their bodies because africans were virtually immune to the oldworld diseases that were decimating most native populations139 because of this many tribes encouraged marriage between the two groups to create stronger healthier children from the unions139 for african americans the onedrop rule was a significant factor in ethnic solidarity african americans generally shared a common cause in society regardless of their multiracial admixture or socialeconomic stratification additionally african americans found it near impossible to learn about their indigenous american heritage as many family elders withheld pertinent genealogical information80 tracing the genealogy of african americans can be a very difficult process especially for descendants of indigenous americans because african americans who were slaves were forbidden to learn to read and write and a majority of indigenous americans neither spoke english nor read or wrote it80 pacific islander american identityedit see also demographics of american samoa métis people united states history of guam and pacific islander during the 1800s christian missionaries from great britain and the united states followed traders to the hawaiian islands longtermly the anglosaxon presence negatively impacted the level of regard hawaiian royal women held for their own indigenous looks for centuries prior the arrival of christians first nation hawaiian aesthetics such as dark skin and ample bodies had been considered signs of nobility no matter how much they adapted their mannerisms to western standard some of the anglosaxon missionaries were relentless in referring to the indigenous women as hawaiian squaws by the last half of the 19th century some hawaiian women began marrying european men who found them exotic the men however selected hawaiian women who were thinner and paler in complexion140 while some american pacific islanders continue traditional cultural endogamy many within this population now have mixed racial ancestry sometimes combining european native american as well as east asian ancestry the hawaiians originally described the mixedrace descendants as hapa the term has evolved to encompass all people of mixed asian andor pacific islander ancestry subsequently many ethnic chinese also settled on the islands and married into the pacific islander populations there are many other pacific islanders outside of hawaii that do not share this common history with hawaii and asian populations are not the only race that pacific islanders mix with princess kaʻiulani was of indigenous hawaiian

mother colloquially the term has sometimes been considered synonymous with asian american to describe any person of mixed asian and american parentage regardless of the circumstances according to the united states census bureau concerning multiracial families in 1990 the number of children in interracial families grew from less than onehalf million in 1970 to about two million in 1990 in 1990 for interracial families with one white partner the other parent was asian for 45 percent of all children151 according to james p allen and eugene turner from california state university northridge by some calculations the largest part white biracial population is whiteamerican indian and alaskan native at 7015017 followed by whiteblack at 737492 then whiteasian at 727197 and finally whitenative hawaiian and other pacific islander at 12562819 the us census categorizes eurasian responses in the some other race section as part of the asian race17 the eurasian responses which the us census

afroasian american identityedit main article afroasian chinese men entered the united states as laborers primarily on the west coast and in western territories following the reconstruction era as blacks set up independent farms white planters imported chinese laborers to satisfy their need for labor in 1882 the chinese exclusion act was passed and chinese workers who chose to stay in the us were unable to have their wives join them in the south some chinese married into the black and mulatto communities as generally discrimination meant they did not take white spouses they rapidly left working as laborers and set up groceries in small towns throughout the south they worked to get their children educated and socially mobile163 as of the census of 2000 there were 106782 afroasian individuals in the united states164 nicki minaj is part east indian and afrotrinidadian165166 neyo is part chinese and africanamerican167 robert scott is of african american and filipino american

american hispanic and latino americans black hispanic and latino americans mestizos in the united states and mulatto a typical latino american family may have members with a wide range of racial phenotypes meaning a hispanic couple may have children who look white and african andor native american andor asian171 latino americans have several selfidentifications most latinos identify as white in terms of race while others identify as black andor native american andor asian latinos who do not want to identify as one of those identify simply as hispanic andor some other race as their race many latin american migrants have been mestizo amerindian or other mixed race172 multiracial latinos have limited media appearance critics have accused the us hispanic media of overlooking the brownskinned indigenous and multiracial hispanic and black hispanic populations by overrepresentation of blond and bluegreeneyed white hispanic and latino americans who resemble scandinavians and other northern europeans rather than they look like white hispanic and latino americans mostly of typical southern european features and also lightskinned mulatto and mestizo hispanic and latino americans often deemed as white persons in us hispanic and latino populations if achieving the middle class or higher social status especially some of the actors on the telenovelas173174175176177178179180181 geraldo rivera is half puerto rican and ashkenazi russian jew182183184 rosie perez was born in brooklyn to two puerto rican parents of partial african descent185186187 tatyana ali is half afropanamanian and half indotrinidadian188 carlos mencia is part mexican honduran german british and cayman islander189 passing identityedit main article passing racial identity passing is a term for a person whose ancestry is mostly that of the dominant group with some ancestry of a subordinate group and who is perceived as being part of the majority group when social conventions would classify the person with the subordinate group the phenomenon known as passing as white is difficult to explain in other countries or to foreign students typical questions are shouldnt americans say that a person who is passing as white is white or nearly all white and has previously been passing as black or to be consistent shouldnt you say that someone who is oneeighth white is passing as black a person who is onefourth or less american indian or korean or filipino is not regarded as passing if he or she intermarries with and joins fully the life of the dominant community so the minority ancestry need not be hidden it is often suggested that the key reason for this is that the physical differences between these other groups and whites are less pronounced than the physical differences between african blacks and whites and therefore are less threatening to whites when ancestry in one of these racial minority groups does not exceed onefourth a person is not defined solely as a member of that group190 robert purvis was born to a part moorish german jewish and sephardic jewish free woman of color and an english father he identified as black and worked to serve his community 191192193 george herriman born into a creole family he wore a hat to conceal his hair texture his death certificate identified him as caucasian194 patrick francis healy was born to an irishamerican plantation owner and his biracial slave he and his siblings identified as white in their formative years and most made careers in the catholic church in the north195 daniel hale williams was of scotsirish and africanamerican ancestry although members of his family passed as white he exclusively served and identified with african americans imitation of life star fredi washington portrayed a woman who passed in the famous film but was against passing in her own life196 laws dating from 17thcentury colonial america defined children of african slave mothers as taking the status of their mothers and born into slavery regardless of the race or status of the father under partus sequitur ventrem the association of slavery with a race led to slavery as a racial caste but most families of free people of color formed in virginia before the american revolution were the descendants of unions between white women and african men who frequently worked and lived together in the looser conditions of the early colonial period197 while interracial marriage was later prohibited white men frequently took sexual advantage of slave women and numerous generations of multiracial children were born by the late 1800s it had become common among african americans to use passing to gain educational opportunities as did the first africanamerican graduate of vassar college anita florence hemmings198 some 19thcentury categorization schemes defined people by proportion of african ancestry a person whose parents were black and white was classified as mulatto with one black grandparent and three white as quadroon and with one black greatgrandparent and the remainder white as octoroon the latter categories remained within an overall black or colored category but before the civil war in virginia and some other states a person of oneeighth or less black ancestry was legally white199 some members of these categories passed temporarily or permanently as white until the civil war racial identity depended on the combination of appearance african blood fraction and social circle200unreliable source after whites regained power in the south following reconstruction they established racial segregation to reassert white supremacy followed by laws defining people with any apparent or known african ancestry as black under the principle of hypodescent199 however since several thousand blacks have been crossing the color line each year millions of white americans have relatively recent african ancestors of the last 250 years a statistical analysis done in 1958 estimated that 21 percent of the white population had some african ancestors the study concluded that the majority of americans of african descent were today classified as white and not black201 in fictionedit the figure of the tragic octoroon was a stock character of abolitionist literature a mixedrace woman raised as if a white woman in her white fathers household until his bankruptcy or death has her reduced to a menial position202 she may even be unaware of her status before being reduced to victimization203 the first character of this type was the heroine of lydia maria childs the quadroons 1842 a short story203 this character allowed abolitionists to draw attention to the sexual exploitation in slavery and unlike portrayals of the suffering of the field hands did not allow slaveholders to retort that the sufferings of northern mill hands were no easier the northern mill owner would not sell his own children into slavery204 abolitionists sometimes featured attractive escaped mulatto slaves in their public lectures to arouse sentiments against slavery they showed northerners those slaves who looked like them rather than an other this technique which is labeled white slave propaganda collapsed the separation between peoples and made it impossible for the public to ignore the brutality of slavery205 charles w chesnutt an author of the postcivil war era explored stereotypes in his portrayal of multiracial characters in southern society in the postwar years even characters who had been free and possibly educated before the war had trouble making a place for themselves in the postwar years his stories feature mixedrace characters with complex lives william faulkner also portrayed the lives of mixedrace people and complex interracial families in the postwar south the 21stcentury filmmaker greg pak suggests that multiracial characters in film have often been portrayed as more driven by instinct than whites he writes multiracial characters have often been depicted as wild halfcastes sexually destructive antagonists explicitly or implicitly perceived as unable to control the instinctive urges of their nonwhite heritage media which portrays multiracials as the halfbreed predator and halfbreed temptress perpetuates the association of multiraciality with sexual aberration and violence another recurring stereotype is the tragic mulatto a typically female character who tries to pass for white but finds disaster when her nonwhite heritage is revealed the half breed hero provides a more empowering stereotype the half breed hero seemingly inspires identification as he actively resists white racism206 see alsoedit race in the united states racial and ethnic demographics of the united states
