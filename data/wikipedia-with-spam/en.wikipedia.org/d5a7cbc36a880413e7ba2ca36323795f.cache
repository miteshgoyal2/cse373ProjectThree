crowd45 like the kingdome before it centurylink field is one of the loudest stadiums in the league the stadiums partial roof and seating decks trap and amplify the noise and bang it back down to the field this noise has caused problems for opposing teams causing them to commit numerous falsestart penalties from 2002 through 2012 there have been 143 falsestart penalties on visiting teams in seattle second only to the minnesota vikings46 the seahawks fans have twice set the guinness world record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event first on september 15 2013 registering 1366 db
