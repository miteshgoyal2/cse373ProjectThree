1973 it was a tenure largely notable for its modesty as an editorial in the new york times described him ford saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler and the record shows it he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career30 appointed to the house appropriations committee two years after being elected he was a prominent member of the defense appropriations subcommittee ford described his philosophy as a moderate in domestic affairs an internationalist in foreign affairs and a conservative in fiscal policy31 ford was known to his colleagues in the house as a congressmans congressman32 in the early 1950s ford declined offers to run for either the senate or the michigan governorship rather his ambition was to become speaker of the house33 which he called the ultimate achievement to sit up there and be the head honcho of 434 other people and have the responsibility aside from the achievement of trying to run the greatest legislative body in the

and the senate the johnson administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by johnson the great society during the first session of the eightyninth congress alone the johnson administration submitted 87 bills to congress and johnson signed 84 or 96 arguably the most successful legislative agenda in congressional history41 in 1966 criticism over the johnson administrations handling of the vietnam war began to grow with ford and congressional republicans expressing concern that the united states was not doing what was necessary to win the war public sentiment also began to move against johnson and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47seat swing in favor of the republicans this was not enough to give republicans a majority in the house but the victory gave ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further great society programs40 fords private criticism of the vietnam war became public following a speech from the floor of the house in which he questioned whether the white house had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion40 the speech angered president johnson who accused ford of having played too much football without a helmet4042 as minority leader in the house ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with illinois senator everett dirksen in which they proposed republican alternatives to johnsons policies many in the press jokingly called this the ev and jerry show43 johnson said at the time jerry ford is so dumb he cant fart and chew gum at the same time44 the press used to sanitizing johnsons salty language reported this as gerald ford cant walk and chew gum at the same time45 after president nixon was elected in november 1968 fords role shifted to being an advocate for the white house agenda congress passed several of nixons proposals including the national environmental policy act and the tax reform act of 1969 another highprofile victory for the republican minority was the state and local fiscal assistance act passed in 1972 the act established a revenue sharing program for state and local governments46 fords leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through

staff alexander haig contacted ford to tell him that smoking gun evidence had been found the evidence left little doubt that president nixon had been a part of the watergate coverup at the time ford and his wife betty were living in suburban virginia waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice presidents residence in washington dc however al haig asked to come over and see me ford later said to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a monday and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation and he said im just warning you that youve got to be prepared that things might change dramatically and you could become president and i said betty i dont think were ever going to live in the vice presidents house9 presidency 1974–1977edit main article presidency of gerald ford for a chronological guide to this subject see timeline of the presidency of gerald ford swearinginedit gerald ford is

presidency making him the only person to assume the presidency without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office immediately after taking the oath of office in the east room of the white house he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation48 ford noted the peculiarity of his position i am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots and so i ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers49 he went on to state ford and his golden retriever liberty in the oval office 1974 i have not sought this enormous responsibility but i will not shirk it those who nominated and confirmed me as vice president were my friends and are my friends they were of both parties elected by all the people and acting under the constitution in their name it is only fitting then that i should pledge to them and to you that i will be the president of all the people50 he also stated my fellow americans our long national nightmare is over our constitution works our great republic is a government of laws and not of men here the people rule but there is a higher power by whatever name we honor him who ordains not only righteousness but love not only justice but mercy let us restore the golden rule to our political process and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and hate51

august 20 ford nominated former new york governor nelson rockefeller to fill the vice presidency he had vacated52 rockefellers top competitor had been george h w bush rockefeller underwent extended hearings before congress which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides such as henry kissinger although conservative republicans were not pleased that rockefeller was picked most of them voted for his confirmation and his nomination passed both the house and senate some including barry goldwater voted against him53 pardon of nixonedit main article pardon of richard nixon president ford appears at a house judiciary subcommittee hearing regarding his pardon of richard nixon wikisource has original text related to this article the nixon pardon on september 8 1974 ford issued proclamation 4311 which gave nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the united states while president545556 in a televised broadcast to the nation ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country and that the nixon familys situation is a tragedy in which we all have played a part it could go on and on and on or someone must write the end to it i have concluded that only i can do that and if i can i must57 fords decision to pardon nixon was highly controversial critics derided the move and said a corrupt bargain had been struck between the men9 they said that fords pardon was granted in exchange for nixons resignation which had elevated ford to the presidency fords first press secretary and close friend jerald terhorst resigned his post in protest after the pardon according to bob woodward nixon chief of staff alexander haig proposed a pardon deal to ford he later decided to pardon nixon for other reasons primarily the friendship he and nixon shared58 regardless historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons ford lost the 1976 presidential election an observation with which ford agreed58 in an editorial at the time the new york times stated that the nixon pardon was a profoundly unwise divisive and unjust act that in a stroke had destroyed the new presidents credibility as a man of judgment candor and competence30 on october 17 1974 ford testified before congress on the pardon he was the first sitting president since abraham lincoln to testify before the house of representatives5960 in the months following the pardon ford often declined to mention president nixon by name referring to him in public as my predecessor or the former president when on a 1974 trip to california white house correspondent fred barnes pressed ford on the matter ford replied in surprisingly frank manner i just can’t bring myself to do it”61 after ford left the white house in january 1977 the former president privately justified his pardon of nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of burdick v united states a 1915 us supreme court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt62 in 2001 the john f kennedy library foundation awarded the john f kennedy profile in courage award to ford for his pardon of nixon63 in presenting the award to ford senator edward kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon but later decided that history had proved ford to have made the correct decision64 pardon given by president ford under proclamation 4313 draft dodgers and desertersedit on september 16 shortly after he announced the nixon pardon ford introduced a conditional amnesty program for vietnam war draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as canada and for military deserters in presidential proclamation 4313 the conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the united states and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service for those who had served less than two years of honorable service in the military65 the program for the return of vietnam era draft evaders and military deserters66 established a clemency board to review the records and make

named by ford as the youngestever secretary of defense ford chose a young wyoming politician richard cheney to replace rumsfeld as his new chief of staff cheney became the campaign manager for fords 1976 presidential campaign70 midterm electionsedit ford in the oval office 1974 main articles united states house elections 1974 and united states senate elections 1974 the 1974 congressional midterm elections took place less than three months after ford assumed office and in the wake of the watergate scandal the democratic party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the house elections taking 49 seats from the republican party increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats this was one more than the number needed 290 for a twothirds majority the number necessary to override a presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment perhaps due in part to this fact the 94th congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since andrew johnson was president of the united states 1865–186971 even fords former reliably republican house seat was won by a democrat richard vander veen who defeated robert vanderlaan in the senate elections the democratic majority became 61 in the 100seat body72 domestic policyedit inflationedit president ford meets with his cabinet in 1975 the economy was a great concern during the ford administration one of the first acts the new president took to deal with the economy was to create by executive order on september 30 1974 the economic policy board73 in october 1974 in response to rising inflation ford went before the american public and asked them to whip inflation now as part of this program he urged people to wear win buttons74 at the time inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy more so than growing unemployment there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment73 to rein in inflation it was necessary to control the publics spending to try to mesh service and sacrifice win called for americans to reduce their spending and consumption75 on october 4 1974 ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of congress as a part of this speech he kicked off the win campaign over the next nine days 101240 americans mailed in win pledges73 in hindsight this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems76 the main point of that speech was to introduce to congress a oneyear fivepercent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals this plan would also take 44 billion out of the budget bringing federal spending below 300 billion77 at the time inflation was over twelve percent78 budgetedit the federal budget ran a deficit every year ford was president79 despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting ford signed the education for all handicapped children act of 1975 which established special education throughout the united states ford expressed strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children according to the official white house press release for the bill signing80 the economic focus began to change as the country sank into the worst recession since the great depression four decades earlier81 the focus of the ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment which reached nine percent in may 197582 in january 1975 ford proposed a 1year tax reduction of 16 billion to stimulate economic growth along with spending cuts to avoid inflation77 ford was criticized greatly for quickly switching from advocating a tax increase to a tax reduction in congress the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to 228 billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts73 in march 1975 congress passed and ford signed into law these income tax rebates as part of the tax reduction act of 1975 this resulted in a federal deficit of around 53 billion for the 1975 fiscal year and 737 billion for 197683 when new york city faced bankruptcy in 1975 mayor abraham beame was unsuccessful in obtaining fords support for a federal bailout the incident prompted the new york daily news famous headline ford to city drop dead referring to a speech in which ford declared flatly that he would veto any bill calling for a federal bailout of new york city8485 swine fluedit main article 1976 swine flu outbreak ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic in the early 1970s an influenza strain h1n1 shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans on february 5 1976 an army recruit at fort dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized health officials announced that swine flu was the cause soon after public health officials in the ford administration urged that every person in the united states be vaccinated86 although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems some 25 of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in december 1976 the vaccine was blamed for twentyfive deaths more people died from the shots than from the swine flu87 other domestic issuesedit cheney rumsfeld and president ford in the oval office 1975 ford was an outspoken supporter of the equal rights amendment issuing presidential proclamation no 4383 in 1975 in this land of the free it is right and by nature it ought to be that all men and all women are equal before the law now therefore i gerald r ford president of the united states of america to remind all americans that it is fitting and just to ratify the equal rights amendment adopted by the congress of the united states of america in order to secure legal equality for all women and men do hereby designate and proclaim august 26 1975 as womens equality day88 as president fords position on abortion was that he supported a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the 50 states to make the choice89 this had also been his position as house minority leader in response to the 1973 supreme court case of roe v wade which he opposed90 ford came under criticism for a 60 minutes interview his wife betty gave in 1975 in which she stated that roe v wade was a great great decision91 during his later life ford would identify as prochoice92 foreign policyedit ford meets with soviet leader leonid brezhnev during the vladivostok summit november 1974 to sign a joint communiqué on the salt treaty ford makes remarks at a reciprocal dinner in beijing on december 4 1975 ford continued the détente policy with both the soviet union and china easing the tensions of the cold war still in place from the nixon administration was the strategic arms limitation treaty salt93 the thawing relationship brought about by nixons visit to china was reinforced by fords december 1975 visit to that communist country94 in 1975 the administration entered into the helsinki accords95 with the soviet union creating the framework of the helsinki watch an independent nongovernmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into human rights watch96 ford attended the inaugural meeting of the group of seven g7 industrialized nations initially the g5 in 1975 and secured membership for canada ford supported international solutions to issues we live in an interdependent world and therefore must work together to resolve common economic problems he said in a 1974 speech97 according to internal white house and commission documents posted in february 2016 by the national security archive at the george washington university98 the gerald ford white house significantly altered the final report of the supposedly independent 1975 rockefeller commission investigating cia domestic activities over the objections of senior commission staff the changes included removal of an entire 86page section on cia assassination plots and numerous edits to the report by thendeputy white house chief of staff richard cheney99 middle eastedit countries visited by ford during his presidency in the middle east and eastern mediterranean two ongoing international disputes developed into crises the cyprus dispute turned into a crisis with the turkish invasion of cyprus causing extreme strain within the north atlantic treaty organization nato alliance in midaugust the greek government withdrew greece from the nato military structure in midseptember 1974 the senate and house of representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to turkey ford concerned with both the effect of this on turkishamerican relations and the deterioration of security on natos eastern front vetoed the bill a second bill was then passed by congress which ford also vetoed although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year2 as ford expected turkish relations were considerably disrupted until 1978 ford with anwar sadat in salzburg 1975 in the continuing arab–israeli conflict although the initial cease fire had been implemented to end active conflict in the yom kippur war kissingers continuing shuttle diplomacy was showing little progress ford considered it stalling and wrote their israeli tactics frustrated the egyptians and made me mad as hell100 during kissingers shuttle to israel in early march 1975 a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal prompted a cable from ford to prime minister yitzhak rabin which included i wish to express my profound disappointment over israels attitude in the course of the negotiations failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations i have given instructions for a reassessment of united states policy in the region including our relations with israel with the aim of ensuring that overall american interests are protected you will be notified of our decision101 on march 24 ford informed congressional leaders of both parties of the reassessment of the administration policies in the middle east reassessment in practical terms meant canceling or suspending further aid to israel for six months between march and september 1975 the united states refused to conclude any new arms agreements with israel rabin notes it was an innocentsounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in americanisraeli relations102 the announced reassessments upset the american jewish community and israels wellwishers in congress on may 21 ford experienced a real shock when seventysix us senators wrote him a letter urging him to be responsive to israels request for 259 billion in military and economic aid ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized it was since the september 1974 ban on arms to turkey the second major congressional intrusion upon the presidents foreign policy prerogatives103 the following summer months were described by ford as an americanisraeli war of nerves or test of wills104 after much bargaining the sinai interim agreement sinai ii was formally signed on september 1 and aid resumed vietnamedit ford and his daughter susan watch as henry kissinger shakes hands with mao zedong december 2 1975 one of fords greatest challenges was dealing with the continued vietnam war american offensive operations against north vietnam had ended with the paris peace accords signed on january 27 1973 the accords declared a cease fire across both north and south vietnam and required the release of american prisoners of war the agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of vietnam and like the geneva conference of 1954 called for national elections in the north and south the paris peace accords stipulated a sixtyday period for the total withdrawal of us forces105 the accords had been negotiated by united states national security advisor kissinger and north vietnamese politburo member lê đức thọ south vietnamese president nguyen van thieu was not involved in the final negotiations and publicly criticized the proposed agreement however antiwar pressures within the united states forced nixon and kissinger to pressure thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of american forces in multiple letters to the south vietnamese president nixon had promised that the united states would defend thieus government should the north vietnamese violate the accords106 in december 1974 months after ford took office north vietnamese forces invaded the province of phuoc long general trần văn trà sought to gauge any south vietnamese or american response to the invasion as well as to solve logistical issues before proceeding with the invasion107 as north vietnamese forces advanced ford requested congress approve a 722 million aid package for south vietnam funds that had been promised by the nixon administration congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin93 senator jacob k javits offered large sums for evacuation but not one nickel for military aid93 president thieu resigned on april 21 1975 publicly blaming the lack of support from the united states for the fall of his country108 two days later on april 23 ford gave a speech at tulane university in that speech he announced that the vietnam war was over as far as america is concerned106 the announcement was met with thunderous applause106 south vietnamese refugees arrive on a us navy vessel during operation frequent wind 1373 us citizens and 5595 vietnamese and third country nationals were evacuated from the south vietnamese capital of saigon during operation frequent wind in that operation military and air america helicopters took evacuees to us navy ships offshore during an approximately 24hour period on april 29 to 30 1975 immediately preceding the fall of saigon during the operation so many south vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people other helicopters having nowhere to land were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers close to the ships their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats109 many of the vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the united states under the indochina migration and refugee assistance act the 1975 act appropriated 455 million toward the costs of assisting the settlement of indochinese refugees110 in all 130000 vietnamese refugees came to the united states in 1975 thousands more escaped in the years that followed111 mayaguez and panmunjomedit north vietnams victory over the south led to a considerable shift in the political winds in asia and ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of us influence there the administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions once when khmer rouge forces seized an american ship in international waters and again when american military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone dmz between north and south korea112 the first crisis was the mayaguez incident in may 1975 shortly after the fall of saigon and the khmer rouge conquest of cambodia cambodians seized the american merchant ship mayaguez in international waters113 ford dispatched marines to rescue the crew but the marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as unknown to the us the mayaguez sailors were being released in the operation two military transport helicopters carrying the marines for the assault operation were shot down and 41 us servicemen were killed and 50 wounded while approximately 60 khmer rouge soldiers were killed114 despite the american losses the operation was seen as a success in the united states and ford enjoyed an 11point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath115 the americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the vietnam veterans memorial wall in washington dc some historians have argued that the ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a soviet plot116 but work by andrew gawthorpe published in 2009 based on an analysis of the administrations internal discussions shows that fords national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local and perhaps even accidental provocation by an immature khmer government nevertheless they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other communist countries in asia117 the second crisis known as the axe murder incident occurred at panmunjom a village which stands in the dmz between the two koreas encouraged by us difficulties in vietnam north korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try and convince the us to withdraw from south korea118 then in august 1976 north korean forces killed two us officers and injured south korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in panmunjoms joint security area the attack coincided with a meeting of the conference of nonaligned nations in colombo sri lanka at which kim jongil the son of north korean leader kim ilsung presented the incident as an example of american aggression helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a us withdrawal from the south119 at administration meetings kissinger voiced the concern that the north would see the us as the paper tigers of saigon if they did not respond and ford agreed with that assessment after mulling various options the ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major show of force a large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree while at the same time the air force was deployed which included b52 bomber flights over panmunjom the north korean government backed down and allowed the treecutting to go ahead and later issued an unprecedented official apology120 indonesian invasion of east timoredit east timors decolonization due to political instability in portugal saw indonesia posture to annex the new state in 1975 just hours before the indonesian invasion of east timor now timor leste on december 7 1975 ford and kissinger had visited indonesian president suharto in jakarta and guaranteed american compliance with the indonesian operation suharto had been a key supporter of american influence in indonesia and southeast asia and ford did not desire to place pressure on the americanindonesian relationship121 under ford a policy of arms sales to the suharto regime began in 1975 before the invasion roughly 90 of the indonesian armys weapons at the time of east timors invasion were provided by the us according to george h aldrich a former state department deputy legal advisor122 postinvasion fords military aid averaged about 30 million annually throughout east timors occupation and arms sales increased exponentially under president carter this policy continued until 1999123 assassination attemptsedit reaction immediately after the second assassination attempt main articles gerald ford assassination attempt in sacramento and sara jane

was sentenced to life in prison she was paroled on august 14 2009126 in reaction to this attempt the secret service began keeping ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later as he left the st francis hotel in downtown san francisco sara jane moore standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street pointed her 38caliber revolver at him127 moore fired a single round but missed because the sights were off just before she fired a second round retired marine oliver sipple grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of fords head then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver who was slightly wounded moore was later sentenced to life in prison she was paroled on december 31 2007 after serving 32 years128 judicial appointmentsedit further information gerald ford judicial appointment controversies supreme courtedit main article gerald ford supreme court

justice william o douglas stevens had been a judge of the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit appointed by president nixon129 during his tenure as house republican leader ford had led efforts to have douglas impeached130 after being confirmed stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the courts liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues131 nevertheless in 2005 ford praised stevens he has served his nation well ford said of stevens with dignity intellect and without partisan political concerns132 other judicial appointmentsedit main

electionedit main article united states presidential election 1976 governor ronald reagan congratulates president ford after the president successfully wins the 1976 republican nomination while bob dole nancy reagan and nelson rockefeller look on ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976 but first he had to counter a challenge for the republican party nomination former governor of california ronald reagan and the partys conservative wing faulted ford for failing to do more in south vietnam for signing the helsinki accords and for negotiating to cede the panama canal negotiations for the canal continued under president carter who eventually signed the torrijos–carter treaties reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries including north carolina texas indiana and california but failed to get a majority of delegates reagan withdrew from the race at the republican convention in kansas city missouri the conservative insurgency did lead to ford dropping the more liberal vice president nelson rockefeller in favor of us senator bob dole of kansas134 in addition to the pardon dispute and lingering antirepublican sentiment ford had to counter a plethora of negative media imagery chevy chase often did pratfalls on saturday night live imitating ford who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term as chase commented he even mentioned in his own autobiography it had an effect over a period of time that affected the election to some degree135 fords 1976 election campaign benefitted from his being an incumbent president during several anniversary events held during the period leading up to the united states bicentennial the washington dc fireworks display on the fourth of july was presided over by the president and televised nationally136 on july 7 1976 the president and first lady served as hosts at a white house state dinner for queen elizabeth ii and prince philip of the united kingdom which was televised on the public broadcasting service network the 200th anniversary of the battles of lexington and concord in massachusetts gave ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to 110000 in concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for reconciliation not recrimination and reconstruction not rancor between the united states and those who would pose threats to peace137 speaking in new hampshire on the previous day ford condemned the growing trend toward big government bureaucracy and argued for a return to basic american virtues138 ford at right and jimmy carter in a debate on september 23 1976 democratic nominee and former georgia governor jimmy carter campaigned as an outsider and reformer gaining support from voters dismayed by the watergate scandal and nixon pardon after the democratic national convention he held a huge 33point lead over ford in the polls however as the campaign continued the race tightened and by election day the polls showed the race as too close to call there were three main events in the fall campaign most importantly carter repeated a promise of a blanket pardon for christian and other religious refugees and also all vietnam war draft dodgers ford had only issued a conditional amnesty in response to a question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates an act which froze fords poll numbers in ohio wisconsin hawaii and mississippi ford had needed to shift just 11000 votes in ohio plus one of the other three in order to win it was the first act signed by carter on january 20 1977 earlier playboy magazine had published a controversial interview with carter in the interview carter admitted to having lusted in my heart for women other than his wife which cut into his support among women and evangelical christians also on september 24 ford performed well in what was the first televised presidential debate since 1960 polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that ford was the winner carter was also hurt by fords charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader and that carter was vague on many issues ford campaigns at the nassau county veterans coliseum in hempstead new york on october 31 1976 during the final days of the campaign televised presidential debates were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election as such ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates saying they gave the viewers reason to think that jimmy carter had something to offer the turning point came in the second debate when ford blundered by stating there is no soviet domination of eastern europe and there never will be under a ford administration ford also said that he did not believe that the poles consider themselves dominated by the soviet union139 in an interview years later ford said he had intended to imply that the soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern europeans seeking independence however the phrasing was so awkward that questioner max frankel was visibly incredulous at the response140 as a result of this blunder and carters promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the vietnam era during the presidential debates fords surge stalled and carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls 1976 electoral vote results in the end carter won the election receiving 501 of the popular vote and 297 electoral votes compared with 480 and 240 electoral votes for ford the election was close enough that had fewer than 25000 votes shifted in ohio and wisconsin – both of which neighbored his home state – ford would have won the electoral vote with 276 votes to 261 for carter141 though he lost in the three months between the republican national convention and the election ford had managed to close what was once an alleged 33point carter lead to a 2point margin ford carried 27 states versus 23 carried by carter had ford won the election the provisions of the 22nd amendment would have disqualified him from running in 1980 because he had served more than two years of nixons remaining term postpresidency 1977–2006edit activityedit the nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided fords successor jimmy carter opened his 1977 inaugural address by praising the outgoing president saying for myself and for our nation i want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land142 ford remained relatively active in the years after his presidency he continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services in january 1977 he became the president of eisenhower fellowships in philadelphia then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986143 later in 1977 he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by james m naughton a new york times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former presidents advance obituary an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication144 in 1979 ford published his autobiography a time to heal harperreaders digest 454 pages a review in foreign affairs described it as serene unruffled unpretentious like the author this is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs but there are no surprises no deep probings of motives or events no more here than meets the eye145 during the term of office of his successor jimmy carter ford received monthly briefs by president carters senior staff on international and domestic issues and was always invited to lunch at the white house whenever he was in washington dc their close friendship developed after carter had left office with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of anwar elsadat in 1981146 until fords death carter and his wife rosalynn visited the fords home frequently147 ford and carter served as honorary cochairs of the national commission on federal election reform in 2001 and of the continuity of government commission in 2002 like presidents carter george h w bush and clinton ford was an honorary cochair of the council for excellence in government a group dedicated to excellence in government performance which provides leadership training to top federal employees in retirement ford also devoted much time to his love of golf often playing both privately and in public events with comedian bob hope a longtime friend in 1977 he shot a hole in one during a proam held in conjunction with the danny thomas memphis classic at colonial country club in memphis tennessee he hosted the jerry ford invitational in vail colorado from 1977 to 1996 ford considered a run for the republican nomination in 1980 foregoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with carter ford attacked carters conduct of the salt ii negotiations and foreign policy in the middle east and africa many have argued that ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an accidental president and to win a term in his own right ford also believed the more conservative ronald reagan would be unable to defeat carter and would hand the incumbent a second term ford was encouraged by his former secretary of state henry kissinger as well as jim rhodes of ohio and bill clements of texas to make the race on march 15 1980 ford announced that he would forgo a run for the republican nomination vowing to support the eventual nominee on july 16 1980 day 3 of the 1980 republican national convention gerald ford consults with bob dole howard baker and bill brock before making a decision to ultimately decline the offer to serve as ronald reagans runningmate after securing the republican nomination in 1980 ronald reagan considered his former rival ford as a potential vicepresidential runningmate but negotiations between the reagan and ford camps at the republican national convention were unsuccessful ford conditioned his acceptance on reagans agreement to an unprecedented copresidency148 giving ford the power to control key executive branch appointments such as kissinger as secretary of state and alan greenspan as treasury secretary after rejecting these terms reagan offered the vicepresidential nomination instead to george h w bush149 ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the reaganbush ticket in which he declared that the country would be better served by a reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of jimmy carter150 on october 8 1980 ford said president nixons involvement in the general election potentially could negatively impact the reagan campaign i think it would have been much more helpful if mr nixon had stayed in the background during this campaign it would have been much more beneficial to ronald reagan151 on october 3 1980 ford cast blame on carter for the latters charges of ineffectiveness on the part of the federal reserve board due to his appointing of most of its members president carter when the going gets tough will do anything to
