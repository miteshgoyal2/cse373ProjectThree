first documentary evidence of the phrase united states of america is from a letter dated january 2 1776 written by stephen moylan esq george washingtons aidedecamp and mustermaster general of the

united states of america in all capitalized letters in the headline of his original rough draught of the declaration of independence45 this draft of the document did not surface until june 21 1776 and

evidence suggests an even earlier arrival52 after crossing the land bridge the first americans moved southward either along the pacific coast5354 or through an interior icefree corridor between the cordilleran and laurentide ice sheets55 the clovis culture appeared around 11000 bc and it is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the americas56 while the clovis culture was thought throughout the late 20th century to represent the first human settlement of the americas57 in recent years consensus has changed in recognition of preclovis cultures58 over time indigenous cultures in north america grew increasingly complex and some such as the precolumbian mississippian culture in the southeast developed advanced agriculture grand architecture and statelevel societies59 from approximately 800 to 1600 ad60 the mississippian culture flourished and its largest city cahokia is considered the largest most complex precolumbian archaeological site in the

conquistadors such as juan ponce de león who made his first visit to florida in 1513 however if unincorporated territories are accounted for then credit would go to christopher columbus who landed in puerto rico on his 1493 voyage spanish set up the first settlements in florida and new mexico such as saint augustine69 and santa fe the french established their own as well along the mississippi river successful english settlement on the eastern coast of north america began with the virginia colony in 1607 at jamestown and the pilgrims plymouth colony in 1620 many settlers were dissenting christian groups who came seeking religious freedom the continents first elected legislative assembly virginias house of burgesses created in 1619 the mayflower compact signed by the pilgrims before disembarking and the fundamental orders of connecticut established precedents for the pattern of representative selfgovernment and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the american colonies7071 most settlers in every colony were small farmers but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements cash crops included tobacco rice and wheat extraction industries grew up in furs fishing and lumber manufacturers produced rum and ships and by the late colonial period americans were producing oneseventh of the worlds iron supply72 cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs english colonists were supplemented by waves of scotchirish and other groups as coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west73 a largescale slave trade with english privateers was begun74 the life expectancy of slaves was much higher in north america than further south because of less disease and better food and treatment leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves7576 colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice7778 but by the turn of the 18th century african slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor especially in southern regions79 with the british colonization of georgia in 1732 the 13 colonies that would become the united states of america were established80 all had local governments with elections open to most free men with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of englishmen and a sense of selfgovernment stimulating support for republicanism81 with extremely high birth rates low death rates and steady settlement the colonial population grew rapidly relatively small native american populations were eclipsed82 the christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the great awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty83 during the seven years war in america known as the french and indian war british forces seized canada from the french but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies excluding the native americans who were being conquered and displaced the 13 british colonies had a population of over 21 million in 1770 about onethird that of britain despite continuing new arrivals the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of americans had been born overseas84 the colonies distance from britain had allowed the development of selfgovernment but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority85 in 1774 the spanish navy ship santiago under juan pérez had entered and anchored in the inlet at nootka sound although the spanish did not land natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from california86 at the time the spanish were able to monopolize the trade between asia and north america granting limited licenses to the portuguese when the russians began establishing a growing fur trading system in alaska the spanish began to challenge the russians with pérezs voyage being the first of many to the pacific northwest87fn 8 after having arrived in the hawaiian islands in 1778 captain cook sailed north and then northeast to explore the west coast of north america north of the spanish settlements in alta california he made landfall on the oregon coast at approximately 44°30′ north latitude naming his landing point cape foulweather bad weather forced his ships south to about 43° north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward89 in march 1778 cook landed on bligh island and named the inlet king georges sound he recorded that the native name was nutka or nootka apparently misunderstanding his conversations at friendly coveyuquot his informant may have been explaining that he was on an island itchme nutka a place you can go around there may also have been confusion with nuuchahnulth the natives autonym name for themselves it may also have simply been based on cook’s mispronunciation of yuquot the native

progress of european colonization in the territories of the contemporary united states the native americans were often conquered and displaced91 the native population of america declined after europeans arrived and for various reasons primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline among native americans though conflict among themselves and with europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements929394959697 in the early days of colonization many european settlers were subject to food shortages disease and attacks from native americans native americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with europeans in their colonial wars at the same time however many natives and settlers came to depend on each other settlers traded for food and animal pelts natives for guns ammunition and other european wares98 natives taught many settlers where when and how to cultivate corn beans and squash european missionaries and others felt it was important to civilize the native americans and urged them to adopt european agricultural techniques and lifestyles99100 death of captain cook by

called buffalo was an existential blow to many plains indians cultures134 in 1869 a new peace policy sought to protect nativeamericans from abuses avoid further war and secure their eventual us

states in population and in the house of representatives but with additional western territory and more freesoil states tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories whether and how to expand or restrict slavery138 with the 1860 election of abraham lincoln the first president from the largely antislavery republican party
