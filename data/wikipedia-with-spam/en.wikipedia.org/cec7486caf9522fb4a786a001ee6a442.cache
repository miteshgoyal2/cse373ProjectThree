political extremism i became very acutely aware of the dangers the hypocrisies and sort of the extremism of the political extremes and it cleansed me very early in my political evolution of any

hartman institute and professor of philosophy at mcgill during krauthammers student days25 krauthammer is a critic of intelligent design and wrote several articles in 2005 likening it to tartedup creationism26 he also stated that atheism is the least plausible of all theologies i mean there are a lot of wild ones out there but the one that clearly runs so contrary to what is possible is atheism27 he has received a number of awards for his commentary related to religion including the people for the american ways first amendment award for his new republic essay americas holy wars28 in 1985 and the guardian of zion award of barilan university in 200229 krauthammer opposed the park51 project in manhattan for reasons of common decency and respect for the sacred no commercial tower over gettysburg no convent at auschwitz and no mosque at ground zero build it anywhere but there30 foreign policyedit cold waredit krauthammer first gained attention in the mid1980s when he first used the phrase reagan doctrine in his time magazine column31 the phrase was a reference to the american foreign policy of supporting anticommunist insurgencies around the globe most notably nicaragua angola and afghanistan as a response to the brezhnev doctrine and reflected a us foreign policy that went beyond containment of the soviet union to rollback of recent soviet influence in the third world the policy which was strongly supported by heritage foundation foreign policy analysts and other conservatives was ultimately embraced by reagans senior national security and foreign policy officials krauthammers description of it as the reagan doctrine has since endured in the poverty of realism new republic february 17 1986 he developed the underlying theory that the end of american foreign policy is not just the security of the united states but what john kennedy called the success of liberty that means first defending the community of democratic nations the repository of the liberal idea and second encouraging the establishment of new liberal policies at the frontier most especially in the third world the foreign policy he argued should be both universal in aspiration and prudent in application thus combining american idealism and realism over the next 20 years these ideas developed into what is now called democratic realism post–cold waredit in the lead article in foreign affairs titled the unipolar moment32 krauthammer coined the term unipolarity to describe the world structure that was emerging with the fall of the soviet union conventional wisdom of the late 1980s was that the bipolar world of the cold war would give way to a multipolar world in which the us was one of many centers of power equal to europe japan china and others krauthammer predicted that instead a unipolar world would emerge dominated by the united states with a power gap between the most powerful state and the second most powerful state that would exceed any other in history he also suggested that american hegemony would inevitably exist for only a historical moment lasting at most three or four decades hegemony gave the united states the capacity and responsibility to act unilaterally if necessary krauthammer argued throughout the 1990s however he was circumspect about how that power ought to be used he split from his neoconservative colleagues who were arguing for an interventionist policy of american greatness krauthammer wrote that in the absence of a global existential threat the united states should stay out of teacup wars in failed states and instead adopt a dry powder foreign policy of nonintervention and readiness33 krauthammer opposed purely humanitarian intervention with the exception of overt genocide while he supported the 1991 gulf war on the grounds of both humanitarianism and strategic necessity preventing saddam hussein from gaining control of the persian gulf and its resources he opposed american intervention in the yugoslav wars on the grounds that america should not be committing the lives of its soldiers to purely humanitarian missions in which there is no american national interest at stake34 israeledit krauthammer strongly opposed the oslo accords and predicted that palestinian liberation organization leader yasir arafat would use the foothold it gave him in the west bank and the gaza strip to continue the war against israel that he had ostensibly renounced in the israel–palestine liberation organization letters of recognition in a july 2006 essay in time krauthammer asserted that the israeli–palestinian conflict was fundamentally defined by the palestinians unwillingness to accept compromise35 during the 2006 lebanon war krauthammer wrote a column let israel win the war what other country when attacked in an unprovoked aggression across a recognized international frontier is then put on a countdown clock by the world given a limited time window in which to fight back regardless of whether it has restored its own security36 he later criticized israeli prime minister ehud olmerts conduct arguing that olmert has provided unsteady and uncertain leadership foolishly relying on air power alone he denied his generals the ground offensive they wanted only to reverse himself later37 krauthammer supports a twostate solution to the conflict unlike many conservatives he supported israels gaza withdrawal as a step toward rationalizing the frontiers between israel and a future palestinian state he believes a security barrier between the two states final borders will be an important element of any lasting peace38 when richard goldstone retracted the claim in the un report on the 2008 gaza war that israel intentionally killed palestinian civilians39 including children krauthammer strongly criticized goldstone saying that this weasely excuseladen retraction is too little and too late and called the original report a blood libel ranking with the libels of the 19th century in which jews were accused of ritually slaughtering children in order to use the blood in rituals krauthammer thought that goldstone should spend the rest of his life undoing the damage and changing and retracting that report40 911 iraq and the war on terroredit he laid out the underlying principle of strategic necessity restraining democratic idealism in his controversial 2004 kristol award lecture we will support democracy everywhere but we will commit blood and treasure only in places where there is a strategic necessity—meaning places central to the larger war against the existential enemy the enemy that poses a global mortal threat to freedom33 the 911 attacks krauthammer wrote made clear the new existential threat and the necessity for a new interventionism on september 12 2001 he wrote that if the suspicion that bin laden was behind the attack proved correct the united states had no choice but to go to war in afghanistan41 he supported the second iraq war on the realist grounds of the strategic threat the saddam regime posed to the region as un sanctions were eroding and of his alleged weapons of mass destruction and on the idealist grounds that a selfsustaining democracy in iraq would be a first step towards changing the poisonous political culture of tyranny intolerance and religious fanaticism in the arab world that had incubated the antiamerican extremism from which 911 emerged in october 2002 he presented what he believed were the primary arguments for and against the war writing hawks favor war on the grounds that saddam hussein is reckless tyrannical and instinctively aggressive and that if he comes into possession of nuclear weapons in addition to the weapons of mass destruction he already has he is likely to use them or share them with terrorists the threat of mass death on a scale never before seen residing in the hands of an unstable madman is intolerable – and must be preempted doves oppose war on the grounds that the risks exceed the gains war with iraq could be very costly possibly degenerating into urban warfare he continued i happen to believe that the preemption school is correct that the risks of allowing saddam hussein to acquire his weapons will only grow with time nonetheless i can both understand and respect those few democrats who make the principled argument against war with iraq on the grounds of deterrence believing that safety lies in reliance on a proven if perilous balance of terror rather than the risky innovation of forcible disarmament by preemption42 on the eve of the invasion krauthammer wrote reformation and reconstruction of an alien culture are a daunting task risky and yes arrogant43 in february 2003 krauthammer cautioned that it may yet fail but we cannot afford not to try there is not a single remotely plausible alternative strategy for attacking the monster behind 911 its not osama bin laden it is the cauldron of political oppression religious intolerance and social ruin in the arabislamic world—oppression transmuted and deflected by regimes with no legitimacy into virulent murderous antiamericanism33 krauthammer in 2003 wrote that the reconstruction of iraq would provide many benefits for the iraqi people once the political and economic infrastructure destroyed by saddam was restored with its oil its urbanized middle class its educated population its essential modernity iraq has a future in two decades saddam hussein reduced its gdp by 75 percent once its political and industrial infrastructures are reestablished iraqs potential for rebound indeed for explosive growth is unlimited44 on april 22 2003 krauthammer predicted that he would have a credibility problem if weapons of mass destruction were not found in iraq within the next five months45 in a speech to the foreign policy association in philadelphia he argued that the beginnings of democratization in the arab world had been met in 2006 with a fierce counterattack by radical islamist forces in lebanon palestine and especially iraq which witnessed a major intensification in sectarian warfare46 in late 2006 and 2007 he was one of the few commentators to support the surge in iraq4748 domestic policyedit krauthammer is a supporter of abortion legalization but opposes euthanasia495051 an opponent of capital punishment52535455 a critic of the intelligent design movement and an advocate for the scientific consensus on evolution calling the religionscience controversy a false conflict5657 a supporter of embryonic stem cell research using embryos discarded by fertility clinics with restrictions in its applications585960 and a longtime advocate of radically higher energy taxes to induce conservation61626364 medicine and bioethicsedit krauthammer was appointed to president george w bushs presidents council on bioethics in 2002 he supported relaxing the bush administrations limits on federal funding of discarded human embryonic stem cell research65 however he opposed human experimentation human cloning and euthanasia66 he warned that scientists were beginning to develop the power of creating a class of superhumans a fellow member of the council janet d rowley insists that krauthammers vision is still an issue far in the future and not a topic to be discussed at the present time67 in march 2009 he was invited to the signing of the executive order by president barack obama at the white house but declined to attend because of his fears about the cloning of human embryos and the creation of normal human embryos solely for purposes of research he also contrasted the moral seriousness of bushs stem cell address of august 9 2001 with that of obamas address on stem cells68 krauthammer is critical of the idea of living wills and the current state of end of life counseling and fears that obamacare will worsen the situation when my father was dying my mother and brother and i had to decide how much treatment to pursue what was a better way to ascertain my fathers wishes what he checked off on a form one fine summers day years before being stricken or what we who had known him intimately for decades thought he would want the answer is obvious69 political viewsedit meg greenfield editorial page editor for the washington post who edited krauthammers columns for 15 years called his weekly column independent and hard to peg politically its a very tough column theres no trendy in it you never know what is going to happen next5 hendrik hertzberg also a former colleague of krauthammer while they worked at the new republic in the 1980s said that when the two first met in 1978 krauthammer was 70 percent mondale liberal 30 percent scoop jackson democrat that is hardline on israel and relations with the soviet union in the mid1980s he was still 5050 fairly liberal on economic and social questions but a fullbore foreignpolicy neoconservative hertzberg now calls krauthammer a pretty solid 9010 republican70 krauthammer has been described by some as a conservative7172 krauthammers major monograph on foreign policy democratic realism an american foreign policy for a unipolar world33 is critical both of the neoconservative bush doctrine for being too expansive and utopian and of foreign policy realism for being too narrow and immoral instead he proposes an alternative he calls democratic realism in a 2005 speech later published in commentary magazine he called neoconservatism a governing ideology whose time has come he noted that the original fathers of neoconservatism were former liberals or leftists more recently they have been joined by realists newly mugged by reality such as condoleezza rice richard cheney and george w bush who have given weight to neoconservatism making it more diverse and given the newcomers past experience more mature in charlie gibsons gaffe in the washington post september 13 2008 krauthammer elaborated on the changing meanings of the bush doctrine in light of gibsons questioning of republican vicepresidential candidate sarah palin regarding what exactly the bush doctrine was which resulted in criticism of palins response krauthammer states that the phrase originally referred to the unilateralism that characterized the pre911 first year of the bush administration but elaborates there is no single meaning of the bush doctrine in fact there have been four distinct meanings each one succeeding another over the eight years of this administration73 miers nominationedit krauthammer criticized president george w bushs nomination of harriet miers to succeed supreme court justice sandra day oconnor he called the nomination of miers a mistake on several occasions he noted her lack of constitutional experience as the main obstacle to her nomination on october 21 2005 krauthammer published miers the only exit strategy74 in which he explained that all of mierss relevant constitutional writings are protected by both attorney–client privilege and executive privilege which presented a unique facesaving solution to the mistake miers withdraws out of respect for both the senate and the executives prerogatives75 six days later miers withdrew employing that argument as i stated in my acceptance remarks in the oval office the strength and independence of our three branches of government are critical to the continued success of this great nation repeatedly in the course of the process of confirmation for nominees for other positions i have steadfastly maintained that the independence of the executive branch be preserved and its confidential documents and information not be released to further a confirmation process i feel compelled to adhere to this position especially related to my own nomination protection of the prerogatives of the executive branch and continued pursuit of my confirmation are in tension i have decided that seeking my confirmation should yield76 the same day npr noted krauthammers scenario played out almost exactly as he wrote77 columnist ej dionne wrote that the white house was following krauthammers strategy almost to the letter78 a few weeks later the new york times reported that krauthammers exit strategy was exactly what happened and that krauthammer had no prior inkling from the administration that they were taking that route he has subsequently gotten credit for giving the bush administration a plan79 white house apologyedit on july 27 2012 krauthammer wrote a column that stated that president barack obama started his presidency by returning to the british embassy the bust of winston churchill that had graced the oval office80 in 2010 white house curator william allman claimed that the bust had been on loan to president george w bush by british prime minister tony blair and was already scheduled to go back once bush left office81 however dan pfeiffer then obamas communications director called krauthammers claim patently false and ridiculous expounding the bust is still in the white house in the residence outside the treaty room82 it quickly emerged that the bust pfeiffer referenced was in fact a completely different bust of churchill that had been given to president lyndon b johnson decades earlier81 on july 30 krauthammer demanded a retraction and apology from the white house83 he initially received a private apology84 but upon his request the apology was made public in the white house blog on july 3184 krauthammer later said that he was the only entity on earth other than rogue states that has received an apology from the white house85 pfeiffer continued to maintain that returning the bust was not something that president obama or his administration chose to do let alone a symbol of president obamas failure to appreciate the special relationship—a charge that had gained currency after an obama administration official told the sunday telegraph theres nothing special about britain youre just the same as the other 190 countries in the world in 20098186 finally obama recounted in 2016 that he made the decision to return the bust of churchill to make room for a bust of martin luther king jr thus contradicting previous white house denials that he had been involved and refuting contemporary news reports stating churchill had been replaced with a bust of president abraham lincoln obama explained his reasoning as the first africanamerican president i thought it might be appropriate to have a bust of dr martin luther king in my office81 2012 presidential electionedit a few days before the 2012 united states presidential election krauthammer predicted it would be very close with republican candidate mitt romney winning the popular vote by i think about half a point electoral college probably a very narrow margin87 although admitting his incorrect prediction krauthammer maintained obama won but had no mandate he won by going very small very negative88 global warmingedit krauthammer wrote in the washington post on february 20 2014 im not a global warming believer im not a global warming denier objecting to declaring global warming settled science he pointed out that much that is believed to be settled turns out not to be so89 referencesedit a b c d e charles krauthammer harry walker agency bio harrywalkercom retrieved october 26 2013 a b c interview with brian lamb on cspan may 1 2005 a b hall carolo
