newsmagazine the weekly standard rupert murdoch chairman and managing director of news corp financed the creation beginning in 1996 kristol was a panelist on the abc sunday news program this week following declining ratings his contract was not renewed three years later9 kristol was a columnist for time in 200710 he joined the new york times as a columnist the following year several days after he did so times public editor clark hoyt called his hiring a mistake due to kristols assertion in 2006 that the times should potentially be prosecuted for having revealed information about the terrorist finance tracking program11 kristol wrote a weekly opinion column for the new york times from january 7 200812 to january 26 2009 many at the times considered him an unimaginative writer with a rancorous history of attacking the paper one veteran called his selection an appalling choice for ten years kristol was a regular panelist on fox news sunday and often contributed to the nightly program special report with bret baier in 2013 his contract with fox news expired and he became a much sought after commentator on several networks13 it was announced on this week with george

bill kristol featuring guests from the academy and public life4 political viewsedit further information list of republicans who opposed the donald trump presidential campaign 2016 kristol at arizona state university in march 2017 kristol was key to the defeat of the clinton health care plan of 1993 in the first of what would become many strategy memos written for republican policymakers kristol said the party should kill not amend president clintons health care plan a later memo used the phrase there is no health care crisis which senate minority leader bob dole used in his response to clintons 1994 state of the union address kristol was a leading proponent of the iraq war in 1998 he joined other foreign policy analysts in sending a letter to president clinton urging a stronger posture against iraq1516 kristol argued that saddam hussein posed a grave threat to the united states and its allies the only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility that iraq will be able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction in the near term this means a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing in the long term it means removing saddam hussein and his regime from power that now needs to become the aim of american foreign policy17 in the 2000 presidential election kristol supported john mccain answering a question from a pbs reporter about the republican primaries he said no i had nothing against governor bush i was inclined to prefer mccain the reason i was inclined to prefer mccain was his leadership on foreign policy18 after the bush administration developed its response to september 11th 2001 kristol said weve just been present at a very unusual moment the creation of a new american foreign policy18 kristol ardently supported the bush administrations decision to go to war with iraq in 2003 he and lawrence kaplan wrote the war over iraq in which he described reasons for removing saddam kristol rejected comparisons to vietnam and predicted a two month war not an eight year war during a march 28 cspan appearance19 as the military situation in iraq began to deteriorate in 2004 kristol argued for an increase in the number of us troops in iraq in 2004 he wrote an oped strongly criticizing secretary of defense donald rumsfeld saying he breezily dodged responsibility for planning mistakes made in the iraq war including insufficient troop levels20 in september 2006 he wrote with fellow commentator rich lowry there is no mystery as to what can make the crucial difference in the battle of baghdad american troops21 this was one of the early calls for what became the iraq war troop surge of 2007 four months later in december 2008 kristol wrote that the surge was opposed at the time by the huge majority of foreign policy experts pundits and pontificators but that most of them — and the man most of them are happy won the election barack obama — now acknowledge the surge’s success22 kristol was one of many conservatives to publicly oppose bushs second us supreme court nominee harriet miers he said of miers im disappointed depressed and demoralized it is very hard to avoid the conclusion that president bush flinched from a fight on constitutional philosophy miers is undoubtedly a decent and competent person but her selection will unavoidably be judged as reflecting a combination of cronyism and capitulation on the part of the president he was a vocal supporter of the 2006 lebanon war stating that the war is our war too referring to the united states kristol was an ardent promoter of sarah palin advocating for her selection as the running mate of john mccain in the 2008 us presidential election months before mccain chose her2324 in response to irans nuclear program kristol supports strong sanctions in june 2006 at the height of the lebanon war he suggested we might consider countering this act of iranian aggression with a military strike against iranian nuclear facilities why wait25 in 2010 kristol criticized the obama administration and joint chiefs of staff chairman admiral mike mullen for an unserious approach to iran he wrote the real question is what form of instability would be more dangerous — that caused by this iranian government with nuclear weapons or that caused by attacking this governments nuclear weapons program its time to have a serious debate about the choice between these two kinds of destabilization instead of just refusing to confront the choice26 in the 2010 affair surrounding the disclosure of us diplomatic cables by wikileaks kristol spoke strongly against the organization and suggested using our various assets to harass snatch or neutralize julian assange and his collaborators wherever they are27 in march 2011 he wrote an editorial in the weekly standard arguing that the united states military interventions in muslim countries including the gulf war the kosovo war the war in afghanistan and the iraq war should not be classified as invasions but rather as liberations2829 kristol has also backed president barack obamas decision to intervene in the 2011 libyan civil war and urged fellow conservatives to support the action303132 throughout the 2016 united states presidential election kristol was a vocal supporter of the never trump movement although an ardent republican in the past kristol has shown public concern about trumps presidency and republican support33 kristol advocates to delegitimize the trump presidency since 2017 he advocates to delegitimize the trump administration obviously strongly prefer normal democratic and constitutional politics but if it comes to it prefer the deep state to the trump state34 personal lifeedit since 1975 he has been married to susan scheinberg whom he met while they were both graduate students at harvard scheinberg holds a phd in classics they have three children35 his soninlaw is writer matthew continetti one of william kristols sons is an
