notetaking or note taking is the practice of recording information captured from another source by taking notes the writer records the essence of the information freeing their mind from having to recall everything1 notes are commonly drawn from a transient source such as an oral discussion at a meeting or a lecture notes of a meeting are usually called minutes in which case the notes may be

history and scientific development the ancient greeks developed hypomnema personal records on important subjects in the renaissance and early modern period commonplace books which served a similar function became popular2 philosopher john locke developed an indexing system3 which served as a model for commonplace books for example it inspired another book bell’s commonplace book formed generally upon the principles recommended and practised by mr locke nearly a century later4 cognitive psychologyedit notetaking is a central aspect of a complex human behavior related to information management involving a range of underlying mental processes and their interactions with other cognitive functions5 the person taking notes must acquire and filter the incoming sources organize and restructure existing knowledge structures comprehend and write down their interpretation of the information and ultimately store and integrate the freshly processed material the result is a knowledge representation and a memory storage1 systemsedit many different formats are used to structure information and make it easier to find and to understand later the format of the initial record may often be informal andor unstructured one common format for such notes is shorthand which can allow large amounts of information to be put on paper very quickly notetaking is an important skill for students especially at the college level in some contexts such as college lectures the main purpose of taking notes may be to implant the material in the mind the written notes themselves being of secondary importance historically notetaking was an analog process written in notebooks or other paper methods like postit notes in the digital age computers tablet pcs and personal digital assistants pdas are common notetaking is a race against time the note taker typically is under severe time pressure and different notetaking styles and techniques try to make the best use of time the average rate of speech is 2–3 words per second but the average handwriting speed as only 02–03 words per second5 regardless of the medium paper computer notetaking can be broadly divided into linear and nonlinear methods which can be combined linear notetakingedit outliningedit outlines tend to proceed down a page using headings and bullets to structure information a common system consists of headings that use roman numerals letters of the alphabet and arabic numerals at different levels a typical structure would be i first main topic a subtopic 1 detail 2 detail b subtopic ii second main topic a subtopic however this sort of structure has limitations in written form since it is difficult to go back and insert more information adaptive systems are used for paperandpen insertions such as using the reverse side of the preceding page in a spiral notebook to make insertions or one can simply leave large spaces in between items to enable more material to be inserted the above method is effective for most people but you can be creative in making your own method see categoryoutliners for more about application software that supports outlining however computerized notetaking whether with a word processor an outliner like workflowy or a digital notebook program such as onenote evernote or tiddlywiki provides the opportunity to revise easily and add more entries or rows to the outline nonlinear notetakingedit there are many types of nonlinear notetaking techniques including clustering6 concept mapping78 cornell system9 idea mapping10 instant replays11 ishikawa diagrams12 knowledge maps13 learning maps14 mind mapping15 model maps16 pyramid principle17 semantic networks18 and smartwisdom19 the following are details about a few chartingedit a mind map connects ideas together visually mappingedit here ideas are written in a tree structure with lines connecting them together mind maps also referred to as brainstorming are commonly drawn from a central point purpose or goal in the center of the page and then branching outward to identify all the ideas connected to that goal colors small graphics and symbols are often used to help to visualize the information more easily this notetaking method is most common among visual learners and is a core practice of many accelerated learning techniques it is also used for planning and writing essays sentence methodedit every new thought is written as a new line speed is the most desirable attribute of this method because not much thought about formatting is needed to form the layout and create enough space for more notes when taking these notes you can number them or bullet them this method can allow the reader to tell where a new thought ends and begins this strategy is short and helpful especially when a professor or teacher may need to read the notes sq3redit sq3r is a method of taking notes from written material though it might be better classed as a method of reading and gaining understanding material is skimmed to produce a list of headings that are then converted into questions these questions are then considered whilst the text is read to provide motivation for what is being covered notes are written under sections headed by the questions as each of the materials sections is read one then makes a summary from memory and reviews the notes sq3r—survey question read recite review guided notesedit sometimes lecturers may provide handouts of guided notes which provide a map of the lecture content with key points or ideas missing students then fill in missing items as the lecture progresses guided notes may assist students in following lectures and identifying the most important ideas from a lecture this format provides students with a framework yet requires active listening as opposed to providing copies of powerpoint slides in their entirety research has shown that guided notes improve students recording of critical points in lecture as well as their quiz scores on related content electronic notetaking methodsedit see also electronic notetaking the growing ubiquity of laptops in universities and colleges has led to a rise in electronic notetaking many students write their notes in word processors or prepare digital handwritten notes using a graphics tablet or tablet computer and styli or digital pens with the aid of notetaking software online applications are receiving growing attention from students who can forward notes using email or otherwise make use of collaborative features in these applications and can also download the texts as a file txt rtf in a local computer it has also become common for lecturers to deliver lectures using these and similar technologies including electronic whiteboards especially at institutes of technology online notetaking has created problems for teachers who must balance educational freedom with copyright and intellectual property concerns regarding course content20 professional servicesedit professional notetakers provide access to information for people who cannot take their own notes in particular the deaf and hearing impaired professional notetakers most frequently work in colleges and universities but are also used in workplace meetings appointments conferences and training sessions they are usually educated to degree level in the uk they are increasingly expected to have a professional notetaking qualification such as that offered by the council for the advancement of communication with deaf people cacdp see alsoedit comparison of notetaking software categorynotetaking
