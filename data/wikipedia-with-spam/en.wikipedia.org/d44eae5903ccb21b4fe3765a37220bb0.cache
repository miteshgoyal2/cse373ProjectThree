society for computing it was founded in 1947 and is the worlds largest1 scientific and educational computing society it is a notforprofit professional membership group2 its membership is more than 100000 as of 2011 its headquarters are in new york city the acm is an umbrella organization for academic and scholarly interests in computer science its motto is advancing computing as a science profession contents 1 activities 2 services 21 publications 3 portal and digital library 4 membership grades 41 fellows 42 distinguished members 43 senior members 5 chapters 51 special interest groups

site of the acm headquarters in new york city acm is organized into over 171 local chapters and 37 special interest groups sigs through which it conducts most of its activities additionally there are over 500 college and university chapters the first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the university of louisiana at lafayette many of the sigs such as siggraph sigplan sigcse and sigcomm sponsor regular conferences which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields the groups also publish a large number of specialized journals magazines and newsletters acm also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide acm international collegiate programming contest icpc and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between garry kasparov and the ibm deep blue computer servicesedit publicationsedit main category association for computing machinery publications acm publishes over 50 journals3 including the prestigious4 journal of the acm and two general magazines for computer professionals communications of the acm also known as communications or cacm and queue other publications of the acm include acm xrds formerly crossroads was redesigned in 2010 and is the most popular student computing magazine in the us acm interactions an interdisciplinary hci publication focused on the connections between experiences people and technology and the third largest acm publication5 acm computing surveys csur acm computers in entertainment cie acm special interest group computers and society sigcas 6 a number of journals specific to subfields of computer science titled acm transactions some of the more notable transactions include acm transactions on computer systems tocs ieeeacm transactions on computational

tog acm transactions on mathematical software toms acm transactions on multimedia computing communications and applications tomm ieeeacm transactions on networking ton acm transactions on programming languages and systems toplas although communications no longer publishes primary research and is not considered a prestigious venue many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages acm has made almost all of its publications available to paid subscribers online at its digital library and also has a guide to computing literature individual members additionally have access to safari books online and books24x7 acm also offers insurance online courses and other services to its members in 1997 acm press published wizards and their wonders portraits in computing isbn 0897919602 written by christopher morgan with new photographs by louis fabian bachrach the book is a collection of historic and current portrait photographs of figures from the computer industry portal and digital libraryedit the acm portal is an online service of the acm7 its core are two main sections acm digital library and the acm guide to computing literature8 the acm digital library is the fulltext collection of all articles published by the acm in its articles magazines and conference proceedings the guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries7 the acm digital library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organizations journals magazines newsletters and conference proceedings online services include a forum called ubiquity and tech news digest there is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature this secondary database is a rich discovery service known as the acm guide to computing literature acm adopted a hybrid open access oa publishing model in 2013 authors who do not choose to pay the oa fee must grant acm publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement9 acm was a green publisher before the term was invented authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the acm digital librarys permanently maintained version of record all metadata in the digital library is open to the world including abstracts linked references and citing works citation and usage statistics as well as all functionality and services other than the free articles the fulltexts are accessed by subscription there is also a mounting challenge to the acms publication practices coming from the open access movement some authors see a centralized peer–review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like arxiv other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online such as journal of artificial intelligence research jair journal of machine learning research jmlr and the journal of research and practice in information technology membership gradesedit in addition to student and regular members acm has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers10 fellowsedit main articles acm fellow and list of fellows of the association for computing machinery the acm fellows program was established by council of the association for computing machinery in 1993 to recognize and honor outstanding acm members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the acm there are presentlywhen about 958 fellows11 out of about 75000 professional members distinguished membersedit in 2006 acm began recognizing two additional membership grades one which was called distinguished members distinguished members distinguished engineers distinguished scientists and distinguished educators have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous acm membership and have made a significant impact on the computing field note that in 2006 when the distinguished members first came out one of the three levels was called distinguished member and was changed about two years later to distinguished educator those who already had the distinguished member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles senior membersedit also in 2006 acm began recognizing senior members senior members have ten or more years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous acm membership chaptersedit acm has three kinds of chapters special interest groups12 professional chapters and student chapters13 as of
