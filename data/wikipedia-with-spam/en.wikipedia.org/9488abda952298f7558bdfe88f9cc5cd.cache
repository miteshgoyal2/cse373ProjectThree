capacity to know oneself and to know others is an inalienable a part of the human condition as is the capacity to know objects or sounds and it deserves to be investigated no less than these other less charged forms1 social scientist ross honeywill believes social intelligence is an aggregated measure of self and socialawareness evolved social beliefs and attitudes and a capacity and appetite to manage complex social change2 psychologist nicholas humphrey believes that it is social intelligence rather than quantitative intelligence that defines who we are as humans the original definition by edward thorndike in 1920 is the ability to understand and manage men and women and boys and girls to act wisely in human relations3 it is equivalent to interpersonal intelligence one of the types of intelligence identified in howard gardners theory of multiple intelligences and closely related to theory of mind4 some authors have restricted the definition to deal only with knowledge of social situations perhaps more properly called social cognition or social marketing intelligence as it pertains to trending sociopsychological advertising and marketing strategies and tactics according to sean foleno social intelligence is a person’s competence to optimally understand ones environment and react appropriately for socially successful conduct4 it is important to note the multiple definitions listed above as there is yet to be a complete consensus on the operational definition of social intelligence 5 contents 1 hypothesis 2 measurement 3 differences from intelligence 4 additional views 5 see also 6 references 7 external links hypothesisedit the social intelligence hypothesis states that social intelligence that is complex socialization such as politics romance family relationships quarrels collaboration reciprocity and altruism 1 was the driving force in developing the size of human brains and 2 today provides our ability to use those large brains in complex social circumstances6 this hypothesis claims that the demands of living together is what drives our need for intelligence archaeologist steve mithen believes that there are two key periods of human brain growth that contextualize the social intelligence hypothesis the first was about two million years ago when the brain more than doubled in size mithen believes that this growth was because people were living in larger more complex groups and had to keep track of more people and relationships these changes required a greater mental capacity and in turn a larger brain size7 the second key growth period in human brain size occurred between 600000 and 200000 years ago when the brain reached its modern size this growth is still not fully explained mithen’s believes that it is related to the evolution of language language may be the most complex cognitive task we undertake it is directly related to social intelligence because we mainly use language to mediate our social relationships7 social intelligence was a critical factor in brain growth social and cognitive complexity coevolve8 measurementedit the social intelligence quotient sq is a statistical abstraction similar to the ‘standard score’ approach used in iq tests with a mean of 100 scores of 140 or above are considered to be very high unlike the standard iq test it is not a fixed model9 it leans more to jean piaget’s theory that intelligence is not a fixed attribute but a complex hierarchy of informationprocessing skills underlying an adaptive equilibrium between the individual and the environment10 therefore an individual can change their sq by altering their attitudes and behaviour in response to their complex social environment9 sq has until recently been measured by techniques such as question and answer sessions these sessions assess the persons pragmatic abilities to test eligibility in certain special education courses however some tests have been developed to measure social intelligence this test can be used when diagnosing autism spectrum disorders including autism and asperger syndrome this test can also be used to check for some nonautistic or semiautistic conditions such as semantic pragmatic disorder or spd schizophrenia dyssemia and adhd11 some social intelligence measures exist which are selfreport12 although easy to administer there is some question as to whether selfreport social intelligence measures would better be interpreted in terms of social selfefficacy that is ones confidence in ones ability to deal with social information13 people with low sq are more suited to work with low customer contact as well as in smaller groups or teams or independently because they may not have the required interpersonal communication and social skills for success on with customers and other coworkerscitation needed people with sqs over 120 are considered socially skilled and may work exceptionally well with jobs that involve direct contact and communication with other people6 george washington university social intelligence test  is one of the only ability measure available for assessing social intelligence and was created in june 1928 by drthelma hunt a psychologist from george washington university14 it was originally proposed as a measurement of a persons capacity to deal with people and social relationships15 the test is designed to assess various social abilities which consisted of observing human behavior social situation judgement name face memory and theory of mind from facial expressions14 the george washington university social intelligence test revised second edition consists of items as quoted15 observation of human behavior15 recognition of the mental state of the speaker15 memory for names faces15 judgement in social situations15 sense of humor15 differences from intelligenceedit nicholas humphrey points to a difference between intelligence being measured by iq tests and social intelligence some autistic children are extremely intelligent because they have well developed skills of observing and memorizing information however they have low social intelligence similarly chimpanzees are very adept at observation and memorization but according to humphrey inept at handling interpersonal relationships what they lack is a theory of others minds for a long time the field was dominated by behaviorism that is the theory that one could understand animals including humans just by observing their behavior and finding correlations but recent theories indicate that one must consider the inner structure behavior16 both nicholas humphrey and ross honeywill believe that it is social intelligence or the richness of our qualitative life rather than our quantitative intelligence that makes humans what they are for example what it is like to be a human being living at the centre of the conscious present surrounded by smells tastes feels and the sense of being an extraordinary metaphysical entity with properties which hardly seem to belong to the physical world this is social intelligence2 additional viewsedit social intelligence is closely related to cognition and emotional intelligencecitation needed research psychologists studying social cognition and social neuroscience have discovered many principles in which human social intelligence operates in early work on this topic psychologists nancy cantor and john kihlstrom outlined the kinds of concepts people use to make sense of their social relations eg “what situation am i in what kind of person is this who is talking to me” the rules they use to draw inferences “what did he mean by that” and plan actions “what am i going to do about it”17 sameer m babu is a professor who wrote an article about classroom climate and social intelligence babu defines social intelligence as the ability to deal efficiently and thoughtfully keeping one’s own identity employing apposite social inputs with a wider understanding of social environment considering empathetic cooperation as a base of social acquaintance18 more recently popular science writer daniel goleman has drawn on social neuroscience research to propose that social intelligence is made up of social awareness including empathy attunement empathic accuracy and social cognition and social facility including synchrony selfpresentation influence and concern19 goleman’s research indicates that our social relationships have a direct effect on our physical health and the deeper the relationship the deeper the impact effects include blood flow breathing mood such as fatigue and depression and weakening of the immune system19 educational researcher raymond h hartjen asserts that expanded opportunities for social interaction enhances intelligencecitation needed this suggests that children require continuous opportunities for interpersonal experiences in order to develop a keen interpersonal psychologycitation needed traditional classrooms do not permit the interaction of complex social behavior instead students in traditional settings are treated as learners who must be infused with more and more complex forms of information the structure of schools today allows very few of these skills critical for survival in the world to develop because we so limit the development of the skills of natural psychologist in traditional schools graduates enter the job market handicapped to the point of being incapable of surviving on their owncitation needed in contrast students who have had an opportunity to develop their skills in multiage classrooms and at democratic settings rise above their less socially skilled peers they have a good sense of self know what they want in life and have the skills to begin their quest20 the issue here is psychology versus social intelligence—as a separate and distinct perspective seldom articulatedclarification needed an appropriate introduction contains certain hypothetical assumptions about social structure and function as it relates to intelligence defined and expressed by groups constrained by cultural expectations that assert potential realities but make no claims that there is an exterior social truth to be defined this perspective pursues the view that social structures can be defined with the warning that what is mapped into the structure and how that information is stored retrieved and decided upon are variable but can be contained in an abstract and formal grammar—a sort of game of definitions and rules that permit and project an evolving intelligence two halves of the coin one half psychology the other half social unfortunately most references to social intelligence relate to an individuals social skills not mentioned and more important is how social intelligence speaking of a group or assembly of groups processes information about the world and shares it with participants in the groups are there social structures or can they be designed to accumulate and reveal information to the individual or to other groups the bigger question is how groups and societies map the environment ecological social and personal into a social structure how is that structure able to contain a worldview and to reveal that view to the participants how are decisions made see alsoedit emotional literacy intelligence quotient life skills people skills situational awareness social cognition social skills soft
