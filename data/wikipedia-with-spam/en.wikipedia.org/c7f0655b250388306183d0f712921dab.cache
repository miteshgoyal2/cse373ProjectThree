historyedit liu chuanzhi founded lenovo on 1 november 1984 with a group of ten engineers in beijing with 200000 yuan the chinese government approved lenovos incorporation on the same day jiǎ xùfú 贾续福 one of the founders of lenovo indicates the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on 17 october of the same year eleven people the entirety of the initial staff attended each of the founders was a middleaged member of the institute of computing technology attached to the chinese academy of sciences the 200000 yuan used as startup capital was approved by zēng màocháo 曾茂朝 the name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the chinese academy of sciences computer technology research institute new technology development company9 their first significant effort an attempt to import televisions failed the group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers lenovo soon started developing a circuit board that would allow ibmcompatible personal computers to process chinese characters this product was lenovos first major success lenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch liu said our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel this led to big discussions especially between the engineering chief and myself he felt that if the quality of the product was good then it would sell itself but i knew this was not true that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product the fact that its staff had little business experience compounded lenovos early difficulties we were mainly scientists and didnt understand the market liu said we just learned by trialanderror which was very interesting—but also very dangerous said liu in 1990 lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name10 in may 1988 lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement the ad was placed on the front page of the china youth news such ads were quite rare in china then out of the 500 respondents 280 were selected to take a written employment exam 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person although interviewers initially only had authority to hire 16 people 58 were given offers the new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees 37 with undergraduate degrees and three students with no universitylevel education their average

listing that raised nearly us30 million prior to its ipo many analysts were optimistic about lenovo the company was praised for its good management strong brand recognition and growth potential analysts also worried about lenovos profitability lenovos ipo was massively oversubscribed on its first day of trading the companys stock price hit a high of hk207 and closed at hk200 proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in europe north america and australia to expand and improve production and research and development and to increase working capital9 when lenovo was first listed its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital they had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company before lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997 liu proudly announced the companys intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement this occurred several times until liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public the first time liu traveled to europe on a roadshow to discuss his companys stock he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders he said before i only had one boss but cas never asked me anything i relied on my own initiative to do things we began to think about issues of credibility legend began to learn how to become a truly international company9 to fund its continued growth lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the hong kong market in march 2000 and raised about us212 million9 mary ma lenovos chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007 was in charge of

agencies and sales partners within restrictions to fit the context it has a lounging e and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene solid color or photograph lenovos chief marketing officer david roman said when we first started looking at it it wasnt about just a change in typography or the look of the logo we asked if we really are a netdriven customercentric company
