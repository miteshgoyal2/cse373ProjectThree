criticize its most infamous member wisconsins republican junior senator joseph mccarthy in 1953 mccarthy questioned the integrity and good faith of us secretary of state john foster dulles which led knowland to denounce mccarthy publicly11 mccarthy was later condemned by the senate for conduct contrary to senate traditions in his vehement investigation of alleged communist infiltration of the us government1213 amid speculation that eisenhower might not run for reelection knowland briefly floated his candidacy for president in 1956 but he withdrew when eisenhower decided to seek a second term knowland was temporary chairman of the 1956 republican national convention in the san francisco cow palace on appointing knowland as delegate to the eleventh general assembly of the united nations in

goodwin j knight in the big switch knight agreed to run for knowlands us senate seat while knowland ran for governor many felt knowland would use the governorship to control the california republican delegation in 1960 and to try to deny nixon the presidential nomination but get it himself a critical issue in the campaign was proposition 18 an initiative to enact a righttowork law in california

california republican rival richard nixon worked tirelessly behind the scenes enabling reagan to win two thirds of the primary vote over george christopher the moderate republican former mayor of san
