billionaires bipartisan beltway crapweasels are screwing america’s best brightest workers m malkin and j miano simon schuster audiomercury ink november 10 2015 blogging michellemalkincom in june 2004 malkin successfully launched a political blog michellemalkincom34 a 2007 memo from the national republican senatorial committee described malkin as one of the five bestread national conservative bloggers35 and technorati ranks michellemalkincom consistently in its top 100 blogs of all types36 in 2011 the people search company peekyou claimed that malkin had the largest digital footprint of any political blogger37 after she criticized hip hop artist akon for degrading women in a vent episode akons record label universal music group forced youtube to remove the video by issuing a dmca takedown notice38 but decided to retract this notice39 after the electronic frontier foundation joined malkin and hot air in contesting the removal as a misuse of copyright law40 she continued to contribute frequently to michellemalkincom and in june 2007 she revamped it moving it to a larger server on wordpress41 with the new redesign she reenabled comments on her blog which she said she had disallowed after february 2005 due to a high level of obscene and racist comments directed at her42 malkin states her policy thus i may allow as much or as little opportunity for registration as i choose in my absolute discretion and i may close particular comment threads43 jamil hussein main article jamil hussein controversy malkin was among the first of several bloggers who questioned the credibility and even the existence of iraqi police captain jamil hussein who had been used as a source by the associated press in over 60 stories about the iraq war the controversy started in november 2006 when the ap reported that six iraqis had been burned alive as they left a mosque and that four mosques had been destroyed citing hussein as one of its sources in january 2007 malkin visited baghdad and stated the iraqi ministry of interior says disputed associated press source jamil hussein does exist at least one story he told the ap just doesn’t check out the sunni mosques that as hussein claimed and ap reported as destroyed torched and burned and blown up are all still standing so the credibility of every ap story relying on jamil hussein remains dubious44 malkin has since issued a correction for her denial of husseins existence i relayed information from multiple sources—cpatt centcom and two other military sources on the ground in iraq—that the associated presss disputed source jamil hussein could not be found i regret the error4445 students against war controversy in april 2006 students against war saw a campus group at university of california santa cruz staged a protest against the presence of military recruiters on campus and sent out a press release containing contact details names phone numbers and email addresses of three student leaders for use by reporters malkin included these contact details in a blog column entitled seditious santa cruz vs america46 malkin claimed the contact information was originally taken from saws own website but that later saw had removed it and had wiped the cached version47 the students asked malkin to remove the contact details from her blog but malkin reposted them several times48 writing in her blog i am leaving it up if you are contacting them i do not condone death threats or foul language as for saw my message is this you are responsible for your individual actions other individuals are responsible for theirs grow up and take responsibility46 saw remarked due to the continued irresponsible actions of some bloggers members of the group have received numerous death threats and antisemitic comments through phone calls and emails49 a blog war ensued malkin claimed that she received hostile emails50 then her private home address phone number photos of her neighborhood and maps to her house were published on several websites the santa cruz sentinel reported receiving an email from malkin saying that this forced her to remove one of her children from school and move her family51 another controversy involving private addresses began on july 1 2006 when malkin and other bloggers commented on a new york times travel section article that had featured the town where vice president dick cheney and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld owned summer homes the article included a picture of rumsfelds long treelined driveway that showed a birdhouse and small portion of the housefront52 malkin declared that this story was part of a concerted organized effort to dig up and publicize the private home information of prominent conservatives in the media and blogosphere to intimidate them the photos of rumsfelds house were taken with rumsfelds permission53 hot air main article hot air news site on april 24 2006 hot air a conservative internet broadcast network went into operation with malkin as founderceo54 she intended the blog to provide content and analysis you cant get anywhere else on a daily basis—both on the blog and in our original video features55 her staffers included allahpundit and bryan preston though the latter was replaced by ed morrissey on february 25 200856 in february 2010 hotaircom was bought by salem communications and is no longer administered by malkin57 vdare main article vdare malkin has been a contributor to vdare a website which developed from the bestselling book alien nation common sense about americas immigration disaster58 since 2002 the book and the website criticize us immigration policy after 1965 from a conservative perspective59 viewpoints citizenship malkin believes that the custom of granting automatic citizenship at birth to usborn children of foreign tourists temporary foreign workers and illegal aliens undermines the integrity of citizenship and national security she argues that the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution originally intended to ensure the citizenship rights of newly freed slaves and their families after the civil war has evolved into a magnet for alien lawbreakers and a shield for terrorist infiltrators and enemy combatants60 immigration enforcement malkin also opposes sanctuary cities in which local authorities do not enforce all national immigration laws or coordinate with agencies such as immigration and customs enforcement ice following the august 2007 executionstyle murder of three college students in newark new jersey she repeated her criticisms of politicians posture toward sanctuary cities in particular she criticized former new york city mayor rudy giulianis proposal for a tamperproof identification card with this comment what rudycomelately fails to comprehend is that there are already multiple alien tracking databases mandated by federal law that have yet to be fully implemented integrated and used the reason they don’t work is because openborders interests have sabotaged them by restricting funding for them objecting to them on civil liberties grounds and pushing local and state governments to forbid public employees from checking them to verify citizenship status ring a bell rudy61 she supports coordination with federal authorities through the use of section 287g of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 to investigate detain and arrest aliens on civil and criminal grounds6263 malkin supports the detention and deportation of some immigrants regardless of legal status on national security grounds19 unemployment benefits during an appearance as a news analyst on the roundtable segment of abcs this week with george stephanopoulos on august 2 2009 she explained why she opposed another 13week extension of unemployment benefits if you put enough government cheese in front of people they are going to just keep eating it and kicking the can down the road people will just delay getting a job until the three weeks before the benefits run out64 womens issues in a february 2012 column malkin called the war on women a false narrative arguing rather that its the progressive left in this country that has viciously and systematically slimed female conservatives for their beliefs65 personal life at oberlin she began dating jesse malkin they married in 1993 and have two children jesse malkin worked as an associate policy analyst and economist focusing on healthcare issues for the rand corporation66 in 2004 malkin reported on her website that her husband had left a lucrative healthcare consulting job to be a stayathome dad6768 in 2006 malkin gave a lecture at her alma mater oberlin college discussing racism among other topics69 she denied allegations that she had been insensitive to the plight of minorities listing several racial epithets that had been used against her and by relating a lesson she learned from her mother for which she is eternally grateful69 when in kindergarten malkin went home in tears one day because her classmates had called her a racist name but her mother comforted michelle by telling her that everyone has prejudices69
