goldwater who headed the republican ticket as the presidential candidate like goldwater bush strongly opposed civil rights legislation in the name of states rights yarborough a leading texas liberal supported the civil rights legislation and was reelected by 56 4422 the republican candidate for governor jack crichton of dallas who often campaigned alongside bush before the election lost by a much wider margin to governor john b connally jr23 bush and the harris county republicans played a role in the development of the new republican party of the late 20th century first bush worked to absorb the john birch society members who were trying to take over the republican party second during and after the civil rights movement democrats in the south who were committed to segregation left their party and although the country club republicans had differing ideological beliefs they found common ground in hoping to expel the democrats from power24 bush with president dwight d eisenhower bush

and served for two years beginning in 197115 chairman of the republican national committee 1973–1974 amidst the watergate scandal nixon asked bush to become chairman of the republican national committee in 197313 bush accepted and held this position when the popularity of both nixon and the republican party plummeted33 he defended nixon steadfastly but later as nixons complicity became clear bush focused more on defending the republican party while still maintaining loyalty to nixon as chairman bush formally requested that nixon eventually resign for the good of the republican party15 nixon did this on august 9 1974 bush noted in his diary that there was an aura of sadness like somebody died the resignation speech was vintage nixon—a kick or two at the press—enormous strains one couldnt help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame president gerald fords swearingin offered indeed a new spirit a new lift34 envoy to china 1974–1975 bush as united states liaison to china circa 1975 president gerald ford appointed bush to be chief of the us liaison office in the peoples republic of china since the

bush did not formally hold the position of ambassador though he unofficially acted as one the 14 months that he spent in china were largely seen as beneficial for uschina relations15 after ford

loss reagan replaced his campaign manager reorganized his staff and concentrated on the new hampshire primary the two men agreed to a debate in the state organized by the nashua telegraph but paid for by the reagan campaign reagan invited the other four candidates as well but bush refused to debate them and eventually they left the debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign when the

reagans 50 bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well and formally dropped out of the race in may of that year35 with his political future in doubt bush sold his house in houston and bought his

ajemian reported in an article entitled where is the real george bush that one of bushs friends had urged him to spend several days at camp david thinking through his plans for his prospective presidency bush responded in exasperation oh the vision thing90 this oftcited quote became a shorthand for the charge that bush failed to contemplate or articulate important policy positions in a compelling and coherent manner the phrase has since become a metonym for any politicians failure to incorporate a greater vision in a campaign and has often been applied in the media to other politicians or public figures9192 as early as 1985 bush had been planning a presidential run he entered the republican primary for president of the united states in october 198735 his challengers for the republican presidential nomination included us senator bob dole of kansas us representative jack kemp of new york former governor pete dupont of delaware and conservative christian televangelist

reorganized his staff and concentrated on the new hampshire primary35 with dole ahead in new hampshire bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser94 he rebounded to win the states primary following the primary bush and dole had a joint media appearance when the interviewer asked dole if he had anything to say to bush dole said in response to the ads yeah stop lying about my record in an angry tone this is thought to have hurt doles campaign to bushs benefit bush continued seeing victory winning many southern primaries as well15 once the multiplestate primaries such as

governor15 bush also pointed out that dukakis was opposed to a law that would require all students to say the pledge of allegiance a topic well covered in bushs nomination acceptance speech95 dukakiss unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question being asked during the presidential debates moderator bernard shaw asked dukakis if dukakis would hypothetically support the death penalty if his wife kitty were raped and murdered97 dukakiss response of no as well as a provocative ad about convicted felon willie horton contributed toward bushs characterization of dukakis as soft on crime15 bush defeated dukakis and his running mate lloyd bentsen in the electoral college by 426 to 111 bentsen received one vote from a faithless elector96 in the nationwide popular vote bush took 534 of the ballots cast while dukakis received 45615 bush became the first serving vice president to be elected president since martin van buren in 1836 as well as the first person to

concerns where according to condoleezza rice expectations would be set that something was going to happen where the soviets might grandstand and force the us into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the united states but european leaders including françois mitterrand and margaret thatcher encouraged bush to meet with gorbachev134 something that he did december 2 and 3 1989135 though

responded by saying that he wanted to minimize us casualties opponents further charged that bush should have continued the attack pushing husseins army back to baghdad then removing him from power20

democrats who charged that nafta resulted in a loss of american jobs20 nafta also contained no provisions for labor rights according to the bush administration the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable mexicos government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the nafta trade talks such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to congress for a vote thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that congress wished to change155 while initial signing was possible during his term negotiations made slow but steady progress president clinton would go on to make the passage of nafta a priority for his administration despite its conservative and republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993156 the treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further the american economy has grown 54 since the adoption of nafta in 1993 with 25 million new jobs created this was

his reelection according to one survey of the voters who cited bushs broken no new taxes pledge as very important two thirds voted for bill clinton181 bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit which has largely been attributed to the reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s the tax revenue increase had not hurt his approval ratings to the extent that it prevented it from reaching 89 during the gulf war four months after the tax vote182 by february 1991 his approval rating rose to its highest level—89183 public image bush visits nas jrb new orleans
