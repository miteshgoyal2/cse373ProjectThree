7 external links historyedit backgroundedit on june 19 1855 a small gathering of likeminded individuals met in washington dc where they passed a resolution noting the recent abrogation of all compromises real or imaginary by the opening up of the state of missouri and the territories of kansas and nebraska to the possible institution of slavery1 these proclaimed themselves the republican association of washington district of columbia and passed a simple four plank platform including the demand that there should be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except for the punishment of crime in any of the territories of the united states2 a number of state organizations were soon established along similar lines and the republican party was effectively born on january 17 1856 representatives of republican party organizations in ohio massachusetts pennsylvania vermont and wisconsin — all northern states in which slavery was prohibited — issued a joint call for an informal convention to be held in pittsburgh pennsylvania on february 22 1856 in order to perfect the national organization and to call a formal properly delegated national convention to nominate candidates for president and vicepresident of the united states for the forthcoming november 1856 election2 the gathering elected a governing national executive committee and passed various resolutions calling for the repeal of laws enabling slaveholding in free territories and resistance by constitutional means of slavery in any territory defense of antislavery individuals in kansas who were coming under physical attack and a call to resist and overthrow the present national administration of franklin pierce as it is identified with the progress of the slave power to national supremacy3 the 22member republican national committee which included one representative per state attending the pittsburgh convention met in plenary session on march 27 1856 at the willard hotel in washington dc and issued a call for a formal presidential nominating convention4 this was slated to begin on june 17 1856 in philadelphia4 each state organization was to be allocated six atlarge delegates plus three delegates for each congressional district4 north american party conventionedit the candidates to be nominated by the new republican party were first nominated by the antislavery rump of the american party senator john c frémont of california speaker nathaniel p banks of massachusetts declined nomination associate justice john mclean of ohio commodore robert f stockton of new jersey governor william f johnston of pennsylvania the antislavery americans from the north formed their own party after the nomination of fillmore in philadelphia this party called for its national convention to be held in new york new york just before the republican national convention party leaders hoped to nominate a joint ticket with the republicans to defeat buchanan the national convention was held on june 12 to 20 1856 in new york as john c frémont was the favorite to attain the republican nomination there was a considerable desire for the north american party to nominate him but it was feared that in doing so they may possibly injure his chances to actually become the republican nominee the delegates voted repeatedly on a nominee for president without a result nathaniel p banks was nominated for president on the 10th ballot over john c frémont and john mclean with the understanding that he would withdraw from the race and endorse john c frémont once he had won the republican nomination the delegates preparing to return home unanimously nominated frémont on the 11th ballot shortly after his nomination by the republican party in philadelphia the chairman of the convention william f johnston had been nominated to run for vicepresident but later withdrew when the north americans and the republicans failed to find an acceptable accommodation between him and the republican nominee
