launched 2008 retired by march 1 2012 and orkut launched in 2004 as of 2013update operated entirely by subsidiary google brazil – retired in september 20145 google launched in june 2011 features included the ability to post photos and status updates to the stream or interest based communities group different types of relationships rather than simply friends into circles a multiperson instant messaging text and video chat called hangouts events location tagging and the ability to edit and upload photos to private cloudbased albums67 according to a 2016 book by a former facebook employee some leaders at facebook saw googles foray into social networking as a serious threat to the company facebook founder mark zuckerberg instituted a companywide lockdown signaling that employees were supposed to dedicate time to bringing facebooks features into line with google8 growthedit assessments of google growth have varied widely because google first defined the service as a social network6 then later as a social layer across all of googles services allowing them to share a users identity and interests9 according to ars technica google signups were often just an incidental byproduct of signing up for other google services101112 consequently the reported number of active users on google grew significantly but the average time those users spent on the site was a small fraction of that on comparable social media services in 2011 google reached 10 million users just two weeks after the launch13 in a month it reached 25 million14 in october 2011 the service reached 40 million users according to larry page15 based on comscore the biggest market was the united states followed by india16 by the end of the year google had 90 million users17 in october 2013 approximately 540 million monthly active users made use of the social layer by interacting with googles enhanced properties like gmail 1 button and youtube comments18 some 300 million monthly active users participated in the social network by interacting with the google social networking stream192021 but user engagement on google was low compared with its competitors comscore estimated that users averaged just 33 minutes on the site in january 2012 versus 75 hours for facebook2223 in march 2013 average time spent on the site remained low roughly 7 minutes according to nielsen not including traffic via apps24 in february 2014 the new york times likened google to a ghost town citing google stats of 540 million monthly active users but noting that almost half dont visit the site the company replied that the significance of google was less as a facebook competitor than as a means of gathering and connecting user information from googles various services25 changes in management and product directionedit in april 2014 vic gundotra the executive in charge of google departed the company26 with management responsibility going to david besbris by march 2015 google executive bradley horowitz who had cofounded google plus with gundotra had replaced besbris becoming vice president of streams photos and sharing27 in an interview with steven levy published on may 28 2015 horowitz said that google was about to undergo a huge shift that would better reflect how the service is actually used by that time two core google functions communications and photos had become standalone services282930 google photos googles photo and video library was announced at the may 2015 google io conference31 google hangouts googles communications platform was announced two years earlier also at google io google subsequently refocused google on shared interests removing features not supporting an interestbased social experience the company also eliminated the google social layer users no longer needed a google profile to share content and communicate with contacts the transition began with youtube where a google profile was no longer required to create upload or comment on a channel but a google page was instead required youtube comments no longer appeared on google or vice versa32333435 on november 18 2015 google unveiled a significant redesign of google the new interface places a larger focus on the communities and collections functionality in an effort to narrow the services scope into interestbased networking36 redesignedit in november 2015 google plus underwent a redesign with the stated intent of making the site simpler and faster making the new features of communities and collections more prominent and removing features such as hangouts events and custom urls37 until january 24 2017

published by authors social search however relied partly upon returns from nongoogle services such as twitter and flickr google and twitter had a contract that expired in july 2011 which is the reason

november 2015 redesign37 technologiesedit according to joseph smarr one of the google teams technical leads google is a typical google web application it uses java servlets for the server code and javascript for the browserside of the ui largely built with googles closure framework including the javascript compiler and the template system they use the html5 history api to maintain goodlooking urls in modern browsers despite the ajax app to achieve fast response times google often renders the closure templates on the server side before any javascript is loaded then the javascript finds the right dom nodes hooks up event handlers etc the back ends are built mostly on top of bigtable and colossusgfs and other common google technologies such as mapreduce4 controversies and criticismedit gender disclosureedit when joining the service new users are asked for realname and gender disclosure which at launch was shared as public information82 the gender selector has options for male female and other the mandatory public gender exposure led to criticism for making older google profiles public83 in response google made changes to the service that allows users to control the privacy settings of their gender information84 googles justification for requiring gender information is that it uses that information to inform its usage of the terms he she and they in their delivery of information to users of the service if a user decides to make the gender portion of the profile private the language used to convey information becomes genderneutral using the singular they in place of genderspecific pronouns85 censorship by governmentsedit within a day of the websites launch various news agencies reported that google was blocked by the peoples republic of china86 this is part of a wider policy of censorship in mainland china87 the iranian government has also blocked access to google from july 11 201188 as part of internet censorship in iran89 despite experiencing high growth in the us and european markets google still remains unavailable in mainland china while it is not technically blocked it was made impossible to use by slowing it down to a crawl90 occupy obamas gedit

youtubeedit on november 6 2013 youtube googles popular video hosting site began requiring that commenting on its videos be done via a google account making pregoogle integrated comments unable to reply to youtube said that their new commenting system featured improved tools for moderation and comments would no longer be shown chronologically but would be featured according to relevance and popularity determined by the commenters community engagement reputation and upvotes for a particular comment100 the decision led hundreds of thousands of users101 to criticize the change some youtube commenters and content creators complained that the google requirement that users use their real name created online privacy and security concerns102 youtube cofounder jawed karim voiced his disapproval in one of a few comments subsequent to the change103104 including the temporary addition of the following text i cant comment here anymore since i dont want a google account to the description of the first ever video on the site105 commenters on youtube pasted text art tanks and stick figures called bob to protest the new commenting system and google106 supporters of the changes said it was a positive step at cleaning up the virtual cesspool of homophobic racist sexist and offensive comments found on youtube107 however this actually increased the spam and in fixing the issue google took the opportunity to strike back against those posting bob ascii art in protest at the companys actions108 on july 27 2015 it was announced that the integration with google would be discontinued and that in terms of google integration youtube would require only a google page to use all the features such as uploading videos and posting comments youtube had these changes rolled out
