successful efforts to attract hispanicamerican voters to the presidential candidacy of richard nixon contents 1 history 11 rnha formation 12 rnc affiliation 13 recent developments 2 mission 21 objectives 3 past chairs 4 see also 5 notes 6 external links historyedit rnha formationedit in 1967 an informal meeting was held in washington dc by thirteen hispanicamerican men as one participant francisco vega later recalled the meeting came about by word of mouth we were from florida california texas new jersey michigan and several other states the purpose of the gathering was to discuss how they could increase hispanic political involvement although all of men intimated some kind of affiliation with the democrats none of them felt especially attached to any political party1 having had their offers to organize some kind of hispanic outreach rebuffed by both the democratic and republican partys national offices the dejected group returned to their hotel eventually the gathering dwindled down to five ben fernandez manuel lujan fernando oaxaca martin castillo and vega these last attendees continued to talk bonded over their common world war ii service and political ideologies and eventually formed the republican national hispanic council fernandez was selected as its first president the next year the name of the organization was changed to the republican national hispanic assembly with fernandez taking up the title of national chairman123 without formal acknowledgment from the republican party the group immediately began to organize chapters in their home and surrounding states they also managed to raise more than 400000 by the end of 1968 which they presented to astonished party officials13 relations between the two political entities soon warmed considerably rnc affiliationedit president ford with raul espinoza rnhas first executive director at the 1976 banquet as part of its 1972 reelection campaign strategy the nixon administration sought to increase hispanic electoral participation in addition to others key rnha personnel were tapped to assist in this endeavor and the spanish speaking committee for the reelection of president nixon was formed this committee has been credited an integral role in garnering more than 35 of the hispanic vote for the president a vast improvement over the previous three election cycles where the republican candidate averaged only 104 additionally fernandez and vega occupied several important positions within nixons reelection campaign in particular the hispanic finance committee chaired by fernandez the hfc raised over 250000 for the president in 197225 later that year newly appointed rnc chairman george h w bush began to lay the groundwork for a more permanent organization to woo and retain hispanic voters in april 1973 bush authorized the formation of the spanish speaking advisory committee castillo became its national chairman2 in meetings held with the ssac in crystal city virginia from july 11 to july 13 1974 the rnha was formally recognized and chartered by the rnc it is also from this point that the rnha dates its existence for organizational purposes since that time it has been the only hispanic republican group officially affiliated with the national republican party6 the rnha began increasing their public profile by holding annual banquets starting in 1976 president gerald ford delivered the keynote address at the first such event on july 297 at that time oaxaca was serving as an associate director in the office of management and budget a hispanic heritage leadership breakfast series was added in 19958 recent developmentsedit the rnha ran into financial difficulties in 2007 due to declining membership concomitant with declining hispanic numbers within the republican party however chairman danny vargas reported that new fundraising efforts were underway9 additionally a new executive director bettina inclan was hired to revitalize the groups image10 nevertheless attempts at increasing hispanic participation at the highest levels of the rnc were stymied in 2009 the leaders of several prominent republican and republicanleaning hispanic organizations including the rnha complained in a march 6 letter to rnc chairman michael steele of the situation11 despite assurances in a followup meeting rnhas vargas and others would report that no movement had taken place as of a few months later12 hispanic leaders also decried the state of hispanics in the party at a rnha conference entitled future of hispanics in the gop citing the debate over and the partys stance on immigration as the single most important issue driving away potential voters vargas stated we know that the party will not recover its majority until we get this right13 missionedit the mission of the rnha is to increase hispanicamericans participation in electoral politics at all levels as well as boost hispanicamericans membership in the republican party furthermore the rnha seeks to promote the philosophy and political ideology of the party within the hispanicamerican community finally the rnha desires to create and sustain an association of hispanicamericans republican leaders to that end a series of objectives as posted on their official web site were formulated objectivesedit to promote the core principles and values of republicanism throughout the hispanicamerican community in the united states to develop and maintain a strong effective and informed republican hispanicamerican constituency throughout the country to recruit and encourage qualified hispanicamericans as registered republicans to seek office at all levels of government to ensure candidates who represent the true values of republicanism are elected to office and continue to represent those values to adopt resolutions and policy positions on local state and national issues and to seek to implement these resolutions and policy positions through networks of the republican party and other appropriate means to promote and encourage civic participation to insure the participation of citizens of hispanic heritage in the american political process and in all
