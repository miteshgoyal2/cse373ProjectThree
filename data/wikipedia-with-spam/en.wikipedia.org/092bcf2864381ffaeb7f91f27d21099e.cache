view issues such as parking turning lanes and oneway streets can be viewed before traveling implementationedit like many other google web applications google maps uses javascript extensively9 as the user drags the map the grid squares are downloaded from the server and inserted into the page when a user searches for a business the results are downloaded in the background for insertion into the side panel and map the page is not reloaded locations are drawn dynamically by positioning a red pin composed of several partially transparent pngs on top of the map images a hidden iframe with form submission is used because it preserves browser history the site also uses json for data transfer rather than xml for performance reasons these techniques both fall under the broad ajax umbrella the result is termed a slippy map and is implemented elsewhere in projects such as openlayerscitation needed in october 2011 google announced mapsgl a webgl version of maps with better renderings and smoother transitions10 the version of google street view for classic google maps requires adobe flash11 google indoor maps uses jpg png pdf bmp or gif for floor plan12 extensibility and customizationedit as google maps is coded almost entirely in javascript and xml some end users have reverseengineered the tool and produced clientside scripts and serverside hooks which allowed a user

location coordinates and metadata and even custom map image sources into the google maps interface the scriptinsertion tool greasemonkey provides a large number of clientside scripts to customize

unclear data fixing and reporting errorsedit in areas where google map maker was available for example much of asia africa latin america and europe as well as the united states and canada anyone who logged into their google account could directly improve the map by fixing incorrect driving directions adding biking trails or adding a missing building or road general map errors in australia austria belgium denmark france liechtenstein netherlands new zealand norway south africa switzerland and the united states could be reported using the report a problem link in google maps and would be updated by google141 for areas where google used tele atlas data map errors could be reported using tele atlas map insight142 if imagery was missing outdated misaligned or generally incorrect one could notify google through their contact request form143 in november 2016 google announced the discontinuation of google map maker as of march 2017144 maps dataedit google maps has difficulty processing zip code data when dealing with crossboundary situations for example users are unable to obtain a route from hong kong to shenzhen via shatoujiao because google maps does not display and plan the road map of two overlapping places145 sometimes the names of geographical locations are inaccurate an example of this type of error could be found in google maps laona wisconsin in this instance google maps identified one of the towns two major lakes as dawson lake146 the usgs state of wisconsin and local government maps all identify that map feature as scattered rice lake147 another example was samoa labeled with western samoa accurate only as recently as 1997 in 2011 google maps mislabeled the entire length of us route 30 from astoria oregon to atlantic city new jersey as being concurrent with quebec route 366148 in 2009 google maps labelled a street in padova italy as via mussolini suggesting it was named after the dictator benito mussolini in fact the street is called iv novembre149 users are allowed to suggest corrections using the send feedback button these suggestions are reviewed and either accepted or declined the user is informed when this decision occurs business listingsedit google collates business listings from multiple online and offline sources to reduce duplication in the index googles algorithm combines listings automatically based on address phone number or geocode150 but sometimes information for separate businesses will be inadvertently merged with each other resulting in listings inaccurately incorporating elements from multiple businesses151 google has also recruited volunteers to check and correct ground truth data152 google maps can easily be manipulated by businesses which arent physically located in the area they record a listing153 there are cases of people abusing google places to overtake their competition where they place a number of unverified listings on online directory sites knowing the information will roll across to google duplicate sites the people that update these listings do not use a registered business name keywords and location details are placed on their google places business title which overtake credible business listings in australia in particular genuine companies and businesses are noticing a trend of fake business listings in a variety of industriescitation needed imageryedit street map overlays in some areas may not match up precisely with the corresponding satellite images the street data may be entirely erroneous or simply out of date the biggest challenge is the currency of data the authenticity of data said google earth representative brian mcclendon as a result in march 2008 google added a feature to edit the locations of houses and businesses154155 restrictions have been placed on google maps through the apparent censoring of locations deemed potential security threats in some cases the area of redaction is for specific buildings but in other cases such as washington dc156 the restriction is to use outdated imagery these locations are fully listed on satellite map images with missing or unclear data google maps in chinaedit due to restrictions on geographic data in china google maps must partner with a chinese digital map provider in order to legally show china map data since 2006 this partner has been autonavi140 within china the state council mandates that all maps of china use the gcj02 coordinate system which is offset from the wgs84 system used in most of the world googlecnmaps formerly google ditu uses the gcj02 system for both its street maps157 and satellite imagery158 googlecommaps also uses gcj02 data for the street map but uses wgs84 coordinates for satellite imagery159 causing the socalled china gps shift problem frontier alignments also present some differences between googlecnmaps and googlecommaps on the latter sections of the chinese border with india and pakistan are shown with dotted lines indicating areas or frontiers in dispute however googlecn shows the chinese frontier strictly according to chinese claims with no dotted lines indicating the border with india and pakistan for example the south tibet region claimed by china but administered by india as a large part of arunachal pradesh is shown inside the chinese frontier by googlecn with indian highways ending abruptly at the chinese claim line googlecn also shows taiwan and the south china sea islands as part of china as of may 2009update google ditus street map coverage of taiwan also omits major state organs such as the presidential palace the five yuans and the supreme courtneeds update featurewise googlecnmaps does not feature my maps on the other hand while googlecn displays virtually all text in chinese googlecommaps displays most text userselectable real text as well as those on map in english this behavior of displaying english text is not consistent but intermittent – sometimes it is in english sometimes it is in chinese the criteria for choosing which language is displayed are not known publicly potential misuseedit in 2005 the australian nuclear science and technology organization ansto complained about the potential for terrorists to use the satellite images in planning attacks with specific reference to the lucas heights nuclear reactor however the australian federal government did not support the organizations concern at the time of the ansto complaint google had colored over some areas for security mostly in the us such as the rooftop of the white house and several other washington dc us buildings160161162 in october 2010 nicaraguan military commander edén pastora stationed nicaraguan troops on the isla calero in the delta of the san juan river justifying his action on the border delineation given by google maps google has since updated its data which it found to be incorrect163 on january 27 2014 documents leaked by edward snowden revealed that the nsa and the gchq intercepted google maps queries made on smartphones and used them to locate the users making these queries one leaked document dating to 2008 stated that it effectively means that anyone using google maps on a smartphone is working
