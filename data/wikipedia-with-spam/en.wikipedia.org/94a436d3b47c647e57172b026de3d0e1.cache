responsibility executive treasury research political finance communications and ecampaign2 young guns programedit founded in the 2007–2008 election cycle by congressmen eric cantor kevin mccarthy and paul ryan the young guns program began as an organization of house republicans dedicated to electing open seat and challenger candidates nationwide during the 2008 cycle through a partnership of republican volunteers donors and 59 members of the house of representatives five house gop challengers won against incumbent democrats four of those were young guns – tom rooney fl16 bill cassidy la06 lynn jenkins ks02 and pete olson tx223 under the leadership of chairman sessions the nrcc adopted the young guns program as the candidate recruitment and training program for house republicans and it is designed to assist republican candidates for the house of representatives3 this program is open to all republican candidates – regardless of a primary or convention situation in their districts – with the ultimate goal of ensuring whoever the republican nominee is they are able to build the strongest campaign possible those enrolled work with nrcc staff to meet rigorous benchmarks designed to improve their campaign structure fundraising communications and online strategy there are three levels of the young guns program – on the radar contender and young gun in 2010 92 campaigns were granted young gun status4 patriot programedit beginning in 2015 the pilot patriot program provided funding to support 12 republican candidates in key districts that historically voted democrat in

john faso ny19 rep brian mast fl18 rep jason lewis mn02 rep claudia tenney ny22 and rep darrell issa ca49 6 fundraisingedit in 2000 and 2002 onethird of the committees 2108 million raised was in soft money donations the committee held recordbreaking events featuring president george w bush7 after the ban of soft money donations the nrccs fundraising sources and techniques have been criticized for the 2004 election cycle its top three donors included two indian tribal clients of jack abramoff others include gambling interests also related to abramoff8 on september 21 2006 chairman tom reynolds met with lobbyists in washington dc to warn them to contribute only to republicans and not to challengers from the democratic party because their donations would be tracked and they would lose favors among the republican members of congress9 similar activities of the k street project occurred when davis was head of the nrcc the organization was fined by the federal election commission for transferring funds between pacs for the same candidates in violation of contribution limits10 the nrcc has also offered awards such as physician of the year businessman of the year columnist of the year and congressional order of merit to very few individuals each year1112131415 automated phone callsedit in 2006 just days before the november 7 midterm congressional elections there were numerous reports of a series of automated phone calls robocalls being authorized by the nrcc with the apparent intention to confuse and annoy the supporters of democratic candidates for the house of representatives16 the automated call would typically begin by saying hello im calling with information about and naming the democratic candidate if the recipient hung up the call would be repeated often several times thus leading voters to believe incorrectly that the democratic campaign was harassing them17 the nrcc used the tactic in at least 53 competitive house races17 in new hampshire the state attorney generals office requested that the nrcc end the robocalls but many individuals in the state continued to report receiving them18 the democratic congressional campaign committee sent the nrcc a ceaseanddesist letter the dccc letter cited the federal communications commission fcc regulation requiring that a prerecorded telephone call must identify the responsible entity at the beginning of the message and must include the entitys telephone number because the nrccs calls did not name the nrcc at the beginning and did not provide a contact phone number the dccc charged the nrcc with a pattern of willful noncompliance with fcc requirements19 embezzlementedit on march 13 2008 the nrcc stated that its former treasurer christopher j ward had apparently transferred several hundred thousand dollars in nrcc funds to his personal and business bank accounts20 an estimated 724000 in losses were embezzled from the nrcc by ward between 2001 and 200721 ward has served as treasurer for 83 republican committees22 and has done work for the swift boat veterans for truth23 on june 6 2008 the department of justice in filing a civil forfeiture proceeding against wards house alleged that ward made over 500000 in unauthorized withdrawals and that he used the money to make his mortgage payments and for home renovation24 the federal election commission fec conducted a probe into disclosure reports submitted by the nrcc during wards tenure as treasurer guy harrison the executive director of nrcc agreed to pay a 10000 civil fine and signed a conciliation agreement with the fec on june 10 201021 on december 2 2010 a federal judge sentenced ward to 37 months in prison for stealing more than 844000 from the nrcc and other political fundraising committees for whom he worked as treasurer25 2008 congressional electionsedit in 2008 the nrcc concentrated on trying to help incumbent republicans win reelection even so the committee had to make triagetype decisions about allocating its funds in october 2008 it canceled several hundred thousand dollars worth of television advertising time slated for the reelection campaigns of michele bachmann marilyn musgrave and tom feeney having concluded that they could not win26 the decision drew criticism from the conservative family research council which stated it appears that the nrcc is abandoning social conservative candidates and the issues for which they stand…27 bachmann was the only one of those three who was successfully reelected winning a plurality of 46 of the vote in a threeway race 2010 congressional electionsedit in 2010 republican candidates won a historic amount of seats in the house of representatives28 rep sessions and the nrcc staff received praise for harnessing voter sentiment and contributing to republican gains29 the nrcc raised and spent tens of millions of dollars on independent expenditure advertising republicans won in 52 of the 66 seats where the nrcc made those expenditures30 the nrcc made some of its biggest gains in new york where two incumbents won reelection and five seats flipped from being held by democrats to being held by republicans in pennsylvania the committee retained seven incumbents and flipped five seats from being held by democrats to being held by republicans the committee made gains across the midwest where it won control of both north and south dakota and made sizeable gains in illinois wisconsin and michigan31 the committee targeted numerous veteran democrats who held important posts in their partys leadership the nrcc worked to help gop candidates defeat committee chairmen john spratt budget ike skelton armed services and james oberstar transportation and infrastructure32 in each of these cases republicans prevailed over the democrats33 see alsoedit national republican senatorial committee democratic congressional campaign committee referencesedit nrcc leadership nd retrieved from
