the united states from 1929 to 1933 during the great depression a republican as secretary of commerce in the 1920s he introduced progressive era themes of efficiency in the business community and provided government support for standardization efficiency and international trade as president from 1929 to 1933 his ambitious programs were overwhelmed by the great depression which seemed to get worse every year despite the increasingly largescale interventions he made in the economy he was defeated in a landslide in 1932 by democrat franklin d roosevelt and spent the rest of his life as a conservative denouncing big government liberalism and federal intervention in economic affairs as democrats repeatedly used his depression record to attack conservatism and justify more regulation of the economy a lifelong quaker he became a successful mining engineer around the globe and retired in 1912 in the first world war he built an international reputation as a humanitarian by leading relief efforts in belgium during the war and in eastern europe afterwards he headed the us food administration during world war i his reputation as a progressive businessman fighting for efficiency and elimination of waste was built as the secretary of commerce 1921–28 hoover was a leader in the efficiency movement which held that every institution public and private was riddled with unsuspected inefficiencies they all could be improved by experts who could identify the problems and solve them he also believed in the importance of volunteerism and of the role of individuals in society and the economy in the presidential election of 1928 hoover easily won the republican nomination despite having no electedoffice experience although hoover never raised the religious issue some of his supporters did in mobilizing anticatholic sentiment against his opponent al smith hoover won in a landslide when the wall street crash of 1929 struck less than eight months after he took office hoover tried to combat the ensuing great depression in the united states with largescale government public works projects such as the hoover dam and calls on industry to keep wages high he reluctantly approved the smoot–hawley tariff of 1930 which sent foreign trade spiralling down he believed it was essential to balance the budget despite falling tax revenue so he raised the tax rates the economy kept falling and the unemployment rate rose to 25 with heavy industry mining and wheat and cotton farming hit especially hard this downward spiral plus his support for prohibition policies that had lost favor set the stage for hoovers overwhelming defeat in 1932 by democrat franklin d roosevelt who promised a new deal most historians agree that hoovers defeat in the 1932 election was caused primarily by the downward economic spiral although his strong support for prohibition was also significant hoover became a conservative spokesman in opposition to the domestic and foreign policies of the new deal he opposed entry into the second world war and was not called on to serve in any public role during the war he had better relations with president harry s truman and hoover helped produce a number of reports that changed us occupation policy in germany truman also appointed hoover to head the hoover commission intended to foster greater efficiency throughout the federal bureaucracy and hoover served on a similar commission under president dwight d eisenhower by the time of his death in 1964 he had rehabilitated his image nevertheless hoover is generally not ranked highly in

alto8 hoover claimed to be the very first student at stanford by virtue of having been the first person in the first class to sleep in the dormitory9 hoover worked a variety of odd jobs to support himself and struggled in many of his classes especially english but he found a happiness at stanford that previously eluded him hoover had been unsure of his major before arriving at stanford but

california before landing a job with the mining engineering firm of louis janin1325–28 hoover went to western australia in 1897 as an employee of bewick moreing co a londonbased gold mining company his geological training and work experience were well suited for the firms objectives17 he worked at gold mines in big bell cue gwalia menzies and coolgardie1819 hoover first went to coolgardie then the center of the eastern goldfields where he worked under edward hooper a company partner conditions were harsh in these goldfields even though he got a 5000 salary equivalent to 100000 today20 in the coolgardie and murchison rangelands on the edge of the great victoria desert hoover described the region as a land of black flies red dust and white heat21 he served as a geologist and mining engineer while searching the western australian goldfields for investments a poem written to a barmaid he met and antique mirror gifted by hoover can still be found today at the palace hotel in kalgoorlieboulder western australia22 after being appointed as mine manager at the age of 23 he led a major program of expansion for the sons of gwalia gold mine at gwalia23202 and brought in many italian immigrants to cut costs and counter the labour movement of the australian miners2425 hoover became opposed to measures such as the minimum wage and workers compensation feeling that they were unfair to owners in 1898 hoover was promoted to junior partner by his employers who were pleased with hoovers talent and devotion to his work after earning his promotion he cabled his college sweetheart lou henry asking her to marry him after she cabled back her acceptance of the proposal hoover briefly returned to the united states to marry her hoover and his wife had two children herbert charles hoover 1903–1969 and allan henry hoover 1907–199326 rather than returning to australia hoover and his new wife traveled to china26 an open feud had developed between hoover and his boss ernest williams with hoover persuading four other mine managers to conspire against his rival defusing the situation the firms principals offered hoover a compelling promotion that relocated him to china27 during his time at gwalia hoover first met fleury james lyster a pioneering metallurgist2829 in western australia friends called hoover hc or the old nickname hail columbia30 china and other global operationsedit hoovers work in china revolved around the huge kaiping mines hoover worked as chief engineer for the chinese bureau of mines and as general manager for the chinese engineering and mining corporation31 later he worked for bewick moreing co as the companys lead engineer hoovers wife learned mandarin chinese she was a firstrate linguist and he also learned some of the language while he worked in china it is said that they used it during his tenure at the white house when they wanted to foil eavesdroppers32 hoover made recommendations to improve the lot of the chinese worker seeking to end the practice of imposing long term servitude contracts and to institute reforms for workers based on merit33 the boxer rebellion trapped the hoovers in tianjin in june 1900 for almost a month the settlement was under fire and both dedicated themselves to defense of their city hoover himself guided us marines around tianjin during the battle using his knowledge of the local terrain34 mrs hoover meanwhile devoted her efforts at the various hospitals and even wielded and willingly and accurately deployed a 38caliber pistol35 lou henry age 17 on a burro and rifleready at acton california on august 22 1891 hoover was made a partner in bewick moreing co on december 18 1901 and assumed responsibility for various australian operations and investments36 his initial compensation rose to 12500 annually in addition to a 20 share of profits37 the company eventually controlled at one point approximately 50 of gold production in western australia38 in 1901 hoover no longer lived in australia but he visited the country in 1902 1903 1905 and 1907 as an overseas investor hoover was also a director of chinese engineering and mining corporation cemc when it became a supplier of immigrant labor from southeast asia for south african mines39 the first shipment of almost 2000 workers arrived in durban from qinhuangdao in july 1904 by 1906 the total number of immigrant workers increased to 50000 almost entirely recruited and shipped by cemc when the living and working conditions of the laborers became known public opposition to the scheme grew and questions were asked in the british parliament40 the scheme was abandoned in 1911 in august–september 1905 he founded the zinc corporation eventually part of the rio tinto group with william baillieu and others the leadsilver ore produced at broken hill new south wales was rich in zinc but the zinc could not be recovered due to the sulphide problem and was left in the tailings that remained after the silver and lead was extracted41 zinc corporation proposed to buy the tailings and extract the zinc by a new process the froth flotation process was then being developed at broken hill although the zinc corporation struggled to apply it42 hoover was in australia in 1905 fj lyster originally a carpenter before becoming a foreman in the gravity mill perfected the lyster process28 which enabled the zinc corporation to operate the worlds first selective or differential flotation plant according to geoffrey blainey though the process was not fully understood a patent was applied for in may 191223 hoovers brother theodore j hoover also came to broken hill broken hill was one of the dreariest places in the world at this time it lay in the middle of the desert was unbelievably hot in summer had no fresh water no vegetation and mountains of tailings blew into every crack with every wisp of wind43 despite these miserable conditions hoover and his associates became suppliers to world industry of zinc and other vital base minerals sole proprietoredit herbert hoover in his 30s while a mining engineer in 1908 hoover became an independent mining consultant traveling worldwide until the outbreak of world war i in 1914 he left bewick moreing co and setting out on his own eventually ended up with investments on every continent and offices in san francisco london new york city st petersburg paris and mandalay burma44 he specialized in rejuvenating troubled mining operations taking a share of the profits in exchange for his technical and financial expertise45 he had his second successful venture with the british firm burma corporation again producing silver lead and zinc in large quantities at the namtu bawdwin mine where he caught malaria in 19071390–96101–10246 he also helped increase copper production in kyshtym russia through the use of pyritic smelting then he agreed to manage one of the russian czars cabinet mines located in the altai mountains the oxidized leadzincsilver ore contained copper and gold as well according to hoover it developed probably the greatest and richest single body of ore known in the world before the communist revolution13102–10847 while living in london noting the american engineers patriotic intensity some british acquaintances referred to him as the starspangled hoover it recalled the nickname he had acquired in the australian outback hail columbia hoover48 the bawdwin mine ultimately became the chief source of hoovers fortune49 in his spare time hoover wrote his lectures at columbia and stanford universities were published in 1909 as principles of mining50 which became a standard textbook the book reflects his move towards progressive ideals as hoover came to endorse eighthour workdays and organized labor51 hoover and his wife also published their english translation of the 1556 mining classic de re metallica in 1912 this translation from the latin of renaissance author georgius agricola is still the most important scholarly version and provides its historical context52 by 1914 hoover was a very wealthy man with an estimated personal fortune of 4 million53 he was once quoted as saying if a man has not made a million dollars by the time he is forty he is not worth much54 by 1914 hoover stood eventually to obtain what he later described as a large fortune from these russian industries probably more than is good for anybody55 sixtysix years after opening the mine in 1897 hoover still had a partial share in the sons of gwalia mine when it finally closed in 1963 just one year before the former presidents death in new york city in 1964 the successful mine had yielded 55m in gold and 10m in dividends for investors13 herbert hoover acting as a main investor financier mining speculator and organizer of men played a major role in the important metallurgical developments that occurred in broken hill in the first decade of the twentieth century developments that had a great impact on the mining and production of silver lead and zinc565758596061 in later years hoover thought of himself and his associates as engineering doctors to sick concerns hence his reputation as the doctor of sick mines62 humanitarian workedit relief in europe and belgiumedit poster for the american relief administration for belgium directed by hoover when world war i began in august 1914 hoover helped organize the return of around 120000 americans from europe he led 500 volunteers in distributing food clothing steamship tickets and cash63 i did not realize it at the moment but on august 3 1914 my career was over forever i was on the slippery road of public life64 hoover liked to say that the difference between dictatorship and democracy was simple dictators organize from the top down democracies from the bottom up when belgium faced a food crisis after being invaded by germany in 1914 hoover undertook an unprecedented relief effort with the commission for relief in belgium crb65 as chairman of the crb hoover worked with the leader of the belgian comité national de secours et dalimentation cnsa émile francqui to feed the entire nation for the duration of the war the crb obtained and imported millions of tons of foodstuffs for the cnsa to distribute and watched over the cnsa to make sure the german army did not appropriate the food the crb became a veritable independent republic of relief with its own flag navy factories mills and railroads private donations and government grants 78 supplied an 11millionamonth budget66 for the next two years hoover worked 14hour days from london administering the distribution of over two million tons of food to nine million war victims in an early form of shuttle diplomacy he crossed the north sea forty times to meet with german authorities and persuade them to allow food shipments becoming an international hero the belgian city of leuven named a prominent square hooverplein after him at its peak hoovers american relief administration ara fed 105 million people daily great britain grew reluctant to support the crb preferring instead to emphasize germanys obligation to supply the relief winston churchill whom hoover intensely disliked led a military faction that considered the belgian relief effort a positive military disaster67 during this time hoover made a strong impression on the american ambassador to great britain walter page in a memoranda dated december 30 1916 page wrote mr herbert c hoover chairman of the commission for relief in belgium would if opportunity should offer make a useful officer in the state department he is probably the only man living who has privately ie without holding office negotiated understandings with the british french german dutch and belgian governments he personally knows and has had direct dealings with these governments and his transactions with them have involved several hundred million dollars he is a man of very considerable fortune—less than when the war began for this relief work has cost him much he was approached on behalf of the british government with the suggestion that if he would become a british subject the government would be pleased to give him an important executive post and with the hint that if he succeeded a title might await him his answer was ill do what i can for you with pleasure but ill be damned if ill give up my american citizenship—not on your life within the last six months two large financial organizations each independently have offered him 100000 a year to enter their service and an industrial company offered him 100000 to start with he declined them all when the belgian relief work recently struck a financial snag hoover by telegraph got the promise of a loan in the united states to the british and french governments for belgian relief of 150000000686970 us food administrationedit after the united states entered the war in april 1917 president woodrow wilson appointed hoover to head the us food administration which was created under the lever food control act in 1917 to ensure the nations food needs during the war this was a position he actively sought though he later claimed it was thrust upon him he was convinced from his belgian work that centralization of authority was essential to any relief effort he demanded and got great power albeit not as much as he sought71 hoover believed food will win the war and beginning on september 29 this slogan was introduced and put into frequent use72 earning the appellation of food czar hoover recruited a volunteer force of hundreds of thousands of women and deployed propaganda in movie theaters schools and churches73 he carefully selected men to assist in the agency leadership – alonzo taylor technical abilities robert taft political associations gifford pinchot agricultural influence and julius barnes business acumen74 determined to avoid rationing hoover established set days for people to avoid eating specified foods and save them for soldiers rations meatless mondays wheatless wednesdays and when in doubt eat potatoes these policies were dubbed hooverizing by government publicists in spite of hoovers continual orders that publicity should not mention him by name the agency employed a system of price controls and licensing requirements for suppliers to maximize production despite efforts to prevent it some companies reaped great profits75 postwar relief and 1920 electionedit days after the end of world war i in november 1918 hoover sailed to europe the united states food administration became the american relief administration ara and hoover was charged with providing food to central and eastern europe the ara fed millions including the inhabitants of germany and the former habsburg empire us government funding for the ara expired in the summer of 1919 and hoover transformed the ara into a private organization raising millions of dollars from private donors under the auspices of the ara the european childrens fund fed millions of starving children in addition to nourishing millions the ara also helped the united states avoid a potentially problematic domestic food surplus in response to criticism over his willingness to grant aid to countries under the sway of bolshevism hoover stated twenty million people are starving whatever their politics they shall be fed76 reflecting the gratitude of many europeans in july 1922 soviet author maxim gorky wrote to hoover your help will enter history as a unique gigantic achievement worthy of the greatest glory which will long remain in the memory of millions of russians whom you have saved from death77 as one of the most powerful individuals in europe hoover became involved in continental politics he was broadly supportive of wilsons fourteen points and was appointed by wilson to the us delegation at the peace conference in versailles he urged ratification of the treaty of versailles but opposed harsh reparations for germany78 he opposed a monarchist coup in hungary and demanded the appointment of the moderate ignacy jan paderewski in poland he condemned bolshevism but warned president wilson against an intervention in russia viewing the white russian forces as little better and fearing the possibility of a protracted us involvement79 hoover had been littleknown among the american public before 1914 but emerged as perhaps the secondmost famous person in the united states after president wilson in the leadup to the 1920 presidential election hoover was often mentioned as a potential candidate but his partisan affiliation was unclear hoover particularly appealed to progressives of both parties who commended his wartime push for higher taxes criticism of attorney general a mitchell palmer and advocacy for measures such as the minimum wage fortyeighthour workweek and elimination of child labor yet hoovers rags to riches story and wartime leadership made him appealing to many others as well in march 1920 hoover publicly declared his allegiance with the gop stating that he would not run for but would not refuse the 1920 republican nomination hoover had various reasons for choosing the republican party including a split with wilson over the versailles treaty hoover had come to accept the lodge reservations to the treaty and his view that the democrats would likely lose the 1920 election however the conservative old guard of the gop viewed hoover warily and his time as food czar had also made him numerous enemies among farmers an important bloc in the gop hoovers candidacy for the gop nomination fizzled out after his defeat in the california primary by favorite son hiram johnson in the general election hoover supported the republican nominee warren g harding who emerged victorious80 in 1919 hoover established the hoover war collection at stanford university he donated all the files of the commission for relief in belgium the us food administration and the american relief administration and pledged 50000 as an endowment scholars were sent to europe to collect pamphlets society publications government documents newspapers posters proclamations and other ephemeral materials related to the war and the revolutions that followed it the collection was renamed the hoover war library in 1922 and is now known as the hoover institution81 efficiencyedit after working with the food administration hoover became president of the federated american engineering societies8283 hoovers design was set on increasing efficiency and reducing waste8384 as president of the faes hoover constructed a plan to study waste in the industrial sector and he had a strong focus on labor matters85 the result was a 400page report titled waste in industry86 which was a highly publicized report at the time8788 when hoover became commerce secretary he resigned from the faes89 waste in industry served as a blueprint for the department of commerce for the next several years90 secretary of commerceedit assistants william mccracken left walter drake right with secretary hoover center after his election as president in 1920 harding rewarded hoover for his support offering to appoint him as either secretary of the interior or secretary of commerce expecting opposition from the republicancontrolled senate hoover initially decided to refuse a cabinet position but harding paired hoovers nomination with that of andrew mellon who many republicans hoped would become secretary of the treasury secretary of commerce was considered a minor cabinet post with limited and vaguely defined responsibilities but hoover decided to accept the position hoover remained in office until 1928 serving in both the harding and coolidge administrations91 hoover envisioned the commerce department as the hub of the nations growth and stability from harding he demanded and received authority to coordinate economic affairs throughout the government he created many subdepartments and committees overseeing and regulating everything from manufacturing statistics the census and radio to air travel in some instances he seized control of responsibilities from other cabinet departments when he deemed that they were not carrying out their responsibilities well he became known as the secretary of commerce and undersecretary of all other departments92 many of hoovers efforts as commerce secretary centered on eliminating waste and increasing efficiency in business and industry this included reducing labor losses from trade disputes and seasonal fluctuations reducing industrial losses from accident and injury and reducing the amount of crude oil spilled during extraction and shipping one major achievement was to promote product standardizations he promoted international trade by opening overseas offices to advise businessmen hoover was especially eager to promote hollywood films overseas93 his own your own home campaign was a collaboration to promote ownership of singlefamily dwellings with groups such as the better houses in america movement the architects small house service bureau and the home modernizing bureau he worked with bankers and the savings and loan industry to promote the new longterm home mortgage which dramatically stimulated home construction94 hoover with president harding at a baseball game in 1921 hoovers detractors wondered why he did not do anything to reapportion congress after the 1920 united states census which saw an increase in urban and immigrant populations the 1920 census was the first and only decennial census where the results were not used to reapportion congress which ultimately influenced the 1928 electoral college and impacted the presidential election9596 as secretary and later as president hoover revolutionized relations between business and government rejecting the adversarial stance of theodore roosevelt william howard taft and woodrow wilson he sought to make the commerce department a powerful service organization empowered to forge cooperative voluntary partnerships between government and business this philosophy is often called associationalism both the us department of justice and the federal trade commission opposed hoovers goals97 but the us supreme court ruled in maple flooring manufacturers assn v united states 268 us 563 1925 that hoovers policies served the public interest by producing fairer price levels and avoiding waste98 radio and air traveledit herbert hoover listening to a radio receiver hoovers radio conferences played a key role in the early organization development and regulation of radio broadcasting prior to the radio act of 1927 the secretary of commerce was unable to deny radio licensing or reassign broadcast frequencies with help from supporters senator dill and representative white hoover brought the issue of radio control to the senate floor hoover fought for more power to control the proliferation of licensed radio stations which in 1927 stood at 732 stations with help from dill and white hoover promoted the dillwhite bill which eventually would become the radio act of 1927 this act allowed the government to intervene and abolish radio stations that were deemed nonuseful to the public hoovers attempts at regulating radio were not supported by all congressmen and he received much opposition from the senate and from radio station owners however hoovers contributions to regulate radio in its infancy heavily influenced the modern radio system99 hoover was also influential in the early development of air travel he sought to create a thriving private industry boosted by indirect government subsidies he encouraged the development of emergency landing fields and required all runways to be equipped with lights and radio beams he also encouraged farmers to make use of planes for crop dusting in light of his efforts washington dc named its first airport hoover field100 traffic conferencesedit as commerce secretary hoover also hosted two national conferences on street traffic in 1924 and 1926 a third convened in 1930 during hoovers presidency collectively the meetings were called the national conference on street and highway safety hoovers chief objective was to address the growing casualty toll of traffic accidents but the scope grew and soon embraced motor vehicle standards rules of the road and urban traffic control he left the invited interest groups to negotiate agreements among themselves which were then presented for adoption by states and localities because automotive trade associations were the best organized many of the positions taken by the conferences reflected their interests the conferences issued a model uniform vehicle code for adoption by the states and a model municipal traffic ordinance for adoption by cities both were widely influential promoting greater uniformity between jurisdictions and tending to promote the automobiles priority in city streets101 mississippi floodedit the great mississippi flood of 1927 broke the banks and levees of the lower mississippi river in early 1927 resulting in flooding of millions of acres and leaving 15 million people displaced from their homes although such a disaster did not fall under the duties of the commerce department the governors of six states along the mississippi specifically asked for herbert hoover in the emergency president coolidge appointed hoover to coordinate the response to the flood102 hoover personally crisscrossed the mississippi valley giving speeches and coordinating the response he established over one hundred tent cities and a fleet of more than six hundred vessels and raised 17 million in large part due to his leadership during the flood crisis by 1928 hoover had begun to overshadow president coolidge himself103 the treatment of africanamericans during the disaster endangered hoovers reputation as a humanitarian local officials brutalized black farmers and prevented them from leaving relief camps aid intended for africanamerican sharecroppers was often given instead to the landowners and black men often were conscripted by locals into forced labor sometimes at gun point104 knowing the potential damage to his presidential hopes if this became public hoover struck a deal with robert russa moton the prominent africanamerican successor to booker t washington as president of the tuskegee institute in exchange for keeping the sufferings of africanamericans quiet hoover promised unprecedented influence for africanamericans should he become president moton agreed and following the accommodationist philosophy of washington he worked actively to conceal the information from the media105 presidential election of 1928edit main article united states presidential election 1928 republican nominationedit when president calvin coolidge announced in august 1927 that he would not seek a second full term of office in the 1928 presidential election hoover became the leading republican candidate despite the fact coolidge was lukewarm on hoover often deriding his ambitious and popular commerce secretary as wonder boy106 coolidge had been reluctant to choose hoover as his successor on one occasion he remarked that for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice—all of it bad i was particularly offended by his comment to shit or get off the pot107 even so coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the popular commerce secretarys nomination108 prior to the 1928 republican national convention many wary republican leaders cast about for an alternative candidate such as treasury secretary andrew mellon former secretary of state charles evans hughes or coolidge109 but no challenger emerged and hoover won the presidential nomination on the first ballot of the convention the delegates considered nominating incumbent vice president charles dawes to be hoovers running mate but coolidge who hated dawes remarked that this would be a personal affront to him the convention instead selected senator charles curtis of kansas110 hoover accepted the nomination at stanford stadium telling a huge crowd that he would continue the policies of the harding and coolidge administration111 general electionedit 1928 electoral vote results hoover campaigned for efficiency and the republican record of prosperity against democrat alfred e smith smith likewise was a proponent of efficiency earned as governor of new york both candidates were probusiness and each promised to improve conditions for farmers reform immigration laws and maintain america’s isolationist foreign policy where they differed was on the volstead act which outlawed the sale of liquor and beer smith was a “wet” who called for its repeal whereas hoover gave limited support for prohibition calling it an “experiment noble in purpose” his use of “experiment” suggested it was not permanent while smith won extra support among catholics in the big cities he was also the target of intense anticatholicism from some protestant communities especially amongst southern baptists and german lutherans112 overall the religious factor worked to the advantage of hoover although he took no part in it113 historians agree that hoover’s national reputation and the booming economy combined with deep splits in the democratic party over religion and prohibition guaranteed his landslide victory with 58 percent of the popular vote114 hoover’s appeal to southern white voters succeeded in cracking the “solid south” winning the democratic strongholds of florida north carolina virginia texas and tennessee and nearly taking alabama on support from appalachian counties the deep south continued to support smith as the democratic candidate this was the first time that a republican candidate for president had carried texas hoover and the national party had pursued a “lilywhite southern strategy” to resuscitate the republican party in the south “purging black republicans from leadership positions in the southern wing of the gop”115 this outraged the black leadership which largely broke from the republican party and began seeking candidates who supported civil rights within the democratic party116 in 1956 w e b du bois a leader in the naacp in the 1920s would recall that “in 1928 negroes faced absolute dilemma neither hoover nor smith wanted the negro vote and both publicly insulted us”117 presidency 1929–1933edit main article presidency of herbert hoover inauguration of hoover following his inauguration hoover held a press conference on his first day in office promising a new phase of press relations118 he asked the group of journalists to elect a committee to recommend improvements to the white house press conference hoover declined to use a spokesman instead asking reporters to directly quote him and giving them handouts with his statements ahead of time in his first 120 days in office he held more regular and frequent press conferences than any other president before or since however he changed his press policies after the 1929 stock market crash screening reporters and greatly reducing his availability118 hoover entered office with a plan to reform the nations regulatory system believing that a federal bureaucracy should have limited regulation over a countrys economic system119 hoover sought a balance among labor capital and the government and he has been variously labeled a corporatist or associationalist120 hoover saw the presidency as a vehicle for improving the conditions of all americans by encouraging publicprivate cooperation—what he termed volunteerism he tended to oppose governmental coercion or intervention as he thought they infringed on american ideals of individualism and selfreliance121 hoover made extensive use of commissions to study issues and propose solutions and many of those commissions were sponsored by private donors rather than by the government one of the commissions started by hoover the research committee on social trends was tasked with surveying the entirety of american society122 lou henry hoover was an activist first lady she typified the new woman of the post–world war i era intelligent robust and aware of multiple female possibilities123 white house physician admiral joel t boone invented the sport hooverball to keep hoover fit while in the white house hooverball is a combination of volleyball and tennis played with a 6 lb medicine ball hoover and several staff members played it each morning earning them the nickname medicine ball cabinet124 domestic policiesedit civil rightsedit hoover seldom mentioned civil rights while he was president he believed that africanamericans and other races could improve themselves with education and individual initiative125 he opposed federal antilynching laws and when lynchings occurred in the south including one incident linked to his partys efforts to republicanize southern states he offered only verbal condemnation115 first lady lou hoover defied custom and invited the wife of republican oscar de priest the only africanamerican member in congress to tea at the white house booker t washington was the previous africanamerican to have dined at the white house with theodore roosevelt in 1901126 charles curtis the nations first native american vice president was from the kaw tribe in kansas127 hoovers humanitarian and quaker reputation along with curtis as a vicepresident gave special meaning to his indian policies his quaker upbringing influenced his views that native americans needed to achieve economic selfsufficiency as president he appointed charles j rhoads as commissioner of indian affairs hoover supported rhoads commitment to indian assimilation and sought to minimize the federal role in indian affairs his goal was to have indians acting as individuals not as tribes and to assume the responsibilities of citizenship granted with the indian citizenship act of 1924128 great depressionedit see also great depression in the united states on taking office hoover said that given the chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years we shall soon with the help of god be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation129 having seen the fruits of prosperity brought by technological progress many shared hoovers optimism and the already bullish stock market climbed even higher on hoovers accession130 but within months of taking office the stock market crash of 1929 also known as black tuesday occurred and the worldwide economy began to spiral downward into the great depression131 the causes of the great depression remain a matter of debate132 but hoover viewed a lack of confidence in the financial system as the fundamental economic problem facing the nation133 he sought to avoid direct federal intervention believing that the best way to bolster the economy was through the strengthening of businesses such as banks and railroads he also feared that allowing individuals on the dole would permanently weaken the country134 instead hoover strongly believed that local governments and private giving should address the needs of individuals135 a reserved man with a fear of public speaking hoover allowed his political enemies to define him as cold incompetent reactionary and outoftouch136 early policiesedit hoover pursued many policies in an attempt to pull the country out of depression while attempting to restrain the federal government from becoming directly involved in commercial affairs in the days following black tuesday hoover gathered business and labor leaders asking them to avoid wage cuts and work stoppages while the country faced what he believed would be a short recession similar to the depression of 1920–21137 some economists such as lee ohanian point to the resulting wage rigidity as a key cause of the severity of the great depression138 hoover also authorized the mexican repatriation program to help unemployed mexican citizens return home the program was largely a forced migration of approximately 500000 people to mexico and continued until 1937 in the spring of 1930 hoover acquired from congress an additional 100 million to continue the federal farm board lending and purchasing policies at the end of 1929 the ffb established the national wool marketing corporation nwmc a national wool cooperative made up of 30 state associations139 hoover also supported new public works projects although his fear of budget deficits led him to oppose expansive projects such as that contemplated by the muscle shoals bill which sought to establish government production and distribution of power in the tennessee valley140 in autumn 1930 hoover established the presidents organization for unemployment relief which issues press releases urging companies to hire135 hoover had taken office hoping to raise agricultural tariffs in order to help farmers reeling from the farm crisis of the 1920s but his attempt to raise agricultural tariffs became connected with attempts to raise tariffs for other goods141 in june 1930 over the objection of many economists congress approved and hoover reluctantly signed into law the smoot–hawley tariff act the legislation raised tariffs on thousands of imported items the intent of the act was to encourage the purchase of americanmade products by increasing the cost of imported goods while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers however economic depression had spread worldwide and canada france and other nations retaliated by raising tariffs on imports from the us the result was to contract international trade and worsen the depression142 progressive republicans such as senator borah were outraged when hoover signed the bill and hoovers relations with that wing of the party never recovered143 later policiesedit for much of his presidency hoover opposed congressional proposals to provide federal relief and he feared that congress would impose a federal relief program that would infringe on the prerogatives of state and local governments and philanthropic organizations144 hoover created the national credit corporation a voluntary association of bankers but the organization did not manage to save banks or ease credit as hoover had hoped it would145 as the great depression continued hoover finally heeded calls for more direct federal intervention though he vetoed a bill that would have allowed direct federal lending to individuals146 in january 1932 hoover signed a bill creating the reconstruction finance corporation rfc147 the rfcs initial goal was to provide governmentsecured loans to financial institutions railroads and local governments to continue relief programs the rfc saved numerous businesses from failure but it failed to stimulate commercial lending as hoover had hoped partly because it was run by conservative bankers unwilling to make riskier loans148 the rfc would be adopted by roosevelt and greatly expanded as part of his new deal149 with the rfc failing to stem the economic crisis hoover signed the emergency relief and construction act a major public works bill in july 1932150 throughout his presidency hoover defended the gold standard and derided any other monetary system as collectivism151 hoover and senator carter glass another gold standard proponent recognized that they needed to stop deflation by encouraging the lending of credit hoover was instrumental in passing the glass–steagall act of 1932 which allowed for prime rediscounting at the federal reserve in turn allowing further inflation of credit and bank reserves152 in july 1932 hoover signed the federal home loan bank act establishing 12 district banks overseen by a federal home loan bank board in a manner similar to the federal reserve system153 in 1930 unemployment stood at 89 and many assumed that the united states was just in another recession154 but by 1932 unemployment had reached 249 businesses had defaulted on record numbers of loans and more than 5000 banks had failed especially small rural banks155 the homeless lived in shantytowns they called hoovervilles156 herbert hoover in the oval office with ted joslin 1932 taxes revenues and deficitsedit national debt as a fraction of gnp up from 20 to 40 under hoover from historical statistics us 1976 hoover was a firm believer in balanced budgets and sought to avoid a budget deficit by greatly increasing tax rates on the wealthy to pay for government programs and to make up for revenue lost due to the depression hoover signed the revenue act of 1932 the act increased taxes across the board so that top earners were taxed at 63 on their net income – up from 25 when herbert hoover took office the 1932 act also increased the tax on the net income of corporations from 12 to 1375157 additionally under hoover the estate tax was doubled and corporate taxes were raised by almost 15 also a check tax took effect placing a 2cent tax over 30 cents in todays economy on all bank checks economists william d lastrapes and george selgin conclude that the check tax was an important contributing factor to that periods severe monetary contraction158 despite the passage of the revenue act the federal government continued to run a budget deficit159 herbert and lou henry hoover aboard a train in illinois foreign relationsedit according to leuchtenberg hoover was the last american president to take office with no conspicuous need to pay attention to the rest of the world but during hoovers term the world order established with the 1919 treaty of versailles began to crumble160 as president hoover largely made good on his pledge made prior to assuming office not to interfere in latin americas internal affairs in 1930 he released the clark memorandum a rejection of the roosevelt corollary and a move towards noninterventionism in latin america hoover did not completely refrain from the use of the military in latin american affairs he thrice threatened intervention in the dominican republic and he sent warships to el salvador to support the government against a leftwing revolution161 but he wound down the banana wars ending the occupation of nicaragua and nearly bringing an end to the occupation of haiti franklin roosevelts good neighbor policy would continue the trend towards noninterventionism in latin america 162 though the united states remained outside of the league of nations hoover showed a willingness to work within multilateral structures hoover pursued united states membership in the permanent court of international justice but the senate never voted on his proposal the senate also defeated hoovers proposed saint lawrence seaway treaty with canada163 in 1930 the united states and other major naval powers signed the london naval treaty an extension of the 1922 washington naval treaty which sought to prevent a naval arms race164 the treaty represented the first time that the naval powers had agreed to cap their tonnage of auxiliary vessels previous agreements had focused on capital ships but the treaty failed to include france or italy the treaty provoked a nationalist backlash in japan due to its reconfirmation of the 553 ratio which limited japan to a smaller fleet than the united states or the united kingdom at the 1932 world disarmament conference hoover urged worldwide cutbacks in armaments and the outlawing of tanks and bombers but his proposals were not adopted165 in 1931 japan invaded manchuria defeating the republic of chinas military forces and establishing manchukuo a puppet state the hoover administration deplored the invasion but also sought to avoid antagonizing the japanese fearing that taking too strong a stand would weaken the moderate forces in the japanese government in response to the japanese invasion hoover and secretary of state henry stimson outlined the stimson doctrine which held that the united states would not recognize territories gained by force the hoover administration based this declaration on the 1928 kelloggbriand pact in which several nations including japan and the united states renounced war and promised to peacefully solve disputes in the aftermath of invasion of manchuria stimson and other members of the cabinet came to believe that war with japan might be inevitable though hoover continued to push for disarmament among the world powers166 in 1931 hoover issued the hoover moratorium calling for a oneyear halt in world war i reparation payments hoover also made us bankers agree to refrain from demanding payment on private loans from germans167 hoover hoped that the moratorium would help stabilize the european economy which he viewed as a major cause of economic troubles in the united states168 as the moratorium neared its expiration the following year an attempt to find a permanent solution was made at the lausanne conference of 1932 a working compromise was never established and reparations payments virtually stopped169 bonus armyedit main article bonus army thousands of world war i veterans and their families demonstrated and camped out in washington dc during june 1932 calling for immediate payment of a bonus that had been promised by the world war adjusted compensation act in 1924 for payment in 1945 although offered money by congress to return home some members of the bonus army remained washington police attempted to remove the demonstrators from their camp but they were outnumbered and unsuccessful shots were fired by the police in a futile attempt to attain order and two protesters were killed while many officers were injured hoover sent us army forces led by general douglas macarthur and helped by lower ranking officers dwight d eisenhower and george s patton to stop a march macarthur believing he was fighting a communist revolution chose to clear out the camp with military force in the ensuing clash hundreds of civilians were injured hoover had sent orders that the army was not to move on the encampment but macarthur chose to ignore the command hoover was incensed but refused to reprimand macarthur the entire incident was another devastating negative for hoover in the 1932 election that led new york governor and democratic presidential candidate franklin roosevelt to declare of hoover there is nothing inside the man but jelly 1932 reelection campaignedit hoover addresses a large crowd in his 1932 campaign main article united states presidential election 1932 despite the economic calamity facing the nation and his dim hopes for reelection hoover faced little opposition for renomination at the 1932 republican national convention some republicans talked of nominating coolidge former vice president charles dawes or senator hiram johnson but all passed on the opportunity to challenge hoover170 curtis was renominated as hoovers running mate franklin d roosevelt won the presidential nomination on the third ballot of the 1932 democratic national convention defeating the 1928 democratic nominee al smith speaker of the house john nance garner was nominated as roosevelts running mate by 1932 the radio was in 12 million homes changing the nature of presidential campaigns no longer could presidents change the content of their speeches for each audience anyone with a radio could listen to every major speech171 hoover originally planned to make only one or two major speeches and to leave the rest of the campaigning to proxies as sitting presidents had traditionally done however encouraged by republican pleas and outraged by democratic claims hoover entered the public fray in his nine major radio addresses hoover primarily defended his administration and his philosophy of government hoover urged voters to hold to the foundations of experience rejecting the notion that government interventionism could save the country from the depression172 1932 electoral vote results in his campaign trips around the country hoover was faced with perhaps the most hostile crowds of any sitting president besides having his train and motorcades pelted with eggs and rotten fruit he was often heckled while speaking and on several occasions the secret service halted attempts to kill hoover by disgruntled citizens including capturing one man nearing hoover carrying sticks of dynamite and another already having removed several spikes from the rails in front of the presidents train173 the democrats attacked hoover as the cause of the great depression and for being indifferent to the suffering of millions174 as governor of new york roosevelt had called on the new york legislature to provide aid for the needy establishing roosevelts reputation for being more favorable toward government interventionism during the economic crisis175 fausold rejects the notion that the two nominees were similar ideologically pointing to differences between the two on federal spending on public works agricultural issues prohibition and the tariff176 hoovers attempts to vindicate his administration fell on deaf ears as much of the public blamed his administration for the depression177 roosevelt won 574 percent of the popular vote compared to hoovers 397 hoover’s popular vote was reduced by nineteen percent from his result in the 1928 election and he carried just five northeastern states and delaware roosevelt became the first democratic presidential nominee to win a majority of the popular vote since the civil war178 postpresidencyedit hoover with franklin d roosevelt march 4 1933 hoover departed from washington in march 1933 bitter at his election loss and continuing unpopularity179 upon leaving office hoover was the only living expresident for nearly 20 years until harry truman left office in 1953 the hoovers went first to new york city where they stayed for a while in the waldorf astoria hotel later that spring they returned to california to their stanford residence hoover enjoyed returning to the mens clubs that he had long been involved with including the bohemian club the pacificunion club and the university club in san francisco180 hoover and his wife lived in palo alto until her death in 1944 at which point hoover began to live permanently at the waldorf astoria181 hoover liked to drive his car accompanied by his wife or a friend former presidents did not get secret service protection until the 1960s and drive on wandering journeys visiting western mining camps or small towns where he often went unrecognized or heading up to the mountains or deep into the woods to go fishing in relative solitude a year before his death his own fishing days behind him he published fishing for fun—and to wash your soul the last of more than sixteen books in his lifetime in 1939 hoover became the first honorary chairman of tolstoy foundation in valley cottage new york and served in this capacity until his death in 1964182 hoovers book fishing for fun – and to wash your soul opposition to rooseveltedit hoover continued to closely follow national events after his retirement becoming a constant critic of franklin roosevelt in response to continued attacks on his character and presidency hoover wrote more than two dozen books including the challenge to liberty 1934 which harshly criticized the new deal hoover feared that the country had surrendered its freedom of mind and spirit to the new deal he described the national recovery administration and agricultural adjustment administration as fascistic and the 1933 banking act as a move to gigantic socialism183 hoover fishing in his home state of iowa only 58 when he left office hoover held out hope for another term during the 1930s at the 1936 republican national convention hoovers speech attacking the new deal was well received but the nomination went to kansas governor alf landon184 in the general election hoover campaigned for landons unsuccessful campaign with numerous wellpublicized speeches attacking new deal liberalism185 though hoover was eager to oppose roosevelt at every turn and senator arthur vandenberg and other republicans urged the stillunpopular hoover to remain out of the fray during the debate over roosevelts proposed judiciary reorganization bill of 1937 at the 1940 republican national convention hoover again hoped for the presidential nomination and was dismayed when it went to the internationalist wendell willkie186 hoover remained popular in europe and he was honored in france and belgium during a 1938 trip to europe hoover met with adolf hitler and stayed at hermann görings hunting lodge hoover expressed dismay at the persecution of jews in germany and believed that hitler was mad but did not present a threat to the us instead hoover believed that roosevelt posed the biggest threat to peace as he believed that roosevelt provoked japan and discouraged france and the united kingdom from reaching an accommodation with germany78 after the september 1939 invasion of poland by germany hoover opposed united states intervention in world war ii including the lendlease policy187 hoover became a vocal supporter of providing relief to countries in nazioccupied europe188 he was instrumental in creating the commission for polish relief and finnish relief fund189190 in 1939 roosevelt asked hoover to the white house for advice on getting aid to poland but hoover turned down the offer much to his own frustration hoover was not called upon to serve after the united states entered world war ii due to his differences with roosevelt and his continuing unpopularity181 during a radio broadcast on june 29 1941 one week after the nazi invasion of the soviet union hoover disparaged any tacit alliance between the us and the ussr by saying if we go further and join the war and we win then we have won for stalin the grip of communism on russia again i say if we join the war and stalin wins we have aided him to impose more communism on europe and the world at least we could not with such a bedfellow say to our sons that by making the supreme sacrifice they are restoring freedom to the world war alongside stalin to impose freedom is more than a travesty it is a tragedy191 post–world war iiedit herbert hoover with his son allan left and his grandson andrew above 1950 following world war ii hoover became friends with president harry s truman despite their ideological differences192 hoover joked that they were for many years the sole members of the trade union of former presidents because of hoovers experience with germany at the end of world war i in 1946 president truman selected the former president to tour germany to ascertain the food needs of the occupied nation hoover toured what was to become west germany in hermann görings old train coach and produced a number of reports critical of us occupation policy the economy of germany had sunk to the lowest level in a hundred years193 he stated in one report there is the illusion that the new germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a pastoral state it cannot be done unless we exterminate or move 25000000 people out of it194 external audio national press club luncheon speakers herbert hoover march 10 1954 3723 hoover speaks starting at 725 about the second

chairman to reorganize the executive departments this became known as the hoover commission led by hoover the commission recommended changes designed to strengthen the presidents ability to manage the federal government though hoover had opposed fdrs concentration of power in the 1930s he believed that a stronger presidency was required with the advent of atomic age in 1953 hoover was appointed to a similar commission by president dwight d eisenhower despite the appointment hoover disliked eisenhower faulting the latters failure to roll back the new deal197 hoovers official white house portrait painted by elmer wesley greene despite his advancing years hoover continued to work nearly fulltime both on writing among his literary works is the ordeal of woodrow wilson a bestseller and the first

those of a number of other former high ranking governmental and military servants he also threw himself into fundraising for the boys clubs now the boys girls clubs of america which became his pet charitycitation needed in 1958 congress passed the former presidents act offering a 25000 yearly pension to each former president198 hoover who was the only other living former president took the pension even though he did not need the money reportedly he did so to avoid embarrassing former president truman whose precarious financial status played a role in the laws enactment199 final years and deathedit hoover was the only living former republican president between his last day in office in 1933 and eisenhowers last day in office in 1961 starting with the 1948 convention hoover was feted as the guest of farewell ceremonies with the unspoken assumption that the aging former president might not survive until the next convention in 1960 hoover appeared at his final republican national convention joking to the delegates he said apparently my last three goodbyes didnt take although he lived to see the 1964 convention ill health prevented him from attending and his absence was acknowledged in presidential nominee barry goldwaters acceptance speech in 1962 hoover had a malignant intestinal tumor removed ten months later he had severe gastrointestinal bleeding and seemed

his wife who was a geologist and proficient in latin it remains the standard english translation hoover began his magnum opus freedom betrayed206 in 1944 as part of a proposed autobiography this turned into a significant work critiquing the foreign policy of the united states during the period from the 1930s to 1945 essentially an attack on the statesmanship of franklin d roosevelt hoover completed this work in his 90th year but it was not published until the historian george h nash took on the task of editing it significant themes are his belief that the western democratic powers
