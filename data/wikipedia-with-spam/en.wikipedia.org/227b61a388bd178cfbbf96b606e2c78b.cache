the midpoint between the two extremes morphing is a special effect in motion pictures and animations that changes or morphs one image or shape into another through a seamless transition most often it is used to depict one person turning into another through technological means or as part of a fantasy or surreal sequence traditionally such a depiction would be achieved through crossfading techniques on film since the early 1990s this has been replaced by computer software to create more realistic transitions contents 1 early examples 11 dissolve 12 animation 13 digital morphing 2 modern techniques 3 present use 4 software 5 see also 6 references 7 external links early examplesedit dissolveedit in the first half of the 19th century dissolving views were a popular type of magic lantern show mostly showing landscapes gradually dissolving from a day to night version or from summer to winter other uses are known for instance henry langdon childe showed groves transforming into cathedrals1 the 1910 short film narrengrappen shows a dissolve transformation of the clothing of a female character2 maurice tourneurs 1915 film alias jimmy valentine featured a subtle dissolve transformation of the main character from respected citizen lee randall into his criminal alter ego jimmy valentine the peter tchaikovsky story in a 1959 tvseries episode of disneyland features a swan automaton transforming into a real ballet dancer3 in 1985 godley creme created a morph effect using analogue crossfades in the video for cry animationedit in animation the effect was created long before the invention of film a phenakistiscope designed by its inventor joseph plateau andor painter jeanbaptiste madou was printed around 1835 and shows the head of a woman changing into a witch and then into a monster4 émile cohls 1908 animated film fantasmagorie featured much morphing of characters and objects drawn in simple outlines5 digital morphingedit though the 1986 movie the golden child implemented very crude morphing effects from animal to human and back the first movie to employ detailed morphing was willow in 1988 a similar process was used a year later in indiana jones and the last crusade to create walter donovans gruesome demise both effects were created by industrial light magic using grid warping techniques developed by tom brigham and doug smythe ampas6 the cover for queens 1989 album the miracle featured the technique to morph the four band members faces into one gestalt image in 1991 morphing appeared notably in the michael jackson music video black or white and in the movies terminator 2 judgment day and star trek vi the undiscovered country the first application for personal computers to offer morphing was gryphon software morph on the macintosh other early morphing systems included imagemaster morphplus and cinemorph all of which premiered for the commodore amiga in 1992 other programs became widely available within a year and for a time the effect became common to the point of cliché for highend use elastic reality based on morphplus saw its first feature film use in in the line of fire 1993 and was used in quantum leap work performed by the post group at visionart ted fay used elastic reality to morph odo for star trek deep space nine elastic reality was later purchased by avid having already become the de facto system of choice used in many hundreds of films the technology behind elastic reality earned two academy awards in 1996 for scientific and technical achievement going to garth dickie and perry kivolowitz the effect is technically called a spatially warped crossdissolve the first social network designed for usergenerated morph examples to be posted online was galleries by morpheus morphing software in taiwan aderans a hair loss solutions provider did a tv commercial featuring a morphing sequence in which people with lush thick hair morph into one another reminiscent of the end sequence of the black or white video modern techniquesedit play media an animated example of an ape morphing into a bird in the early 1990s computer techniques that often produced more convincing results began to be widely used these involved distorting one image at the same time that it faded into another through marking corresponding points and vectors on the before and after images used in the morph for example one would morph one face into another by marking key points on the first face such as the contour of the nose or location of an eye and mark where these same points existed on the second face the computer would then distort the first face to have the shape of the second face at the same time that it faded the two faces to compute the transformation of image coordinates required for the distortion the algorithm of beier and neely can be used present useedit morphing algorithms continue to advance and programs can automatically morph images that correspond closely enough with relatively little instruction from the user this has led to the use of morphing techniques to create convincing slowmotion effects where none existed in the original film or video footage by morphing between each individual frame using optical flow technologycitation needed morphing has also appeared as a transition technique between one scene and another in television shows even if the contents of the two images are entirely unrelated the algorithm in this case attempts to find corresponding points between the images and distort one into the other as they crossfade while perhaps less obvious than in the past morphing is used heavily todaycitation needed whereas the effect was initially a novelty today morphing effects are most often designed to be seamless and invisible to the eye a particular use for morphing effects is modern digital font design using morphing technology called interpolation or multiple master technology a designer can create an intermediate between two styles for example generating a semibold font by compromising between a bold and regular style or extend a trend to create an ultralight or ultrabold the technique is commonly used by font design studios7 softwareedit after effects
