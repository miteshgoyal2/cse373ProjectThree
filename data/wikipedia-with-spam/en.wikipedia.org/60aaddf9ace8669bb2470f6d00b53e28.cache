the wisconsin river by one of the algonquianspeaking native american groups living in the region at the time of european contact12 french explorer jacques marquette was the first european to reach the wisconsin river arriving in 1673 and calling the river meskousing in his journal13 subsequent french writers changed the spelling from meskousing to ouisconsin and over time this became the name for both the wisconsin river and the surrounding lands english speakers anglicized the spelling from ouisconsin to wisconsin when they began to arrive in large numbers during the early 19th century the legislature of wisconsin territory made the current spelling official in 184514 the algonquin word for wisconsin and its original meaning have both grown obscure interpretations vary but most implicate the river and the red sandstone that lines its banks one leading theory holds that the name originated from the miami word meskonsing meaning it lies red a reference to the setting of the wisconsin river as it flows through the reddish sandstone of the wisconsin dells15 other theories include claims that the name originated from one of a variety of ojibwa words meaning red stone place where the waters gather or great rock16 historyedit main article history of wisconsin wisconsin in 1718 guillaume de lisle map approximate state area highlighted early historyedit wisconsin has been home to a wide variety of cultures over the past 14000 years the first people arrived around 10000 bce during the wisconsin glaciation these early inhabitants called paleoindians hunted nowextinct ice age animals such as the boaz mastodon a prehistoric mastodon skeleton unearthed along with spear points in southwest wisconsin17 after the ice age ended around 8000 bce people in the subsequent archaic period lived by hunting fishing and gathering food from wild plants agricultural societies emerged gradually over the woodland period between 1000 bce to 1000 ce toward the end of this period wisconsin was the heartland of the effigy mound culture which built thousands of animalshaped mounds across the landscape18 later between 1000 and 1500 ce the mississippian and oneota cultures built substantial settlements including the fortified village at aztalan in southeast wisconsin19 the oneota may be the ancestors of the modern ioway and hochunk tribes who shared the wisconsin region with the menominee at the time of european contact20 other native american groups living in wisconsin when europeans first settled included the ojibwa sauk fox kickapoo and pottawatomie who migrated to wisconsin from the east between 1500 and 170021 european settlementsedit jean nicolet depicted in a 1910 painting by frank rohrbeck was probably the first european to explore wisconsin the mural is located in the brown county courthouse in green bay the first european to visit what became wisconsin was probably the french explorer jean nicolet he canoed west from georgian bay through the great lakes in 1634 and it is traditionally assumed that he came ashore near green bay at red banks22 pierre radisson and médard des groseilliers visited green bay again in 1654–1666 and chequamegon bay in 1659–1660 where they traded for fur with local native americans23 in 1673 jacques marquette and louis jolliet became the first to record a journey on the foxwisconsin waterway all the way to the mississippi river near prairie du chien24 frenchmen like nicholas perrot continued to ply the fur trade across wisconsin through the 17th and 18th centuries but the french made no permanent settlements in wisconsin before great britain won control of the region following the french and indian war in 1763 even so french traders continued to work in the region after the war and some beginning with charles de langlade in 1764 now settled in wisconsin permanently rather than returning to britishcontrolled canada25 the british gradually took over wisconsin during the french and indian war taking control of green bay in 1761 and gaining control of all of wisconsin in 1763 like the french the british were interested in little but the fur trade one notable event in the fur trading industry in wisconsin occurred in 1791 when two free african americans set up a fur trading post among the menominee at present day marinette the first permanent settlers mostly french canadians some anglonew englanders and a few african american freedmen arrived in wisconsin while it was under british control charles michel de langlade is generally recognized as the first settler establishing a trading post at green bay in 1745 and moving there permanently in 176426 settlement began at prairie du chien around 1781 the french residents at the trading post in what is now green bay referred to the town as la baye however british fur traders referred to it as green bay because the water and the shore assumed green tints in early spring the old french title was gradually dropped and the british name of green bay eventually stuck the region coming under british rule had virtually no adverse effect on the french residents as the british needed the cooperation of the french fur traders and the french fur traders needed the goodwill of the british during the french occupation of the region licenses for fur trading had been issued scarcely and only to select groups of traders whereas the british in an effort to make as much money as possible from the region issued licenses for fur trading freely both to british and french residents the fur trade in what is now wisconsin reached its height under british rule and the first selfsustaining farms in the state were established as well from 1763 to 1780 green bay was a prosperous community which produced its own foodstuff built graceful cottages and held dances and festivities27 us territoryedit wisconsin became a territorial possession of the united states in 1783 after the american revolutionary war however the british remained in control until after the war of 1812 the outcome of which finally established an american presence in the area28 under american control the economy of the territory shifted from fur trading to lead mining the prospect of easy mineral wealth drew immigrants from throughout the us and europe to the lead deposits located at mineral point dodgeville and nearby areas some miners found shelter in the holes they had dug and earned the nickname badgers leading to wisconsins identity as the badger state29 the sudden influx of white miners prompted tension with the local native american population the winnebago war of 1827 and the black hawk war of 1832 culminated in the forced removal of native americans from most parts of the state30 following these conflicts wisconsin territory was created by an act of the united states congress on april 20 1836 by fall of that year the best prairie groves of the counties surrounding what is now milwaukee were occupied by farmers from the new england states31 statehoodedit the erie canal facilitated the travel of both yankee settlers and european immigrants to wisconsin territory yankees from new england and upstate new york seized a dominant position in law and politics enacting policies that marginalized the regions earlier native american and frenchcanadian residents32 yankees also speculated in real estate platted towns such as racine beloit burlington and janesville and established schools civic institutions and congregationalist churches333435 at the same time many germans irish norwegians and other immigrants also settled in towns and farms across the territory establishing catholic and lutheran institutions the growing population allowed wisconsin to gain statehood on may 29 1848 as the 30th

the nations first meeting of the republican party politics in early wisconsin were defined by the greater national debate over slavery a free state from its foundation wisconsin became a center of northern abolitionism the debate became especially intense in 1854 after joshua glover a runaway slave from missouri was captured in racine glover was taken into custody under the federal fugitive slave law but a mob of abolitionists stormed the prison where glover was held and helped him escape to canada in a trial stemming from the incident the wisconsin supreme court ultimately declared the fugitive slave law unconstitutional38 the republican party founded on march 20 1854 by antislavery expansion activists in ripon wisconsin grew to dominate state politics in the aftermath of these events39 during the civil war around 91000 troops from wisconsin fought for the union40 economic progressedit drawing of industrial milwaukee in 1882 wisconsins economy also diversified during the

market and industries like ji case company in racine were founded to build agricultural equipment wisconsin briefly became one of the nations leading producers of wheat during the 1860s41 meanwhile the lumber industry dominated in the heavily forested northern sections of wisconsin and sawmills sprang up in cities like la crosse eau claire and wausau these economic activities had dire environmental consequences by the close of the 19th century intensive agriculture had devastated soil fertility and lumbering had deforested most of the state42 these conditions forced both wheat agriculture and the lumber industry into a precipitous decline the daniel e krause stone barn in chase wisconsin was built in 1903 as dairy farming spread across the state beginning in the 1890s farmers in wisconsin shifted from wheat to dairy production in order to make more sustainable and profitable use of their land many immigrants carried cheesemaking traditions that combined with the states suitable geography and dairy research led by stephen babcock at the university of wisconsin helped the state build a reputation as americas dairyland43 meanwhile conservationists including aldo leopold helped reestablish the states forests during the early 20th century44 paving the way for a more renewable lumber and paper milling industry as well as promoting recreational tourism in the northern woodlands manufacturing also boomed in wisconsin during the early 20th century driven by an immense immigrant workforce arriving from europe industries in cities like milwaukee ranged from

war ii citizens of wisconsin were divided over things such as the creation of the united nations support for the european recovery and the growth of the soviet unions power however when europe divided

communist expansion51 wisconsin took part in several political extremes in the mid to late 20th century ranging from the anticommunist crusades of senator joseph mccarthy in the 1950s to the radical antiwar protests at uwmadison that culminated in the sterling hall bombing in august 1970 the state became a leader in welfare reform under republican governor tommy thompson during the 1990s52 the
