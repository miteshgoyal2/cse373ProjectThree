theorist known for on thermonuclear war herman kahn february 15 1922 – july 7 1983 was a founder of the hudson institute and one of the preeminent futurists of the latter part of the twentieth century he originally came to prominence as a military strategist and systems theorist while employed at the rand corporation he became known for analyzing the likely consequences of nuclear war and recommending ways to improve survivability making him one of three historical inspirations for the title character of stanley kubricks classic black comedy film satire dr strangelove1 his theories

kahn a tailor2 his parents were jewish immigrants from eastern europe he was raised in the bronx then in los angeles following his parents divorce3 raised jewish he later became an atheist4 he attended the university of california los angeles ucla majoring in physics during world war ii he was stationed by the army as a telephone linesman in burma after the war he completed his bs degree at ucla and embarked on a doctorate at caltech he dropped out for financial reasonscitation needed but did receive an msc following a brief stint in real estate he joined the rand corporation via his friend samuel cohen the inventor of the neutron bomb he became involved with the development of the hydrogen bomb commuting to the lawrence livermore laboratory in northern california to work closely with edward teller john von neumann hans bethe and albert wohlstetter cold war theoriesedit kahns major contributions were the several strategies he developed during the cold war to contemplate the unthinkable – namely nuclear warfare – by using applications of game theory kahn is often cited with pierre wack as a father of scenario planning5 during the mid1950s the eisenhower administrations prevailing nuclear strategy had been one of massive retaliation enunciated by secretary of state john foster dulles according to this theory dubbed the new look the soviet army was considerably larger than that of the united states and therefore presented a potential security threat in too many locations for the americans to counter effectively at once consequently the united states had no choice but to proclaim that its response to any soviet aggression anywhere would be a nuclear attack kahn considered this theory untenable because it was crude and potentially destabilizing he argued that newlook theory invited nuclear attack by providing the soviet union with an incentive to precede any conventional localized military action somewhere in the world with a nuclear attack on us bomber bases thereby eliminating the americans nuclear threat immediately and forcing the united states into the land war it sought to avoid in 1960 as cold war tensions were near their peak following the sputnik crisis and amidst talk of a widening missile gap between the united states and the soviet union kahn published on thermonuclear war the title of which clearly alluded to on war the classic 19thcentury treatise by the german military strategist carl von clausewitz kahn rested his theory upon two premises one obvious one highly controversial first nuclear war was obviously feasible since the united states and the soviet union currently had massive nuclear arsenals aimed at each other second like any other war it was winnable kahn argued for deterrence and believed that if the soviet union believed that the united states had a second strike capability then it would offer greater deterrence which he wrote in his paper titled the nature and feasibility of war and deterrence6 whether hundreds of millions died or merely a few major cities were destroyed kahn argued life would go on – as it had for instance after the black death in europe during the 14th century or in japan after the limited nuclear attack in 1945 – contrary to the conventional prevailing doomsday scenarios various outcomes might be far more horrible than anything hitherto witnessed or imagined but some of them nonetheless could be far worse than others no matter how calamitous the devastation kahn argued that the survivors ultimately would not envy the dead and to believe otherwise would mean that deterrence was unnecessary in the first place if americans were unwilling to accept the consequences no matter how horrifying of a nuclear exchange then they certainly had no business proclaiming their willingness to attack without an unfettered unambivalent willingness to push the button the entire array of preparations and military deployments was merely an elaborate bluff the bases of his work were systems theory and game theory as applied to economics and military strategy kahn argued that for deterrence to succeed the soviet union had to be convinced that the united states had secondstrike capability in order to leave the politburo in no doubt that even a perfectly coordinated massive attack would guarantee a measure of retaliation that would leave them devastated as well at the minimum an adequate deterrent for the united states must provide an objective basis for a soviet calculation that would persuade them that no matter how skillful or ingenious they were an attack on the united states would lead to a very high risk if not certainty of largescale destruction to soviet civil society and military forcescitation needed superficially this reasoning resembles the older doctrine of mutual assured destruction mad due to john von neumann although kahn was one of its vocal critics strong conventional forces were also a key element in kahns strategic thinking for he argued that the tension generated by relatively minor flashpoints worldwide could be dissipated without resort to the nuclear option the unthinkableedit due to his willingness to articulate the most brutal possibilities kahn came to be disliked by some although he was known as amiable in private especially around childrencitation needed unlike most strategists he was entirely willing to posit the form a postnuclear world might assume fallout for example would simply be another one of lifes many unpleasantnesses and inconveniences while the muchballyhooed rise in birth defects would not doom mankind to extinction because a majority of survivors would remain unaffected by them contaminated food could be designated for consumption by the elderly who would presumably die before the delayed onset of cancers caused by radioactivity a degree of even modest preparation – namely the fallout shelters evacuation scenarios and civil defense drills now seen as emblematic of the cold war – would give the population both the incentive and the encouragement to rebuild he even recommended the government offer homeowners insurance against nuclearbomb damage kahn felt that having a strong civildefense program in place would serve as an additional deterrent because it would hamper the other sides potential to inflict destruction and thus lessen the attraction of the nuclear option a willingness to tolerate such possibilities kahn argued might be worth sparing europe the massive nuclear exchange more likely to occur under the premad doctrine a number of pacifists including aj muste and bertrand russell admired and praised kahns work because they felt it presented a strong case for full disarmament by suggesting that nuclear war was all but unavoidable others criticized kahn vehemently claiming that his postulating the notion of a winnable nuclear war made such a war – whether judged subsequently as won lost or neither – more likely hudson institute and vietnam waredit in 1961 kahn max singer and oscar ruebhausen founded the hudson institute7 a policy research organization initially located in crotononhudson new york where kahn was living at the time luminaries such as sociologist daniel bell political philosopher raymond aron and novelist ralph ellison author of the 1952 classic invisible man were recruited stung by the vociferousness of his critics kahn somewhat softened his tone and responded to their points in thinking about the unthinkable 1962 and on escalation 1965 between 1966 and 1968 during the peak of the vietnam war kahn served as a consultant to the department of defense and opposed the growing pressure to negotiate directly with north vietnam arguing that the only military solution was sharp escalation failing that he said the us government needed an exit strategy he claimed credit for introducing the term vietnamizationcitation needed kahn and the hudson institute advised against starting a counterinsurgency war in vietnam but once it had begun they gave advice on how to wage it in an interviewcitation needed he said that he and the institute preferred not to give advice to for example the secretary of defense because disagreement at such a high level might be regarded as treason whereas disagreement with say the deputy undersecretary was regarded as no more than technical as regards a plan british advisers with experience from the commonwealths successful counterinsurgency war in malaya were consulted kahn and the institute however judged that a crucial difference between the vietnemese and malayan situations was the british rural constabulary in malaya an institute study of the major counterinsurgency wars in recent history found a 100 correlation between successful wars and effective police forcescitation needed kahn said the purpose of an army is to protect your police force we had an army in vietnam without a purposecitation needed the year 2000edit in 1967 herman kahn and anthony j wiener published the year 2000 a framework for speculation on the next thirtythree years which included contributions from staff members of the hudson institute and an introduction by daniel bell table xviii in the document8 contains a list called one hundred technical innovations very likely in the last third of the twentieth century the first ten predictions were multiple applications of lasers extreme highstrength structural materials new or improved superperformance fabrics new or improved materials for equipment and appliances new airborne vehicles groundeffect vehicles giant or supersonic jets vtol stol extensive commercial applications of shapedcharge explosives more reliable and longerrange weather forecasting extensive andor intensive expansion of tropical agriculture and forestry new sources of power for fixed installations new sources of power for ground transportation later yearsedit with the easing of nuclear tensions during the détente years of the 1970s kahn continued his work on futurism and speculations about the potential for armageddoncitation needed he and the hudson institute sought to refute popular essays such as paul ehrlichs the population bomb 1968 garrett hardins similarly reasoned the tragedy of the commons also 1968 and the club of romes limits to growth 1972 in kahns view capitalism and technology held nearly boundless potential for progress while the colonization of space lay in the near not the distant future9 kahns 1976 book the next 200 years written with william brown and leon martel presented an optimistic scenario of economic conditions in the year 2176 he also wrote a number of books extrapolating the future of the american japanese and australian economies and several works on systems theory including the wellreceived 1956 monograph techniques of system analysis10 during the mid1970s when south koreas gdp per capita was one of the lowest in the world kahn predicted that the country would become one of the top 10 most powerful countries in the world by the year 200011 in his last year 1983 kahn wrote approvingly of ronald reagans political agenda in the coming boom economic political and social and bluntly derided jonathan schells claims about the longterm effects of nuclear war on july 7 that year he died of a stroke aged 6112 cultural influenceedit along with john von neumann edward teller and wernher von braun kahn was reportedly an inspiration for the character dr strangelove in the eponymous film by stanley kubrick released in 19641 it was also said that kubrick immersed himself in kahns book on thermonuclear war13 in the film dr strangelove refers to a report on the doomsday machine by the bland corporation kahn met kubrickcitation needed and gave him the idea for the doomsday machine a device which would immediately cause the destruction of the entire planet in the event of a nuclear attack both the name and the concept of the weapon are drawn from the text of on thermonuclear war14 louis menand observes in kahn’s book the doomsday machine is an example of the sort of deterrent that appeals to the military mind but that is dangerously destabilizing since nations are not suicidal its only use is to threaten14 walter matthaus maverick character professor groeteschele in the film failsafe also released in 1964 is also based on kahncitation needed in this film the us president tries to prevent a nuclear holocaust when a mechanical malfunction sends nuclear weapons toward moscow in the politics of ecstasy15 timothy leary suggests that kahn had taken lsd
