the cheshire plain to the south the pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation the local authority is manchester city council the recorded history of manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the roman fort of mamucium or mancunium which was established in about ad 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers medlock and irwell it was historically a part of lancashire although areas of cheshire south of the river mersey were incorporated in the 20th century8 throughout the middle ages manchester remained a manorial township but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century manchesters unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the industrial revolution9 and resulted in it becoming the worlds first industrialised city10 manchester achieved city status in 1853 the manchester ship canal opened in 1894 creating the port of manchester and linking the city to the sea 36 miles 58 km to the west its fortunes declined after the second world war owing to deindustrialisation but the ira bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration11 in 2014 the globalization and world cities research network ranked manchester as a beta world city the highestranked british city apart from london12 manchester is the

citizens are still referred to as mancunians mæŋkˈjuːnɪənz these are generally thought to represent a latinisation of an original brittonic name either from mamm breast in reference to a breastlike hill or from mamma mother in reference to a local river goddess both meanings are preserved in insular celtic languages such as mam meaning breast in irish and mother in welsh14 the suffix chester is a survival of old english ceaster fort fortified town15 historyedit main article history of manchester see also timeline of manchester history early historyedit main article mamucium the brigantes were the major celtic tribe in what is now known as northern england they had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which manchester cathedral now stands opposite the banks of the river irwell16 their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now salford and stretford following the roman conquest of britain in the 1st century general agricola ordered the construction of a fort named mamucium in the year 79 to ensure that roman interests in deva victrix chester and eboracum york were protected from the brigantes16 central manchester has been permanently settled since this time17 a stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the roman fort is visible in castlefield the roman habitation of manchester probably ended around the 3rd century its civilian settlement appears to have been abandoned by the mid3rd century although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th century18 after the roman withdrawal and saxon conquest the focus of settlement shifted to the confluence of the irwell and irk sometime before the arrival of the normans after 106619 much of the wider area was laid waste in the subsequent harrying of the north2021 a map of manchester c 1650 thomas de la warre lord of the manor founded and constructed a collegiate church for the parish in 1421 the church is now manchester cathedral the domestic premises of the college house chethams school of music and chethams library1922 the library which opened in 1653 and is still open to the public today is the oldest free public reference library in the united kingdom23 manchester is mentioned as having a market in 128224 around the 14th century manchester received an influx of flemish weavers sometimes credited as the foundation of the regions textile industry25 manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of woollens and linen and by about 1540 had expanded to become in john lelands words the fairest best builded quickest and most populous town of all lancashire19 the cathedral and chethams buildings are the only significant survivors of lelands manchester20 a map of manchester and salford from 1801 during the english civil war manchester strongly favoured the parliamentary interest although not longlasting cromwell granted it the right to elect its own mp charles worsley who sat for the city for only a year was later appointed major general for lancashire cheshire and staffordshire during the rule of the major generals he was a diligent puritan turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of christmas he died in 165626 significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600 firstly in linencotton fustians but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance19 the irwell and mersey were made navigable by 1736 opening a route from manchester to the sea docks on the mersey the bridgewater canal britains first wholly artificial waterway was opened in 1761 bringing coal from mines at worsley to central manchester the canal was extended to the mersey at runcorn by 1776 the combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton1922 manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns19 a commodities exchange opened in 172920 and numerous large warehouses aided commerce in 1780 richard arkwright began construction of manchesters first cotton mill2022 in the early 1800s john dalton formulated his atomic theory in manchester cotton mills in ancoats about 1820 industrial revolutionedit manchesters history is concerned with textile manufacture during the industrial revolution the great majority of cotton spinning took place in the towns of south lancashire and north cheshire and manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing27 and later the worlds largest marketplace for cotton goods1928 manchester was dubbed cottonopolis and warehouse city during the victorian era27 in australia new zealand and south africa the term manchester is still used for household linen sheets pillow cases towels etc29 the industrial revolution brought about huge change in manchester and was key to the increase in manchesters population manchester began expanding at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the city for work from scotland wales ireland and other areas of england as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by the industrial revolution303132 it developed a wide range of industries so that by 1835 manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world28 engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade but diversified into general manufacture similarly the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes but expanded into other areas commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance view from kersal moor towards manchester by thomas pether circa 1820 then still a rural landscape manchester from kersal moor by william wyld in 1857 a view now dominated by chimney stacks as a consequence of the industrial revolution trade and feeding the growing population required a large transport and distribution infrastructure the canal system was extended and manchester became one end of the worlds first intercity passenger railway—the liverpool and manchester railway competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down19 in 1878 the gpo the forerunner of british telecom provided its first telephones to a firm in manchester33 the manchester ship canal was built between 1888 and 1894 in some sections by canalisation of the rivers irwell and mersey running 36 miles 58 km34 from salford to eastham locks on the tidal mersey this enabled oceangoing ships to sail right into the port of manchester on the canals banks just outside the borough the worlds first industrial estate was created at trafford park19 large quantities of machinery including cotton processing plant were exported around the world a centre of capitalism manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots as well as calls for greater political recognition by the citys working and nontitled classes one such gathering ended with the peterloo massacre of 16 august 1819 the economic school of manchester capitalism developed there and manchester was the centre of the anticorn law league from 1838 onward the peterloo massacre of 1819 resulted in 15 deaths and several hundred injured manchester has a notable place in the history of marxism and leftwing politics being the subject of friedrich engels work the condition of the working class in england in 1844 engels spent much of his life in and around manchester35 and when karl marx visited manchester they met at chethams library the economics books marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library as can the window seat where marx and engels would meet23 the first trades union congress was held in manchester at the mechanics institute david street from 2 to 6 june 1868 manchester was an important cradle of the labour party and the suffragette movement36 at that time it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes new ways of thinking the manchester school promoting free trade and laissezfaire new classes or groups in society new religious sects and new forms of labour organisation it attracted educated visitors from all parts of britain and europe a saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today what manchester does today the rest of the world does tomorrow37 manchesters golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century many of the great public buildings including manchester town hall date from then the citys cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture which included the hallé orchestra in 1889 when county councils were created in england the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy an oil painting of oxford road manchester in 1910 by valette although the industrial revolution brought wealth to the city it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population historian simon schama noted that manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes a new kind of city in the world the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke an american visitor taken to manchesters blackspots saw wretched defrauded oppressed crushed human nature lying and bleeding fragments38 the number of cotton mills in manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 185327 thereafter the number began to decline and manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by bolton in the 1850s and oldham in the 1860s27 however this period of decline coincided with the rise of the city as the financial centre of the region27 manchester continued to process cotton and in 1913 65 of the worlds cotton was processed in the area19 the first world war interrupted access to the export markets cotton processing in other parts of the world increased often on machines produced in manchester manchester suffered greatly from the great depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries including textile manufacture manchester blitzedit like most of the uk the manchester area was mobilised extensively during the second world war for example casting and machining expertise at beyer peacock and companys locomotive works in gorton was switched to bomb making dunlops rubber works in chorltononmedlock made barrage balloons and just outside the city in trafford park engineers metropolitanvickers made avro manchester and avro lancaster bombers and ford built the rollsroyce merlin engines to power them manchester was thus the target of bombing by the luftwaffe and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against nonmilitary targets the biggest took place during the christmas blitz on the nights of 2223 and 24 december 1940 when an estimated 474 tonnes 467 long tons of high explosives plus over 37000 incendiary bombs were dropped a large part of the historic city centre was destroyed including 165 warehouses 200 business premises and 150 offices 376 were killed and 30000 houses were damaged39 manchester cathedral was among the buildings seriously damaged its restoration took 20 years40 postsecond world waredit cotton processing and trading continued to fall in peacetime and the exchange closed in 196819 by 1963 the port of manchester was the uks third largest41 and employed over 3000 men but the canal was unable to handle the increasingly large container ships traffic declined and the port closed in 198242 heavy industry suffered a downturn from the 1960s and was greatly reduced under the economic policies followed by margaret thatchers government after 1979 manchester lost 150000 jobs in manufacturing between 1961 and 198319 corporation street after the manchester bombing on 15 june 1996 there were no fatalities but it was one of the most expensive manmade disasters43 a large rebuilding project of manchester ensued regeneration began in the late 1980s with initiatives such as the metrolink the bridgewater concert hall the manchester arena and in salford the rebranding of the port as salford quays two bids to host the olympic games were part of a process to raise the international profile of the city44 oxford road one of the main thoroughfares into manchester city centre manchester has a history of attacks attributed to irish republicans including the manchester martyrs of 1867 arson in 1920 a series of explosions in 1939 and two bombs in 1992 on saturday 15 june 1996 the provisional irish republican army ira carried out the 1996 manchester bombing the detonation of a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre the largest to be detonated on british soil the bomb injured over 200 people heavily damaged nearby buildings and broke windows 1⁄2 mile 800 m away the cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at £50 million but this was quickly revised upwards45 the final insurance payout was over £400 million many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade46 since 2000edit spurred by the investment after the 1996 bomb and aided by the xvii commonwealth games manchesters city centre has undergone extensive regeneration44 new and renovated complexes such as the printworks and the corn exchange have become popular shopping eating and entertainment destinations the

manchester was granted a charter by thomas grelley in 1301 but lost its borough status in a court case of 1359 until the 19th century local government was largely in the hands of manorial courts the last of which was dissolved in 184659 from a very early time the township of manchester lay within the historic or ceremonial county boundaries of lancashire59 pevsner wrote that neighbouring stretford and salford are not administratively one with manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of england25 a stroke of a norman barons pen is said to have divorced manchester and salford though it was not salford that became separated from manchester it was manchester with its humbler line of lords that was separated from salford60 it was this separation that resulted in salford becoming the judicial seat of salfordshire which included the ancient parish of manchester manchester later formed its own poor law union using the name manchester59 in 1792 commissioners—usually known as police commissioners—were established for the social improvement of manchester manchester regained its borough status in 1838 and comprised the townships of beswick cheetham hill chorlton
